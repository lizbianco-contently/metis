GARY L. HOLLINGSWORTH\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, let me begin by saying it is a source of \ngreat pride and pleasure to Dot Helms and me that Dr. Gary L. \nHollingsworth has accepted the Senate's invitation to serve as guest \nchaplain today.\n  His eloquent prayer was typical of his great ministry--sincere, \nimpressive, and deeply reverent.\n  The Nation very much needs to be remembered every day in the prayers \nof all of us, and we Senators need the prayerful support of all \nAmericans that we will faithfully uphold the moral and spiritual \nprinciples set forth by our Founding Fathers.\n  Dr. Hollingsworth is pastor of First Baptist Church, Alexandria, \nwhich since its organization in 1803 has served the spiritual needs of \ncountless citizens of the Nation's Capital and surrounding area. It is \none of the truly historic churches of the area; its congregation \nnumbers 2,850 members. The First Baptist annual budget has grown to $2 \nmillion. In addition to the spiritual needs of its congregation, First \nBaptist, Alexandria, serves many other local, national, and \ninternational ministries--for example in the Dominican Republic, \nTanzania, Ukraine, and others.\n  Now, first a word about Dr. Hollingsworth: He and Gwen Beaman were \nmarried a few days before Christmas in 1978. They have two fine sons, \nJonathan Andrew and Ryan Thomas.\n  Gary's friends are excited about his being a part of the U.S. Senate \ntoday--but I suspect his wonderful parents, L.T. and Magoline \nHollingsworth, are excited most of all. A number of staff members and \nmembers of First Baptist, Alexandria, are here today and of course the \nSenate welcomes all of them as well.\n  For the remainder of today's Senate session, Dr. Hollingsworth will \nhave the privilege of the Senate floor. He can come and go--meaning \nthat he can meet the Senators, talk with them and maybe counsel some \nwho need it most.\n  Thank you, Chaplain Hollingsworth, from the U.S. Senate, for this \nday, for being here today. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/26/senate-section/article/S10665-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10665-S10680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA SELF-DEFENSE ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, is there a unanimous consent stipulating \nwhat shall happen now? I assume the pending business is still the \nBosnia resolution, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 21) to terminate the United States arms embargo \n     applicable to the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Dole amendment No. 1801, in the nature of a substitute.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I inquire of the Chair if the first speaker \non this has been identified in the unanimous consent?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The first speaker was to be the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, Senator Dodd.\n  Mr. HELMS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S10666]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the fact that more than 3 years after the \noutbreak of hostilities in the Balkans we are debating the same issues \nthat we did not resolve 3 years ago is surely proof of the failure of \nWestern leaders to craft an effective policy against the expansionist \nbrutality and ethnic cleansing that is going on in Bosnia, and it is \nsurely proof it is a false hope to believe that aggression which is \nignored will somehow stop on its own without the use of collective \nforce.\n  There is no use in blaming NATO or blaming the United Nations. We \nhave to blame the leading nations of NATO and the United Nations. \nLeading nations means the United States, the French, the British, and \nour other allies that have the responsibility to lead but that have \ncollectively failed.\n  We have heard a lot about the failure of the United Nations and the \nfailure of NATO, and, yes, there is plenty of failure there. But NATO \nand the United Nations are made up of countries, and those entities \nfollow the decisions and the will of their members. So when the United \nNations fails, it is because we or the British or the French or the \nRussians or other members of the Security Council and the General \nAssembly that make up the United Nations and will not allow it to do \nsomething have decided on that course of action.\n  The same thing is true with NATO. NATO has failed because we and the \nBritish and the French and the other members of NATO will not agree on \na course of action in the Balkans. We have failed. Collectively we have \nfailed.\n  There is no easy answer in Bosnia, but I am convinced that the least \nbad answer is to allow Bosnians to defend themselves. I have been \nconvinced of that for a long time and nothing has changed my view. \nQuite the opposite. I am more convinced than ever that since we and \nWestern Europe are not willing--no one is willing--to send in ground \nforces to defend the Bosnian Government and its people against \naggression. The least we should do is allow them the right that every \nother government in the world has, and that is the right of self-\ndefense. No other state recognized by the United Nations is being \nprevented from exercising this inherent right.\n  If lifting the embargo results in the United Nations leaving and if \nit results in the suspension of humanitarian relief, then at least the \nBosnians will have been able to exercise their right to die fighting \ninstead of having their hands tied by this embargo while they are being \nslaughtered.\n  I find it morally repugnant that we, the nations of the world, are \ndenying Bosnia that right while being unwilling collectively to come to \nthe defense of Bosnia. And it is particularly repugnant in light of the \nethnic cleansing, the rape, the forced marches which the State \nDepartment has acknowledged are being carried out primarily by the \nBosnian Serbs.\n  The United Nations estimates that the Bosnian Serbs have expelled, \nkilled, or imprisoned over 90 percent of the 1,700,000 non-Serbs who \nbefore the war lived throughout the territory now held by the Bosnian \nSerbs. Now, it is not just in the name of decency that we must allow \nthe Bosnians the right to fight back. In the hope of stopping Serb \naggression before it spreads more widely, or before it involves \nneighboring countries and ultimately us in a wider, deeper conflict we \nmust also allow the Bosnians the right to fight back.\n  At this point allowing the Bosnians to fight back seems to me to be \nthe best hope of eventually stopping Serb expansionist drives. So it is \nnot just that it is morally repugnant not to allow the Bosnians to \ndefend themselves. As a practical matter I do not see any other way of \nstopping Serb expansionism unless someone tries physically to stop it. \nWho is going to try to stop it? Who is there fighting the Serbs in \ntheir expansionist goals? And they have them. Their goals for a greater \nSerbia which can spread into the Balkans and spread into Europe can \nonce again be the source of a wider war which then drags in America as \nwe have been dragged in twice in this century. So no one believes that \nallowing the Bosnians to defend themselves is going to Americanize the \nwar more than doing nothing. Doing nothing will also result someday in \nAmerica being dragged into a wider conflict. The only way to prevent a \nwider conflict is to allow someone who wants to fight against Serb \nexpansionism to fight. That is what the Bosnians not only are willing \nto do, but they are pleading with us that they be allowed to do.\n  Bosnia has been littered by broken promises. None of us can be \nsanguine about the new threats of airstrikes that were made in the last \nfew days. We look at the fine print of the London agreement and we see \nthat us and our allies, NATO, and U.N. officials are still arguing \nabout the dual-key approach, about who has the right to call in \nairstrikes and who has the right to veto them, and about whether or not \nthe threats apply to Gorazde or whether or not they apply to all safe \nareas. We read in the morning newspaper that ``U.N. officials are now \ngiven the right to veto airstrikes by NATO.'' We were told last weekend \nno, they were not. NATO and the United Nations are again in disarray \nwithin a few days after presumably there had been an agreement. And if \nthere is any principle involved in the London conference, in the London \nagreement, it was that a credible threat of airstrikes against \nstrategic Serb targets in Bosnia would have at least a reasonable \nprospect of stopping an attack on Gorazde.\n  Now, that is what the Secretary of Defense told us yesterday. That at \nleast a credible threat would have the possible effect of deterring an \nattack on Gorazde. It is not guaranteed that threat of an airstrike \neven if it is addressed at targets in Bosnia held by the Serbs outside \nof the immediate area, that a threat, a credible threat of a strong air \nattack would deter the attack, but at least there was that possibility. \nThat is what is at the heart of the London declaration. Though then the \nquestion comes, if it is possible that the threat of a credible \nairstrike would stop an attack on Gorazde, why would not that same \nthreat stop the attack on Sarajevo? Why do we not apply the Gorazde \nrules to Sarajevo? What London did was give a green light for an attack \non Sarajevo because what it said was the threat of a credible air \nattack is limited to Gorazde. And when I asked the Secretary of Defense \nand Secretary of State yesterday, why do we not apply that same threat \nto stop this ongoing assault and siege of the capital of a nation that \nbelongs to the United Nations, I was told we hope that same decision \nwill be made relative to Sarajevo in the next few days.\n  Well, I hope it will be too. But I am not going to hold my breath. \nAnd I cannot honestly tell the people of Bosnia who have suffered for \nyears that somehow or other these kinds of faltering steps, threat \ntoday, watered down tomorrow, threat today, not carried out tomorrow--\nthat this can in any way protect them. There is only one thing that \nwill protect the Bosnian people from the Bosnian Serb expansion, and \nthat is if they are allowed to defend themselves. It has been proven \nyear after year that this is their only defense. There is no other. \nNow, we are told that this would be a bad precedent, withdrawing from \nthe U.N. resolution. But this would not be the first U.N. resolution \nwhich has been ignored in Bosnia and ignored by us. The U.N. Security \nCouncil passed a resolution last September which was an effort to \npunish the Serbs for rejecting the contact group's peace plan. Now, \nthat resolution, just last September, declared that all states should \n``desist from any political talks with the leadership of the Bosnian \nSerb party as long as that party has not accepted the proposed \nsettlement in full.''\n  The U.N. resolution says, all states should ``desist from any \npolitical talks with the leadership of the Bosnian Serb party as long \nas that party has not accepted the proposed settlement in full.'' \nWithin 4 months we violated that resolution unilaterally. There was no \nchange in that resolution. We and other European officials went to Pale \nfor political talks with the leadership of the Bosnian Serb party. U.S. \nSpecial Envoy Charles Thomas went there despite the fact that the \npreconditions which had been set for that direct dialog had not been \nmet. Now, that was a blatant disregard, unilaterally for an important \nU.N. resolution. Of course, \n\n[[Page S10667]]\nthat one was dealing with the Serbs. So I guess that one is overlooked. \nThat does not count. It was a resolution very specifically regulating \ndiplomatic and political and military matters. And we ignored it, \nunilaterally we ignored it. The U.S. Ambassador at that time, Victor \nJackovich, objected to the visit and was recalled to Washington as a \nresult of his statement of objection.\n  This genocide in Bosnia has taken on Orwellian aspects. UNPROFOR is \nno longer a protection force. Safe havens are neither safe nor are they \nhavens. The contact group of nations is not making any significant \ncontact with the warring parties on a peace agreement. And peacekeepers \nare now hostages and human shields.\n  Whatever else, whatever else, the United States and our allies have \nnot mustered the will to defend Bosnia. And we cannot in conscience \nboth enforce an embargo and tell the Bosnians that we are not going to \ndefend you and we are not going to let you defend yourselves. We cannot \nin good conscience say both things at the same time. We are not going \nto defend you and we are not going to let you defend yourselves. It is \none or the other. Morally it is one or the other, and also it is one or \nthe other for very practical reasons. That is, unless there is a \ncounterweight to Serb expansionism in Bosnia, it will continue. Next it \nwill be Kosovo. Next it will be Croatia. Next other countries will \nbecome involved in stopping that expansion.\n  Next, other countries will respond to the first countries getting \ninvolved. Next, a Balkan war spreads to Europe.\n  There is no easy answer in Bosnia, and anyone who thinks that there \nis a cure is making a terrible mistake.\n  Allowing the Bosnians to defend themselves has risks. The status quo \nhas risks. And in judging which are the greater risks, nobody can be \nsure that their judgment is right. But year after year, I have felt \nthat with all of the clash of pros and cons, there is one nugget of \ntruth, and that is the right of self-defense, of that I am sure.\n  I am sure that the U.N. Charter, an international law, permits every \nnation the right of self-defense. I am sure that this country has stood \nfor that for as long as we have been in existence. We have stopped \nstanding for that in Bosnia.\n  Later on today, the Senate will reassert that fundamental belief that \nevery nation has a right of self-defense, and if there is anyplace \nwhere that right is appropriate, it is in a place that has been the \nvictim of a genocide.\n  I never thought we would hear the words ``ethnic cleansing'' again in \nthis century. We not only heard them, we have watched them. We have \nwatched ethnic cleansing operate. We saw a picture in the paper of \nSerbian troops separating men from women and children. The men going \nthat way, probably to slaughter; the women and children going this way, \nprobably to rape or to other horrors. That picture reminded me of \nanother picture that took place in a concentration camp about 50 years \nago, where Gestapo agents, at the doors of the camp, separated \nfamilies, some to their death, a few to survive.\n  It is time to let the Bosnians defend themselves. It has been long \noverdue and the Senate today is going to make a statement, which I hope \nis a powerful statement that is, if we cannot stop genocide, and if we \nare unwilling to stop it, we certainly must let the victims of the \ngenocide try to protect themselves from that horror.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I rise today in support of the \nresolution that is before the Senate, the resolution sponsored by \nSenator Dole, Senator Lieberman, and many others. I compliment them for \nthis resolution. I also compliment many of my colleagues who spoke so \neloquently on this issue yesterday.\n  I was one that wanted to speak. I noticed the Presiding Officer made \nan excellent speech last night. Several other of my colleagues, Senator \nMcCain and others, spoke eloquently on the need for this resolution. I \ncompliment them for it.\n  Madam President, my involvement in the former Yugoslavia probably \nstarted with a trip that I made with Senator Dole to Yugoslavia in the \nsummer of 1990. I learned a lot about the former Yugoslavia and some of \nthe Republics at that time. I must say my eyes were opened. I was \nshocked by some of the things I had seen, by some of the \ndiscrimination, and I will say hatred, by some of the leaders in \nSerbia, particularly Mr. Milosevic.\n  I remember Senator Dole and others on the trip, we wanted to go into \nKosovo. Mr. Milosevic did not want us to go. I remember there were so-\ncalled elections in Serbia about that time. He stole the elections. But \nhe did not want us to go into Kosovo because of all the problems. We \nwanted to go into Kosovo because we heard of human rights violations. \nThey did not want us to find out about it.\n  The people of Kosovo wanted us to go, and we initially went. We went \nbecause of the leadership of Senator Dole. Even the State Department \nsaid they did not know about this, but Senator Dole said no, we are \ngoing to go, and we went after hours of haggling negotiations. We \neventually went.\n  We saw thousands of people--Albanians. Kosovo is about 85 percent \nAlbanian. They were really oppressed. They had been denied jobs. Their \nnewspapers had been shut down. They were denied access to radios. They \nwere expelled from hospitals, from universities, and other \ninstitutions.\n  Frankly, the leaders in Serbia--and I hope you will note I am talking \nabout the leaders, because not all Serbs are bad. Certainly, in my \nopinion, they have some very bad leadership. They distorted the whole \nthrust of our intentions. Our intentions were to listen to the people, \nand they tried to deny us that access.\n  We did listen to many of the people in Kosovo on both sides of the \nissue. We saw mass demonstrations, thousands of people. In many cases, \nthe police tried to deny them access to us.\n  I will not forget that trip. I will not forget the leadership that \nSenator Dole had in trying to make sure that we were able to see the \npeople in Kosovo, and also I will not forget the way that Mr. Milosevic \nhad distorted our trip, distorted the press afterward, and how he had \nsuppressed some of the people in Kosovo.\n  It reminds me of the same trip where we were also in other countries, \nsome of the Eastern European countries that were now experiencing \ndemocracy, and how excited they were; and then, to see this happening \nin the former Yugoslavia, and how sad that was.\n  Now we see some results later. I might mention as a result of that, \nwe passed an amendment. I will mention that amendment. In the fall of \n1990, that was opposed by the Bush administration, but the result of it \nwas if we are going to give economic assistance to the republics in the \nformer Yugoslavia, they must be showing some respect for human rights \nand democracy. Serbia did not qualify. Other Republics did qualify.\n  We had a heated debate on that. We had a conference on that one issue \nthat lasted for hours. We passed that amendment--so-called Nickles-Dole \namendment. It was one of the first legislative items we had dealing \nwith the former Yugoslavia that said we want to support the forces that \nare trying to get human rights, freedom, and democracy. Again, I say, \nthis is back in the fall of 1990, so this is not a new issue.\n  Mr. President, in thinking back a little more, and more recently, I \nremember an issue we had in the summer of 1993, where this Senator and \nothers raised the prospect that we felt like this administration was \ntrying to delegate too much authority to the United Nations. We had a \nvote on this floor. Actually, we had an amendment, and fought it for 2 \ndays on the floor, saying we did not think U.S. military combatants \nshould be placed under U.N. control.\n  We eventually lost that amendment. I think we made a point. Our point \nwas that this administration was very intent on delegating U.S. \nmilitary authority under the auspices of the United Nations. We stated \nthen, 2 years ago, that would not work. I think the events in Bosnia, \nthe events in the former Yugoslavia, have proven that to be the case. \nThey have not worked. \n\n[[Page S10668]]\n\n  The United Nations is not a military machine. It may be a diplomatic \neffort, but their efforts on the military front will certainly fail. \nThey have failed.\n  We are witnessing a real tragedy, a real tragedy, and a lack of \nleadership from the United Nations, a lack of leadership from the \nUnited States. A lot of mistakes have been made. We continue to see \nwar-torn Bosnia suffer as a result.\n  Mr. President, myself and others have met with the Prime Minister of \nBosnia, and he said, ``Let us defend ourselves. Lift the arms embargo. \nThe arms embargo that was placed in 1991 was placed on the entire \nYugoslavia. There is not a Yugoslavia today.'' The arms embargo was not \nplaced on the State of Bosnia.\n  Maybe we made a mistake in recognizing the State of Bosnia. But we \nhave done that. That may have been a mistake. But Bosnia is an \nindependent nation. They have a right to defend themselves.\n  Under the auspice of the United Nations, we said, well, we will have \na resolution, we will designate safe areas. Those safe areas are not \nsafe. The Senator from Texas pointed out last night, they are not safe.\n  It is a real tragedy, a human rights tragedy, when we see today \ngenocide taking place, when we see people either being slaughtered, \nraped, or separated from their families with men on one side, women on \nanother, and there are other people transported out--ethnic cleansing, \nhappening today, in 1995, in the so-called safe areas, where we have a \nU.N. resolution saying this will be a safe area, and it is not safe.\n  Certainly, we should accede to the request of the people of Bosnia \nwho say, ``At least let us protect ourselves.'' We should give them \nthat opportunity. They have requested that opportunity. Some people say \nif we do that, think of the consequences. I think that is important. We \nshould think of the consequences. What will happen? Who is in the best \nsituation to make those determinations? I say the people of Bosnia.\n  The people of Bosnia are saying they are going to ask the U.N. so-\ncalled peacekeeping troops to leave. If they wish to do so, let us let \nthem do so. If they want to have the ability to be able to protect \nthemselves, certainly we should allow them to do that. Senator McCain \nsaid on the floor last night that there are worse things than dying. \nCertainly if a family is being separated from their loved ones, they \nought to at least have the opportunity to be able to fight for their \nfamilies. We are not giving them that. We have given them a false \numbrella called the U.N. safekeeping area, safe haven, and they have \nnot proven to be safe. Surely we owe it to those individuals to allow \nthem to be able to protect themselves. We have not done that under this \nadministration.\n  As a candidate, President Clinton said he wanted to lift the embargo. \nThey have made a couple of failed attempts. To me, again, that shows \nreal lack of leadership. They made an attempt through the United \nNations early in 1993 to have a multilateral lifting of the embargo. \nBut it was not successful.\n  What happened between this and the previous administration when we \nhad a world crisis in the Persian Gulf with the Bush administration? \nThey were able to pass U.N. resolutions and enforce those U.N. \nresolutions. They had teeth. They had respect, and we were successful \nin getting our allies in the United Nations--and some people who you \nwould not consider our allies in the United Nations--to support those \nresolutions to expel Saddam Hussein and the Iraqis from Kuwait. We \nbuilt up a worldwide effort and community to oppose his aggression, to \nfinance the opposition to that aggression and militarily put the forces \ntogether to repel that aggression. We passed U.N. resolutions, and we \nenforced those resolutions.\n  This administration 2 years later is not able to convince our allies \nto lift the embargo and, instead, is leading us down a road to surely \nsignificant U.S. military involvement, which I know has not been stated \nas the intention of this administration. Now they say, ``Well, if we \nlift the embargo, the U.N. troops are going to leave, and surely then \nit would be Americanization of the war.'' Why? Because this \nadministration said we will supply 25,000 troops to get the U.N. troops \nout. So now we have U.S. ground troop involvement in Bosnia. Where did \nthey come up with the 25,000 troops?\n  Madam President, 2 years ago when we had this debate on the floor and \nI was arguing against delegating U.S. authority to the United Nations, \nI was quoting administration sources that said they wanted to commit \n25,000 troops to an international peacekeeping force in the former \nYugoslavia. I argued against that. Yet, that is what this \nadministration is trying to do. They said, ``Well, we have already made \na commitment.'' Even when they made that public announcement of, ``Yes, \nwe will put U.S. forces in for the withdrawal,'' a few weeks ago for \nthe relocation of U.N. peacekeeping forces, where did that come from? \nThey said, ``Well, we were continuing with the commitment of the Bush \nadministration.'' That is not the case. That is not factual. The Bush \nadministration never committed putting United States ground forces into \nthe former Yugoslavia for any reason, not relocation of troops, not the \nextrication of the U.N. troops, not for any reason. They did say, \n``Yes, we might have some air support'' for protection, or cover, or \nfor whatever reason, but they did not say we would be putting in ground \ntroops.\n  The Prime Minister of Bosnia has said, ``Why do you need 25,000 \ntroops?'' Almost all of the U.N. troops are on the Bosnian Government's \nland, Moslem controlled, not Serb controlled area. I think they said 30 \nor 60 U.N. troops might be under the control of the Serbs. Why do we \nneed 25,000 troops to get them out?\n  So I want to make it perfectly clear, I support the resolution \nlifting the arms embargo. I do not support the 25,000 troops that \nPresident Clinton made without consulting with Congress, certainly in \ncontradiction to the previous administration's commitment in \nYugoslavia. I do not think you need 25,000 troops to get U.N. troops \nout. Those are troops. They can get out. They have the capability of \ngetting out. Why make this kind of unilateral commitment, ``Well, if \nthey are going to get out, we have to make a commitment to help them \nget out?'' The Bosnian Government said they are going to ask them to \nleave; they have not been a help; they have not been a positive factor \nconcerning this.\n  I will read a couple of quotes by the Bosnian Foreign Minister:\n\n       I emphasize once again that we are not asking for foreign \n     troops to come to Bosnia. I emphasize once again that we are \n     only prepared to count on ourselves and no one else.\n\n  This is July 17 of this year.\n  He also said, and I quote this.\n\n       * * * it's my assessment that you don't really need these \n     NATO troops and certainly not these U.S. troops. The reason \n     is that when these plans were drawn up, they were drawn up \n     under worst case scenarios--number one, assuming a large \n     number of U.N. and Serb controlled territory, and number two, \n     assuming that Bosnian civilians would, somehow, prevent the \n     U.N. troops from leaving.\n       Well, on the first point, there are almost no U.N. troops \n     left on Serb-controlled territory. They have all withdrawn to \n     government-controlled territory; effectively, now, it is \n     government troops that are protecting them, and we are ready \n     to let them leave. As for Bosnian civilians preventing the \n     U.N. from leaving, they've seen what the U.N. has done for \n     them in Srebrenica, what it's doing for them in Zepa, what it \n     needs to do for them in Gorazde, and, frankly, what it needs \n     to do for them in Sarajevo. It's not a heck of a lot. I think \n     most of the Bosnian civilians--I think all, frankly--would be \n     glad to see the U.N. forces leave.\n\n  That was made July 18, 1995.\n  So basically the Bosnian Foreign Minister has said they are going to \nbe asking the U.N. forces to leave. They have not helped. The safe \nareas have not. They are not safe. We have seen what happened in \nSrebrenica and Zepa. They are afraid of what is going to happen in \nSarajevo. They are asking. And we have a letter on our desk that said:\n\n       Please. I am writing to you today to once again appeal to \n     the American people and the government to lift the illegal \n     and the immoral arms embargo on our people.\n       Today's vote is a vote for human life. It is a vote for \n     right against wrong. It is not about politics. It is about \n     doing the right thing.\n\n  He basically says, ``Let us defend ourselves.'' So why have a \ncommitment of 25,000 troops? He said, ``We are going to let the troops \nout.'' The troops can get out. Do we have to get their equipment out? \nWe are going to risk 25,000 troops to get out U.N. equipment? I do not \nthink that equipment is worth it. \n\n[[Page S10669]]\n\n  What happens when some forces happen to shoot down U.S. transport \nhelicopters or destroy military equipment or personnel get locked in, \nor if they capture more pilots and they hold those captive and hostage? \nWhat are we going to do then? We are probably going to send in more \ntroops to make sure we get them out.\n  In other words, the Bosnian people are not asking for United States \nforces. They are not asking that we send troops. Let us not do it. I \nthink it would be a mistake. I think the administration made a mistake \nwhen they unilaterally said, oh, yes, we will commit 25,000 U.S. forces \nfor the extrication of the U.N. forces. I think that is a mistake. And \nso I am going to be very clear that while I support the lifting of the \narms embargo, I do not support U.S. ground forces to pull out the U.N. \nforces that were probably there by mistake in the first place.\n  Madam President, let us allow the Bosnians to defend themselves. Let \nus lift this embargo. This embargo was placed on the entire country of \nYugoslavia, not on the nation of Bosnia. Bosnia has been recognized by \nthe United Nations. It has been recognized by the United States. Maybe \nthat was a mistake. But that was in 1991. Surely, they have a right to \ndefend themselves as a sovereign country.\n  Madam President, further vacillations from this administration, which \nsaid in the past they are in favor of lifting the embargo but has been \nso ineffective in getting other countries to join us, is very \nregrettable. We need strong leadership in the United States, and we \nhave not seen it. So it is with some regret I say that we are really \nrefuting the President's policy, but it needs to be refuted.\n  I think we have serious mistakes that have been made in the former \nYugoslavia, and as a result you see a real decline of United States \nleadership, United States prestige, United States influence, not only \nin Europe but I am afraid throughout the world. As to our ability in \nthe United Nations, think of where we were under both the Reagan and \nBush administrations when we had a great deal of influence in the \nUnited Nations where we were the leaders, where we were the leader, and \nnow to see we do not have the capability to convince the allies to lift \nthe embargo I think shows a real impotence by the United States, a real \nloss of prestige and influence on our allies. I regret that. I do not \nwant that to happen. I do not care who is President.\n  This is a serious vote, one of the more serious votes we will have \nhad in this body, and it is one that I do not relish--having \ncongressional dictation of foreign policy. Many times that can be a \nmistake. But, Madam President, this administration's foreign policy has \nbeen a disaster. It has been a real disaster for the people of Bosnia. \nWe need to change course. I think lifting the arms embargo is the first \nstep.\n  And again, I wish to congratulate Senator Dole and Senator Lieberman \nand others who have had the persistence to bring this forward, \nparticularly Senator Dole, because, as I mentioned earlier in my \ncomments, I went to the former Yugoslavia with him and I saw his \npersistence in trying to stand up for what he felt was right in helping \nthe people who are really oppressed--at the time the people in Kosovo. \nI compliment him for that tenacity. And looking back, since we have \nbeen involved in amendments in the Chamber since 1990, this is not just \nabout Presidential politics, as some people have alluded. This is much \nmore important than that.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank the Chair.\n  Let me say at the outset that this is a most difficult issue. I have \nheard my colleagues over the last number of days talking about the \nBosnian situation express I think during the remarks a degree of \nanguish. It is a policy that began to evolve prior to the arrival of \nthis administration, with serious and difficult questions under the \nadministration of President Bush, and this administration has obviously \nwrestled with them as well. I think in fact that my colleagues by and \nlarge during the expression of their remarks have also expressed a \nrecognizable degree of uncertainty over which is the best course of \naction to follow.\n  And so with that in mind, let me begin by saying the obvious to all \nof us. Under our Constitution, the Senate plays a unique and important \nrole in the conduct of foreign policy. In exercising our \nresponsibilities, we bear an individual and collective obligation--to \ndo that which is in the best interests of our country. We are Senators \nof the United States and no other nation. This is our most important \npriority.\n  That is not to say there may be other considerations, but they must \nalways be secondary, always secondary, Madam President, to the \ninterests of our country, the United States.\n  It is not uncommon obviously for Members of this body to arrive at \nentirely different conclusions regarding what those best interests may \nbe. That is obviously the case with the conflict in Bosnia.\n  I respect deeply my colleagues who have concluded that the United \nNations should leave Bosnia and the arms embargo be lifted, thus giving \nthe beleaguered people of Bosnia the chance to defend themselves. I \nhave nothing but the highest respect for them and the conclusions that \nthey have drawn.\n  If, however, the only consideration were whether the victims, the \nBosnian Moslems, should be able to fight back, then I believe the \nconclusion we would reach would be a simple one.\n  Unfortunately, the implications of removing U.N. forces and lifting \nthe embargo could, could produce, Madam President, profound effects on \nthe United States, on NATO, our most important strategic alliance, on \nother significant allies, on the nations and peoples neighboring \nBosnia, and on the innocent people of Bosnia themselves, who have \nalready suffered so much.\n  Just as the original decision, no matter how lamentable in hindsight, \nto impose the embargo and introduce U.N. forces triggered certain \nevents, the tragic results of which we are witnessing today, so, too, \ncould the decision to lift and leave create unwelcome results tomorrow. \nNo matter how much we may wish to undo the mistakes of the past 3 \nyears, let us not compound those mistakes by plunging into greater ones \ntoday.\n  The stakes, Madam President, are far too high and, in my view, the \nprice far too dear. The obvious guilt that some people feel over the \nbloodstained land of Bosnia should not be equated with, in my view, the \nparalysis that afflicted Western leaders in the 1930's. Remember, six \ndecades ago the world literally sat idly and watched the cruel advance \nof fascism. Whatever else may have been done wrong in Bosnia, we have \nnot been mere observers to Serbian genocide.\n  Significant military, diplomatic, and political efforts have been \ntried to end the horror of Bosnia. It is totally wrong and profoundly \ndangerous, in my view, to our future interests to imply that Western \nleaders have once again been mere spectators to naked aggression.\n  It is a legitimate criticism, however, to suggest that more thought, \nfar more thought should have been given to those earlier decisions and \nthe likely Serbian reaction to them. But our failure to have been \nthoughtful once on Bosnia, in my view, is no justification for making \nthe same mistakes again.\n  As we vie with one another to find new and more dramatic language to \nexpress our moral outrage over Serbian aggression, we have not even \nbegun to exhaust our vocabulary. In my view, the worst is yet to come. \nFor all that will be left in the pitiful land called Bosnia are two \nhighly armed forces, locked in a death struggle with no regard for \nanyone who happens to be in their way, including, I fear, their own \npeople.\n  I know my colleagues are impatient over this issue. It has gone on \nfar too long. I know that my colleagues are horrified over the \nsickening atrocities. I know, Madam President, my colleagues are \nfrustrated with the pathetic failure of the status quo policy. And I \nknow my colleagues want to move on to other issues that we must try to \nresolve. My concern, Madam President, is that we are about to act out \nof passion at what we are witnessing in Bosnia, rather than acting \nafter \n\n[[Page S10670]]\ncareful analysis of what may be the unintended results of our \nlegislative action.\n  Madam President, I pose the following six questions for my colleagues \nto consider before casting their vote on this vitally important \nresolution.\n  First, are we prepared to commit 20,000 to 25,000 United States \nground forces to the Bosnian battlefield with the full knowledge, the \nfull knowledge, that there are those who will seek to involve us in \ntheir cause?\n  Second, are we prepared to witness the collapse of multilateral \nembargoes we have engineered against Iraq, Libya, and Iran, not to \nmention the added difficulty we will have in leading and fashioning \nsuch future efforts?\n  Third, are we prepared to accept a deep and lasting fissure in the \nmost vital and strategic alliance our Nation has anywhere in the world \nat the very hour, at the very hour that alliance faces uncertainty from \nRussia and the New Independent States which are staggering under the \ncrippling economic, political, social, and military burdens?\n  Fourth, are we prepared to accept the likely broad-based political \nhostility from the people of our two oldest and most dependable allies \nin the world?\n  Fifth, do we accept the clear responsibility of our country if the \nlift-and-leave proposals in this resolution occur and the cancerous \nconflict of Bosnia spreads to the other Balkan States?\n  Sixth, and lastly, Madam President, what are we prepared to propose \nif the war in Bosnia escalates and today's mind-wrenching scenes are \npaled by comparison as thousands more innocent Bosnians are raped, \nmurdered, cleansed, and left destitute?\n  Madam President, I do not argue that any or all of these questions \ncan be answered with certainty if this resolution is adopted, but nor, \nMadam President, can those who propose this resolution argue that these \nresults will never occur. The issue then must be which course poses the \ngreater risk when the possible results are weighed against each other. \nThe answer, I believe, is clear.\n  Gnashing our teeth over the current mess in Bosnia does not justify \nplacing other vital interests of our country at risk not to mention the \nrisk to the very people that this resolution seeks to deliver from \nharm's way.\n  Having concluded that this resolution should be rejected, Madam \nPresident, let me quickly add that I do not believe a continuation of \nthe status quo is any more acceptable for many of the same reasons. The \nU.N. forces must be permitted in my view to fight back and fight back \naggressively on the ground in the face of Serbian offensives. The role \nof these forces as nothing more than armed crossing guards is \nuntenable. These troops are some of the best trained troops in the \nworld. These troops have been trained to do one thing, Madam President. \nWe ought to allow them to do it, that is, fight.\n  NATO's airstrikes are also critical in my view. Alone they will not \ncomplete the job, but in conjunction with an aggressive effort on the \nground these targeted airstrikes on essential military targets could, I \nthink, be decisive.\n  Madam President, President George Bush, to his everlasting credit, \nshowed the world how future conflicts of this kind should be addressed; \nnamely, by building international alliances and cooperation, no easy \ntask indeed. President George Bush demonstrated in my view how \neffective the civilized world can be in handling these international \nthugs and simultaneously protecting our own vital interests.\n  This is not to say, Madam President, that every situation that \nthreatens U.S. interests must only be addressed through international \nmeasures. That would be foolish. But where international burden sharing \ncan be achieved, it should be sought.\n  What a great tragedy it would be if in the very first real test of \nthe Bush doctrine it was the United States led by President Bush's own \nparty that walked away and left our allies on their own. Can, Madam \nPresident, the United States, the only superpower on Earth, accept the \nburden and mantle of leadership the world anticipates from us? The \nanswer to that question does not reside alone on 1600 Pennsylvania \nAvenue. Madam President, it resides in this Chamber on this day. It \nresides with each and every one of us who bear the obligation bestowed \nby our Constitution and constituents as U.S. Senators. That obligation, \nMr. President, sometimes means casting a vote that is politically \ndifficult but necessary to protect U.S. national interests. This is \nclearly in my view one of those moments. And I urge the rejection of \nthe proposal.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator, Mr. President, remain for just a brief \nquestion or two?\n  Mr. DODD. Certainly.\n  Mr. WARNER. I listened very carefully to your rendition of the six \nquestions. I am prepared to work on that. But I listened as you said \nthem, and I think I got your words accurately with reference to the \nNATO forces. ``They should fight back. They are the finest troops in \nthe world.''\n  I agree that they are the finest troops in the world. But, Mr. \nPresident, roughly speaking there are only 10,000 of the rapid reaction \nforce that have been brought in. They are the ones and the first ones \nthat have been equipped to engage in defensive operations and offense \nif the Senator's recommendation were to be adopted.\n  But my first question to you, there are roughly 10,000 French, \nBritish, and Dutch. My understanding is but a fourth or a third of \nthose are actually in the region at this time. That is a relatively \nsmall force. Some have moved into the Sarajevo area. The Senator \nsuggests that suddenly this force can wheel into action and adequately \ndeter the overwhelming forces of the Bosnian Serbs. I find that \nunrealistic.\n  Mr. DODD. Well, I presume that is a question.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. I will try and respond. Let me say I have great respect for \nmy colleague from Virginia's knowledge in matters affecting NATO and \nmilitary affairs.\n  I really point out, as I said, I think the status quo is unacceptable \nand that in my view a better alternative would be to give these forces \nwho are well-trained, some of the best trained in the world, the \nopportunity to respond.\n  Last evening our colleague from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey, spoke with \neloquence, I believe, in describing a series of events where NATO \nforces, officers, with far fewer numbers than their Serbian aggressors \nhandled the situations militarily in several instances that have not \nbeen widely reported but should be known by people because the \nassumption I think that is developing is that these soldiers that are \nthere are cowards unwilling to fight. In fact when they have been \nplaced in those situations, they have done a remarkably fine job.\n  Now whether or not the balance in the equation of forces is such that \nthese troops could presently handle the extensive aggression by the \nSerbians is a legitimate question. But I think it begs the issue of \nwhether or not it makes more sense to try and free up that force and \nlet them do the job. I happen to believe, having read the U.N. \nresolutions, that there is enough flexibility in that language that \nthese forces could be far more aggressive without going back to the \nSecurity Council and seeking broader authority for them to act. So if \nthe issue is merely getting more troops in to do the job, then it seems \nto me that would be a better course of action to follow, I say to my \ncolleague, than the issue of leaving to the Bosnians the unilateral \ndecision to ask these troops to leave, lifting that embargo on weapons, \nunder the assumption that during that period of time that there will \nnot be even a broader, wider spread of aggression than we are presently \nseeing today.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my distinguished colleague from \nConnecticut refers to the U.N. resolutions which he, who is indeed a \nvery experienced and knowledgeable Member of the Senate as it relates \nto the United Nations and other matters, the Senator thinks they lend \nthemselves to interpretation.\n  Mr. President, I say why were not they written clearly in the first \ninstance? That is one of the major problems we have here is the lack of \nclarity, the lack of understanding of who has the authority to use \nforce.\n  The headlines in today's paper start out with: ``NATO Gives U.N. \nOfficials Veto on Airstrikes in Bosnia.'' \n\n[[Page S10671]]\n\n  Is that the type of chain of command that the Senator from \nConnecticut is suggesting can resolve this conflict?\n  Mr. DODD. My colleague from Virginia, Mr. President, will have no \nargument with this Senator over whether or not there have been serious \nblunders made over the last few years. I do not think necessarily we \nadvance our cause by engaging in the kind of 20/20 hindsight with which \nno one is going to argue.\n  I quickly state, and my colleague from Connecticut is here, who is \none of the principal authors of this resolution, had this body and \nothers followed the advice of my colleague from Connecticut several \nyears ago, I suspect we would not be here today engaged in this debate. \nI am not debating that point at all.\n  The points I tried to raise and, again, I believe probably a few \nother Members appreciate and understand the one particular point I \ntried to raise, and that is NATO. I do not think there has been another \nMember of this body over the past quarter of a century who has stood \nmore often and fought harder to maintain the vital concern of that \nalliance.\n  My fear is, and it is shared, that we may do damage to that alliance \nat the moment when it is critically important we do everything possible \nto shore up that alliance. I cannot say with certainty that will \nhappen. I do not buy the rhetoric in every case of those who suggest \nthis is an absolute certainty.\n  But when I balance and weigh the risks between jeopardizing that \nrelationship and the situation as it presently exists, I come down on \nthe side of caution rather than running the risk of looking back and \nregretting deeply, in the legitimate call of doing something different \nthan we are doing, placing in harm's way that most strategic alliance.\n  That is not the only reason I argue, but it seems to me we have to be \ncareful, no matter how disappointed and how angry and how legitimately \nupset people are over what we are watching night after night, day after \nday with the human tragedy unfolding in Bosnia.\n  As tragic as all of that is, my deep concern is that in our resolve \nto answer those mistakes, we will make additional ones, in fact, fall \nprey to the same thing that occurred several years ago when we should \nhave thought--I think my colleague from Connecticut yesterday in an \neloquent set of remarks pointed out the people are well intentioned. I \ndo not think he was arguing they were motivated by malevolence, but \nhonestly thought, I guess, if you impose an embargo on the Bosnian \nMoslems, somehow that was going to bring the Bosnian Serbs to the \nnegotiating table.\n  I do not think anybody had a corrupt intent with that in particular, \nexcept maybe the Serbians themselves, but it did not work. We did not \nthink it through carefully.\n  Now the situation is different than at that particular moment. There \nis a lot more involved in the decisions we make than just the decision \nto go in or not. That is why I express that concern.\n  I will be honest with my two colleagues, this is really the first \ntime I have spoken on this issue, because as I said to my colleague, \nthis has been gnawing at me over what steps to take. I envy those who \nmonths ago, except those who have worked for years on this, came to a \nsnappy conclusion on this. I think most of my constituents are deeply \nconcerned and confused as to what is the best course to follow.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let me speak for myself. I have not come \nto a quick, snappy decision. For 2 years plus I opposed the \ndistinguished majority leader and my good friend from Connecticut \nsteadfastly and have taken many of the positions that the senior \nSenator from Connecticut has taken.\n  Mr. DODD. No, I respect that.\n  Mr. WARNER. But I have changed my view because I think we can no \nlonger, as a body, as the U.S. Senate, sit by idly. We have to take the \ninitiative. The drafters of the resolution which is presently before us \nhave radically changed from their earlier positions to where now they \nrecognize there are a certain set of triggering mechanisms that should \nbring about the action sought; namely, the very basic right of people \nto defend themselves with such arms as they may require.\n  Here are today's dispatches:\n\n       Thousands of terrified Bosnian refugees poured out of the \n     captured enclave of Zepa today.\n\n  A safe haven which we basically demilitarized, took away the arms, \nthinking that for some reason, the Bosnian Serbs would honor the U.N. \ndeclaration that this was a safe haven. These people relied--relied, \nMr. President--on what had been represented to them by the United \nNations.\n  Despite the efforts to try to get clarity of chain of command and \ncontrol, here is today's New York Times, if I may just read a \nparagraph:\n\n       Four days after the United States, Britain, and France \n     threatened the Bosnian Serbs with the heaviest airstrikes yet \n     if they attacked the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, NATO \n     officials said early this morning that they had agreed that \n     no large-scale bombing could start unless United Nations \n     civilian officials gave the go-ahead.\n\n  Clearly, again, the dual key. We just continue to go along \nindecisively as a partner to this decisionmaking between the United \nNations and NATO. It is time, Mr. President, it is time some body \npolitic in this world stood up and said, ``This is the course of action \nwe can take,'' and that option is now before the U.S. Senate this very \nmorning. In a matter of 3 hours, we will cast a vote which I hope will \nbe heard around the world as this is the policy that should be followed \nhenceforth. I commend the distinguished majority leader and the junior \nSenator from Connecticut for taking this action.\n  Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague, the senior \nSenator. We have worked together. We have traveled together on many \nissues relating to foreign affairs. While I regret he cannot at this \npoint in time join, I hope that in the future there will be other \nopportunities when we can work together once again. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to make a comment in regard to \nthe story in the New York Times today referred to by my friend from \nVirginia, and to talk more broadly for a moment about some of the \nunderstandable and very sincere statements that my senior colleague \nfrom Connecticut made about the impact of our actions today on our NATO \nallies.\n  We have been in a historic alliance with the French and British, one \nof the great alliances of history, which successfully thwarted the \nadvance of Soviet troops into Europe and beyond, and the cold war.\n  Part of what is being played out here--and I do not use that verb \nlightly--in the former Yugoslavia is the extent to which this great \nalliance, NATO, remains viable, the extent to which we have common \ninterests or acknowledge that we have common interests, both in \nprotecting stability in Europe and in having NATO be a force for \nstability in the world, which we continue to need.\n  Mr. President, the last two American administrations, the Bush \nadministration, Republican, and the Clinton administration, Democratic, \nhave either agreed with or gone along with our allies in Europe, \nparticularly the British and the French, in their vision of what was \nhappening in Yugoslavia and what they ought to do and ought not to do \nto try to stop it.\n  From the beginning, there has been a group of us in Congress on a \nbipartisan basis that has disagreed with the position of the \nadministrations, the Bush and Clinton administrations, and our allies \nparticularly in Britain and France. As I have said before, this is a \nDemocratic administration, obviously, but Senator Dole stood with me, \nand I with him and with many others of both parties during the Bush \nadministration in criticizing that administration for standing by and \nletting this arms embargo continue to be imposed, particularly in \nresponse to the appeals of our allies of Britain and France.\n  President Clinton ran for office, as we have said, critical of the \nBush administration for its weakness in Bosnia, urging the policy of \nlifting the arms embargo and then striking from the air. He came into \noffice with that policy. A lot of Members had a high sense of hope. But \nas this debate has gone on, people say if you vote for this Dole-\nLieberman proposal there will be more bloodshed, the war will be \nAmericanized. \n\n[[Page S10672]]\n\n  We have rebutted that and we will again. Do we not have a \nresponsibility to listen to the people whose blood has been shed? What \ngives us the sense of presumptuousness, of moral paternalism, to say to \nthese people who have lost 200,000 lives, that we are worried that what \nwe are about to do, which they want us to do, give them the weapons to \ndefend themselves, will shed more of their blood?\n  That is preposterous. It is outrageous. Think how we would feel if we \nwere on the other side of this tragedy, attacked, having lost a \nsubstantial percentage of our population, watching our families \nseparated, men in this direction, women in that direction, women raped, \nmen slaughtered, refugees all around, torn from our homes because of \nour religion.\n  How would we feel in trying to fight back against these tanks and \nheavy artillery, with light weapons on our side, if the world not only \nstood by and watched this slaughter occurring, but it continued to \nimpose an embargo that meant we could not make it a fair fight, that we \ncould not stand up and fight for our families.\n  Mr. President, these excuses that have been given are really, to me, \nunacceptable. The Americanization of the war--we have responded to that \nas we have gone along, too; but what remains is the fact that as we \nlook at this history, we continue to impose this illegal arms embargo.\n  Let me go back to the NATO allies. The allies talked Secretary \nChristopher out of the lift-and-strike position. The allies had a few \nmonths before, earlier in 1992, as a result of the first understanding \nof the atrocities being committed in Europe, the ITN British television \ncrews going into the concentration camps--I cannot call them anything \nelse. They called them ``detention camps'' at that time--emaciated \nbodies of men, clearly starving.\n  Yesterday, the International Tribunal in the Hague, authorized by the \nUnited Nations, indicted the President of the Bosnian Serbs, Mr. \nKaradzic and his chief of staff, General Mladic. Among the elements of \nthe indictment is the operation of these detention camps and \nslaughtering of people.\n  Europeans at that point, very much on their own, felt pressure from \nworld opinion. We, too, instead of responding with the basic and \nfundamental policy that at long last--this is 1992--give these victims, \nthe Bosnians, the weapons with which to fight back. We did not do that. \nWe maintained the embargo. And instead of using NATO air power to \npunish the Serbs for their aggression and genocide, what did we do? We \nsent in--we, at the urging of the Western European allies--sent in the \nUnited Nations on a peacekeeping mission where there was no peace, \nmisusing the brave soldiers--British, French, Dutch, Bangladeshi, \nJordanian, a whole host of countries that are there, Malaysian--sending \nthem into combat without adequate weapons themselves, making a mistake \nfor which we will pay for a long time, bringing the United Nations down \nbecause of the outrageous mission. That was the decision that was \nsupported and led by our allies in Europe.\n  Allies are just like members of the same family--you have \ndisagreements. It is a test of the strength of the family and a test of \nthe strength of this alliance as to whether we can transcend the \ndisagreement and go on and be allies.\n  Understand how this happened--the British and French led the drive to \nsend in the United Nations to assert their own ability to deal with \nthis problem in Europe. It was dealt with in a way that was ambivalent.\n  ``If the sound of the trumpet be uncertain, who will follow into \nbattle?'' Remember the words of the Scripture. The sound of that \ntrumpet was extremely uncertain. No one followed in the battle except \nthe Serbs who saw the weakness and continued the aggression.\n  The policy has continued. The strength of rejection of the policy has \ngrown on a bipartisan basis here in Congress. That is what, I think, \nwill be expressed later today.\n  Now the latest excuse for not acting--at every step we were told, \nSenator Dole and I, ``Do not lift the arms embargo, they will seize \nhostages, U.N. personnel.'' The embargo has not been lifted, and \nhostages were seized. ``Do not lift the embargo, they will attack the \nsafe havens.'' We did not lift the embargo, they attacked the safe \nhavens. The latest excuse is the London communique, an agreement, an \nexpression of strength by the NATO allies to use the might of NATO air \npower, a warning to the Serbs: Attack Gorazde and you will pay the \nprice. As I have said here before in the last 3 or 4 days, a threat, \nnot a policy to end the war, and a limited threat at that. Only going \nto one of the four so-called safe areas is sending a clear signal to \nthe Serbs that the other three are open season. In fact, in the last 3 \nor 4 days, that is exactly what they have done, attacked Sarajevo, \nTuzla, and particularly, Bihac. OK, a limited threat, but at least a \nthreat with regard to Gorazde.\n  At least the assertion coming out of the meetings that the dual-key \napproach was over, that we no longer had to go to the United Nations, \nthat NATO had finally taken control, and this great alliance was \nworking, together, to stop aggression, instability in Europe, and \ngenocide, once again, in this century, against a people, because of \ntheir religion.\n  What do we find? Today is Wednesday, 5 days later. Exactly what my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Warner from Virginia, has said. \nApparently, it was not as strong a message from London. Apparently, the \ndual-key approach, where soldiers on the ground have to go to the U.N. \npoliticians to get approval, and over and over, they have gone and been \nrefused the right to strike back at those who are shooting at them.\n  I will read from the article in today's New York Times written from \nBrussels by Craig Whitney.\n\n       Far from doing away with the cumbersome ``dual-key'' \n     arrangement that the United States says has hampered NATO's \n     ability to protect United Nations peacekeepers on the ground, \n     the NATO allies in effect have sided with the United Nations \n     Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has been saying \n     nobody could take his key away from him.\n       The allies agreed to make what one NATO official called a \n     ``strong recommendation'' to Mr. Boutros-Ghali to leave it to \n     his military field commanders on the ground in Gorazde and \n     elsewhere to decide when the time had come to start bombing \n     the Serbs if they attacked.\n\n  Imagine this. We have gotten ourselves in a position where the \nstrongest military alliance in the world today must make a plea to the \nSecretary General of the United Nations to allow this strong alliance \nto strike back at countries, at soldiers, that are not only attacking \ncivilians in safe areas, but are attacking NATO soldiers.\n  Continuing:\n\n       But since Mr. Boutros-Ghali has been extremely cautious \n     about approving airstrikes in the past, what was meant to \n     sound like a roar in London 4 days ago appeared likely to \n     have been throttled down to something more like a growl by \n     the time NATO ambassadors finished grappling with it in the \n     small hours of Wednesday morning.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator will look at that article, there is the \nparagraph that deserves to be noted. It says as follows:\n\n       The main pressure to preserve a decision-making role for \n     Mr. Boutros-Ghali came from Britain and France. With nearly \n     15,000 soldiers on the ground in Bosnia who could suffer the \n     consequences if bombing and Serb reactions to it spiral out \n     of control, the countries pressed, in effect, for a series of \n     political firewalls against precipitate American action from \n     the air.\n\n  Then the next paragraph.\n\n       In particular, French officials deny [I repeat deny] that \n     they ever agreed last Friday in London to launch \n     automatically what the American Secretary of Defense William \n     Perry called a ``disproportionate response'' to an attack on \n     Gorazde.\n\n  The U.S. Senate was highly influenced by the comments of the \nSecretary of Defense. I think he is a very fine and able individual. I \ndo not know what the background is to this. He, along with the \nSecretary of State, were present yesterday in the Halls of the Senate. \nI met with both briefly.\n  But I find it very disconcerting when our allies undercut what \nSecretary Perry thought was a decision reached last week, and he \npersonally was present at that time.\n  So I think that again we come back to who is going to make a decision \nin this frightful situation? I say the responsibility comes now to this \nbody politic as the sole one in the world \n\n[[Page S10673]]\nwilling to step up at this time and speak decisively on this critical \nissue.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia is absolutely \nright. Yesterday, I was in a meeting with the Democratic Senators which \nSecretary Perry and Secretary Christopher addressed. I have the highest \nregard for both of them.\n  It is clear to me--I know they are acting with the best of intentions \nand sincerity here--that the policy they took and fought so hard for \nlast week in London, and it appeared that they thought was adopted, was \nclearly not what the British and the French are willing to accept. The \nparagraph that the Senator from Virginia read is exactly where I was \ngoing, which is to say that our allies, presumably having accepted a \npolicy in London on Friday, then at the NATO Ministers' meeting in \nBrussels yesterday have undercut it and set up Mr. Boutros-Ghali as \ntheir instrument to frustrate that.\n  I must say that I do not understand it because they do have troops on \nthe ground. They are the ones who are most vulnerable if the NATO \nallies are not able to strike back against Serbian aggression. When \nwill they understand that the Serbs will take the--who is smiling, who \nis laughing most at this story from Brussels? The Serbs are. The \nsignals are clear. ``Do what you want with the three of the four \nremaining areas, `safe areas,' incredulously titled today. And as for \nGorazde, don't worry too much about attacking that either eventually \nbecause the West does not have its act together.'' That was just a \ntoothless tiger roaring, or growling, as the article in the Times today \nsaid, from London.\n  I want to make two points about this. The first is to my colleagues \nwho are going to vote in a few hours, and it is an important vote. \nPlease read this article. Then I simply do not know how any colleague \nin good conscience could say that the policy emanating from the London \ncommunique is a reason not to vote to lift the arms embargo. This sense \nthat somehow the calvary was coming and, therefore, the victims do not \nneed to defend themselves is not so. It is simply not so. That is not a \nreason to sustain this illegal, immoral arms embargo.\n  The second point is, and let us acknowledge it, that we continue to \nhave a fundamental difference of opinion--that is, the bipartisan \nmajority here in the Senate, bipartisan majority in the other body--\nwith our allies in Britain and France. Let us acknowledge it. We \nacknowledge it.\n  I do not understand how our Western European allies, having gone \nthrough two world wars in Europe this century because aggression was \nnot stopped early, can stand by and not see that they have an interest \nin stopping aggression here before it goes on to Kosovo, and then to \nMacedonia, which will bring in Greece and Turkey, Bulgaria, Albania, \nand in the worst of all circumstances will create truly another tragic \nwider war in the Balkans. But they have apparently not reached that \nconclusion.\n  Let us acknowledge here what we are saying. We disagree with our \nallies. Let us acknowledge also that that disagreement puts in doubt, \nsadly unsettlingly, the viability of this great alliance.\n  I think we have to figure out a way to disagree within the family and \nstill remain strong. We have to figure out a way. Looking back in \nhindsight I wish that both the Bush and Clinton administrations had \nfigured out a way to lead our NATO allies to a stronger policy, the \npolicy of lifting the embargo and striking from the air. I truly \nbelieve that if we had implemented that policy in 1992, the war would \nbe over today. A settlement would have been reached because the Serbs \nfinally would have been given a reason to stop their aggression.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, could the Senator forbear for a moment?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. We have but a few moments left.\n  The Senator from Connecticut raised a very clear point. In today's \nNew York Times--and I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord certain backup documents to this important colloquy.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n U.S. Department of State--Press Briefing by Secretary of State Warren \nChristopher, Secretary of Defense William Perry, Chairman, Joint Chiefs \n            of Staff, Gen. John Shalikashvili, July 21, 1995\n\n       Secretary Christopher. Good evening. On behalf of the \n     entire United States delegation, I want to thank Prime \n     Minister Major for convening today's conference and Foreign \n     Secretary Rifkind for his very skillful chairmanship.\n       None of us is under any illusion about today's meeting. By \n     now we're all too aware that no conference, including this \n     one, can end the war and suffering in the former Yugoslavia. \n     What a conference of this kind can do is to focus our minds \n     on how we can best contribute to alleviating suffering and \n     achieving a negotiated settlement. This conference has served \n     as a decision-forcing event. As I told my colleagues today, \n     the entire world is watching us, waiting to see if the West \n     will answer the Bosnian Serbs' outrageous aggression.\n       We face a very simple and stark choice: either the \n     international community rapidly takes firm steps to fulfill \n     its mission in Bosnia or its mission will collapse. Today we \n     have agreed on several actions which, if vigorously \n     implemented, offer a real opportunity to reassert the \n     international community's role in Bosnia.\n       Let me stress the obvious: to have any chance of success \n     the decisions made today must be translated, translated \n     quickly into reality on the ground. President Clinton and the \n     United States are determined to do so. The international \n     community and the people of Bosnia simply cannot afford any \n     more empty threats. Let me briefly review what the United \n     States believes to be the central elements of today's \n     agreement.\n       First, the unanimous reaffirmation that UNPROFOR will \n     remain in Bosnia. In order to do so, its ability to fulfill \n     its mandate will be strengthened. We are all painfully aware \n     of UNPROFOR's shortcomings. Nevertheless, we agree that \n     UNPROFOR's collapse in the face of Bosnian Serb aggression \n     can only lead to far greater humanitarian tragedy and \n     strategic danger in the Balkans.\n       Second, and of most immediate concern. Gorazde will be \n     defended. Bosnian Serb leaders are now on notice that an \n     attack against Gorazde will be met by substantial and \n     decisive air power. Secretary Perry and General Shalikashvili \n     can speak more fully on the military aspects of the plan, but \n     let me make just a couple of points. Any air campaign in \n     Gorazde will include significant attacks on significant \n     targets. There'll be no more pin-prick strikes. Moreover, \n     existing command and control arrangements for use of NATO air \n     power will be significantly adjusted to ensure that \n     responsiveness and unity, our purposes, are achieved. The new \n     system is a much improved system.\n       Third, we will take steps to stabilize the situation in \n     Sarajevo. Its people must be fed. French and British troops \n     from the Rapid Reaction Force will take action to open and \n     secure humanitarian access routes. At the same time, we \n     agreed more broadly on the need to fullfill the United \n     Nations other mandates, including that in the other safe \n     areas. In this regard we are especially concerned about the \n     escalating Bosnian Serb attacks in Bihac.\n       Fourth, we're agreed on the need to support on-going \n     efforts to address Bosnia's deep humanitarian needs, which \n     have certainly been exacerbated by the fighting in Srebrenica \n     and Zepa. We intend and we are urging others to increase our \n     contribution, especially in advance of the coming winter.\n       Fifth, we reaffirmed our belief that the conflict in \n     Yugoslavia can only be resolved by a political settlement. \n     Today we received an update from the European Union's \n     representative Carl Bildt and we underscored our support for \n     this work. Tonight the Contract Group ministers will be \n     meeting with Mr. Bildt to review his political efforts. At \n     the same time, during the conference, I made clear our belief \n     that so long as the Bosnian Serb aggression continues, any \n     political process is doomed to failure. Our first step must \n     be to take action that can return an element of stability on \n     the ground. At that point we agreed that a country wide \n     ceasefire should be declared which can be used as a basis for \n     a resumption of the negotiations.\n       Finally, today's participants are fully aware of the risks \n     that will accompany any effort to implement UNPROFOR's \n     mission more vigorously. The Bosnian Serbs have taken \n     hostages before and they may do so again. As part of today's \n     plan, we are urging the United Nations to take steps \n     immediately to minimize the exposure of its personnel. At\n      the same time, we're determined that the taking of hostages \n     will no longer be allowed to prevent the implementation of \n     our policies. We are also resolved to hold the Bosnian \n     Serb leaders fully responsible for the safety and \n     personnel of any UN personnel that they have detained.\n       Let me say again that President Clinton is committed to \n     working with our partners, all of them--especially France and \n     Britain--to see that the decisions we take today are \n     translated into reality. We do not seek to make the \n     international community a participant in the war in Bosnia, \n     but we're determined to make another, perhaps final effort to \n     fulfill the world's responsibilities in Bosnia. Today's \n     meeting was a necessary first step toward that goal. Now we \n     must act. Thank you.\n       I believe that Secretary Perry and General Shalikashvili \n     will not have opening remarks, \n\n[[Page S10674]]\n     but I'm sure you'll have some questions for them as well as for me.\n       Question. Secretary, could you clear up a couple of things? \n     We had been told earlier by our Defense officials that this \n     ultimatum would apply to an attack on Sarajevo as well. And \n     according to Secretary Ritkind, that is not the case. It \n     would only apply, according to the Chairman's statements, to \n     an attack on Gorazde. So could you clear that up, and also \n     could you clarify French claims that there is a commitment of \n     American helicopter lift to bring in troops to Gorazde?\n       Secretary Christopher. With respect to the first question, \n     the conference today focused on Gorazde because that seemed \n     to be the area of greatest immediate threat. Having attacked \n     and apparently overcome both the enclaves in Srebrenica and \n     Zepa, the next one evidently on the target list is Gorazde. \n     So we focused our primary concern on that, but at the same \n     time we were concerned about all the safe areas. Now with \n     respect to Sarajevo, the focus there was on the use of Rapid \n     Reaction Force to ensure that there will be opportunities for \n     humanitarian aid to get through. But let me emphasize this: \n     should the Bosnian Serbs launch the kind of shelling attack \n     that they have had on Srebrenica and Zepa, should they launch \n     that kind of attack on other safe areas, these procedures can \n     be promptly applied to those other areas and we stand ready \n     to take the necessary steps to do so. But today's meeting was \n     focused, as the Chairman said, primarily on Gorazde.\n       With respect to the other question you asked, as the \n     Chairman's statement indicated, there was an indication on \n     the part of all the participants that the UNPROFOR troops \n     were necessary, would be resupplied, given additional \n     supplies, additional arms if necessary. If that becomes \n     necessary, that can be considered. But there is no commitment \n     on behalf of the United States, at the present time, for the \n     use of helicopters; and I might say there is also no \n     commitment by the United States with respect to ground \n     troops. Our long-standing position on that remains intact.\n       Question. I am sorry. You said that there would be no more \n     pinprick attacks and there have been statements here about \n     substantial attacks, I would like to ask Secretary Perry and \n     General Shalikashvili, would these attacks go far beyond \n     Gorazde? In other words do you intend as you said on the \n     airplane to wipe out the Serbs' air defense system and give \n     you freedom in the air over Bosnia and to attack perhaps fuel \n     dumps, ammunition depots and other areas to teach them a \n     lesson?\n       Secretary Perry. I don't want to describe the details of \n     the air campaign which we discussed in some detail with our \n     colleagues. But what I will say is that, first of all, it is \n     a phased plan ranging everywhere from close air support for a \n     particular tactical unit on the ground that is being \n     attacked, to a broader regional air campaign; that this would \n     be agreed to in detail, to be drawn out in detail and agreed \n     to between the air commander and the ground commander. In its \n     latter phases it involves an area considerably broader than \n     Gorazde. Would General Shalikashvili perhaps like to add to \n     that?\n       General Shalikashvili. I think that you are right, that it \n     is important to understood that these are not just responses \n     against the initial provocation but an air campaign that \n     consists of a wide range of targets throughout a broad zone \n     of operations. That is a significant departure from the way \n     air power was used before.\n       Question. And was it agreed that, if hostages were held, \n     that such a campaign would not be stopped by that?\n       Secretary Perry. That was an issue that was discussed fully \n     and completely at the meeting. We all understood that the \n     success of a sustained air campaign depended on its being \n     sustained and therefore it could not be deterred and \n     interrupted by hostage taking if that were to occur. We \n     cannot let a policy be hostage to the taking of hostages.\n       Question. Do you understand the meeting to have declined to \n     approve, at this point, the use of air power in the case \n     where some other action is taken other than an attack on \n     Gorazde? Will there have to be another meeting if some other \n     action is taken by the Bosnian Serbs in violation of UN \n     mandates?\n       Secretary Christopher. David, let me say two things about \n     that. First, the meeting didn't decline to do anything. The \n     meeting was positive in character. Second, there are existing \n     authorities, as you know, for the use of air power in \n     particular circumstances. If additional authority was \n     necessary because the Bosnian Serbs took some other action, \n     we stand ready to do that; but there are broad existing \n     authorities under the UN Security Council at the present time \n     that are available to the NATO authorities. We focused on \n     Gorazde and, as both the Secretary and the General have said, \n     we made fairly specific and detailed plans for an air \n     campaign should it become necessary in\n      Gorazde. I think those procedures could be translated into \n     other areas if that becomes necessary.\n       Question. Bihac is under attack now, sir, and I wonder why \n     that hasn't been responded to?\n       Secretary Christopher. The situation in Bihac is as it has \n     been before, not always entirely clear as to who's doing the \n     attacking and what the circumstances are. We will be watching \n     that very carefully. I think that today's meeting indicates a \n     new level of concern about the situation in Bosnia as a \n     whole. We addressed what we thought was the principal current \n     threat; we will certainly be following Bihac. As I said in my \n     statement, we are very concerned about the escalating attacks \n     there, and we are following it with great care.\n       Question. What is the new message to the Serbs?\n       Secretary Christopher. The new message to the Serbs is that \n     if you attack--First, the message to the Serbs is you should \n     not attack Gorazde. We are issuing a very strong, stern \n     warning to them which will be communicated in ways in \n     addition to this particular press conference or Foreign \n     Secretary Rifkind's press conference. But beyond that we are \n     saying that if you do attack, you are going to pay an \n     extremely heavy price.\n       Question. What price?\n       Secretary Christopher. I think that we will leave that to \n     their consideration and imagination.\n       Question. Do you think they are quaking in their boots, as \n     somebody else put it earlier at another press conference?\n       Secretary Christopher. If they are well advised, they will \n     not attack Gorazde because they will pay a very heavy price.\n       Question. I have just been to the press conference by Mr. \n     Kozyrev and the greatest expert on air strikes in the world \n     at the moment, on civilian air strikes, namely General \n     Grachev. They said that they don't agree with any of this and \n     that they haven't been quoted properly, and they attack Mr. \n     Rifkind for not quoting them. Do the Russians have the veto \n     or not?\n       Secretary Christopher. The Russians do not have a veto. \n     There is no further action by the United Nations Security \n     Council required for us to take the action that we are going \n     to take today. We are prepared to go forward with the action \n     if necessary. I\n      must say that I did not hear the press conference, but \n     Foreign Minister Kozyrev and the General were present in \n     the meeting. They joined us I think in the importance of \n     UNPROFOR staying. They joined us in the significance of \n     the Bosnian Serbs not taking further action--that they \n     should not threaten Gorazde. I think that they realize \n     UNPROFOR is at stake. If Gorazde were to be taken, as the \n     Foreign Secretary said, UNPROFOR's mission in Bosnia would \n     be very seriously compromised.\n       But to answer your question directly, the action that we've \n     taken today and the agreements that we've reached are not \n     dependent upon Russian concurrence or any Russian vote.\n       Question. You said earlier that how the countries with \n     troops on the ground would respond if hostages were taken was \n     fully discussed in the meeting. Do I understand you to mean \n     that you understand clearly that these countries would not \n     request interruption of bombings if this were to take place?\n       Secretary Christopher. I can't forecast what any given \n     country would do under some hypothetical situation. But the \n     agreement of the importance of introducing a sustained air \n     campaign was made with the understanding that it had to be \n     sustained even in the face of hostage-taking. This was \n     explicitly discussed and discussed in some detail.\n       Question. Secretary Perry, again on your hostage remarks. \n     Does that mean that the allies have to be prepared for the \n     possibility of losing their personnel to a NATO air strike? \n     Did the allies explicitly agree to that?\n       Secretary Perry. Could you re-formulate the question? I did \n     not understand the point.\n       Question. Your comment on the necessity of sustaining an \n     air campaign, even if hostages are taken: Could we interpret \n     that to mean that the allies must be prepared for the \n     possible loss of their hostages in the event air strikes are \n     authorized? Was it discussed in such explicit detail, and did \n     you get agreement on that point?\n       Secretary Perry. First of all, we are not proposing to \n     conduct an air campaign. We are proposing to threaten an air \n     campaign to stop, to deter any action that the Bosnian Serbs \n     might take to attack Gorazde. We hope that will be \n     successful.\n       If it is not successful, we are prepared to conduct a \n     sustained air campaign. We understand--everybody at the \n     meeting understands--there would be substantial risks in \n     doing that. The risks would be to the air crews conducting \n     the campaign, the risk would involve UN forces on the ground, \n     the risk would be even to civilians who are in the area of \n     the targets. Those are inherent risks in air campaigns. We \n     all agreed that that was\n      an unattractive option, and the only reason we are going to \n     proceed with that option is because the alternatives seem \n     even more unattractive to us. The alternative of letting \n     Gorazde fall, which would drive the UNPROFOR out of \n     Bosnia, would result in a humanitarian catastrophe of \n     great proportions. Therefore, balancing risks, we believe \n     that these risks were far preferable to allowing Gorazde \n     to fall.\n       Secretary Christopher. Could I add to Secretary Perry's \n     statement that we are urging the United Nations and we have \n     urged the United Nations already to minimize the exposure of \n     its personnel to limit the possibilities of hostage-taking if \n     it comes to that.\n       Question. Yes, I would like to ask you if the results of \n     this meeting and met your hopes and expectations before the \n     meeting and do you think they will be sufficient to restore \n     the credibility of the United Nations mission in Bosnia?\n       Secretary Christopher. Yes, I found the meeting to be a \n     successful meeting. It met my hopes and expectations, \n     especially since it was called on short notice and there was \n     the need to try to coalesce the views of many countries in a \n     very short period of time. I \n\n[[Page S10675]]\n     think our working together with the British and French in advance to \n     the meeting, of contacting other countries in advance paved \n     the way for a successful meeting. And incidentally, at the \n     meeting today Foreign Minister Kozyrev also described it as a \n     successful meeting. If the Serbs are wise, the situation in \n     Bosnia will become stabilized and will provide the \n     opportunity for us to try to seek a peaceful negotiated \n     settlement of the matter. In a sense, the matter is in their \n     hands. If they choose to attack Gorazde, as I said, they will \n     suffer very gravely. But it would be a much wiser course for \n     them to withhold those attacks and enter into a peaceful \n     negotiation which is the only ultimate conclusion to this \n     tragic conflict.\n       Question. Has it been decided to invite Canada and Italy to \n     join the contact group, both in recognition of their major \n     contributions to peacekeeping and peace enforcement in Bosnia \n     and also to put the contribution of one of the current five, \n     post-Chechnya Russia in more proportionate perspective? And \n     second, given the outspoken support of the World Jewish \n     Congress for Bosnia's Muslims, will you seek technical \n     assistance from the Israelis for an Entebbe-like operation to \n     rescue Karadzic and his mates before they commit further war \n     crimes?\n       Secretary Christopher. One thing about it when you get two \n     questions, you can choose which one to answer. With respect \n     to Italy and Canada, there was no discussion about the \n     Contact Group today, but the point I would emphasize here is \n     that both Italy and Canada were very well and openly \n     represented today by the Foreign Minister, the Defense \n     Minister and the chief of their military forces. They \n     participated very actively in the discussions today. They \n     were deeply involved and they will be certainly fully \n     consulted as we move through each one of these further \n     procedures.\n       Question: I'd like to ask about the dual key. Secretary \n     Rifkind was saying that he could not conceive of a situation \n     in which General Rupert Smith didn't have a final decision on \n     whether air strikes would be launched. Can you tell us how \n     far up the UN chain of command approval would have to come \n     and who talks to whom in order to approve an air strike?\n       Secretary Perry. We discussed that in considerable detail \n     today, and we had at the meeting all of the relevant people. \n     I'd like to refer specifically to General Shalikashvili to \n     give you a more detailed answer to that. I am satisfied that \n     we've made substantial changes much for the better in how \n     that coordination is done. John?\n       General Shalikashvili. The procedures we did discuss, as \n     Secretary Perry said, are a very qualitative step forward, \n     and they parallel proper air-ground operations procedures. In \n     such procedures, the appropriate ground commander, General \n     Rupert Smith, and the air commander must continually \n     coordinate to insure that air strikes are carried out safely, \n     but at the same time also very promptly.\n       These procedures that we now have represent the second part \n     of your question: how far up does this coordination go in the \n     UNPROFOR chain. The UNPROFOR chain that is involved in these \n     coordinations stops with the military commanders.\n       Thank you very much.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the New York Times article clearly says \nthat NATO officials said early this morning that they had agreed that \nno large-scale bombing could start unless the United Nations ``civilian \nofficials'' gave the go ahead. Emphasis ``civilian officials.''\n  Now I read from a press conference last Friday, July 22, of Secretary \nof State Christopher, Secretary of Defense Perry, and Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff General Shalikashvili. Referring to the last \npage:\n\n       Question: I'd like to ask about the dual key. Secretary \n     Rifkind was saying that he could not conceive of a situation \n     in which General Rupert Smith . . .\n\n  That is the on-scene commander for the UNPROFOR and U.N. troops--\n\n     didn't have a final decision on whether airstrikes would be \n     launched. Can you tell us how far up the UN chain of command \n     approval would have to come and who talks to whom in order to \n     approve an air strike?\n\n  General Shalikashvili replied:\n\n       The procedures we did discuss, as Secretary Perry said, are \n     a very qualitative step forward, and they parallel proper \n     air-ground operations procedures. In such procedures, the \n     appropriate ground commander, General Rupert Smith, and the \n     air commander must continually coordinate to insure that air \n     strikes are carried out safely, but at the same time also \n     very promptly.\n       These procedures that we now have represent the second part \n     of your question: How far up does this coordination go in the \n     UNPROFOR chain. The UNPROFOR chain that is involved in these \n     coordinations stops with the military commanders.\n\n  Let me repeat that.\n\n       The UNPROFOR chain that is involved in these coordinations \n     stops with the military commanders.\n\n  To me, Mr. President, I clearly get the impression that the on-scene \nmilitary commanders, Gen. Rupert Smith and NATO Commander Admiral \nSmith, are the decisionmakers. That is in direct conflict with what is \nreported today.\n  The Senate of the United States is trying to work its way through \nthis complex issue. To a certain degree many, including this Senator, \nwant to rely on the representations of the three principal security \nofficials of the United States, Secretaries of State, Defense, and the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs. But their representation to the world in \nthis press briefing to the U.S. Senate on July 22 is in direct conflict \nwith the reports that we received today.\n  So I come back again and again. It is now the time, and the \nobligation of this body politic to make a decision.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia is absolutely \nright.\n  Again, I say to my colleagues, to quote the Scriptures, ``If the \nsound of the trumpet be uncertain, who will follow in the battle?''\n  The sound of the trumpet that was sounded in London on Friday is \nextremely uncertain, and there is no reason to use that communique as \nan excuse for not voting to lift the arms embargo.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the situation in Bosnia continues to \nworsen. Every day brings additional news of Bosnian-Serb troop \nmovement, resulting in more chaos, devastation and reports of \nhorrendous atrocities. As one so-called safe zone after another is \noverrun, and with refugees streaming out of them, it is obvious to most \nthat the Bosnian policy constructed by the United Nations, NATO and the \nAmerican administration has failed.\n  If the consequences of the U.N. failure were not so grave, many of \nthe scenes we all have witnessed would have to be considered almost \nfarcical. United Nations armored personnel carriers being used to ferry \nbicyclists across streets in order to avoid a handful of snipers who \noperate with near impunity--shooting not only at the U.N. personnel--\nbut at women, children, elderly folks. It's an outrage. Then we witness \nthe spectacle of United Nations equipment being taken by the Bosnian-\nSerbs as they overrun United Nations positions, and also by the Bosnian \nMoslems in desperate attempts to protect themselves against Serbian \nattacks.\n  We have all witnessed these events, Mr. President--and those who \ncontinue to argue that negotiators require just a little more time need \nto face up to the reality of the situation. There is a deep-seated \nAmerican belief that reasonable individuals--with time and effort--can \nsolve even the most intractable of problems. Well, perhaps too many of \nour well intentioned negotiators labored for too long under the false \nimpression that we were dealing with reasonable individuals in Pale and \nin Belgrade. The cycle of retaliatory violence confirms the fact that \nthere is nothing remotely reasonable about the Bosnian-Serb leaders or \ntheir counterparts in Belgrade.\n  Institutions that tried to prevent further escalation have failed to \ndo so--plain and simple. This being the case, it is now time to pursue \nan alternate course of action that will not embroil United States \nground forces in a conflict that the Bosnian Moslems can best settle on \ntheir own. The Serbs control 70 percent of Bosnian territory and will \ncontinue to advance unless the Bosnian Moslems affect a reversal of the \nbalance of power through force of arms.\n  While the unilateral lifting of the arms embargo may have some \nshortcomings of its own, and could be a costly endeavor, we should no \nlonger actively prevent the Bosnian Moslems from defending themselves \nby trying to keep them unarmed.\n  However, we should not assume that this decision will not have \nconsequences. For example, depending on the sources of the weapons, we \ncould be sowing seeds of future difficulties. If the Bosnian Government \ndecides to access East European weapons inventories for instance, we do \nnot know exactly how the Russians will react.\n  Apart from sending weapons directly to the Serbs, the Russians might \nalso decide to stem the flow of weapons to the Bosnians by applying \ncertain forms of pressure on the East Europeans. \n\n[[Page S10676]]\nSomehow, I have a difficult time imagining that Russia will just sit \nidly by as events unfold which are clearly detrimental to their Balkan \nallies. It is also not exactly clear what might happen in the event \nthat the United States become a prime source of equipment, and gets \ninvolved in the training of Bosnian personnel.\n  Mr. President, my decision to support this resolution is not without \nsome concern about the unintended consequences of lifting the embargo. \nHowever, I do not see that we have much choice.\n  For several years, the administration has been sending a stream of \nlet's-wait-and-see signals regarding action on Bosnia. The President \nasked the majority leader to hold off on S. 21 until after the London \nconference. Well, the London conference is over and the situation \ncontinues to spin out of control. It should be abundantly clear to all \nthat sooner or later, all of the safe-areas are threatened by the \nBosnian-Serbs. We even have one of the top Bosnian-Serb commanders in a \nrecent interview with a Belgrade newspaper stating his intention to \ntake the remaining safe-areas within a few months. Coincidentally, this \nsame Bosnian-Serb commander--who over- saw the trampling of \nSrebrenica--was indicted yesterday by a U.N. Criminal Tribunal for \nperpetrating war crimes.\n  This time, the waiting is over, for if the embargo is not lifted \nsoon, there may be no Bosnian Moslems left to arm. Ronald Reagan once \nsaid that ``America will support with moral and material assistance \nyour right not just to fight and die for freedom, but to fight and \nwin.'' By supporting this resolution today, the Senate will telegraph \nits support for those who seek to make it on their own. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Dole resolution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nresolution offered by Senators Dole and Lieberman.\n  For months, the situation in Bosnia has deteriorated from bad to \nworse, as have our policy options. Disappointment has given way to \ndisaster--no matter how deep our common concern, it pales in the face \nof the horror and chaos of Srebrenica.\n  As we witness this unfolding tragedy, it is important to keep in mind \nthat it is more than the future of Bosnia that is at stake--American \ncredibility and international influence are on the line. Tomorrow's \nadversaries are carefully watching Bosnia today. They are measuring the \nweight of American words--evaluating the strength of our resolve--\nassessing our leadership, credibility and determination.\n  And, there is little doubt over the conclusion any casual observer \nwould reach--our Bosnian policy is scarred by retreat and reversal--and \nrepetition of the same mistakes.\n  Once again, as the Senate takes up legislation to lift the embargo \nthere is a last minute appeal from the White House that the timing is \nall wrong. We are urged to give yet another policy alternative time to \nwork.\n  But this alternative, like the last alternative, and the options \nbefore that are building on the failure of UNPROFOR.\n  Last week, Assistant Secretary of State Holbrooke commented ``To \nwhatever extent Americans are involved in the air or in any other way \nin Bosnia, we will not be limited or constrained by the insane dual key \nsystem with the U.N. and NATO * * *. We are not going to ask the United \nNations' permission for Americans to do anything in Bosnia.''\n  I was encouraged by this refreshingly frank assessment of what has \ncompromised UNPROFOR's mission and shattered all hope for a resolution \nto the crisis. You do not usually hear senior officials call years of \npolicy ``insane.'' It is a rare event for anyone in this administration \nto forcefully assert unilateral American rights and interests.\n  Unfortunately, no one in London listened.\n  United Nations officials will still be involved in decisions about \nwhen and where to conduct air strikes and use force. Although Secretary \nPerry and Secretary Christopher have offered public assurances that \nthis time, this decision is different, U.N. officials are already \nundermining those claims and maintaining that all final decisions on \nthe use of force will continue to involve the United Nations.\n  Bosnia policy is in mayhem--the effect of the meetings in London \nmerely modified the mayhem. Once again, we failed to deal with the real \nproblem--Serb aggression. As Prime Minister Silajdzic said, ``Another \nhalf measure . . . another fig leaf.''\n  Marginally modifying the chain of command as agreed in London cannot \nerase or correct the United Nations and UNPROFOR's failed course. And, \nthis is a well travelled course.\n  Just a few short weeks ago, President Chirac visited the U.S. \npleading for American support for the Rapid Reaction Force. He assured \nus that it would be an aggressive, combat ready unit prepared to \nintercede--to make a real difference. Field commanders would make the \ndecisions, not U.N. bureaucrats hundreds of miles removed from the \nconflict.\n  Chirac talked of opening a road to Sarajevo, of vigorously defending \nall the safe havens; and, he was adamant that peacekeepers would no \nlonger be the sorry victims of Serb hostage taking.\n  Sadly, within days, it became clear the U.N. had other ideas. Special \nEnvoy Akashi immediately issued an apologetic letter, assuring the Serb \nmilitary that the Rapid Reaction Force would only augment the existing \nUNPROFOR units. There would be no change in mission, no change in \noperational activities, no change in command. In soothing platitudes, \nAkashi directly undermined the RRF's credibility and undercut whatever \nopportunity they might have had to demonstrate success.\n  Worse yet, no one from the administration challenged Akashi's \ninterpretation.\n  Now, we are being promised a robust air campaign, but one that will \nonly protect Gorazde. Once again we have abandoned a principle we \nasserted a few short months ago. Once again, we drew a line in the \nsand, or, more appropriately, we drew a line around six safe havens. \nAnd now, once again, we are deserting the Bosnians in five of the six \nsafe havens.\n  How long before we are forced by circumstance to redefine, retreat, \nrepackage the next alternative?\n  It is long past time to recognize that United Nations Protection \nForce has become an expensive oxymoron--it is neither a force to be \ndealt with nor does it offer any protection. In fact, some have grimly \njoked the only thing the U.N. has successfully occupied is office \nspace.\n  Any doubt--any false hope--about their capability to protect \ncivilians was obliterated in the savaging of Srebrenica.\n  The mission has failed and it is time--it is past time--for UNPROFOR \nto leave, for the embargo to be lifted, and for the Bosnians to be \ngiven the chance to defend themselves.\n  It is their right and our duty.\n  In 1775, a young Patrick Henry stood up and talked of indulging in \nthe illusions of hope, served by entreaty and supplication.\n  In calling our Nation to arms, he said,\n\n       We have done everything we could to avert the storm which \n     is now coming on. . . . Our petitions have been slighted; our \n     remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; \n     our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been \n     spurned. . . . In vain, may we indulge the fond hope of peace \n     and reconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope. If \n     we wish to be free . . . we must fight.\n\n  The United Nations role in Bosnia is replete with petitions, \nsupplications, and remonstrances--all in vain.\n  Are we to deny the Bosnian Moslems the very right to self \ndetermination that defines the conscience of this Nation? Are we to \nrefuse them freedom--repudiate their desire to secure liberty?\n  We have paid a high price for failure in Bosnia--over $2 billion in \ntaxpayers' dollars have supported UNPROFOR. What we have paid in \ntreasure, Bosnians have paid in lives and liberty.\n  Lifting the embargo will not guarantee Bosnians their freedom, but \nthe United States will no longer hold the key to their shackles--the \nball and chain that UNPROFOR has become.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the majority \nleader's resolution to lift the arms embargo. I do not make this \ndecision lightly, and I have no illusions that our vote today will do \nanything to stop this \n\n[[Page S10677]]\nconflict. In fact, we can be sure that lifting the arms embargo will \nintensify the fighting and lead to more pain and suffering. I do not \nsee what other choice we have, though. The U.N. peacekeeping force has \nfailed to defend the misnamed ``safe havens'' or to protect Bosnians \nfrom Serb aggression, and the most honorable thing we can do is allow \nthe Bosnians to defend themselves.\n  I will be the first to admit, Mr. President, that I did not expect \nBosnia to become such a difficult and divisive issue for our country. \nWhen communism collapsed and the walls fell in 1989, I was as excited \nas anyone over the end of the cold war and the prospect of a world \nfinally at peace. I expected that old ethnic and national tensions \nwould flare up, but I figured that European and U.N. diplomacy and a \nfew peacekeepers could handle the job, with limited U.S. involvement. \nThe United States had just won a 40-year-long cold war, and we deserved \nto rest on our laurels. So when this conflict first started in 1991 \nafter Slovenia and Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia, like \nmost Americans, I barely took notice of it. I supported the creation of \nthe U.N. Protection Force [UNPROFOR] in February 1992, and I did not \nargue with UNPROFOR's extension to Bosnia in June 1992, putting my \nfaith in efforts to cobble together a political settlement.\n  But this wound refuses to heal. Instead it festers, fed by historical \nconflicts and prejudices reaching back 500 years. I worry that this \ngangrenous conflict threatens to contaminate all of Europe.\n  As this conflict continued to worsen and Bosnians continued to \nsuffer, I still held out hope for reason to prevail over aggression and \nimperialism. Last July, I voted against this very same resolution to \nlift the arms embargo. I wanted to give the administration more time to \npursue a multilateral agreement on the arms embargo, and negotiators \nmore time to find an agreement the Serbs would accept.\n  In the past year, the situation only got worse. This civil war cost \nthe lives of several U.N. peacekeepers, and almost killed a brave \nAmerican pilot. The Serbs continue to press their attacks, to \nethnically cleanse by driving Bosnians out of their homes, and to kill \ncivilians by shelling Bosnian safe areas. The only honorable thing to \ndo is to admit that without unrestrained military commitments, U.N. \npeacekeepers cannot stop the Serbs, and let the Bosnians begin to fight \nSerbs on equal terms.\n  Regardless of the final wording of this legislation, I hope we all \naccept our commitment to helping U.N. peacekeepers withdraw from \nBosnia, if necessary, with the massive involvement of United States \nground troops. Senator Dole set forth a set of reasonable guidelines on \nthe use of U.S. forces in a withdrawal, designed to reduce risks, which \nI support. But despite the risks, it is our responsibility as a member \nof NATO to help our allies save their people stuck in Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, this is not a political or partisan issue for me. I \nthink our Defense Secretary, Secretary Perry, called this legislation \nthe ``lift-and-pray'' option, and that is as good a description as any. \nThis difficult situation has no easy solutions, and highlights our own \ndifficulties in coming to grips with the realities of a post-cold-war \nworld. It seems like the new world order looks a lot like old world \ndisorder. As much as anybody, I want peace in Bosnia--but not a peace \nbought with the wholesale slaughter of Bosnians by Serbs.\n  It is time to admit that we do not have the answers here, and to do \nthe only honorable thing--let the Bosnians get weapons they need to \nfight for their homes and their lives.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in support of this resolution to \nlift the arms embargo on Bosnia.\n  For several years, the United States and the United Nations have \nrelied on a system of safe havens. These were protected towns: Gorazde, \nSrebrenica, and Zepa in eastern Bosnia; Sarajevo, the capital; and \nBihac in the west. U.N. peacekeepers were to provide security for the \npeople in these towns, while an overall arms embargo covered all \nparticipants in the war.\n\n\n                       failure of present policy\n\n  Where do we now stand today?\n  The Bosnian Serbs have ignored repeated efforts on the part of \nAmericans, Europeans, and Russians to achieve peace. Instead, they have \nattacked all the safe havens.\n  Srebrenica has been captured, and its women and children expelled. \nNobody knows what has become of the men of the town. The Western \ncountries had given all these people a guarantee of safety.\n  Zepa fell yesterday.\n  Bihac is under attack.\n  Sarajevo is being bombed as heavily as ever.\n  And the U.N. peacekeepers have been shot at, shelled, and taken \nhostage.\n  Clearly, this policy has failed. The U.N. force has proven unable to \nprevent Bosnian Serb offensives, to protect civilians, or even to \nprotect its own members. The time has come to admit it and move to \nsomething new.\n\n\n                             three choices\n\n  No choice is a good one. But I believe we have essentially three \noptions, and one is superior.\n  First and foremost, we should not become involved as a combatant in \nthe war. That would confront the American armed services with an \nimpossible task--to impose a permanent political settlement. We would \nbe likely to lose many men and women; we would certainly lose some; and \nultimately it would be futile.\n  Second, the strategy some propose of American air attacks against \nBosnian Serb positions, is irredeemably flawed. It does not command the \nfull support of our allies, and in any case history shows that air \nattacks without a coordinated ground campaign do not succeed.\n  The only remaining choice is the third: to lift the arms embargo and \nlet the Bosnian Government fight in defense of its country. This may \nnot solve the problems of the former Yugoslavia--and I do not believe \nan outside power can solve those problems--but it has the virtue of \njustice.\n  A country attacked by an outside aggressor, or by a rebellion against \na legitimate government, has the right to defend itself as best it can. \nAnd its people, who have seen the West break its promise to keep them \nsafe, should at least be able to fight for themselves.\n  That is why I support this resolution. And I urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, for many months I have resisted \nlegislative initiatives to unilaterally lift the arms embargo against \nthe Bosnian Government. But today I intend to vote differently.\n  I have felt that our country should not depart from the joint 1991 \ndecision made with our NATO allies through the United Nations in \nenforcing an international arms embargo against what was then \nYugoslavia. The international community took this action to prevent the \nfighting from escalating after Slovenia and Croatia withdrew from the \nYugoslav federation.\n  As we all know, the fighting has escalated nevertheless. The U.N. and \nNATO have ever since struggled to balance the safety of Bosnia \ncivilians with the desire to prevent the war from spiralling or \nspreading.\n  But events have taken a dramatic and tragic turn in recent weeks. \nThat is why I now intend to vote for the Dole-Lieberman bill to lift \nthe arms embargo after the United Nations protection forces have left.\n  I recognize that United Nations forces have helped to reduce civilian \ncasualties to a fraction of their prior levels. These forces have also \ncarried out humanitarian operations that have saved thousands of lives.\n  However, it is now evident that the U.N. peacekeeping forces cannot \nbe expected to keep the peace where there is no peace. The U.N. forces, \nI believe, were sent to the region to try to provide safe havens to \nprotect civilians, to open routes to supply food, medicine and \nessential supplies to the Bosnian people, and to try to keep the peace.\n  But it is now clear that the Bosnian Serbs are advancing in areas \nthat the Bosnian Moslems thought were safe. The Bosnian Serbs have \nmarched into Srebrenica, a city that the United Nations had guaranteed \nas a safe haven for civilians. Today we here the further news that \nanother so-called safe haven--Zepa--has fallen before the Bosnian \nSerbs' advance.\n  Again, Bosnian civilians have been left unprotected because the U.N. \nforces are not deployed for or capable \n\n[[Page S10678]]\nof resisting the Serbs' aggression. The fate of Srebrenica and the fall \nof Zepa make a mockery of the United Nations humanitarian mission.\n  We can now see that the embargo has had the practical effect of \nleaving the Bosnian Moslems virtually defenseless in the face of \nSerbian aggression.\n  I have not supported and do not support sending American ground \ntroops to Bosnia to take sides in this conflict. I do not expect that \nwe or our allies are prepared to send troops to the region in \nsufficient numbers to put an end to the war.\n  If that is the case--and I believe it is--then I think we must end \nthe arms embargo against the Bosnian Moslems, so that they can defend \nthemselves.\n  It is a departure for me to support ending an arms embargo anywhere, \nbecause I believe we ought to promote policies that slow the spread of \narms around the world.\n  However, I cannot stand by and watch the atrocities that are \noccurring in Bosnia without believing that it is somehow immoral for us \nto deny the Bosnian Moslems the ability to defend themselves, their \nfamilies and their territory. An independent nation has the right of \nself-defense under article 51 of the U.N. Charter. That is why lifting \nthis embargo is not analogous to lifting the arms ban against Iraq or \nagainst any other aggressor.\n  Let me also point out that the Dole-Lieberman bill we are debating is \na new version. It now says that United Nations Protection Forces should \nfirst leave Bosnia before the embargo is lifted. This will help to \nprevent the U.N. forces from getting caught in an escalating crossfire. \nAs an additional insurance against that possibility, the United States \nmust be prepared to honor the President's commitment to our NATO allies \nto send United States forces to assist in evacuating NATO forces from \nBosnia.\n  Even as we take these steps, I support a renewed effort on the part \nof the United States to seek NATO's support for a multilateral lifting \nof the arms embargo against Bosnia. That would be a preferable \napproach. But in the final analysis, the United States must help the \nBosnian Moslems get the arms to defend themselves.\n  For these reasons, I intend to vote for the Dole-Lieberman bill. I \npray that in some way a new set of policies might force the Bosnian \nSerbs to negotiate a real truce and move that region closer to a \npermanent end to its conflict.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday I spoke at length about the \nsituation in Bosnia. I spoke about the damage this debacle has caused \nto NATO, which has acted like a frightened child in the face of \ngenocide on its borders. I said that the status quo is totally \nunacceptable. I also said that I believe our first responsibility is to \nNATO, and that NATO should be given an opportunity to redeem itself and \nact forcefully to protect the remaining safe havens in Bosnia.\n  I was encouraged by the statements of the NATO leaders after last \nFriday's meeting in London, when they said that NATO would respond with \nsubstantial and decisive air strikes if the Serbs attack Goradze. Then \nSecretary Perry and Secretary Christopher suggested that there would be \na similar response to attacks against the other remaining safe havens, \nwhich I support. They also indicated that the dual-key approach, that \nhas been such a disaster, would end. In the future, NATO commanders \nwould decide when to strike, not U.N. bureaucrats. These assurances \nwere major factors in my decision yesterday to oppose unilaterally \nlifting the embargo.\n  Yesterday, I said I expected to see NATO display the kind of unity \nand power that it should have displayed from the very beginning of this \nconflict. I feared that by unilaterally lifting the arms embargo, we \nwould be undercutting our NATO allies and saying that we do not support \na forceful NATO response. I believe such a decision could lead to wider \nwar, greater suffering, and potentially endanger thousands of \nAmericans. I believe that decisive NATO air strikes could not only turn \nthe tide in favor of the Bosnian Moslems, it could also demonstrate the \ncontinued viability and strength of the NATO alliance.\n  I was therefore very concerned by the article in today's New York \nTimes, titled ``NATO Gives UN Officials Veto on Air Strikes in \nBosnia.'' That article suggests that the fatally flawed status quo \nregarding the dual-key policy has not changed.\n  Mr. President, if that article were accurate I would have had no \nchoice but to reconsider my position on this issue. As I said \nyesterday, I cannot support the status quo. I needed to be convinced \nthat the failed dual-key policy was no longer in effect, and that NATO \nis now fully authorized to use decisive force to deter further Serb \natrocities.\n  Because of the questions raised by that article, I prepared to \ntelephone U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali earlier today. I \nwanted his assurance that future decisions about the use of NATO air \npower would be made by military commanders, not U.N. bureaucrats. \nShortly before I was to make that call, I was informed by our mission \nto the United Nations in New York that the Secretary General had issued \na statement which eliminated any ambiguity about dual-key. His \nstatement goes even further, to address the issue of NATO action to \nprotect Bihac and Sarajevo, as well as Goradze.\n  It is for that reason that I ask unanimous consent that the statement \nby U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali be printed in the \nRecord. His statement makes clear that the status quo is no longer in \neffect. Dual-key is over. A rapid, decisive response is now NATO \npolicy.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Press Statement\n\n        (Attributable to a Spokesman for the Secretary-General)\n\n       The Secretary-General and his advisers have concluded their \n     study of the letter from NATO Secretary-General Willy Claes \n     about the North Atlantic Council's decisions last night \n     relating to the use of NATO air power to deter Bosnian Serb \n     attacks on Gorazde.\n       As indicated in my earlier statement today, the Secretary-\n     General welcomes the commitment of the North Atlantic \n     Alliance to support the United Nations in the implementation \n     of Security Council resolutions, and looks forward to working \n     with NATO toward that end. He fully supports the decision \n     taken by the North Atlantic Council, as conveyed in \n     Secretary-General Claes' letter, and agrees with its \n     conclusion that an attack by the Bosnian Serbs on Gorazde \n     should be met by a firm and decisive response, including \n     through air strikes.\n       On the question of the ``dual key'', the relevant Security \n     Council resolutions call for close co-ordination between the \n     United Nations and NATO on the use of NATO air power and this \n     is reflected in the NATO decision. In order to streamline \n     decision taking within the United Nations chain of command \n     when the use of air power is deemed to be necessary, the \n     Secretary-General has decided to delegate the necessary \n     authority in this respect to his military commanders in the \n     field. He has accordingly delegated authority in respect of \n     air strikes, which he has hitherto retained himself, to \n     General Bernard Janvier, the Commander of United Nations \n     Peace Forces, with immediate effect. As regards close air \n     support, which is the use of air power to defend United \n     Nations personnel, the Secretary-General's Special \n     Representative, Mr. Yasushi Akashi, after consulting the \n     Secretary-General, has today delegated the necessary \n     authority to General Janvier, who is authorized to delegate \n     it further to the UNPROFOR Force Commander when operational \n     circumstances so require.\n       The Secretary-General is deeply concerned by current \n     attacks on Sarajevo and on the Bihac pocket and notes that \n     the North Atlantic Council has asked the NATO Military \n     Authorities, in consultation with the United Nations Peace \n     Forces, to formulate proposals on the possible use of air \n     power in these situations also.\n       The Secretary-General is informing the Security Council of \n     the measures that he is taking. He again expresses his \n     appreciation for the continuing close co-operation which he \n     enjoys with the Secretary-General of NATO. In furtherance of \n     co-operation between the United Nations and NATO, he has \n     today instructed the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping \n     Operations, Mr. Kofi Annan, and the Force Commander, Gen. \n     Janvier, to travel to Brussels for consultations with NATO on \n     the operational modalities for implementing last night's \n     decision of the North Atlantic Council.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the moral and practical consequences of \nour actions in Bosnia are on a collision course.\n  Every moral instinct I have tells me to lift the arms embargo of \nBosnia. I share the anger, frustration and pain that inspired this \namendment.\n  We must finally recognize that the U.N. peacekeeping mission has \nfailed. They cannot keep the peace in a land where there is no peace. \nDespite their bravery, despite their good intentions \n\n[[Page S10679]]\n--they are not able to protect Bosnian civilians--they are not even \nable to protect themselves.\n  As a Polish-American, I see what is happening in Bosnia, and I think \nof what happened to Poland in the Second World War. Polish patriots on \nhorseback, armed only with swords, faced German tanks and German \nhowitzers. The world watched but did nothing.\n  And as Hitler exterminated the Jews, most of the world stood by. This \npassivity amounted to acquiescence.\n  We are showing the acquiescence today with our meaningless U.N. \nresolutions and our empty threats.\n  What is the result of our failure?\n  It is mothers and children running for their lives from so called \nsafe havens.\n  It is the young woman who took her own life after being forced from \nher home and separated from her family.\n  It is the food and medicine convoys prevented from getting to those \nin need.\n  It is the Serb gunfire that is continually targeted toward civilians.\n  And it is the rape and torture that has been going on for 3 years. \nThis barbarism is a crime against humanity.\n  It is very painful to be reminded of the inhumanity that man is \ncapable of. It is a shame on all of us.\n  What history does not teach us, our principles should. And there is \nno more fundamental principle than the right to self-defense. We never \nshould have imposed an arms embargo on Bosnia.\n  So my heart tells me to lift the embargo. I want the Serbs to pay for \ntheir barbarism. If we cannot or will not defend the Bosnian people--\nlet us stop pretending--let us lift the embargo, let us let them defend \nthemselves.\n  But, Mr. President, I cannot vote to take this course unless I also \nconsider the consequences that we and the Bosnian people will face down \nthe road.\n  What happens after we lift the embargo? Most people think that the \nBosnian people will then be able to defend themselves--and that \nAmericans would stay out of the war.\n  But both of these points are wrong.\n  Just allowing the Bosnians to arm will not make it happen. According \nto our military leaders, it will take months to sufficiently arm and \ntrain the Bosnian army. In the meantime, the Bosnian people will be \ndefenseless.\n  The Serbs will not wait. The moment we lift the embargo, the Serbs \nwill make a land grab--not just into the eastern enclaves, but also \ninto central Bosnia. Their brutality could spread across all of Bosnia. \nSo by lifting the embargo, we could make things a great deal worse for \nthe people we so want to help.\n  In addition, lifting the arms embargo will guarantee that United \nStates troops will be on the ground in Bosnia. They would be in rough \nterrain, surrounded by hostile forces. Not defending the Bosnian \npeople--but defending the U.N. peacekeepers as they make their retreat. \nThere could be American casualties and there could be American POW's. \nAnd we will have done nothing to protect the Bosnian people.\n  While most people in this body support lifting the embargo--how many \nsupport sending U.S. troops? And how many of us are willing to take \nresponsibility for the carnage that could occur if we lift the embargo \nand leave the unarmed Bosnians to fend for themselves? We need to \nconsider the moral consequences of our action.\n  In any military action abroad, I believe that must always have clear \ncriteria and objectives that answer three important questions:\n  Why are we there?\n  What keeps us there?\n  And what gets us out?\n  Without answers to these questions, we cannot send U.S. troops into \nbattle. And we have no such answers in Bosnia.\n  I am not saying that we should stick with the status quo. That has \nbrought the Bosnians nothing but misery.\n  I had hoped that in the London meetings last weekend that the allies \nwould reach consensus on clear, decisive and immediate action. We did \nnot go as far as we should have. We did not end, once and for all, the \ndual key policy that puts U.N. bureaucrats in control of military \ndecisions.\n  But NATO policy does seem to be shifting. We are at least preparing \nfor more robust and meaningful retaliation for Serb aggression and for \nsubstantial and decisive use of NATO air power. I believe that we must \ngive this new policy a chance to succeed.\n  So I will oppose the Dole resolution.\n  This is a heart-wrenching decision for me. As I have said, every \ninstinct I have tells me to lift the embargo. But I believe that we \nshould not go it alone unless we are willing to act alone--unless we \nare willing to send in our troops to save Bosnia from the carnage that \ncould occur. We must look at the moral and practical consequences of \nour action.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we all agree that the crisis in Bosnia is \na massive human tragedy. But I oppose this legislation calling for a \nunilateral lifting of the arms embargo, and I do so for five reasons.\n  First, lifting the embargo may theoretically give the Bosnian Moslems \na more effective means to defend themselves. But in fact, lifting the \nembargo is far more likely to put them in an even worse position--\nunless the United States and other nations are able and willing to \nprovide extensive amounts of arms and military training over a lengthy \nperiod of time, and unless these nations are also prepared to take \nwhatever military action is necessary--including the use of ground \ntroops--to keep the Bosnian Serbs from over-running the Moslems during \nthat period.\n  Second, if the U.N. forces withdraw, as seems inevitable when the \narms embargo is lifted, the plight of innocent civilians will get much \nworse as the bloodshed escalates and the vital U.N. humanitarian \nlifeline is severed. In 1992, before the U.N. peacekeepers arrived, \nthere were 130,000 civilian casualties. Last year, there were fewer \nthan three thousand.\n  In addition, over 1.3 million refugees and much of the civilian \npopulation of Sarajevo and central Bosnia--a total of 2.7 million \npeople--are dependent upon the relief work of the United Nations. The \nU.N. may not have kept the peace as well as we had hoped, but it has \nsaved hundreds of thousands of Bosnian lives. This lifesaving \ncapability--and the maintenance of vital humanitarian supply lines--\nwill all be lost if we unilaterally lift the arms embargo and force the \nUnited Nations out of Bosnia. Without the U.N.'s humanitarian efforts, \nwe will see more starvation, more loss of life and a new flood of \nrefugees. The almost $500 million in food, medicine, shelter, and other \nrelief supplies which U.N. agencies plan to deliver this year could \nwell be denied to the innocent people of Bosnia.\n  Third, the wider war that is the most likely result if this \nlegislation is enacted is in no one's interest and could have \ncatastrophic consequences. The last thing the people of Europe and \nAmerica need is a wider war in the Balkans.\n  Fourth, if the embargo is to be lifted, it should be done in \ncooperation with our allies, not unilaterally. Unilateral action by the \nUnited States will seriously undermine both the United Nations and NATO \nand will serve as a dangerous precedent for other nations to ignore \nother international mandates.\n  Fifth, this legislation would make a negotiated solution even more \ndifficult than it is now. Yet a negotiated solution is the only \nrealistic hope for ending this tragic war instead of expanding it.\n  There are no good answers on Bosnia. But the answer proposed in this \nlegislation is worse than the alternative of working closely with our \nallies, as President Clinton is doing. He deserves the bipartisan \nsupport of Congress at this very important and very difficult time.\n  Mr. CONRAD, Mr. President, I intend to support the Bosnia-Herzegovina \nSelf-Defense Act as modified by the Nunn and Cohen amendments.\n  The war in Bosnia is tragic and horrible. No one can hear accounts of \nthe rape, torture, and other crimes the Serbs have committed as they \noverran the so-called safe areas in Srebrenica and Zepa without being \nprofoundly saddened--and outraged.\n  I share with my colleagues a deep sense of frustration that the U.N. \nforces in Bosnia have been unable to put an end to these atrocities. I \nwish the many attempts to reach a negotiated settlement had been \naccepted by the Serbs. I wish our allies in Europe had been more \nwilling to take the lead in countering Serbian aggression.\n  But the reality is, they have not. No one is effectively defending \nthe \n\n[[Page S10680]]\nBosnians, and they do not have the capacity to defend themselves \nbecause of the arms embargo on the former Yugoslavia.\n  In the past, I have opposed resolutions calling for the unilateral \nlifting of the arms embargo. I have long believed the United States \nshould not get involved on the ground in Bosnia, and that it will be \nmuch easier to get into Bosnia that it will be to pull American forces \nout later. I have been very concerned that unilateral actions could \nlead to greater American responsibility for that outcome and greater \nU.S. involvement.\n  But the amended resolution we will vote on today is different. Taken \ntogether, the Nunn and Cohen amendments require the United States \nbefore unilaterally lifting the embargo, to force a U.N. Security \nCouncil and, if necessary, U.N. General Assembly vote on lifting the \nembargo multilaterally. Only if both these avenues have been exhausted \nwould the United States, as a last resort, act unilaterally.\n  The events of the past few weeks have made it clear that we cannot \nwait indefinitely for multilateral agreement to lift the arms embargo. \nThe current approach in Bosnia is not working. Under these \ncircumstances, we must force the United Nations to re-evaluate the arms \nembargo. It is my strong hope that the United Nations will decide to \nlift the arms embargo multilaterally. It is immoral to continue to \nblock the Bosnians from obtaining the arms they need to defend \nthemselves against Serbian aggression when it is abundantly clear that \nonly the Bosnians are willing to defend Bosnia against Serbian \naggression, ethnic cleansing, and other atrocities. The events of the \npast few weeks demonstrate that no one else--not the United Nations, \nnot the United States, and not the Europeans--will adequately defend \nthe Bosnians.\n  This was not an easy decision, Mr. President. There are no cheap or \neasy answers in Bosnia, and this approach involves some risks. But it \nis time to take the least risky approach: to lift the arms embargo--\nmultilaterally if possible, but unilaterally if necessary--so the \nBosnians can defend themselves.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                amendment no. 1848 to amendment no. 1801\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, my amendment is at the desk, and I call that \namendment up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn], for himself, Mr. \n     Graham, and Mr. Robb, proposes an amendment numbered 1848 to \n     amendment No. 1801.\n       On page 2, after line 18, insert the following:\n       ``(4) The Contact Group, composed of representatives of the \n     United States, Russia, France, Great Britain, and Germany, \n     has since July 1994 maintained that in the event of \n     continuing rejection by the Bosnian Serbs of the Contact \n     Group's proposal for Bosnia And Herzegovina, a decision in \n     the United Nations Security Council to lift the Bosnian arms \n     embargo as a last report would be unavoidable.''\n       On page 5, after line 12, insert the following and reletter \n     subsections (e) and (f) as subsections (f) and (g) \n     respectively:\n       ``(e) International Policy.--If the Government of Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina submits a requests to the United Nations \n     Security Council for the departure of UNPROFOR from Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina or if the United Nations Security Council or \n     the countries contributing forces to UNPROFOR decide to \n     withdraw from Bosnia and Herzegovina, as provided in \n     subsection (a), the President (or his representative) shall \n     immediately introduce and support in the United Nations \n     Security Council a resolution to terminate the application of \n     United Nations Security Council resolution 713 to the \n     Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The United States shall \n     insist on a vote on the resolution by Security Council. The \n     resolution shall, at a minimum, provide for the termination \n     of the applicability of United Nations Security Council \n     resolution 713 to the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina no \n     later than the completion of the withdrawal of UNPROFOR \n     personnel from Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I will speak more to this resolution in my \noverall thoughts on the subject of the Dole-Lieberman amendment later \nthis morning or shortly after noon after we meet with the President of \nSouth Korea.\n  But this amendment, as indicated by the reading of the clerk, \nbasically does two things. This amendment says, which is a fact, that \nthe contact group composed of Britain, France, Germany, the United \nStates, and Russia in 1994 made a statement that if the Bosnian Serbs \ndid not agree to the contact group proposal, that the last resort would \nbe the unavoidable lifting of the arms embargo in the U.N. Security \nCouncil.\n  The second part of this amendment makes it clear that, without \ninterfering with the Dole-Lieberman amendment's timetable, which does \nnot require the lifting of the embargo until after the U.N. forces are \nremoved from Bosnia, without altering that timetable on what would be \nthe unilateral lift, this amendment sets up another effort. It sets up \none final effort by the United States, having the President of the \nUnited States go to the Security Council and asking the Security \nCouncil to multilaterally, in accordance with the United Nations' and \nthe Security Council's previous resolution, lift the embargo.\n  I think this amendment is important. All of us know that the Security \nCouncil may not do that but in a month or two the situation may change. \nSome minds may change. And I would remind those countries, Britain, \nFrance, Germany, Russia, as well as the United States, that as part of \nthe contact group, and those that are also on the Security Council, \nincluding Britain, France, and Russia, that this action, this \nmultilateral lift that we will be seeking, if the U.N. forces withdraw, \nis in complete accord and consistent with statements that they signed \non to as a part of the contact group in 1994.\n So it would be my hope that there would be some minds changed if the \nU.N. forces withdraw.\n\n  Mr. President, I will make further remarks about both this amendment \nand my overall view of the Dole-Lieberman proposal before us and the \nadministration policy sometime later in this debate.\n  I would say, though, that I concur in what I heard my friend from \nVirginia and my friend from Connecticut just state about the reports in \nthe paper this morning which indicate that there remains a dual key, \nthat the United Nations is maintaining jurisdiction and that our allies \nin Great Britain and France, according to the New York Times report, \nnotwithstanding the London meeting, have been proponents of retaining \nthat dual key.\n  That is contrary to what this Senator understood in reports from our \nadministration's representatives when they returned from London. It is \ncontrary to the initial reports that came out of NATO from London. And \nit points to the continuing inability of NATO to get its act together \nand of the United Nations to be able to delegate authority for military \naction, and the United Nations by all accounts is incapable of making \nthose decisions.\n  It also calls into question the crucial point about whether a bombing \ncampaign envisions the possibility of hostage taking and whether the \nparticipants in the bombing campaign in response to an attack on \nGorazde are willing to continue the required military action even if \nhostages are taken.\n  Mr. President, it is absolutely essential that the NATO alliance not \nbegin a strike campaign unless they are willing to hit meaningful \ntargets and unless they are willing to continue that in the face of \nalmost certain adversity, that is, hostage taking and perhaps even the \nkilling of United Nations personnel.\n  Mr. President, these remarks I will continue at a later point, but I \ndid want to go on record that the Senator from Virginia and the Senator \nfrom Connecticut are correct, in my view, that this report this morning \nI think greatly undercuts the position we hoped had come out of the \nLondon conference, which was to abolish the dual key at least as far as \nGorazde is concerned.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/26/senate-section/article/S10665-4", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10680-S10697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  JOINT MEETING OF THE TWO HOUSES--ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY KIM YONG-\n                SAM, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA\n\n\n                                 Recess\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Parliamentary inquiry.\n  I think it would be helpful if the Chair would cite the order of the \ntime of the votes and the pending matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending matter is S. 21, the Bosnia \nmatter. There are 45 minutes to each side under control in debate, and \ncircumstances with leaders on each side controlling debate. At 1:30----\n  Mr. WARNER. I think it is 1:45, Mr. President.\n  Will the Chair clarify the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is controlled time until 1:30, followed \nby the two leaders who have an opportunity to speak to the issue and \nuse their leader time. The amendment by the Senator from Georgia. [Mr. \nNunn] is pending to the substitute of the majority leader.\n  Mr. WARNER. Thank you. Mr. President, then, for planning purposes, \nSenators could anticipate a vote between 1:45 and 2.\n  Would that be correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That, I believe, is the general time of which \nthe next recorded vote should occur.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for no more than 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time for that purpose?\n  Mr. CRAIG. And that the time not be used by either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, would that \ntime then be divided for both sides fully?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would choose it not be divided from either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator's request?\n  Mr. CRAIG. If there is no objection, it could be divided equally.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have to \nconsult with the distinguished majority leader. I note the presence on \nthe floor of a number of Senators who wish to address the pending \nresolution.\n  Might we inquire of the Senator from Idaho the time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. It does not deal with this issue.\n  Mr. WARNER. I realize that. The time that the Senator would want?\n  Mr. CRAIG. No more than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, may I inquire of the manager of the bill--I \nam sorry. I just walked onto the floor and did not understand what the \nallocation of time was. I know we are moving toward a vote at 1:45, \napproximately. The time is reserved for leaders. I would like to get \nsome assurance that I will be able to speak on the pending question for \nup to 10 minutes or so. I do not know how that works in terms of other \ntime that might be allocated. I just offer that so that the leader has \nsome opportunity to make a judgment on this.\n  Mr. WARNER. For the information of the Senators present, there is now \nan hour and a half of time equally divided between the majority leader \nand the Senator from Connecticut and those who wish to speak in \nopposition. I see the presence of two or three Senators I happen to \nunderstand will be speaking in favor, on behalf of the majority \nleader's amendment. I am perfectly willing to allocate such time within \nthat 45 minutes as they desire.\n  Could the Senator from Indiana indicate how much time he would like \nto have?\n  Mr. COATS. I prefer more, but I will accept 10 minutes or so.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I may indicate to the Senator from \nVirginia, I would be happy to have 5 minutes reserved for my comments.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have just been advised by the majority \nleader's staff that the majority leader is overcommitted at this time \nwith respect to the time period of 45 minutes under his control. \nTherefore, I regret that I would have to interpose an objection to----\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will yield the floor then if time has \nbeen allocated for this purpose.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this is the first I knew about this \nallocation of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIndiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. WARNER. Might I ask the Senator from Indiana if he could lessen \nthat time if at all possible because we are overrequested.\n  Mr. COATS. I will do my best.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for his courtesy. I \ndid speak on this issue a few days ago, and I will attempt to summarize \nthe statement that I have here in the interest of preserving some time \nfor other Members.\n  I tried to make two points. First, that it is regrettable that we are \nhere not debating what the policy should be relative to Bosnia, \nfulfilling our constitutional role of advise and consent to the \nPresident of the United States, who is Commander in Chief and who is \ndelegated and given the responsibility and authority to conduct the \nUnited States foreign policy, but regrettably we are here formulating \nthat policy in the absence of leadership provided by the President and \nthe administration in fulfilling their duties. That has been a \ncontinuing sad story that has permeated this entire Bosnia debate over \nthe last 2\\1/2\\ to 3 years.\n  Filling this vacuum of leadership is not something that this Senator \nrelishes or even feels fully qualified to perform. Nevertheless, it \nseems that it is left to us to try to identify and define some policy \nrelative to the United States involvement or lack of involvement in \nthis conflict in Bosnia.\n  It is true that the choices that face us as a nation in terms of \ndealing with this conflict are not easy choices. Former Secretary of \nDefense Les Aspin said all choices in Bosnia are bad; some are worse. \nIt is clear that we are dealing with perhaps what might be defined as \nthe best of the worst in terms of choices. But a couple of facts \nconfront us very, very directly today in this conflict.\n  Fact No. 1 is that the current attempts at negotiating a settlement \nto the conflict in Bosnia have failed. And they have failed for a \nperiod now of 2\\1/2\\ to 3 years. There have been numerous attempts. \nThere have been numerous so-called peace agreements, new peace plans. I \nmet with the Bosnian Foreign Minister just a few days ago. He said, \n``We have signed 17 pieces of paper agreeing to cease-fires and \nagreeing to peace plans.'' He said that, ``We have one party in this \nconflict that holds a piece of paper and no weapon, and another party \nwho holds a weapon and no piece of paper.'' He said to guess which one \nis going to prevail.\n  He said, ``We will not be able to sit down at the table and begin to \nnegotiate an agreement which both sides can agree to and adhere to \nuntil there is an equalization of the confrontation that exists between \nthe two.'' Either both hold a piece of paper or both hold a piece of \npaper and a weapon, and some sort of rough stalemate exists that will \ncause both parties to have an incentive to come to the peace table. As \nthe situation now exists, no peace can be achieved if one party has no \nreason to achieve a peace, no basis to achieve a peace. There is no \nreason they need to achieve a peace if they can achieve their gains \nthrough force.\n  The second truth we face is that UNPROFOR's--the so-called protective \nforce's--policy of protecting Bosnians \n\n[[Page S10682]]\nin safe havens has failed. We daily read of the latest disaster in this \nregard.\n  It is clear that UNPROFOR, for whatever reason, does not have the \ncapacity, the will, or whatever, to achieve a successful implementation \nof the protection policy.\n  The third basic fact, and we might as well say it and be up front \nabout it, the United States is not going to intervene militarily to \nsolve this and resolve this conflict. The American people do not \nsupport it, the Congress does not support it, the President has not \narticulated why we should do this, how it is in our vital strategic or \nnational interest, how we could achieve this militarily, how long we \nwould be there, what our exit strategy would be.\n  None of the defined criteria that are used to justify American \nintervention have been either defined or articulated to either us or \nthe American people, and it is clear that we will not commit troops to \nthis conflict.\n  Anyone who has studied the history of conflict in this region, anyone \nwho understands to the most elementary level the nature of the \nenvironment in which we will be placing our troops, anyone who \nunderstands the complexity of this particular conflict, has to come to \nthe conclusion that it would be a disaster, a mistake, to involve the \nU.S. militarily in this conflict.\n  Therefore, we are left with what I believe is probably the best-worst \noption, something that I have been reluctant to endorse, but something \nI do now endorse, and that is a lifting of the embargo. I agree with \nthe proposal that withdraws the U.N. protective forces first before we \nlift. I think that is important. I agree with the policy that says the \nUnited States should not commit to a NATO strategy that is destined to \nbe a failed policy.\n  But after UNPROFOR has left, and hopefully we will not need to \nfulfill the President's already-stated commitment and promise to our \nNATO allies to utilize U.S. forces to withdraw those forces, hopefully \nthat will not be necessary. I will reluctantly support that, in an \nemergency situation, if there is no other way, as a commitment to NATO \nthat I believe has been made and we need now to keep. Hopefully, we \nthen can lift the arms embargo.\n  I think we need to understand what this means. I asked the foreign \nminister, what does this mean lifting the arms embargo? What kind of \narms do you seek? He said, ``You don't understand. We don't need \nAmerican advisers on the ground; we don't need massive training off \nsite, we are very skilled in the rudimentaries of conflict.''\n  What we are dealing with here is not a Desert Storm sophisticated \narms conflict, but something more akin to pre-World War II. He said, \n``The first thing we need are helmets.'' He said, ``Most of our deaths \nare caused by shrapnel injuries to the head because we are not allowed \nto have helmets under the arms embargo.'' It is an absurd restriction.\n  Second, he said, ``We need some ammunition, small arms ammunition. We \ndon't need people to show us how to use that. We have been an arms \nmanufacturer in the past.''\n  Third, he said, ``We need some antitank weapons so that we can deter \nthe heavy tank forces that may be arrayed against us.'' He said, \n``These don't need to be sophisticated either; shoulder-held, shoulder-\nfired antitank weapons would be sufficient.''\n  And fourth, ``We need artillery to counter the artillery that is \nutilized by the Serbs so that we can achieve some kind of balance of \nforces.''\n  So lifting the arms embargo does not mean necessarily greater U.S. \ninvolvement, it does not mean we need to supply the arms. These arms \nare available on the world market. It simply means we give the Bosnians \nthe right to do what they had asked us to do, and that is to defend \ntheir own borders.\n  Finally, I think we need to examine a strategy of containment that is \nin our vital national interest, not to have this spread into the areas \nof Macedonia and Kosovo. We do need to draw the line, NATO does need to \nbe involved in this, but it requires U.S. leadership to accomplish it. \nU.S. leadership has been the glue that formulated NATO, it has been the \nglue that has held it together, and it is going to be the leadership \nnecessary to maintain NATO as a sustainable, viable defense entity. So \nwe need that leadership, and we should consult with our NATO allies \nabout a containment strategy that keeps this conflict contained within \nits current area.\n  So, Mr. President, that is a very abbreviated explanation of why I \nsupport the Dole-Lieberman effort here. I do so reluctantly. I believe \nwe have no other choice.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia for the time that he has allotted \nto me.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield myself such time that I might \nrequire.\n  I think it would be in order if we sort of recognized, went back and \nforth from those in support and those in opposition. The Senator from \nWashington came very promptly. So I suggest by way of unanimous consent \nthat the Senator from Washington proceed, to be followed by Senator Kyl \nand Senator DeWine, Senator Thurmond. Of course, we can interrupt that \norder, if necessary, if others in opposition wish to speak.\n  And then I also announce that we have reason to believe that Senator \nCohen may be desirous of submitting an amendment. I hope he will advise \nthe managers as to his time requirements as early as possible. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes in opposition.\n  I do rise today in opposition to S. 21, which directs the President \nof the United States to unilaterally lift the arms embargo on Bosnia \nand Herzegovina. Like many of my colleagues, I, too, want to do \nsomething, anything, to stop further atrocities from occurring in \nBosnia. The situation grows more horrid everyday. We have all said it \nin a hundred different ways: There are no good options to choose from \nwhen trying to determine how best to respond to the tragedies in Bosnia \nand Herzegovina.\n  Compelling, sound, and thoughtful arguments have been made on both \nsides of this debate. In the words of one young Dutch peacekeeper just \nfreed from Srebrenica: ``You wish the war would stop, but it's only a \nwish. It will be a miracle if this war ever stops.''\n  He had come to that conclusion after witnessing first hand the hatred \nthat has fueled this conflict for generations, a hatred so deep as to \nseem endless, passed on for centuries from parent to child.\n  At home, most Americans wonder aloud why the nations of Europe have \nnot been able to come together around this crisis. Knowing how pressing \nthe needs are in our own country, many Americans voice frustration at \nthe unending calls for one form or another of United States involvement \nin Bosnia. Many resent the United States. in the role of global \npoliceman again, and still many others are horrified by the pictures \nthey see of refugees, of Bosnia's senseless dead, of ethnic cleansing \nand genocide, of a young woman hanging from a tree in desperate pursuit \nof escape.\n  It is this profound sense of frustration that brings us to this \ndebate today. Proponents of S. 21 argue that this approach gives us the \nbest of both worlds--allowing the United States to do something to \nresolve the conflict while doing nothing to further our own national \ninvolvement. But I believe, Mr. President, that the promises of this \napproach may well prove to be false and that the consequences of \nSenator Dole's bill are not well understood.\n  It is those consequences that concern me the most. It is those \nquestions that have not been answered as we go through this debate.\n  Despite those who have dismissed his comments during the course of \nthis debate, I agree with Secretary of Defense William Perry when he \nsays that unilaterally lifting the embargo greatly risks Americanizing \nthe war in the Balkans.\n  Let me make it clear that I agree with those who argue that the arms \nembargo should be lifted, because it is the Bosnians' right as an \nindependent nation to defend themselves. U.N. Resolution 713, agreed to \nin 1991 and imposing an arms embargo on all states formed from former \nYugoslavia, has frozen a military imbalance in place, because Bosnian \nSerbs inherited most of the arms and troop strength from Tito's \nYugoslavia.\n  But I continue to have very strong concerns about the United States \ngoing \n\n[[Page S10683]]\nit alone and lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia unilaterally--\nagainst the better judgment of our European allies who have troops on \nthe ground, and who have far more at stake than we do at this point.\n  We have spent little time during this debate discussing the actual \ndetails of the plan before us. But it is those details that will \ndetermine the success or failure of this approach.\n  For example, if the goal of lifting this embargo is to get arms to \nthe Bosnians, how exactly will that be accomplished? Who will be \nsupplying the arms? The language of the bill suggests that we can \nsomehow preclude U.S. participation, but I am unclear as to how that \ncan be achieved. If we act unilaterally, we may then be in a position \nof supplying not just arms, but also trainers and other U.S. military \nsupport personnel. Or, if we simply provide funds for the Bosnians to \npurchase arms, will we be supportive if they use United States funds to \npurchase arms from Russia--or Iran?\n  How do we keep United States supplied arms from falling into the \nwrong hands? This may be a particularly difficult problem if Russian \narms are purchased--given that Russia has remained very close to the \nSerbs during this conflict.\n  More broadly, if we view the Bosnian crisis as a potential threat to \nEuropean stability, then I believe we must approach the problem in \nconcert with our European allies, despite how difficult this has been. \nThey are strongly opposed to lifting the embargo, and have made it \nclear that if the United States lifts the Bosnian embargo, they will \nremove their peacekeepers. That will no doubt lead to a new wave of \nrefugees in Europe. It is the Europeans who will have to deal with the \nimmediate effects of any U.S. action. It will be their soldiers who are \non the ground in Bosnia, and whose lives will be on the line.\n  Other questions remain.\n  Currently, the United States works with our allies to enforce the \nembargo. If we break it unilaterally, will our allies continue to try \nand enforce it, and if so, how will we deal with such conflicts?\n  The Croatians, too, have lost territory to the Serbs and would like \nto reclaim it. If we lift the embargo against Bosnia, why will we not \nbe asked to do the same for Croatia?\n  And, if the United States acts unilaterally, this could lead some \nnations to question their commitment to other embargoes, such as the \neconomic boycott of Iraq currently in place.\n  Mr. President, I am not prepared today to bury the multilateralism we \nhave worked so hard to develop over the last 50 years with our allies.\n  And finally, if the U.N. peacekeepers are removed, the United States \nmay find itself in a position of having to deploy our own troops to \nhelp in that evacuation. Have the American people been adequately \nprepared for the loss of life that may occur under those circumstances? \nOn that question, Mr. President, I strongly believe we should take the \nmatter to a vote of the House and Senate if a wider role for U.S. \ntroops is requested, so that the American people are involved.\n  Let me make it clear that although I do not support the resolution \nbefore us today, I agree that the status quo is totally unacceptable. \nThe handwringing of the West has been endless. Our actions have been \nirresolute and irresponsible.\n  It has been a mistake from the beginning to deploy U.N. peacekeepers \nin a situation where no peace exists. It is not the mission of U.N. \npeacekeepers to make peace. Their role is to try to keep the peace once \na settlement to the conflict has been agreed upon. That is not the \nsituation in the former Yugoslavia. In the words of the Secretary \nGeneral, the West has delivered to the United Nations a ``mission \nimpossible.''\n  Scores of peacekeepers have been killed--and countless wounded. They \nhave been deployed as soldiers into a war zone, but without the arms \nand means to protect even themselves.\n  The peacekeepers have done their best under these horrid \ncircumstances. They have saved countless thousands of lives. They have \ndelivered vital humanitarian relief supplies. But they cannot be \nexpected to resolve this war.\n  As I said in the beginning of my statement, we have come to this \ndebate out of a deep sense of frustration.\n  This past weekend's ministerial level meetings in Europe produced a \nrefinement of current allied strategy, but the current allied position \nremains tenuous and untested. We know that NATO's pinprick airstrikes \nare to be replaced by a NATO air campaign. We have been promised \nsignificant improvements in the duel-key command and control system, \nbut confusion on this critical issue remains.\n  Overall, the agreement between the United States and our allies is \nextremely fragile, with important questions remaining about its \nimplementation. Will, for example, the plan to protect Goradze become a \npolicy and extend to other U.N. safehavens if they come under attack?\n  Fundamentally, is there a policy of resoluteness behind this site \nspecific plan? If so, I have yet to hear it. And will the military \nofficers on the ground finally be in control of military decisions, as \nopposed to the current situation where civilian U.N. officials can veto \na military recommendation to initiate airstrikes. It is that situation \nwhich has led the Serbs to conclude that the West is nothing more than \na paper tiger.\n  Rightfully frustrated by what appears to be yet more allied \nindecisivness, Senators voting today in support of the unilateral \nlifting of the embargo believe their action will contribute to a \nsolution in Bosnia. For the sake of the Bosnians, and for the sake of \nthe entire civilian population throughout the former Yugoslavia, I hope \nthat they are right, and that this action brings the conflicting \nparties closer to the peace table.\n  But we have no way of knowing that will be the case.\n  Let me state clearly that I oppose unilaterally lifting the embargo \nfor two basic reasons: At the core, this is a European issue. Our \nEuropean allies are on the frontline, and they do not want us to act \nunilaterally. We have 50 years of solid NATO relations at stake, and I \nhave strong concerns about the United States going it alone against our \nEuropean allies who have troops on the ground and who have more at \nstake than we do as we go into this debate.\n  Second, and more important, if we do this, we have to be prepared to \naccept the consequences--we, the Senators of the U.S. Senate.\n The moment we lift the embargo, there is a strong chance the allies \nwill leave and an all-out war will follow. If that is our choice, we \nwill have to live with the resulting carnage. It is for those two \nreasons that I oppose this proposition before the Senate.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a debate with endless questions and few \nanswers, but in my view history will far better be served if the United \nStates continues to try to forge a consensus approach to this tragic \nsituation, rather than adopt a go-it-alone strategy that may well have \nthe unforeseen consequence of widening the war and escalating our own \nnational involvement.\n  It is with a great deal of reluctance and sadness that I vote today \nin opposition to the amendment before the Senate.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield myself such time as I may require. I am informed \nat the present time there will be an objection to any request to extend \nthe amount of time now elapsing between 12:20 and 1:30, at which time \nthe leaders have their time reserved.\n  Therefore, I ask the Senator from Arizona how much time is required?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could the Senator reduce it to 3?\n  Mr. KYL. I will do my best.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask the Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine], to reduce his \ntime to 3 minutes.\n  The distinguished Senator from South Carolina, could we inquire as to \nthe amount of time that the Senator desires?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, 7 or 8 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could I ask the Senator to reduce that amount of time? We \nare rapidly running out of time.\n  Hopefully we can accommodate the Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Can the Senator extend it to give me 7 minutes?\n  Mr. WARNER. I am told there will be an objection. Could we hopefully \ndo 5 minutes?\n  Mr. THURMOND. I will try.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor. \n\n[[Page S10684]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to strongly support the Dole-Lieberman \nresolution. It is frustrating for all because the moral imperatives \nhere demand action, yet as has been noted by all of the other speakers, \nall actions are fraught with problems.\n  We all agree there are no good options. We all agree that lifting the \narms embargo is not a panacea, but it will enable the Bosnian Moslems \nto defend themselves, which is their right under article 51 of the \nUnited Nations charter. It may hasten the day when the Serbs cease \ntheir aggression.\n  Ever since the United Nations extended diplomatic recognition to \nBosnia and Herzegovina in 1992, I have believed that the United Nations \nshould either act to get the United Nations to lift the 1991 embargo, \nor unilaterally lift that embargo to make it easier for the Moslem \ncommunities to defend themselves.\n  We all know that the Bosnian Serbs have an arsenal of weapons which \nthey obtained largely from the Yugoslavian Army, also from Romania, the \nSoviet Union and other sources.\n  In Afghanistan, Cambodia, Nicaragua, and with the Kurds in Iraq, the \nUnited States helped those defending their families and territory to \nacquire the weapons to defend themselves. This situation is no \ndifferent, Mr. President. That is why I support lifting the arms \nembargo.\n  While some negative consequences could result from lifting the arms \nembargo, it cannot be worse for the Bosnian Moslems than the death of \n200,000 civilians, perhaps thousands of women raped, 2 million people \nleft homeless, and the loss of 70 percent of their territory.\n  Albert Wohlsetter pointed out in an editorial entitled ``Genocide by \nEmbargo,'' ``adherence to Security Council Resolution 727, even after \nthe United Nations, European Community and the United States has \nrecognized the independent status of the states of the former \nYugoslavia, is a violation of article 51 of the U.N. Charter which \nacknowledges the right of self-defense.'' He says ``The United States \nshould now simply declare that there is no valid embargo on the \nsovereign nations who are the victims of continuing Serbian genocide.''\n  Mr. President, shortly we will be voting on two amendments which seek \nto involve the United Nations. Of course, if the United Nations could \nquickly lift the arms embargo, that would be the best result. These \namendments should not interpose between U.S. action immediately and \nlifting of the arms embargo by the rest of the world communities any \nrequirements that would delay U.S. action.\n  That is why I believe we should first pass the Dole-Lieberman \nresolution which commits the United States to action, not dependent on \nwhat anyone else does. As former British Prime Minister Margaret \nThatcher wrote in her recent letter to Senator Dole, ``American \nleadership is vital to bring order out of the present chaos. No country \nmust be allowed to veto the action required to end the present \ncatastrophe.''\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I may proceed for \nnot to exceed 2 minutes on my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is important that the Senator from \nMaine be given an opportunity to propose an amendment which is in the \nnature of a second-degree amendment. I yield to him 2 minutes.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1851 to Amendment No. 1848\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, last evening I took the floor to indicate \nthat my expectation was that Senator Nunn would be offering an \namendment that essentially would require President Clinton to go to the \nUnited Nations. A year ago in August, Senator Nunn and then Senator \nMitchell also sponsored legislation requiring the President to go to \nthe United Nations. The President did, but he did not seek a vote.\n  Under the Nunn amendment, as I understand it, he would require the \nPresident to seek a vote to lift the embargo on a multilateral basis. \nIt is my expectation that if the President were required to do so, \nnonetheless we could anticipate that one of the members of the Security \nCouncil--be it Russia, be it France, be it any other member--would \nimpose a veto or seek to prevent it from coming to a vote.\n  My amendment to the Nunn amendment would require that in the case \nthat a vote is prevented or in case a veto is lodged, that the \nPresident would then go to the General Assembly of the United Nations \nwhich has voted--the membership of that has voted on two prior \noccasions overwhelmingly--to lift the embargo.\n  This would, in my judgment, meet the objections of our colleagues who \nare concerned about undermining our relationship and the United Nations \nor with NATO. This would give an opportunity for a multilateral lifting \nof the embargo and would preserve the integrity of the institution \nitself.\n  I believe it would resolve the problems that many of my colleagues \nfeel now, acting unilaterally. This is an opportunity for the countries \nwho have voiced their support for the lifting of that embargo on a \nmultilateral basis to cast their vote. I believe we would accomplish \nour objectives. I intend to support the Dole resolution. I intend to \nsupport the Nunn amendment, and hopefully my colleagues will also \nsupport it.\n  Mr. President, I send to the desk my amendment in the second degree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Mr. Cohen] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1851 to amendment No. 1848.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike the period at the end and insert in lieu thereof the \n     following: ``In the event the United Nations Security Council \n     fails to adopt the resolution to terminate the application of \n     United Nations Security Council resolution 713 to the \n     Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina because of a lack of \n     unanimity of the permanent members, thereby failing to \n     exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of \n     international peace and security, the United States shall \n     promptly endeavor to bring the issue before the General \n     Assembly for decision as provided for in the Assembly's \n     Uniting for Peace Resolution of 1950.''\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I believe the Nunn amendment is \nsufficient to allow consideration of a multilateral lift of the arms \nembargo by our allies. The Nunn amendment provides the United States \nample opportunity to consult to the greatest reasonable extent with our \nallies. As I said in my statement earlier, the time to act is now--not \nlater. However, so that it can never be said that the United States did \nnot allow every opportunity for the international community to support \na multilateral lift of the arms embargo, I will support the Cohen \nsecond-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1801\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Dole-\nLieberman bill.\n  Let me make very clear, however, at the outset, that I believe that \nthis is a terrible way to have to make foreign policy.\n  The facts are that no congressional action can substitute for \nPresidential leadership. No congressional action can substitute for \nPresidential vision. There is no substitute for a clear and coherent \nU.S. foreign policy defined, articulated, and pursued by the President.\n  Congress cannot negotiate with our allies. Congress cannot open up a \nback channel. Congress cannot order airstrikes.\n  Therefore, this is a resolution that I am not particularly happy to \nhave to endorse. I am sure that many of my colleagues share my intense \ndislike for congressional micromanagement of foreign affairs and \nforeign policy. I do not think, Mr. President, we should make a \npractice of acting as pseudo-Secretaries of State.\n  In fact, last week when the President called the majority leader and \nasked him to delay action on this resolution, I had hoped then that the \nPresident was going to lead. The events of last weekend and the last \nfew days, as articulated by my colleague from Connecticut and my \ncolleague from Virginia several hours ago, clearly shows this is not \ngoing to happen.\n  Mr. President, Congress cannot force the President to lead, but maybe \nCongress can push him towards leading. Indeed, we must do this. The \nstakes in Bosnia are great. This conflict is more than just a civil \nwar. It involves more \n\n[[Page S10685]]\nthan just the tragedies we see on TV, however horrible they are.\n It also involves the question of the future of NATO and ultimately the \nstability of Europe.\n\n  We have to reassert U.S. leadership of NATO. We have to maintain NATO \nas a viable force. We have to prevent the spread of this conflict.\n  The administration simply does not have a coherent policy to achieve \nthese ends. Crossing your fingers is not a policy.\n  To achieve these ends, you have to start changing the conditions on \nthe ground. The bill before us outlines one way in which we could begin \nto do this.\n  Clearly, though, lifting the arms embargo is a moral imperative. It \nis the right thing to do. The administration may not have a foreign \npolicy yet, but until they do we should at least give the Bosnians a \nchance to defend themselves.\n  The arms embargo is an unwise, outdated policy, enacted against a \ncountry that no longer exists. I am, however, troubled by the idea of a \nunilateral U.S. withdrawal from a collective engagement. That is why I \nintend to support the amendments of Senators Cohen and Nunn. We should \ngo to the U.N. Security Council--and, if we fail there, the General \nAssembly--to make this an allied and not a purely American policy.\n  Mr. President, the handwriting is on the wall for the U.N. policy in \nBosnia. The UNPROFOR troops are coming out--they are probably coming \nout whether we pass this resolution or not.\n  They are coming out for good reason. They simply have no constructive \nrole to play under the rules of engagement.\n  Are the UNPROFOR troops supposed to stay in Bosnia just to die? Are \nthey supposed to stay there just to be captured--just to serve as a \nshield for the aggressors? No. The writing is on the wall, and they are \ncoming out.\n  We need the President to lead.\n  The President needs to explain to the American people what America's \ngoals are in Bosnia--how, specifically, he intends to achieve them--\nwhat sacrifices the American people might have to make--and why.\n  We cannot do that here on the Senate floor, but somebody has to. And \nthat somebody is the President of the United States.\n  On this issue, the administration is adrift. It is my hope that by \npassing this resolution, the Senate is recalling the President to his \nmost important responsibility--to serve as Commander in Chief.\n  Mr. President, this problem will not just disappear. The only hope \nfor a more positive resolution of this tragedy will come with \nPresidential leadership.\n  Mr. WARNER. Now, Mr. President, the distinguished senior Senator from \nSouth Carolina is about to address the Senate. I would like to make a \nfurther request for unanimous consent that the Senator from Minnesota \n[Mr. Wellstone] be granted 3 minutes following that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, last week I spoke on the floor about the \nsituation in Bosnia--about the U.N. safe havens being overrun by the \nBosnian Serbs and U.N. peacekeepers being taken hostage.\n  Since my statement on the floor, the United States and its allies, \nprimarily Britain and France, met to discuss options. The result of \nthose meetings was a stern warning that aggressive airstrikes would be \nused against the Bosnian Serbs if they try to overrun anymore U.N. safe \nhavens, like Gorazde. The Bosnian Serbs reaction to that ``stern \nwarning'' was to fire a barrage of shells into Sarajevo killing and \nwounding civilians. Members opposing S. 21 are asking that time be \nallowed for the new directive to use aggressive airstrikes against the \nBosnian Serbs to work. In the meantime, the U.N. General Secretary is \nsitting in New York determining exactly what the use of aggressive \nairstrikes will include. And according to the news accounts today, he \nwill retain the authority to veto any NATO recommendation to use \naggressive airstrikes. Meanwhile, Zepa fell yesterday to the Bosnian \nSerbs, and Sarajevo continues to be shelled.\n  It is clear to me that the majority of Members in this body agree \nthat the U.N. mission has failed--it is time for the U.N. protection \nforces to withdraw. Despite continued stern warnings and threats by the \nUnited Nations and NATO to use aggressive airstrikes, the Bosnian Serbs \ncontinue to defy the United Nations and NATO and continue to pose a \ndanger to the civilians in the U.N. safe havens and the U.N. \npeacekeepers there to protect them. The time has come for the \nadministration and our allies to quit wringing their hands about what \nto do in Bosnia and quit looking to the United Nations to make \ndecisions on whether to use aggressive airstrikes to enforce peace in a \ncountry where there is no peace.\n  Mr. President, as I stated last week, the United States has no \nnational security interests in Bosnia. The only interests the United \nStates has with regard to the situation in Bosnia is to provide \nleadership and act responsibly as a member of the United Nations \nSecurity Council and as a member of NATO. It is time for the United \nNations to withdraw its forces from Bosnia and to seek agreement to \nlift the arms embargo against Bosnia. Failing an agreement by the U.N. \nSecurity Council to lift the embargo, the United States should \nunilaterally lift the arms embargo so that the Bosnians can defend \nthemselves. It is time for the Congress to show its leadership to \nensure that U.S. credibility as a treaty partner and NATO ally. We must \nassist, if requested, in a NATO withdrawal of the U.N. protection \nforces from Bosnia.\n  I remain concerned that Members of this body did not actively engage \nin a discussion of U.S. support in a NATO withdrawal of UNPROFOR. The \nU.S. cannot stand by while our allies are in mortal danger during a \nwithdrawal of UNPROFOR. As I stated last week, the damage to U.S. \nleadership, honor, prestige and credibility would be beyond \ncalculation, if we do not send a clear signal now that the Congress \nwill support the participation of U.S. troops in a withdrawal \noperation. It should be understood, however, that any U.S. \nparticipation in a U.N. withdrawal must be totally under NATO command \nand that there can be no dual key arrangement between the United \nNations and NATO and there must be robust rules of engagement.\n  The situation facing this body is not complicated, but the demand for \nus to take decisive action is clear and urgent. The Dole-Lieberman \nsubstitute to S. 21 allows us to take action which is well defined and \nin the best interest of our Nation. The Dole-Lieberman substitute also \nserves the best interests of our Allies, to whom we have pledged our \nsupport in leaving what has become an impossible mission. I urge the \nSenate to support the Dole-Lieberman substitute to S. 21 and hope that \nour Allies join in this positive course of action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to pose a further unanimous-\nconsent request, that from the time under the control of the \ndistinguished majority leader, 4 minutes be granted to the Senator from \nMinnesota, now waiting to speak; that 3 minutes be granted to the \nSenator from Iowa; that 3 minutes be granted to the Senator from New \nJersey [Mr. Lautenberg] who has been here; and my understanding is the \nSenator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] is going to speak against the \namendment, consequently he would take 5 minutes from the time under the \ncontrol of the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, we have witnessed, over the last few \nmonths, especially the last 2 weeks, a sickening spectacle in Bosnia. \nWomen raped for alleged sins committed by their ancestors centuries \nago, torture, and the brutal cold-blooded murder of young Moslem men. \nWhere are the Serbs taking these men, 12 years of age and older--if you \nwant to call a 12-year-old a man? I have felt from the beginning we \nshould be flying over, taking notes of the license plates, and making \nclear to the Serbs they will be held accountable for war crimes.\n  Mr. President, this is the never again--again. These are Nazi-like \ntactics, Nazi-like actions. That is what we are witnessing.\n  During the last 3 years, I have voted at various times both on the \narms embargo and to find other ways that allies could respond to this \naggression by the Serbs. And it does seem to me that the arms embargo \nmust be lifted.\n \n[[Page S10686]]\n\n  But if we are going to be intellectually honest, we need to think \nthrough all of the policy implications that accompany this momentous \ndecision. If the UNPROFOR forces are going to be leaving, they have to \nhave safe exit, and the international community, with the United States \nincluded, I believe, has to make a commitment.\n  What about the refugees themselves? I traveled to the former \nYugoslavia, and I met with refugees. And I saw enough pain to last a \nlifetime. God forbid what is going to happen to them in the interim if \nU.N. forces withdraw and the Serbs just go on forward and we have more \nslaughter on top of slaughter. What is going to be our response and the \nresponse of the international community?\n  I say to my colleagues, I think this is a moral imperative, and we \nshould end this. I hope it is multinational. But we should end this \narms embargo.\n  But, please, Democrats and Republicans alike, do not think that now, \nall of a sudden, it is a level playing field. Do not make this a \ntechnical fix. Do not turn your gaze away from what is happening \nbecause we have other obligations that we must live up to. The people \nof Bosnia need our help. They deserve the right to defend themselves \nagainst brutal Serb aggression.\n  We should vote today to send a strong signal to the administration \nand to our allies that we must move forward forcefully on Bosnia before \nthe entire U.N. operation collapses and the people of Bosnia are \noverrun altogether by the Serbs.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues, Senator Lieberman, ``never again'' \nshould mean ``never again.'' Let us vote to send a strong signal to the \nrest of the world that we still believe in that proposition.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, regardless of which side you may be on \nin this debate, I think we can all agree on one thing. And that one \nthing we can all agree on is the lack of leadership this administration \nhas displayed in this crisis. This administration under President \nClinton has zigged and zagged and flipped and flopped more than a lost \nrabbit in an Iowa corn field.\n  This administration has huffed and puffed and bluffed it's way \nthrough this crisis for over 2 years now. I would agree that the prior \nBush administration also made mistakes. But, those mistakes have been \nincreased and expanded under a Clinton foreign policy that no one \nunderstands or respects. And, that includes our allies.\n  The only entity that has less respect is probably the United Nations. \nAnd who do we turn the responsibility over to? Of course, the Clinton \nadministration has allowed the United Nations to define and control our \npolicy.\n  Just a few examples of the multilateral ineptitude that's taken place \nincluding the following:\n  In November 1993, a Sarajevo schoolyard was shelled, killing 4 \nchildren and wounding 40. The Clinton administration responded by \nsaying ``We're not going to allow that city to be strangled, to be cut \noff, to be relentlessly attacked.'' What action was taken? None.\n  In May 1995, 200 U.N. peacekeepers were taken hostage and used as \nhuman shields against air strikes. We heard all kinds of protests and \nthreats from the Clinton administration to the NATO Secretary General. \nWhat action was taken? None.\n  One of our planes was shot down recently thanks to the fact that the \nadministration had neglected to provide missile jamming devices to our \nplanes. And the pilot was hunted like an animal. Thankfully, the pilot \nwas rescued. What action did we take against the aggressors? None.\n  Mr. President, in stark contrast, we see the leadership of Majority \nLeader Dole. Senate Dole has consistently moved forward with efforts to \nallow the Bosnian Government to exercise its inherent right to defend \nitself. Against many odds last year, including a hostile Clinton \nadministration, and an uncooperative Congress, Senator Dole forged \nahead and made his case. Today, his case, which is the case for justice \nto the Bosnian Government, will finally win the day.\n  Of course, it may only be for a day or so, since the Clinton \nadministration is adamant about continuing its incompetent course of \ndisaster, by threatening to veto a unilateral lifting of the embargo. \nThis of course, is another sad commentary on the administration's \nfailed policy.\n  Mr. President, it is way beyond the time to finally act. And veto \nthreats, notwithstanding, I urge my colleagues to do the right thing \nand support the Dole substitute amendment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I rise for the simple purpose of clarifying, to the degree that I am \nable, a point of law, a point of international practice, an American \nprinciple which is at issue in the first two amendments that we are \ngoing to consider. And I thank my friends from Virginia and Connecticut \nfor allowing me this time.\n  A very brief proposition, sir, but a long history behind it: Article \n24 of the charter, drafted in a time of great expectations for post-\nworld war that did not come to pass, states that,\n\n       In order to ensure prompt and effective action by the \n     United Nations, its Members confer on the Security Council \n     primary responsibility for the maintenance of international \n     peace and security, and agree that in carrying out its duties \n     under this responsibility the Security Council act on their \n     behalf.\n\n  Sir, this was at a time when we anticipated that the Security Council \nwould have available to it armed forces from various member countries.\n  The Senate provided that the President could make available specific \nmilitary units--the 6th Fleet, the 1st Marine Division. If once we had \nagreed in the Senate and in the Congress to do this, he could \nthereafter deploy them at will.\n  However, it was stated, and it was a matter of great concern in our \ndelegation in San Francisco--Senator Vandenberg was most particularly \nconcerned--that the powers of the Security Council would not interfere \nwith the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense, which \nwas the basic law of nations. Senator Vandenberg said that, if this was \nnot provided in the charter explicitly, a reservation would be offered \non this floor, and he would support it, and, in the end, it was agreed \nto. Then Republican adviser John Foster Dulles, was not that \nenthusiastic, but after much debate by the delegation it became the \nposition of the United States that it had to be included in the \ncharter.\n  Now, sir, here is the simple point, and I hope I can be heard on \nthis. I speak as someone who was Permanent Representative to the United \nNations under President Ford. I speak as someone who once served as the \nPresident of the Security Council.\n  If we adopt the two amendments before us, we concede that in the one \ninstance, the Security Council, in the other, the General Assembly, has \nthe right to deny the inherent right of individual or collective self-\ndefense. If they have to vote to agree to the exercise of that right, \nthen it is not a right itself; it is simply an authority that can be \nconferred by a higher body; to wit, the Security Council or the General \nAssembly.\n  I say once again, sir, this is an article of great concern to us. The \nTreaty of Chapultepec, the Western Hemisphere defense system, the \nMonroe Doctrine--all of those things were agreements which we were \nconcerned might be limited by the charter, putting into question the \ninherent right of individual or collective self-defense.\n  If we ever concede, for whatever transient purposes of this moment, \nthat the Security Council has the right to confer what becomes simply a \nprivilege, not a right, or the General Assembly has the right to confer \nwhat becomes now a privilege, not a right, then we are in grossest \nignorance and avoidance of the history of the charter and the text of \nthe charter.\n  Mr. President, I hope we do not make this mistake. It would be \nsomething that 50 years ago on this floor would have been clearly \nunderstood. And we have not dealt with these issues much in the last \nhalf century. We may have become forgetful, although the revered former \nchairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations would remember. He was \nthere.\n  I point out, sir, that the right of individual or collective self-\ndefense is inherent. That is the language of the \n\n[[Page S10687]]\ncharter. The charter is simply a codification of rights. The right to \nself-defense being an inherent right, we cannot ever concede to the \nSecurity Council or to the General Assembly some authority to confer--\nlet the right become operational, or however you like to say it--that \nright. It ceases at that point to be a right. It becomes a privilege to \nbe conferred or denied.\n  I thank the Chair most specifically for his kindness and attention.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a memorandum of law be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the memorandum was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Memorandum of Law\n\n\n                                SUMMARY\n\n       The history of Article 51 demonstrates that any member \n     state's obligation to defer to the Security Council in \n     refraining from engaging in individual or collective self-\n     defense is conditioned on the Security Council taking \n     effective measures to restore peace and prevent aggression. \n     The record further shows that unless this point was made \n     clear in the Charter, the Senate probably would have taken a \n     reservation on this point in giving its consent to \n     ratification.\n\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\n       According to Ruth Russell's indispensable ``A History of \n     the United Nations Charter,'' the principle of the right of \n     self defense was so unanimously agreed upon that initially \n     there was no proposal to include in the Charter an express \n     provision on this point. The bulk of the debate over the \n     issue revolved around the desire of the U.S. delegation to \n     confirm that the Security Council could not interfere with \n     the ``collective'' right of self defense within the Americas \n     under the Treaty of Chapultepec.\n       The American delegation initially considered opposing any \n     express reservation on the grounds that it could only be used \n     to restrict what was ``inherent'':\n       ``When the [American] delegation made its paragraph-by-\n     paragraph study of the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals, its most \n     serious difficulties arose with . . . maintenance of peace \n     and security. The enforcement aspects of the chapter were \n     accepted without debate. The only point left unsettled was \n     whether a specific reservation of the right of self-defense \n     should be included. As this was agreed to be an inherent \n     right of sovereignty, not deniable by the projected Charter, \n     there was no controversy on the principle. The question, as \n     it had earlier confronted American officials, was whether \n     attempted definition would not defeat the very end desired by \n     making possible a restrictive interpretation of the \n     principle. The issue was left open. . . .''\n       Later the U.S. delegation had ``acrimonious'' debates about \n     how to protect the right of the U.S. to engage in collective \n     self-defense in the Western Hemisphere in the face of a \n     ``Great Power'' veto. This passage is from Senator \n     Vandenberg's diary:\n       ``[John Foster] Dulles argued that there is nothing in \n     Dumbarton Oaks which prohibits `self-defense' and that under \n     the Chapultepec agreement `self-defense' in the Western \n     Hemisphere is a partnership affair and that the Monroe \n     Doctrine is still part of it. I served notice on the \n     Delegation, as a matter of good faith, that if this question \n     is not specifically cleared up on the Charter, I shall expect \n     to see a Reservation on the subject in the Senate and that I \n     shall support it.''\n       A subsequent U.S. delegation statement of the U.S. position \n     made it clear that states must be free to take action if the \n     Security Council is frustrated by the use of the veto: ``if \n     any one of the Great Powers with a veto in the Security \n     Council abuses its power . . . the Organization will have \n     broken down and all states would then be free to take \n     protective action.''\n       When the U.S. finally proposed that there should be a \n     formal recognition of the `inherent'' right of self-defense \n     in order to protect its rights in the Western Hemisphere, the \n     official U.S. position--endorsed by President Roosevelt--was \n     explained as follows:\n       ``Should the Security Council not succeed in preventing \n     aggression, and should aggression occur by any state against \n     any member state, such member state possesses the inherent \n     right to take necessary measures for self-defense.''\n       Ruth Russell explains that an express reservation on this \n     point was in part necessitated because the delegation ``faced \n     a very practical problem in getting the treaty through the \n     Senate.''\n       The British proposal on Article 51--which is very close to \n     the final version--makes even more clear than the final text \n     that the Security Council must act and act effectively if \n     other states are to be expected to defer to it:\n       ``Nothing in this Charter should invalidate the right of \n     self-defense against armed attack, either individual or \n     collective, in the event of the Security Council failing to \n     take the necessary steps to maintain or restore international \n     peace and security.''\n       Interestingly, two of the last three paragraphs in \n     Russell's 965-page history of the Charter concern the \n     inherent right of self-defense. She was writing in 1958 and \n     the ``Great Power'' veto had, of course, become very much a \n     problem:\n       ``Responsible American officials assumed, it can be said \n     with more accuracy, that if the desired cooperation did not \n     materialize, a serious great-power split would probably lead \n     to another world war, with or without the United Nations. \n     Even if the Council could not guarantee the peace, they also \n     pointed out, it could make clear the record. And as the \n     Charter in no way abrogated the right of self-defense, which \n     no nation was prepared to relinquish, action against \n     aggression could still be taken outside the Organization. \n     This was always an implicit assumption of American officials, \n     although it was not made explicit until the San Francisco \n     Conference.\n       ``There the right was recognized in Article 51, in both \n     national and collective terms. If, therefore, the United \n     Nations machinery for any reason could not function to \n     maintain international peace and security, national power \n     could be mobilized by the states on a regional or some other \n     joint basis. The decisive factor, in that case, would be the \n     willingness of other states to act against the recalcitrant \n     state even at the cost of war. What experience has shown is \n     that the desire to support such drastic action against \n     disliked policies and countries is never as widespread as the \n     willingness to condemn them. This was as true in the autumn \n     of 1945 as it has been under the United Nations.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, does the Senator from New York require \nmore time?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I would only say the same thing over and over again. \nThe right of self-defense--individual, collective--is inherent and in \nno way depends on the approval of the Security Council or the General \nAssembly or any other international body.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think he has very clearly stated his \nmessage.\n  Under the current unanimous-consent request, there are 3 minutes for \nthe Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. President, I yield such time as to make that 5 minutes, 2 minutes \nadditional.\n  To inform other Senators, that results in the expiration of the time \nunder the control of the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair. I thank our colleague from \nVirginia for his graciousness in permitting me these 5 minutes. I know \neverybody is pulling at him, and I do not want to use any more time \nexcept to thank him for that.\n  Mr. President, if any of us were fence sitting or had doubts about \nwhat it was that we were witnessing, I think each day that has gone by \nin recent weeks has further confirmed that we no longer can stand idly \nby, that we must take action as befits our status as an international \nleader in terms of morality and humanity, a country that supports human \nrights almost above all else. Our very Constitution is based on law. \nAnd when we stand by idly, which we are being forced to do by the \ncowardice of our allies, then I think we become coconspirators, whether \nwe like it or not.\n  Mr. President, as recently as this morning, we saw something that \nkind of confirms what the distinguished Senator from New York just \nsaid.\n  In a report from Brussels, the New York Times writes that:\n\n       The allies agreed to make what one NATO official called a \n     ``strong recommendation'' to Mr. Boutros-Ghali to leave it to \n     his military field commanders on the ground in Gorazde and \n     elsewhere to decide when the time has come to start bombing \n     the Serbs if they attack. But since Mr. Boutros-Ghali has \n     been extremely cautious about approval of airstrikes in the \n     past, what was meant to sound like a roar in London 4 days \n     ago appeared to have been throttled down to something more \n     like a growl by the NATO Ambassadors.\n\n  That is the situation. But the killing does not stop. The attacks do \nnot stop. The barbarism does not stop. And if one had at all any sense \nof rights, when you read the stories about what happened in Zepa and \nwhat happened before that in Srebrenica, where a woman was forced to \ndrink the blood of her 16-year-old son after his throat was cut, \nbarbarism of the most primitive and cruel fashion, we cannot stand by \nand permit that to happen.\n  Mr. President, last year, we gave a deadline of November 15 for our \nallies to get themselves together so that we could move multilaterally. \nWhat happened? Since then hundreds, thousands more have been killed, \nthousands abused, and more territory taken by the rogue government of \nthe Bosnian Serbs--total disdain for world organization, for rules, for \nhumanitarian conduct among people. It is shocking to see, and we ought \nnot to permit it to go on any longer.\n  Now, I know, Mr. President, that we are embarking on a shaky course, \nbut \n\n[[Page S10688]]\nnot to do anything is a far shakier course. And certainly coconspiring \nwith the Bosnian Serbs to say that we will talk ourselves into the \nground while you kill the Bosnian people, separating men from women, \nfamilies, brothers from sisters, is terrible. It is terrible. And there \nis not a person here who could witness a crime like that taking place \nand not intervene at one's own peril--no one. No decent human being \ncould walk by and permit that to happen.\n  Mr. President, yesterday I had a conversation with the Prime Minister \nof Bosnia, and I asked him the perennial question that seems to exist \nnow, and that is: Are you not afraid that larger forces will come in \nand bring even more devastation? And he said, ``Ask the 5,000 missing \nin Srebrenica whether or not they were afraid of more power coming \nagainst them.''\n  Mr. President, he is not asking for much. He is asking for us to give \nthem a chance to fight back, to untie the hands from behind their backs \nand give them the weapons necessary to defend themselves, as the \nSenator from New York so articulately stated just a couple of minutes \nago.\n  It pains me to make this kind of a decision because we are going down \na path we are not sure about. There is one thing I am sure about. I for \none cannot permit the killing to take place, the barbarism to continue, \nwithout speaking out against it in a way that has significance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to say to my distinguished \ncolleague from New Jersey that was a very powerful statement, and I \nhope it can be clearly understood and accepted by all. I certainly join \nhim in his observation and very much respect his support of this \nimportant measure now before the Senate.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that would consume all the time \nunder the control of the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time under the control of the majority \nleader has been consumed.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Shelby). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Noting the absence in the Chamber of any colleagues \nwishing to speak on the other side, I rise to say a few words with the \nunderstanding that as soon as or even before I see someone else who \nwishes to speak, I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, this has been, since we began it yesterday afternoon \nat 2:15 p.m., a very important, very serious, very heartfelt debate, \nand I thank my colleagues for, no matter which side they are on, \nappreciating the seriousness of what we are doing here and for \nreflecting that seriousness in their remarks.\n  I just want to say a few words in closing. Of course, Senator Dole \nwill speak in leader's time a little bit later.\n  No matter what any of those in opposition to the proposal that \nSenator Dole and I and others of both parties have made, no matter what \narguments have been made--that it would cause bloodshed, it would \nAmericanize the war, it would do offense to our allies, all of which \narguments I feel we have rebutted--one thing stands out. No one has \ncome to the floor of this Senate to say that the arms embargo is \njustified or should stay in place. No one has supported the arms \nembargo. Everyone who has said they will be voting against our measure \nto lift the arms embargo will do so because of their fear of what might \nhappen--the war might be widened; it does not give a proper opportunity \nfor the London communique, as flawed as Senator Warner and I indicated \nwe believed it was earlier in the morning, or did not give time for the \nLondon communique to go into effect. But I have not heard anyone come \nhere and justify the arms embargo, because it is unjustifiable.\n  As Senator Moynihan said, in what might be called an articulation of \na natural rights theory of international law, quite valid, to suggest \nthat this is a right of self-defense that must be granted or can be \ntaken away by an international body is wrong. It is conveyed as a right \nunder the charter of the United Nations.\n I would say under any theory of natural rights that people have \nindividually or acting collectively. Again, remember that it was \nimposed in 1991 on Yugoslavia, which no longer exists, on the premise \nthat it might help stop a war from breaking out because it would keep \nweapons from pouring into that area, encouraged--in fact, requested by \nMilosevic in Belgrade. Why? Because he knew he had a monopoly of the \nweapons and munitions, supported by a well-meaning world. But what was \nits justification to support it after war broke out, and after the \nSerbs invaded Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and began to kill and remove \nfrom their homes hundreds of thousands of people, millions of refugees? \nThis is an illegal act. It is an immoral act, and has consequences on \nthe victims. And it is invalid.\n\n  Some have said if we lift this arms embargo, what about the other \ninternational policies of sanctions against Iran and Iraq and Libya? Is \nany Member of the Chamber prepared to compare the behavior of Iran to \nthat of the Bosnian people or Libya to Bosnia or Iraq to Bosnia? And in \nevery other one of those cases, those nations violated international \nlaw, international norms. The Bosnians have done no such thing. And \nthey have been the victims of this embargo. Just think if anyone stood \nup today, the embargo had not been in effect since 1991, and proposed \nan arms embargo on the nations in the former Yugoslavia, no one would \nsupport it. It is so self-evidently unfair, and unfortunately in its \nconsequences brutally deadly.\n  So, I take some heart from the fact that the opposition to the \nproposal that we have made to lift the arms embargo has not featured \nanyone saying that the embargo was or is justified in their feature \narguments of what might happen if the embargo was lifted.\n  Does the Senator from North Dakota wish to speak?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me, Mr. President, if I might. I would like the ask \nthe Senator from Connecticut to yield for a question.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I would be glad to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have been enormously torn by this issue. Much of what \nthe Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Kansas and others \nhave expressed on the floor is real anguish. There is real anguish \nabout, I think, a moral problem confronting the world with respect to \nwhat is happening in the Balkans. I know there has been a lot of \ncriticism on the floor that the current policy does not work, the \nPresident does not have a policy, and so on.\n  Frankly, I have not heard anyone else on the floor express what \npolicy they would work in the Balkans. This resolution, as I understand \nit, is a policy that simply says lift the arms embargo. That is not, of \ncourse, a policy to end the war. It is a policy, as the Senator from \nConnecticut describes, to try to even the odds. But to those who say \nthere is no policy, I would say that I am very anxious to hear, what do \nthey think will solve this problem in the Balkans?\n  What is happening there is grotesque. Unspeakable horrors are being \nvisited upon innocent civilians. I read yesterday of Dutch observers, \nDutch soldiers coming back who describe what is happening. And there \nare other reports from reputable sources. What is being visited upon \nthe Bosnian Moslems can only be described as a horror. And we must care \nabout that and deal with it and respond to it.\n  Yet I would ask the Senator this question. Here is what troubles me. \nWe have not--the United States--put U.S. troops on the ground in the \nBalkans. I do not think we should. And I would not support us doing so. \nBut other countries have. The British have. The French have. The \nUkrainians have. The Dutch have. Other countries have put their troops \non the ground in harm's way in that region.\n  It troubles me at this point for us, who have not put troops on the \nground, and I do not think we should, to say to those countries who \nhave, that we do not care what you think about the proper policy in \nBosnia. This bill tells our allies that we do not care that you believe \nthe arms embargo ought to continue. We will decide unilaterally that \nthe arms embargo should not continue. That is what I am torn by. That \nis what I am troubled by.\n  Other countries have made a troop commitment on the ground. And they \n\n[[Page S10689]]\n  still say they believe that we ought to act together on lifting the \nembargo. And they are not yet willing, as I understand it, to decide \nthat the arms embargo ought to be lifted.\n  I wonder if the Senator could respond to this general question. How \ndoes one look at what our allies have done, that we have not done, and \nthen respond that we can unilaterally decide on an arms embargo without \ncaring what their position is?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nNorth Dakota. Actually, I have watched him as he has been listening to \nthis debate. I have seen, because I know him, his own struggling and \nanguish about this. And I respect the seriousness with which he has \ngone out, and the sincerity and the relevance of the questions that he \nasks now.\n  Let me answer the two questions. In the first place, what is the \npolicy? Who can offer a policy that will do any better than what is \nhappened now? I will say to my friend, the policy that the Western \nWorld and the world has followed up until now, which is to send the \nUnited Nations into what I consider to be a mission impossible, to keep \nthe peace where there was only war has not worked.\n  The London communique raised some hope that it might begin to work if \nthe allies can get together and use their air power to give some \nmeaning to the word ``safe'' as applied to safe areas. Right now they \nare the furthest things from safe. Combined with that the very weak and \nconfused U.N. presence, the continued arms embargo, that has been the \npolicy up until now.\n  I judge that to be a failure. It has not stopped Serbian aggression \nand not stopped the suffering of the Bosnian people and it has done \nterrible damage to the credibility of the United Nations, NATO, and \nunfortunately the United States.\n  The alternative policy, the preferable policy, which is in part \nimplemented by the proposal that we will vote on in awhile, is the so-\ncalled lift-and-strike policy that in fact President Clinton adopted in \nthe 1992 campaign and carried with him into 1993 and to the Presidency. \nHe was frustrated in his desire to implement that lift-and-strike \npolicy in the spring of 1993 when our allies in Europe refused to go \nalong.\n  So what we are asking in putting this proposal here is to begin to \nfinally, though the hour is late and ever more difficult in Bosnia, to \nimplement the lift-and-strike policy. Lifting through this action and \nstriking hopefully through the broadening of the measures agreed to and \nthe toughening of the measures agreed to in the London communique.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might ask a question about that point. That suggests \nsomehow that the strategy of dealing with the conflict in Bosnia is to \nrely on air power. And I tell you, I have been in meetings where Colin \nPowell, when he was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and others \ndescribed for us how air power might be used in the Balkans. It is a \nmuch different circumstance than using air power in the desert, where \nfolks would run their tanks out into the middle of the open desert and \nwe would send airplanes over to bomb the tanks. I wonder whether the \nSenator believes that air power eventually is what is going to resolve \nthe conflict in the Balkans?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. No. I agree with Senators and others who have spoken \nthat air power can help but never decide the conflict. But when \ncombined with the considerable Bosnian military force on the ground, \nfinally fully armed, I think it is a winning combination.\n  I say to my friend I note the presence on the floor of the Senator \nfrom Georgia. I do not want to impinge on his time. I would simply \nanswer the second question raised about the troops on the ground and \nthe allied nations that I hope that the U.N. mission can be fortified \nas a result of the London communique. I am doubtful based on the \nconflicting messages that have come out of late, but it does seem to me \nthe lifting of the embargo does stand separately because it is an \nillegal and invalid act and it can stand alongside the continued \npresence of the U.N. troops.\n  However, responding to concerns expressed, I think appropriately, by \nthe Senator from Georgia and others, Senator Dole and I made a \nsubstantial change in the proposal to lift the arms embargo from the \nmeasure we introduced last year to say the embargo would not be lifted \nuntil the allies on the ground had the chance to exit if, in fact, they \nchose to exit.\n  I will say finally, as the Senator from North Dakota considers how to \nvote, it seems to me--and I must say of all the reasons given for \nvoting against our proposal, the one that has most profoundly troubled \nme is the suggestion that it would cause more bloodshed. Here I think \nwe owe it to the victims, those who have shed their blood, to listen to \nthem and not to make a paternalistic judgment for them about what may \nbe better for them. They are the ones who have suffered.\n  I close, finally, with words from a letter of Prime Minister \nSilajdzic of Bosnia, who said:\n\n       Our people ask that we be allowed only our right to defend \n     ourselves. It is on their behalf that I appeal to the \n     American people and Government to untie our hands so that we \n     may protect ourselves. The slaughter has gone far enough. My \n     people insist that they would rather die while standing and \n     fighting than on their knees. In God's name, we ask that you \n     lift the arms embargo.\n\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I do not want to interrupt my friend from \nConnecticut. I do want to get started on my remarks. I understand I \nhave 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A little under 20 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1848\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I would like to begin my remarks by briefly \nreviewing the history of the Bosnian debate that has taken place in the \nSenate not over the last 3 or 4 years, but over the last 12 months.\n  As most Senators will recall, last July during the consideration of \nDepartment of Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1995, the \nSenate debated two competing amendments. One, sponsored by Senators \nDole and Lieberman, would have unilaterally lifted the arms embargo \nupon the request of the Bosnian Government. The other, sponsored by \nSenator Mitchell and me, expressed the sense of Congress that there \nshould be a multilateral lift of the arms embargo.\n  I know it has been pointed out, but the Dole-Lieberman amendment we \nnow have before us is not a lift-first-then-leave policy; it is a \nleave-first-and-then-lift policy, and that point needs to be \nemphasized. This is not the same Dole-Lieberman amendment we had last \nyear.\n  The Dole-Lieberman amendment last year failed on a 50 to 50 vote, and \nthe Mitchell-Nunn amendment was adopted on a vote of 52-48. Later, on \nthe Department of Defense appropriations bill, another vote was taken, \nand the Dole amendment was adopted and the Mitchell-Nunn amendment was \nadopted again.\n  During the House-Senate conference on the authorization bill, with \nboth of these amendments on the authorization bill, the House bill had \na unilateral lift provision that passed by a significant margin in the \nHouse. The Senate bill had the Mitchell-Nunn provision I already \ndescribed. The compromise provision, worked out during conference, \nstated as general United States policy that the United States should \nexercise leadership within the international community to cause the \nBosnian Serbs to accept the contact group proposal. It also called for \nsuch leadership to be taken on three separate, but complementary \ntracks, as follows, and these are important as background for this vote \ntoday:\n  First, there was an international track policy that if the Bosnian \nSerbs did not accept the contact group's peace proposal by October 15, \n1994, the President should formally introduce and support a resolution \nwithin the U.N. Security Council to lift the Bosnian arms embargo \nmultilaterally. The provision was not mandatory because the President \nwrote to the conferees committing his administration to introduce and \nsupport such a resolution in the Security Council. The administration \ndid as they committed they would do to the conferees, but they did not \npress the resolution to a vote because they determined that it would \nnot pass.\n  The second part of the provision in that authorization bill, a \ncompromise between the House and Senate, was a \n\n[[Page S10690]]\nunilateral U.S. policy track. It provided that if the U.N. Security \nCouncil did not lift the Bosnian arms embargo, then, first, no funds \ncould be used to enforce the arms embargo on the Bosnian Government \nother than as required of all U.N. member states, and that has been the \nlaw since last year. We have not been enforcing the embargo according \nto the law. We have been respecting it, not enforcing it, with our \nmoney and with our forces.\n  Second, the President shall submit a plan to and consult with the \nCongress on the manner in which U.S. Armed Forces and the forces of \nfriendly states would provide training to the Bosnian army outside \nBosnia.\n  And, third, the President should submit a plan to consult with the \nCongress regarding the unilateral termination of the Bosnian arms \nembargo and the implications thereof.\n  The third and final part of last year's authorization bill, which I \nthink perhaps was its most relevant part to where we are now, was an \ninterim policy track. It provided that if the Bosnian Serbs attacked \nany safe areas, the President should promptly, formally introduce and \nsupport in the U.N. Security Council a resolution that selectively \nlifts the Bosnian arms embargo in order to allow the provision of \ndefensive weapons, such as antitank weapons, counter-battery radars and \nmortars, to enable the Bosnian Government to defend the safe areas.\n  Mr. President, to my knowledge, the Clinton administration did not \nintroduce a resolution in the U.N. Security Council to selectively lift \nthe Bosnian arms embargo when the Bosnian Serbs attacked and overran \nthe safe areas just recently. I consider it unconscionable for the \nUnited Nations protected safe areas to be overrun, with the Bosnian \ndefenders being unable to defend because they are denied defensive \nweapons, and the United Nations is unwilling or unable to defend these \nsafe areas. We declared that policy last year in the authorization \nbill. We gave the President congressional instructions, short of a \nmandate, but instructions as to what should be done. It has not been \ndone.\n  The United States, our allies, and the United Nations have reached \nthe point in Bosnia of making a fundamental change in policy or \nbeginning to withdraw. A continuation of the present policy is a \nprescription for continued tragedy on the ground in Bosnia and \ncontinued erosion of U.N., NATO, and United States credibility in \nEurope and throughout the world.\n  The Clinton administration favors the continued presence of the U.N. \nforces in Bosnia, as well as a vigorous use of NATO air power to save \nthe remaining safe areas. But a number of fundamental questions about \nthis strategy remain unanswered.\n  First, have our NATO allies truly signed on to a substantial and \ndecisive use of air power, hitting lucrative targets, if Gorazde is \nattacked?\n  Second, is NATO willing to continue its air attacks as required, even \nif hostages are taken or the Serbs begin killing substantial numbers of \nU.N. personnel?\n  Third, are we protecting only Gorazde or are other safe areas \nincluded? If not, what does the term ``U.N. safe area'' mean at this \npoint in time when two have fallen and only one is clearly designated \nas being protected? Will the United Nations divide safe areas into \nthree classes--fallen safe areas, about-to-fall safe areas and safe-\nsafe areas? It appears that is taking place.\n  Fourth, does the so-called dual-key arrangement remain in effect? \nThis morning's New York Times reports from Brussels that British and \nFrench officials in NATO really do not want the United Nations to give \nup its dual key. If accurate, this would directly contradict the \nadministration's understanding and explanation of the London \nconference.\n  Fifth, if NATO and the United Nations really intend vigorous \nairstrikes, why are U.N. personnel not being moved out of harm's way, \nboth as a protective measure and as an indication of the dead \nseriousness of NATO's new resolve?\n  Sixth, if there is an allied diplomatic strategy to go along with its \nLondon policy, what is it? I have not seen it.\n  Will the United States continue to insist on a just settlement--I put \nthose words in quotes because they have been used so many times in both \neditorials and in debate--insist on a just settlement to the conflict, \nbut also remain unwilling to commit American resources for a just \nsettlement and remain unwilling to admit that there will never be a \njust settlement unless the United Nations and NATO are willing to \nimpose it by force?\n  That question is not simply for the administration, but for many in \nCongress, for many in the news media that keep talking about a just \nsettlement but never, ever, complete the logic that it requires the use \nof force to impose it. Otherwise, it is not going to happen. And the \nuse of force is most likely going to have to be outside force, \nincluding U.S. force.\n  Mr. President, these open questions make it clear to me that the \nUnited Nations, the NATO policy, and the U.S. Government altogether \nhave no coherent strategy regarding Bosnia.\n  To many Members of Congress, the Dole-Lieberman proposal is more \nattractive than the current policy, primarily because it has not yet \nbeen tried and tested. This proposal also is far from complete or \ncoherent. It has taken on a very large and, I believe, exaggerated \nsignificance, both by its supporters and by its critics, and many of \nits critics continue to describe it as it was last year without \nacknowledging it has changed.\n  A number of key questions are not answered or even acknowledged by \nthe Dole-Lieberman proposal that we will vote on this afternoon. I will \nadd quickly, that both Senators Dole and Lieberman have addressed some \nof these policies in their oral statements.\n  Most of these are not in any way part of this deliberation, because \nthey are not going to be voted on. It is not in the proposal.\n  First, there is a large question that must be answered by the \nsupporters of the Dole-Lieberman proposal, which encourages U.N. \nwithdrawal--and when we vote on it today, that is what we will be \ndoing. We will not mandate. We will be encouraging it. We will be \ngiving an incentive.\n  Are the supporters prepared to back President Clinton's public \ncommitment and private commitment to assist in the U.N. withdrawal with \nU.S. ground forces, if required? We are calling for the withdrawal. The \nPresident has said we will help the withdrawal, if it takes place, with \nground forces, if necessary.\n  But we ignore that question. We act like it does not exist. We act \nlike that is not even part of the equation, if we can simply vote on \nthe part we like here--lifting--but not face the implications of the \npart we do not like; that is, U.S. ground forces committed. The Dole-\nLieberman proposal's silence on this point, I am afraid, speaks loudly \nto the world.\n  Second, will the United States furnish equipment like artillery, \ntanks, and antitank weapons when the embargo is lifted? If we will not \ndo it directly, will we help facilitate that delivery? Will the allies \nalso lift the embargo? If they continue the embargo, will we forcibly \nbreak the embargo by delivering equipment? Will Russia unilaterally \nlift its embargo on Serbia, as it has said it will do over and over \nagain? If that is the case, will there be a net gain for the Bosnian \nGovernment?\n  Third, and perhaps more importantly, will the United States help \ntrain the Bosnian forces, or at least help facilitate the training? \nTraining is needed more than equipment. Equipment is part of the \nequation, and an important part, but training is sadly lacking. It has \nto take place. Someone has to do it. When will it take place? Where \nwill it take place? Who will do it? Will the United States help?\n  Silence on this key set of questions is what we have, and what we \nwill be voting on. Silence.\n  Fourth, do the authors of the Dole-Lieberman amendment envision \ndefensive or offensive equipment flowing to Bosnia, or both? \nUnderstandably but unfortunately, in order to secure votes for passage \nof the Dole-Lieberman amendment, it addresses these key questions--\ntraining, supplies, equipment--it addresses these key questions only by \nsilence, plus one paragraph. That is a negative paragraph on page 5, \nsection 4(e) which states as follows:\n\n       Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as \n     authorization for deployment of United States forces in the \n     territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina for any purpose, \n     including \n\n[[Page S10691]]\n     training, support, or delivery of military equipment.\n\n  That is what this says. We are not going to help them with training. \nWe are not going to help them with equipment. We have no authorization. \nWe will not let any American forces on the ground. All of this somehow \nwondrously is supposed to take place.\n  Fifth, considering the implication of this paragraph, who will \nprovide close air support to protect the few remaining safe areas when \nthe U.N. forces begin pulling out, as envisioned by the Dole-Lieberman \nbill? Who will have the forward air observers on the ground to \ndesignate targets for our aircraft if the United States conducts \nairstrikes to protect against Bosnian Serb offensives? And as the \nUnited Nations starts pulling out--and it will take anywhere from 7 \nweeks to 22 weeks--and the Bosnian Serbs go on the offensive, and there \nare no close air observers there plugged in, with training, with NATO \nequipment, how are we going to have airstrikes that go after targets \nunless they are fixed targets? We can go after fixed targets, but what \nabout the moving targets? Believe me, those on the attack will be \nmoving. Will we ask for British and French to provide the protection \nwhile the United Nations is pulling out prior to the lifting of the \nembargo and the necessary weeks of training of the Bosnian forces?\n  Again, these are unanswered questions.\n  Mr. President, I feel the Senate is faced with a choice between two \nincoherent policies. In these circumstances, our Nation would be better \noff if we made impassioned speeches and avoided passing a law.\n  The Dole-Lieberman amendment does not face up to the reality of the \nsituation on the ground where the Bosnian Serbs occupy between 70 and \n80 percent of the territory in Bosnia and have a decided advantage in \nheavy weapons.\n  Mr. President, I pointed out many flaws with the current policy and \nwith the Dole-Lieberman proposal. Even with these flaws, however, in \nthe legislative proposal, the Dole-Lieberman bill is much improved over \nthe earlier provisions.\n  It has been mischaracterized by the administration, our allies, and \nthe U.S. press. Yes, it requires a unilateral lifting of the Bosnian \narms embargo, but it does so only after the U.N. forces are withdrawn \nfrom Bosnia. It does not mandate that UNPROFOR withdraw from Bosnia. It \nplaces a responsibility upon the Government of Bosnia to make the \ndifficult choice of requesting that the United Nations withdraw its \nforces, with all the attendant consequences, including the loss of \nhumanitarian relief supplies, of such a withdrawal.\n  This is not going to be an easy decision for the Bosnian Government.\n  The Rapid Reaction Force, consisting of our French, British, and \nDutch allies, has deployed to the Sarajevo area with the intention of \ncountering Bosnian Serb attacks on U.N. forces there, including those \nU.N. forces who are escorting humanitarian relief convoys.\n  NATO is apparently determined to conduct robust air action to counter \nthe Bosnian Serbs' attack on Gorazde, a determination that will \nhopefully be extended to other safe areas, Bihac and others, if \nnecessary.\n  If these actions are carried out successfully, and if this bill is \nultimately enacted into law, the Bosnian Government will be faced with \na very difficult decision, a difficult decision that I do not believe \nwe can predict with certainty.\n  One choice they will have is to keep the United Nations in Bosnia, \nwhich means a continuation of the effort to protect the flow of \nhumanitarian relief supplies to the Bosnian people and some degree of \nprotection for at least the safe area of Gorazde and perhaps Sarajevo.\n  The other choice the Bosnian Government will face is to have the U.N. \nforces withdrawn and have the arms embargo lifted by the United States \nafter the U.N. forces are out of Bosnia, which may --I say may--result \nin their acquiring more heavy arms and equipment and may result in a \ncontinuation of air defense and airstrikes by the United States or some \nother nation.\n  Mr. President, there have been assertions over the last week or so \nthat various actions will Americanize the conflict in Bosnia. I think \nthose who say that about either the current policy or the Dole-\nLieberman amendment are accurate. In my view, with either policy choice \nwe are given today, there is a danger that the conflict will \nincreasingly be Americanized.\n  Mr. President, neither the current policy of the United Nations and \nNATO, nor the Dole-Lieberman approach, in my view, are coherent \npolicies.\n  The administration has worked diligently in the last few days to \nbring about change in the current policy in Bosnia. It has fallen short \nof the mark.\n  Mr. President, the United States, our allies, and the United Nations \nhave reached a critical juncture in Bosnia. I believe that the actions \nof UNPROFOR, particularly the actions of the Rapid Reaction Force to \nensure the delivery of humanitarian relief supplies to the people of \nSarajevo, and the actions of NATO to deter or, if necessary, repel \nattacks on Gorazde, and hopefully the other remaining safe areas, will \nin the final analysis, determine the outcome of the Dole-Lieberman \namendment. Not only the outcome as to whether it becomes law, but what \nhappens if it does become law, and what the Bosnian Government does \nwhen the ball is in its court.\n  When this bill passes, it will probably be accepted by the House of \nRepresentatives and sent to the President in the next few days. The \nPresident will undoubtedly, as he said, veto the Dole-Lieberman bill, \nand Congress will vote whether to override the President's veto.\n  Mr. President, in spite of its flaws, I will vote for the Dole-\nLieberman bill today even with all of its defects, as a way of \nexpressing my strong feeling on two key points: First, the current \nU.N.-NATO policy in Bosnia is a failure and, without dramatic change, \nwill continue to erode the credibility of the NATO alliance and the \nUnited States worldwide; second, the ability of the Bosnian Serbs to \noverrun the so-called safe areas without the United Nations taking \ndecisive steps to prevent that, and the commission of unlawful acts in \ncapturing the safe areas and in mistreating innocent civilians by the \nthousands clearly demonstrate that the continuation of the arms embargo \nis both untenable, immoral and unjustified.\n  Mr. President, this embargo should be lifted the way it was imposed--\nmultilaterally, and, in the final analysis, unilaterally, if absolutely \nnecessary. It is my hope that the Nunn amendment, which will express \nthat order of priorities, will pass when it is voted on in a few \nminutes, because it makes it clear that even though the odds are \nagainst the Security Council lifting the embargo multilaterally, we \nought to at least try to get it lifted multilaterally before we do so \nunilaterally. Otherwise, we will truly meet ourselves coming back, in \nterms of our embargo on Iraq, Libya, and perhaps other places in the \nworld as events unfold.\n  Mr. President, I believe that, even after this bill passes and after \nit goes to the President and after it is vetoed, if it is, I believe \nthat all of us--whichever side of this argument we are on or where we \nhave been--need to carefully review the developments on the ground in \nBosnia, and particularly the performance of the United Nations and NATO \nin the coming days.\n  I will decide and I will cast my vote on the inevitable question of \noverriding the President's veto, based upon these events that will \nunfold.\n  Mr. President, I yield back any remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I certainly wish to express to my good \nfriend and colleague of these many years my own appreciation for his \nsupporting the underlying measure by the distinguished majority leader \nand the Senator from Connecticut. The Senator from Georgia and I have \nworked in this arena for many, many years together. I have always had a \nprofound respect for his ability to get right to the heart of an issue \nand to express, irrespective of politics or partisan issues, what he \nthinks is in the best interests of the country. Again, I appreciate his \njoining here today.\n  I would like to see if I could clarify one part of my colleague's \nremarks. He addressed the rapid reaction force, \n\n[[Page S10692]]\nwhich today is reported to be taking positions in the Sarajevo area. If \nI understood the Senator, he felt how they carried out that mission \nmight well have a very strong bearing on the future of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. NUNN. That mission, as well as protecting the other safe areas as \ndesignated, as well as enforcing the other mandates that have thus far \nbeen rather ineffectively enforced; not solely that issue but including \nthat issue.\n  Mr. WARNER. But as I look through the press reports and other \ninformation that is available to the Senate, it is not clear to me the \nextent to which those rapid reaction forces augmenting the UNPROFOR \nforces in Sarajevo will be used for any mission other than protecting \nthe UNPROFOR forces in the carrying out of the mission, namely of \ndelivering food, medicine, and the like to that area.\n  Is it the Senator's understanding that they would participate in the \nprotection of the civilians if it is unrelated to the mission of \nUNPROFOR?\n  Mr. NUNN. I say to my friend from Virginia, I am not clear on that \npoint. I do not know that there is a clear policy.\n  Obviously, if you keep the road open, as those forces are pledged to \ndo, that helps the humanitarian mission of getting the supplies \nthrough. Whether they would respond to artillery shelling of the city \nif it does not hit U.N. personnel, I do not have an answer to that. It \nseems to me, when you have a safe haven and that safe haven is being \ngrossly violated, if it means anything at all it ought to be enforced. \nBut I do not have the knowledge to speak to what their intention is at \nthis point in time.\n  Obviously, the United States does not have forces there and this \nwould be a decision made by the United Nations and by our allies who \nhave forces on the ground.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is my understanding, that it is \ncertainly unclear at this point in time the extent to which they would \nengage in retaliating or defending or whatever word you wish to use, \nagainst these prolonged, continuous attacks on the Bosnian Serbs. I \njust hope the Senate, indeed others following this debate worldwide, do \nnot attach too much significance to the presence of those rapid \nreaction forces until such time as we have a much clearer idea as to \ntheir mission and their capabilities of carrying out that mission.\n  This is a relatively small number of combat arms that are being \nplaced in that area by the rapid reaction forces; in comparison to the \norder of battle, after the Bosnian Serbs.\n  Mr. NUNN. I say to my friend from Virginia, he may be right on that. \nI think we will have to wait and see how the events unfold.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Nunn amendment \nto the Dole-Lieberman substitute to S. 21. The Nunn amendment \nrecognizes that it is the Bosnian Serbs who have rejected the agreement \nreached by the contact group. The amendment also places the \nresponsibility of seeking a multilateral lift of the arms embargo on \nthe administration. Failing an agreement of the U.N. Security Council \nto multilaterally lift the arms embargo, the United States has no \nalternative but to unilaterally lift the arms embargo, pending a \nwithdrawal of UNPROFOR.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we are about to vote, and I would like, \nsimply, to summarize, as best I can, the situation as many of us \nunderstand it to be this afternoon.\n  As we begin, I think there is much about which there is complete \nagreement. We all agree that the current situation is horrifying--the \nethnic cleansing, the violence, the violation of human rights, pictures \non television, all of which we believe we simply should not tolerate. \nWe all agree that the status quo is untenable. Zepa fell yesterday, and \nthere continues to be Serbian aggression in areas throughout Bosnia \nthat we are simply unwilling to accept. We all agree that lifting the \nembargo is desirable. And we agree that the Bosnians ought to be able \nto defend themselves. We agree on all of those points. I do not think \nthere is a Senator in the Chamber who would disagree on any of that.\n  The issue before us is not a question of if we lift the embargo, but \nhow. How do we lift it so we can enable the Bosnians to fight for \nthemselves but protect our other vital United States interests as well? \nThat is the issue.\n  We have a number of specific questions relating to this embargo that \ngo beyond enabling the Bosnians to help themselves, and on that issue, \nthe question of how we keep in balance, in proper perspective, all of \nthese various aspects of the decision. I am afraid our decisions are \nbeing driven as much by emotions as they are by the facts, as they are \nby the cool consideration of the consequences of lifting the embargo \nunilaterally this afternoon.\n  That is understandable. We see the Serbian atrocities and we want to \nrespond. We see a one-sided war spreading day by day, and by all that \nis right we want to scream, ``Enough. Enough.'' We want to be able to \nhelp in some way, because all too often countries have stood by while \natrocities of this kind have been perpetrated. And we want no part of \nthat.\n  We are united by that outrage, by that contempt. We are united by the \nresolve to do something more. And I understand that, as does every \nSenator in the Chamber this afternoon.\n  What divides us, what really divides us, is how best to transform \nresolve into action. Really, the question is, as we try to come to some \nagreement as to what our action ought to be--the question is, do we \ngive NATO and the United Nations one more chance to succeed? Do we give \nthem one more chance to act to stop Serb aggression before we lift the \nembargo? Or must we lift it right now, unilaterally?\n  The President has made himself very clear. The President has urged us \nto give our united efforts that chance. The President has urged us to \nrecognize the purpose of our alliances, to demonstrate our commitment \nto multilateral efforts. How many times have we said to the United \nNations and to other members of the world community: We need your help. \nWe need your cooperation. We need your participation?\n  How many times did we send people to Britain and to France and to \ncountries all over the world during the Persian Gulf war saying, ``Help \nus, this is a united effort''? How many times did we go to other \ncountries and say, ``We have to put some constraints on Libya, or on \nCuba''? And will we, at some point in the future, go to our allies and \nsay, ``We need your help with North Korea, with China''?\n  That is what the President is asking us to bear in mind as we make \nthe decision we must this afternoon. The choice is clear. Recognizing \nour desire to lift the embargo, do we give this effort another chance, \nrecognizing that progress has been made in the last few days? \nRecognizing that, at some point, time does run out, do we allow them \nthe opportunity to demonstrate, with whatever resolve we can muster, \nthat in the remaining weeks before winter sets in that we use all of \nthe muscle, all of the force, all of the resolve that we in a united \nway can muster, or face the consequences of unilateral action which \ncould lead this country to great peril and, frankly, to very disturbing \nprecedents?\n  A unilateral lift means in large measure unilateral responsibility. A \nunilateral lift means accelerated deployment of U.S. forces, and on \nthat there can be no question. If we lift, they leave. If we lift, we \nhelp them leave. If we lift, we are there, and the action spreads. And \nthen what? A unilateral lift means the possibility of the \ndisintegration of NATO.\n  What do we tell our NATO allies, that this organization, which has \nstood now for 50 years--ironically we celebrated that anniversary this \nyear--what do we tell them the next time they come to us or we go to \nthem? ``Well, as long as everything is going OK, as long as it is \ncomfortable for us, we will join you. But, you know, if things get \nrough, if we disagree with you, we have the right to say NATO does not \nmatter anymore. NATO is not going to be an alliance. We are going to \npick and choose for ourselves whether or not and when we want to be \ninvolved in NATO.''\n  Do we really want to send that message to our NATO allies? Do we \nreally want to say NATO does not count? Do we really want to suffer the \nconsequences of a disintegrated NATO \n\n[[Page S10693]]\nwith all that is going on in Europe today?\n  A unilateral lift means the demise of other multilateral embargoes. \nLet there be no mistake about that either. I do not know how we tell \nour allies we still need them in the Persian Gulf, we still need them \nin Libya, and, by the way, we do not want you to send anything to Cuba. \nHow do we say that with a straight face, Mr. President?\n  A unilateral lift could dramatically undermine our President and this \ncountry's credibility. If we roll over the President this afternoon, \nthen what? ``Go out there, Mr. President. We are united, Democrats and \nRepublicans. We want you, as the Commander in Chief and as the \narticulator of foreign policy, to go do your thing. We are just going \nto roll over you when we decide we do not like what you are doing.''\n  What kind of standing is this country going to have with all of the \nworld? We have one President at a time. We have one Commander in Chief \nat a time. We have a State Department that we delegate responsibility \nto, to create foreign policy.\n  A unilateral lift, Mr. President, unfortunately may not even work; \narms may not even get through. We are talking here about 3 months \nbefore anything actually reaches Bosnia. That assumes that we can get \nthrough Croatia, that the Croatian ports will be open, that the lines \nwill be available to us. It means that somehow we have all that worked \nout but our allies, after we have ignored their pleas, are going to \nagree to end the embargo and allow our supplies to get through into \nBosnia.\n  Then, what if arms are not enough? What if our allies have gone? What \nhappens then, Mr. President? What happens when we find out 6, 8 months \nfrom now that this did not work, and our allies are gone and the \nhorrific acts that we see on television right now are continuing? What \nhappens then when the Bosnians come to us and say, ``We need your help; \nyou have seen what we have seen on television, and we cannot tolerate \nthis.''?\n  Will we send troops to stop the spread of the war to Macedonia or \nKosovo, or, God forbid, Turkey or Greece? What then? Are we still going \nto make these courageous speeches about how horrifying and difficult it \nis for the Bosnians? Will we be willing then to rush to their support?\n  Mr. President, this is not a time to divorce ourselves from a united \neffort. Let us make a decision based upon what comes not only from our \nhearts but from our efforts as well. Let us vote ``no'' on this \nresolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as I understood last night we had about 15 \nminutes. I would be happy to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut, Senator Lieberman.\n  Mr. President, I have listened with great care to the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, and I have a lot of respect for him. But I do not \nthink the world is going to collapse if we do the right thing. That is \nwhat it is all about. NATO is going to collapse? Our allies are going \nto leave us? They are not going to leave us. We are the leader of the \nfree world. But we have not acted like it in this instance. But we are. \nWe did not act like it in the last administration--but we are--when it \ncame to Bosnia.\n  So I am not as troubled about the world coming apart here, now, if \nthe Senate does what it should have done months and months ago, and \nmaybe a couple of years ago. This is not about rolling over the \nPresident. This is about the Senate of the United States. It is about \nRepublicans and Democrats with a shared common view--and some on each \nside, I might add.\n  I believe we do not have many opportunities like this to sort of turn \naway from the historic failure and chart a new path for America. It \ndoes not have to do with the U.S. Senate. And I know it is a difficult \nvote for my colleagues on the other side with a President of their \nparty. And I commend those who have stood up and said, ``We are going \nto do the right thing.''\n  This is not politics. This is not about President Clinton or \nPresident Bush or anybody in the Senate. It is not the Dole amendment \nor the Lieberman amendment. This is a message from the U.S. Senate, \nsupported, I might say, by dozens and dozens of groups all across \nAmerica. And without reading all the groups, the Action Council for \nPeace in the Balkans, Americans for Saving Bosnia, America Council for \nPublic Affairs, American Jewish Conference, American Muslim Council, \nAmerican Task Force on Bosnia, and on and on it goes.\n  Then the Action Council for Peace in the Balkans, represented by \noutstanding Americans, Democrats and Republicans, Morris Abrams, Frank \nCarlucci, Hodding Carter, Max Kampelman, Frank Fahrenkoph, Richard \nBurt, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and that list goes on and \non. Albert Wohlstetter, Paul Wolfowitz, John Silber, Albert Shanker--\nDemocrats and Republicans, conservatives and liberals, who I guess \nbelieve the people have a right to defend themselves, even if they are \na little, tiny country with no lobbyist running around the Congress. \nThey will not be affected by what we did yesterday on lobbying reform. \nThey do not have any.\n  We get long-distance calls, overseas calls, from the prime minister \nand the foreign minister, and they called yesterday. And as they were \ncalling, they were telling us that Zepa was about to fall, and it did.\n  So it seems to me that what we ought to be doing here is the very \nresponsible, right thing--a nonpartisan, nonpolitical, bipartisan \nmessage to the world, not just to Bosnia--that if you are an \nindependent nation, if you are a member of the United Nations, as the \nSenator from New York so eloquently stated yesterday, you have a right \nto self-defense. You do not have a right to American troops. You do not \nhave a right to American air power. You do not have a right to American \nanything. But you have a right to self-defense. And that is what this \ndebate is all about.\n  We are a big country. They are a small country. And I guess it would \nbe good if Bosnia would just go away. If they would just surrender, our \nproblems would end for a while until somebody starts writing the \nhistory of this era.\n  It would be a stain on the West, almost. Well, maybe not almost. It \nwould recall previous stains on the West when we stood by and watched \nthe genocide in World War II.\n  Call it ethnic cleansing, call it anything you want. The Senator from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry, said we are going to abandon Bosnia. We \nare not going to abandon Bosnia. We are going to do what we have been \ntold by their elected officials they want us to do, lift the arms \nembargo.\n  And again, I know that things do change. But I remember in 1992, \ncandidate Clinton said lift the arms embargo and have air strikes; let \nus provide some leadership, he was saying to President Bush, who was \nfairly quiet on this issue himself. Lift the arms embargo. And I \nremember going to meetings at the White House in, I think, April and \nMay of 1993. It was all for that purpose. The President was for it. The \nVice President was for it. This Senator was for it. But I must say, \nthere was a mixed group there, as we do have from time to time. We get \nmixed advice. The President got mixed advice that said: Do not do it; \ndo not get involved.\n  This is an immoral and unjust policy that we have in effect now. They \nought to take away the key from Boutros Boutros-Ghali, lock the door \nand throw away the key as far as he is concerned. They are not even \ncertain yet; they are still debating whether or not we have the dual-\nkey approach, whether anything can ever be done by NATO without U.N. \napproval. I think NATO is in difficulty because nobody can find a \nmission. Without a mission, why are they there? And they are troubled \nby this. I have been there. I have talked to them. And I have heard \nthem all tell us the same thing: Do not lift the arms embargo. The U.N. \nprotection forces are doing the best they can.\n  And they are, and they should be commended. Some have lost their \nlives. They are our friends and they are our allies. But we are the \nleader of the free world. We cannot abdicate that responsibility. We \ncannot abdicate that leadership and say, well, not this time; we want \nto pass on Bosnia. This is a \n\n[[Page S10694]]\nEuropean problem. So we go along with the Europeans until it fails.\n  They tell all the Bosnians we are going to have these six nice safe \nhavens for you. You give up your heavy equipment. You are not going to \nneed it. This is safe.\n  So they give up their heavy equipment. Now they have rifles to fire \nagainst tanks and artillery weapons. And how many safe havens is it \ngoing to take to get anybody's attention? How many are going to fall? \nTwo already, two more in danger, Sarajevo and Bihac. How many more--\nall? Four? Five? Six? And then suddenly we recognize that this must be \na failed policy?\n  We have had a lot of activity in London and Brussels. We have had a \nlot of pounding the table and demanding the Serbs do this and do that, \nand they did it. They just took another safe haven. They are scared to \ndeath.\n  I was asked on a program last evening, and I do not mean it to sound \nlike this, but I think the person asked the question, well, they are \nnot killing as many people now so there must be something good coming \nout of it. And maybe the killing has been reduced as far as numbers. \nThere were only 630 casualties in July, 130 killed. An average of 4 or \n5 are killed daily, 12 and 15 are wounded, and last weekend 7 children \nwere killed.\n  Now, does that mean we have to rush in and help everyone because we \nare the world's policeman? Absolutely not. But it seems to me--and I am \nnot an expert in foreign policy--that this country ought to have a \nright through its elected leaders to say to us: It is time to go, U.N. \nprotection forces. When they leave, lift the arms embargo and let us \ndefend ourselves.\n  It always seemed to me that was sort of a basic right, an inherent \nright that all Americans enjoyed, and all Americans would defend \nsomebody else's right to defend themselves or some nation's right to \ndefend itself. And suddenly it is all mixed up.\n  The House, by a vote of 3 to 1, has sent the world a message. I know \nit is tough for the British, and it is tough for the French. I have \ntalked to the Prime Minister, and I have talked to the President of \nFrance. They are our allies, and they are our friends. We have been \ntheir friends in tough, tough times, and we have provided the manpower \nand the money and the weapons.\n  Now, there have been a lot of efforts to muddy the waters and say, \nboy, if you do this, you are going to Americanize the war.\n  That is one I cannot fathom. I have talked to Senator McCain about \nit. I do not know how you Americanize the war. If you withdraw the \nprotection forces and lift the arms embargo, the Democratic leader said \nas sure as that happens, there are going to be American troops there.\n  Who said so? I assume the President would come to Congress. They are \nnot asking us to die for Bosnia. They are asking us to give them a \nchance to defend themselves and they will do the dying for their \ncountry. They are not asking for American ground troops. Oh, they would \nlike some air cover, but they are not even asking for that.\n  The amendment before us is very important. This amendment does not \nprohibit United States assistance to Bosnia, military or financial. I \nwould say, since Soviet-style weaponry is the preponderance of what the \nBosnians use, certainly we would not be providing the bulk of the arms. \nI think we can find some consensus if we pass this resolution and if a \nveto is overridden.\n  This amendment also does not prevent the United States from seeking a \nmultilateral lifting of the arms embargo in the U.N. Security Council. \nI do not happen to believe that the amendment by the Senator from \nGeorgia is necessary. I know he has offered it in good faith, just as \nhe did offer an amendment last August in good faith, but I do not \nbelieve it is necessary. I do not think it detracts much from the \nresolution. It does not add much to the resolution.\n  On August 10, 1994, President Clinton sent a letter to the \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia which stated:\n\n       I am writing to reaffirm my administration's support for \n     lifting the international arms embargo on Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina . . . It has been my long-held view that the arms \n     embargo has unfairly and unintentionally penalized the victim \n     in this conflict, and the Security Council should act to \n     remedy this injustice.\n\n  That was President Clinton's statement a year ago about lifting the \narms embargo. The letter goes on to state:\n\n       In this regard, if by October 15--\n\n  This was last year--\n\n     the Bosnian Serbs have not accepted the contact group's \n     proposal of July 6, 1994--\n\n  Which, I might add, the Bosnians did accept--\n\n     it would be my intention within 2 weeks to introduce formally \n     and support a resolution at the United Nations Security \n     Council to terminate the arms embargo on Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina.\n       Further, as my administration has indicated previously, if \n     the Security Council for some reason fails to pass such a \n     resolution within a reasonable time, it would be my intention \n     to consult with the Congress thereafter regarding unilateral \n     termination of the arms embargo.\n\n  Those are all President Clinton's words.\n  I believe that 9 months is more than a reasonable time, with all the \natrocities, all the things we have witnessed, as the Democratic leader \nsaid. I listened to the Democratic leader last night on C-SPAN, and I \nhave listened to others. I listened to the remarkable statement made by \nthe Senator from Delaware last evening, Mr. Biden, and many, many \nothers on both sides of the aisle. I have listened to Senator Warner \nfrom Virginia, who has had a different view of this issue up until now, \nand he has told us in very vivid terms why he now holds the view that a \ngreat majority do.\n  So I just ask the question, Is the leadership to say, ``Well, we've \ngot a failed policy but we have to stick to it and we should not \npersuade our allies it is a failed policy''? It might be embarrassing \nfor the British to have to leave, or it might be embarrassing for the \nFrench to have to leave. And America is going to be blamed if they \nleave. We are being blamed right now. We are being blamed right now, \nbut, as I said, we may be blamed more in the history books for what did \nnot happen.\n  The opposition is also saying, the Dole-Lieberman bill will \nAmericanize the war--America will be alone in providing assistance to \nthe Bosnians.\n  Mr. President, that is simply not the case. We know that most of the \nmembers of the United Nations support lifting the arms embargo on \nBosnia. Going first does not mean going it alone.\n  Mr. President, finally, the opposition to Dole-Lieberman is saying \nthat this bill abandons Bosnia. In my view, this is truly twisted \nlogic. I believe that at this very moment the Bosnians feel abandoned. \nThe issue is not how many troops are on the ground or how many planes \nare in the air, but what these troops and planes are doing. It seems to \nme that if they are doing nothing, the Bosnians feel abandoned. Let us \nface it, these forces are essentially bystanders as events in \nSrebrenica painfully demonstrated.\n  If we are worried about abandoning the Bosnians, let us listen to the \nBosnians. Ask the Bosnians if they feel abandoned by this legislation. \nThe truth is, the Bosnian Government strongly supports this \nlegislation. They know the price they are paying. They know the price \nthey are willing to pay.\n  In conclusion, I would urge my fellow colleagues to support this \nlegislation. I would urge them to search their consciences. The U.S. \nSenate has the historic opportunity to make a difference. To do what is \nright. To let the Bosnians live defending themselves, rather than die \ndefenseless.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from over 40 \norganizations in support of this bill, along with a letter of strong \nsupport from Lady Margaret Thatcher be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 25, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: We are writing to urge you to vote YES on the \n     Dole-Lieberman bill (S.21) to end the U.S. arms embargo \n     against the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina. We also urge you to sign on as a co-sponsor of \n     the bill and to recruit your colleagues as co-sponsors.\n       The war in Bosnia is now well into its fourth year. Over \n     200,000 civilians have been brutally murdered by Serbian \n     forces, tens of thousands of women raped, and almost three \n     million people have been forced to flee their homes and \n     villages. Serbian forces have been able to carry out their \n     genocidal assault on Bosnia with virtual impunity because of \n     an immoral arms embargo that denies the legitimate government \n     of Bosnia the means to exercise its inherent right to self \n     defense.\n       The response of the United Nations to the aggression has \n     been to send poorly armed \n\n[[Page S10695]]\n     peacekeepers, even though there is no peace to keep. In recent weeks, \n     Serbian forces have been allowed to overrun two of the six \n     UN-declared ``safe areas,'' and the UN mission has approached \n     total collapse. The lesson we must learn is that only the \n     Bosnian Army has the will and the manpower to defend the \n     fledgling multi-ethnic democracy and its citizens against \n     further attacks.\n       It is also clear that ultra-nationalist Serbian leaders \n     have no interest in negotiating while they can accomplish \n     their military and political objectives by attacking Bosnia's \n     remaining civilian population. Until the Bosnian Army can \n     mount a credible defense on the ground, this cowardly war of \n     aggression will continue. And we must live in the knowledge \n     that, at least in part, we are responsible for tying the \n     hands of the victims.\n       The organizations listed below represent a wide range of \n     religious, humanitarian, student, and citizen advocacy \n     groups. Some of the names will be familiar to you; others \n     have been formed in recent months by voters outraged by the \n     genocide and our feeble and immoral response to it. We have \n     joined together today to ask for your support for the Dole-\n     Lieberman bill. The U.S. and its allies, NATO, and the UN \n     have failed to stop the aggression. Unless Congress acts--and \n     acts NOW--thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, more innocent \n     people will die and the price of eventually confronting this \n     aggression will continue to rise.\n       By voting for Dole-Lieberman, you will be taking a clear \n     stand against genocide, against aggression, against \n     appeasement, and for an honorable and sustainable peace in \n     Bosnia. You will be rejecting the failed policies of European \n     countries that have facilitated more than three years of \n     genocide. You will be voting for the one policy that makes \n     moral, political, and military sense.\n       Vote Yes on the Dole-Lieberman bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                         national organizations\n\n       Action Council for Peace in the Balkans.\n       American Committee to Save Bosnia.\n       American Council for Public Affairs.\n       American Jewish Congress.\n       American Muslin Council.\n       American Task Force for Bosnia.\n       B'nai B'rith.\n       Federation of Reconstructionist Congregations and Havurot.\n       Islamic Network.\n       Muslim Public Affairs Council.\n       National Association of Arab Americans.\n       National Federation of Croatian Americans.\n       National Jewish Community Relations Advisory Council.\n       Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association.\n       Union of American Hebrew Congregations.\n\n\n                        grassroots organizations\n\n       American Bosnian & Hercegovinian Association.\n       Americans for Bosnian Orphans.\n       Ann Arbor Committee for Bosnia.\n       Bosnia Advocates of Metrowest.\n       Bosnia Briefings.\n       Bosnia Support Committee of D.C.\n       Bosnia Task Force, San Diego.\n       Bosnia-Hezegovinian Help Organization.\n       California Coalition Against Ethnic Cleansing.\n       Coalition Against Genocide.\n       Coalition for Intervention Against Genocide.\n       Connecticut Citizens Against Genocide.\n       Free Bosnia Action Group.\n       Friends of Bosnia (W.

The UN and NATO have \n     failed to enforce the Security Council Resolutions which \n     authorized the use of force to defend the safe havens and to \n     get humanitarian assistance through. The safe havens were \n     never safe; now they are falling to Serb assault. Murder, \n     ethnic cleansing, mass rape and torture are the legacy of the \n     policy of the last three years to the people of Bosnia. It \n     has failed utterly. We owe it to the victims at last and at \n     least to have the weapons to defend themselves--since we \n     ourselves are not willing to defend them.\n       The arms embargo was always morally wrong. Significantly, \n     it was imposed on the (then formally intact but fragmenting) \n     former Yugoslavia at that regime's own behest. It was then, \n     quite unjustly and possibly illegally, applied to the \n     successor states. Its effect--and, as regards the Serbs, its \n     intention--was to ensure that the proponents of a Greater \n     Serbia, who inherited the great bulk of the Yugoslav army's \n     equipment, enjoyed overwhelming military superiority in their \n     aggression. It is worth recalling that the democratically \n     elected, multi-faith and multi-ethnic Bosnian Government \n     never asked for a single UN soldier to be sent. It did ask \n     for the arms required to defend its own people against a \n     ruthless aggressor. That request was repeatedly denied, in \n     spite of the wishes of the US administration and of most \n     leading American politicians.\n       There is no point now in listing the failures of military \n     policy which subsequently occurred. Suffice it to say that, \n     instead of succeeding in enforcing the mandates the UN \n     Security Council gave them, UNPROFOR became potential and \n     then actual hostages. Airpower was never seriously employed \n     either. The oft repeated arguments against lifting the arms \n     embargo--that if it occurred UN troops would be at risk, that \n     the enclaves like Srebrenica would fall, that the Serbs would \n     abandon all restraint--have all now been proved worthless. \n     For all these things have happened and the arms embargo still \n     applies.\n       Two arguments are, however, still advanced by those who \n     wish to keep the arms embargo in place. Each is demonstrably \n     false.\n       First, it is said that lifting the arms embargo would \n     prolong the war in Bosnia. This is, of course, a morally \n     repulsive argument; for it implies that all we should care \n     about is a quick end to the conflict without regard to the \n     justice or otherwise of its outcome. But in any case it is \n     based on the false assumption that the Serbs are bound to \n     win. Over the last year in Bosnian army has grown much \n     stronger and the Bosnian Serbs weaker. The Bosnian army has, \n     with its Croat allies, been winning back crucial territory, \n     while desertion and poor morale are badly affecting the over-\n     extended Serb forces. What the Bosnian government lacks \n     however are the tanks and artillery needed to hold the \n     territory won and force the Serbs to negotiate. This lack of \n     equipment is directly the result of the arms embargo. Because \n     of it the war is being prolonged and the casualties are \n     higher. Lifting the arms embargo would thus shorten not \n     lengthen the war.\n       Second, it is said that lifting the arms embargo would lead \n     to rifts within the UN Security Council and NATO. But are \n     there not rifts already? And are these themselves not the \n     result of pursuing a failed policy involving large risks to \n     outside countries' ground troops, rather than arming and \n     training the victims to repel the aggressor? American \n     leadership is vital to bring order out of the present chaos. \n     No country must be allowed to veto the action required to end \n     the present catastrophe. And if American leadership is truly \n     evident along the lines of the policy which you and your \n     colleagues are advancing I do not believe that any country \n     will actually try to obstruct it.\n       The West has already waited too long. Time is now terribly \n     short. All those who care about peace and justice for the \n     tragic victims of aggression in the former Yugoslavia now \n     have their eyes fixed on the actions of the US Senate. I \n     hope, trust and pray that your initiative to have the arms \n     embargo against Bosnia lifted succeeds. It will bring new \n     hope to those who are suffering so much.\n       With warm regards.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                Margaret Thatcher.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I will just conclude by saying this is not a partisan \ndiscussion. It is not a partisan debate. It is not about Democrats and \nRepublicans, not about philosophy. It is not about politics. It is \nabout whether some small country that has been ravaged on all sides, \npillaged, women raped, children killed, do they have any rights in this \nworld? Do they have a right to say to these big countries like France \nand Great Britain and America that it is time to go, ``Let us fight and \ndie for ourselves.'' That is what this is all about. They have said our \namendment is simple. It is simple. That is what it does.\n  Maybe I missed something in my lifetime, but I have never missed the \npoint that people have a right to defend themselves. And if we stand in \ntheir way, and if more are killed and more are raped and more little \nboys 12 years old are taken off to camps and more are hung on trees and \nmore throats are cut because we imposed our will on this little \ncountry--``You cannot do this because we do not want you to do this.'' \nIt is their country. It is their lives, their blood.\n  I think it is time for a change in policy. And I hope we will have a \nresounding vote in favor of the Dole-Lieberman resolution.\n  I want to congratulate and commend my friend from Connecticut for his \ntireless efforts, nonpartisan, going back--I think we worked together \nl\\1/2\\ years on this issue, without any disagreement, never talking \nabout the political advantage. This is not about \n\n[[Page S10696]]\npolitics; it is about life or death for a little country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell).

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bosnia and Herzegovina Self-\n     Defense Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) For the reasons stated in section 520 of the Foreign \n     Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 \n     (Public Law 103-236), the Congress has found that continued \n     application of an international arms embargo to the \n     Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina contravenes that \n     Government's inherent right of individual or collective self-\n     defense under Article 51 of the United National Charter and \n     therefore is inconsistent with international law.\n       (2) The United States has not formally sought multilateral \n     support for terminating the arms embargo against Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina through a vote on a United Nations Security \n     Council resolution since the enactment of section 1404 of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 \n     (Public Law 103-337).\n       (3) The United Nations Security Council has not taken \n     measures necessary to maintain international peace and \n     security in Bosnia and Herzegovina since the aggression \n     against that country began in April 1992.\n\n[[Page S10697]]\n\n       (4) The Contact Group, composed of representatives of the \n     United States, Russia, France, Great Britain, and Germany, \n     has since July 1994 maintained that in the event of \n     continuing rejection by the Bosnian Serbs of the Contact \n     Group's proposal for Bosnia and Herzegovina, a decision in \n     the United Nations Security Council to lift the Bosnian arms \n     embargo as a last resort would be unavoidable.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF SUPPORT.\n\n       The Congress supports the efforts of the Government of the \n     Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina--\n       (1) to defend its people and the territory of the Republic;\n       (2) to preserve the sovereignty, independence, and \n     territorial integrity of the Republic; and\n       (3) to bring about a peaceful, just, fair, viable, and \n     sustainable settlement of the conflict in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina.\n\n     SEC. 4. TERMINATION OF ARMS EMBARGO.\n\n       (a) Termination.--The President shall terminate the United \n     States arms embargo of the Government of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina, as provided in subsection (b), following--\n       (1) receipt by the United States Government of a request \n     from the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina for termination \n     of the United States arms embargo and submission by the \n     Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in exercise of its \n     sovereign rights as a nation, of a request to the United \n     Nations Security Council for the departure of UNPROFOR from \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina; or\n       (2) a decision by the United Nations Security Council, or \n     decisions by countries contributing forces to UNPROFOR, to \n     withdraw UNPROFOR from Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       (b) Implementation of Termination.--The President may \n     implement termination of the United States arms embargo of \n     the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina pursuant to \n     subsection (a) prior to the date of completion of the \n     withdrawal of UNPROFOR personnel from Bosnia and Herzegovina, \n     but shall, subject to subsection (c), implement termination \n     of the embargo pursuant to that subsection no later than the \n     earlier of--\n       (1) the date of completion of the withdrawal of UNPROFOR \n     personnel from Bosnia and Herzegovina; or\n       (2) the date which is 12 weeks after the date of submission \n     by the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina of a request to \n     the United Nations Security Council for the departure of \n     UNPROFOR from Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       (c) Presidential Waiver Authority.--If the President \n     determines and reports in advance to Congress that the \n     safety, security, and successful completion of the withdrawal \n     of UNPROFOR personnel from Bosnia and Herzegovina in \n     accordance with subsection (b)(2) requires more time than the \n     period provided for in that subsection, the President may \n     extend the time period available under subsection (b)(2) for \n     implementing termination of the United States arms embargo of \n     the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina for a period of up \n     to 30 days. The authority in this subsection may be exercised \n     to extend the time period available under subsection (b)(2) \n     for more than one 30-day period.\n       (d) Presidential Reports.--Within 7 days of the \n     commencement of the withdrawal of UNPROFOR from Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina, and every 14 days thereafter, the President \n     shall report in writing to the President pro tempore of the \n     Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives on the \n     status and estimated date of completion of the withdrawal \n     operation. If any such report includes an estimated date of \n     completion of the withdrawal which is later than 12 weeks \n     after commencement of the withdrawal operation, the report \n     shall include the operational reasons which prevent the \n     completion of the withdrawal within 12 weeks of commencement.\n       (e) International Policy.--If the Government of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina submits a request to the United Nations Security \n     Council for the departure of UNPROFOR from Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina or if the United Nations Security Council or the \n     countries contributing forces to UNPROFOR decide to withdraw \n     from Bosnia and Herzegovina, as provided in subsection (a), \n     the President (or his representative) shall immediately \n     introduce and support in the United Nations Security Council \n     a resolution to terminate the application of United Nations \n     Security Council resolution 713 to the Government of Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina. The United States shall insist on a vote on \n     the resolution by the Security Council. The resolution shall, \n     at a minimum, provide for the termination of the \n     applicability of United Nations Security Council resolution \n     713 to the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina no later than \n     the completion of the withdrawal of UNPROFOR personnel from \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the event the United Nations \n     Security Council fails to adopt the resolution to terminate \n     the application of United Nations Security Council resolution \n     713 to the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina because of a \n     lack of unanimity of the permanent members, thereby failing \n     to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of \n     international peace and security, the United States shall \n     promptly endeavor to bring the issue before the General \n     Assembly for decision as provided for in the Assembly's \n     Uniting for Peace Resolution of 1950.\n       (f) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     interpreted as authorization for deployment of United States \n     forces in the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina for any \n     purpose, including training, support, or delivery of military \n     equipment.\n       (g) Definitions.--As used in this section--\n       (1) the term ``United States arms embargo of the Government \n     of Bosnia and Herzegovina'' means the application to the \n     Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina of--\n       (A) the policy adopted July 10, 1991, and published in the \n     Federal Register of July 19, 1991 (58 FR 33322) under the \n     heading ``Suspension of Munitions Export Licenses to \n     Yugoslavia''; and\n       (B) any similar policy being applied by the United States \n     Government as of the date of completion of withdrawal of \n     UNPROFOR personnel from Bosnia and Herzegovina, pursuant to \n     which approval is denied for transfers of defense articles \n     and defense services to the former Yugoslavia; and\n       (2) the term ``completion of the withdrawal of UNPROFOR \n     personnel from Bosnia and Herzegovina'' means the departure \n     from the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina of substantially \n     all personnel participating in UNPROFOR and substantially all \n     other personnel assisting in their withdrawal, within a \n     reasonable period of time, without regard to whether the \n     withdrawal was initiated pursuant to a request by the \n     Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a decision by the \n     United Nations Security Council, or decisions by countries \n     contributing forces to UNPROFOR, but the term does not \n     include such personnel as may remain in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina pursuant to an agreement between the Government \n     of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the government of any country \n     providing such personnel.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I just wish to echo the many accolades I \nhave heard paid to the distinguished majority leader for his leadership \non this issue over a period of years. He has been unwavering in his \ndetermination, together with our distinguished colleague, the junior \nSenator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, with strong staff support \nprovided by Mira Baratta, who has worked on this tirelessly now for \nyears, Randy Scheunemann, Ron Marks, John Lilley, of the staff of \nSenator Lieberman, and Mrs. Ansley on my staff. Together, we have been \nable to present this in a very fair and objective and nonpartisan way.\n  I wish to extend my appreciation to those staff members and the \ndistinguished majority leader and the Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/26/senate-section/article/S10680-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10697-S10699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RYAN WHITE CARE REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We are prepared to move along in terms of the \namendments.\n  We had opening statements and discussion on last Friday.\n  I see my friend and colleague from California, who wishes to address \nthe Senate on this issue. But I would like to indicate at least to our \nside that we are prepared to consider amendments. This measure has been \non the calendar for some period of time. We have some 63 cosponsors.\n  We are, as we have said, prepared to deal with various amendments, \nand we hope we will have some brief comments in terms of whatever \npeople's views are about the legislation and then we can get down to \ndealing with the amendments.\n  So I would yield the floor at this time.\n  \n[[Page S10698]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nRyan White CARE Reauthorization Act, and in so doing I would very much \nlike to thank the Labor and Human Resources Committee.\n  I would like to thank its distinguished chairman, the Senator from \nKansas, and the ranking member, the Senator from Massachusetts. And I \nmust say, to the credit of this committee, this reauthorization bill is \nreported to the full floor unanimously.\n  Mr. President, Ryan White affects 42 cities--7 in my State--and all \n50 States. It costs $630 million, and it provides 350,000 people with \nservices they would not be able to get, otherwise, outside of a \nhospital. It has dramatically reduced the overall cost of the health \ncare delivery system.\n  Let me give you some examples of how Ryan White funding has helped \ncommunities in my State. In California, through use of its Ryan White \ntitle II funds, the State has reported a 50-percent reduction in \nhospital stays resulting in over $21 million in cost savings.\n  In San Francisco, Project Open Hand delivers a meal to 1,200 \nhomebound people every day. This is accomplished through the efforts of \n2,400 volunteer drivers and food preparers.\n  In Los Angeles, the AIDS Health Care Foundation, which is the largest \nAIDS organization in California, annually serves approximately 2,400 \npeople living with HIV and AIDS at outpatient clinics. Last year it \nprovided a final home to over 250 hospice residents.\n  In San Diego, the AIDS Foundation uses its Ryan White funding to \nprovide a full range of outpatient clinical and social services to \npeople with AIDS.\n  Let me say that, increasingly, the majority of new cases served under \nthe Ryan White Act are in rural areas. Increasingly they are women, \nthey are minorities, and they are children. And I think the lesson in \nthis is that AIDS really knows no gender or sexual orientation. It is a \nreal and major threat, and, as such, this act is very important in its \ntreatment.\n  Mr. President, I am one who has had quite a bit of experience with \nAIDS. I would like to take a few moments to tell you what it was like \nbefore there was a Ryan White CARE Act. As mayor of San Francisco \nduring the 1980's, I had many challenges. But none was more serious or \nsevere than the emergence of the AIDS epidemic. I remember my first \nmeeting on this subject as if it were yesterday. I think it was 1981. I \nwas told in a meeting in the mayor's office that there was a rumor of a \nso-called gay cancer which had as one of its symptoms purple skin \nlesions. I called our director of public health and asked him to look \ninto it. He called the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and \nlearned that New York and Los Angeles were reporting a similar syndrome \nthat was appearing in gay men.\n  At the time, we had no idea what we were dealing with. We did not \nknow whether this was caused by a virus, a bacteria, or something else. \nWe did not know how widely spread the epidemic had become or that \nhemophiliacs, Haitians, and intravenous drug users were already \ninfected. We certainly did not know that it had originated in Central \nAfrica, and that it would impact millions of people, and that it was \nsweeping through sub-Saharan Africa long before it reached this \nhemisphere.\n  But one thing I did know. We were dealing with something that was \ndeadly. And it is my belief that as an elected official, when one \nlearns of a threat to the public health, one has a responsibility to \nact. By the end of that first year, there were 76 diagnosed cases in \nSan Francisco. We had allocated $180,000 for the first AIDS program in \nthe Nation. By the time I left office in 1988, January, we were \nspending approximately $20 million a year, more than the rest of the \ncities in the country combined and, for most of the time, more than the \nState of California.\n  There was no Ryan White program then. But I can tell you that I \ncertainly could have used it. We had to fund all those services from \nthe city budget--the first AIDS prevention programs, the first AIDS \nhousing programs, the first preliminary AIDS research efforts, which \nwere pioneered at San Francisco General Hospital by Dr. Paul \nVolberding, and others. We opened the first AIDS ward. I broke that \nribbon. We funded hospice care as well as a full range of support \nservices.\n  San Francisco's response became known as the model AIDS program. \nHealth officials from around the world came to observe it. And many \nreturned home to replicate it. Make no mistake about it, it was hard. \nBut if I had it to do over again, I would do it again. And if I do \nnothing else in my public life, creation of that model will be among my \nproudest achievements.\n  Last year it was learned that San Francisco was actually experiencing \na decline in the number of new AIDS cases. This was very encouraging. \nAs far as I know, San Francisco is the only major city on the planet \nthat has experienced a decline in its AIDS caseload. When I read in the \nNew York Times that the decline was attributable to one thing, the \nprevention program put into place in the early 1980's, I felt an \naffirmation of the principle which I stated earlier, which I will state \nagain. As an elected official, when one learns of a threat to the \npublic health, one has a responsibility to act.\n  Having said that, a lot of cities have sustained devastating losses. \nNo city has been harder hit than my own, a city just 7 miles square, \nrenowned for its beauty and its people. It is a city where 2 percent of \nits entire population has been claimed by AIDS, and 4 percent of its \nremaining population is estimated to be infected with the HIV. More \nthan 50,000 young Californians have died from AIDS, approximately the \nsame number as all Americans who died in Vietnam. Almost five times \nthat many young Americans have died from AIDS.\n  While my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have recounted the \nalarming statistics with which we have become all too familiar, I \nbelieve that America has become numbed by the statistics of AIDS. I am \nreminded of a statement made in a different context: ``A single death \nis a tragedy; a million deaths are a statistic.'' That is all too true \nwhen it comes to AIDS.\n  The young man for whom this legislation is named gave the disease a \nface and a name to which every American could relate. Ryan White, a \nyoungster, with his courage in fighting prejudice, helped this Nation \nbegin to understand that AIDS knows no boundaries. Many years before \nthe world came to know the name of Ryan White, there were also other \nnames. There were names and faces that will be with many of us in this \nChamber for a long, long time. For me, I lost many friends. I can tell \nyou that I have lost many friends, and could recount a long litany of \ntragedy and suffering.\n  Let me tell you about two because they are recent deaths. The first \nis police officer Ray Benson whose funeral I attended just a few weeks \nago. Ray became a San Francisco police officer in 1980 when I was \nmayor. And during the next 12 years he became the model police officer. \nHe displayed conspicuous gallantry that personifies the risk of police \nofficers daily when they report to duty. He received many awards during \nthe course of his tenure, most recently the Medal of Valor for his \nactions while arresting a narcotics suspect. At the time he sustained \nserious wounds which required more than a 100 stitches in his face. But \nhe shielded his fellow officers from the suspect's knife. Officer Ray \nBenson was a friend of mine. When I last saw him, his vision was \nfailing, but his same strong spirit stood out. Ray's death from AIDS is \nbut the most recent loss I have personally known.\n  I would like to mention just one other name and, due to the time \nconstraints, I will stop. That name is Brad Wilson.\n  Brad was my scheduler during my campaign for Governor of California \nand my Senate campaign until he became too sick. He grew up in the \nOzarks, graduated from the University of Chicago with top honors, and \nreceived his law degree from New York University.\n  After receiving an AIDS diagnosis, Brad fought for 6 more years, \nstruggling to maintain his dignity and working as much as possible \nuntil 2 months before his death. In his final days, this brilliant \nyoung attorney, 39, was unable to care for himself in any \n\n[[Page S10699]]\nway. Morphine was administered intravenously to deaden the pain caused \nby a brain infection, but he maintained his dignity until the end.\n  Three of his last visitors at home were my daughter and her husband \nwho took with them my 5-month-old granddaughter to boost his spirits. \nBoth Brad and Ray were able to avail themselves of the services \nprovided by the Ryan White CARE Act, and for this I am forever \ngrateful.\n  I mention these two names as a very personal example of the loss, but \nthey are but two more names out of almost 250,000 who have died from \nAIDS in the United States. Ryan White's death proved that AIDS is an \nequal opportunity killer, and there should be no room for prejudice or \ndiscrimination toward those it strikes for, in truth, it can strike \nanyone.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, with Ryan White's memory \nin mind, as well as the memory of each and every American who has died \nfrom AIDS.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California, \nSenator Feinstein, for a very powerful statement. The reasons that she \nlaid out as to why there should be support for this legislation, I \nthink, will particularly help, and I appreciate her comments.\n  The Senator from North Carolina, Senator Helms, had some amendments \nthat he wished to offer. Senator Byrd has requested about 10 minutes as \nin morning business. I think as long as Senator Helms is not here, I am \nprepared to offer an amendment as soon as Senator Byrd finishes, if, \nindeed, Senator Helms is not here. But I think he is ready to go as \nwell.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Byrd be allowed to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished Senator from \nKansas, my friend, Senator Kassebaum, for her courtesy and kindness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/26/senate-section/article/S10697-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10699-S10701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ELIMINATE THE DUAL KEY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today's New York Times reports that the \nUnited Nations Secretary General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, would \n``veto NATO airstrikes.'' Secretary of State Christopher has written to \nme to clarify the decisions that were made in Brussels. In his letter, \nSecretary Christopher has stated that ``the North Atlantic Council \napproved detailed planning for the use of substantial NATO airpower to \ndeter or respond to Bosnian Serb attacks on the U.N. safe area of \nGorazde. These plans include a broader range of options for commanders, \nwho for the first time will have the ability to use NATO airpower \nwithin a wide geographic area against a variety of targets which may \npose a threat to the safe area.'' Secretary Christopher goes on to say \nthat ``Of equal importance, NATO military authorities were instructed \nto formulate plans for protecting other safe areas, particularly Bihac, \non the basis of the new approach adopted for Gorazde . . . These steps, \nwhich confirm decisions taken in London, reflect unanimous Allied \nendorsement of the substantial change to the dual key previously in \neffect.''\n  Reinforcing Secretary Christopher's letter, the Secretary General \njust released a statement that delegates the authority for airstrikes \nto the military commanders on the ground. In his press statement, the \nSecretary General says, ``on the question of the `dual key,' the \nrelevant Security Council resolutions call for close coordination \nbetween the United Nations and NATO on the use of NATO air power and \nthis is reflected in the NATO decision. In order to streamline \ndecisions taking within the U.N. chain of command when the use of air \npower is deemed to be necessary, the Secretary General has decided to \ndelegate the necessary authority in this respect to his military \ncommanders in the field.'' Mr. President, this is consistent with the \nNorth Atlantic Council decision agreed upon last night, and is a major \nstep forward.\n  As a result of a meeting conducted last Friday in London and \nimplemented by the North Atlantic Council of NATO last night in \nBrussels, NATO has made a decision to take new, positive action in \nBosnia to deter and retaliate against Bosnian Serb aggression against \nat least the U.N.-designated safe areas of Gorazde and Sarajevo. \nAlready, French and British troops have taken action to forcefully \nreopen the ground route for humanitarian supplies into Sarajevo. The \nNATO military command is establishing the command and control links and \ndecisionmaking rules to guide NATO operations in Bosnia in fulfillment \nof the decisions so recently made. The new decisionmaking process would \neliminate the veto that has been exercised regularly by U.N. political \nauthorities, frustrating timely and strong alliance action. The \nSecretary General has agreed with this decision.\n  This is an important new development, a vital change in the military \nequation. It is critical to the success of alliance military operations \nin Bosnia.\n  Our NATO allies have come to this consensus partially at the behest \nof the United States, which has urged more forceful action against the \nBosnian Serb forces. This decision to retaliate, which has been \nforcefully communicated to the Bosnian Serb military commander by a \ntrio of United States, United Kingdom, and French generals, commits \nNATO to punishing and disproportionate airstrikes against any Bosnian \nSerb military facility or formation anywhere in Bosnia, including Serb \nheadquarters and command and control centers, should the Bosnian Serbs \nattempt to overrun Gorazde.\n  The need to make these decisions and these threats credible requires \nthe elimination of the ``dual key'' to authorizing airstrikes. This \n``dual key'' process, which has required both NATO and U.N. political \nauthorities to authorize airstrikes, has gutted the effectiveness of \nprevious NATO airstrikes undertaken to punish the Serbs for actions \nagainst U.N. protection forces or Bosnian civilians. The decisionmaking \nprocess has been far too slow, and has been burdened with added \nrequirements to notify the targets of the intended strike, to strike at \nprearranged times, and to strike at targets that do not \ndisproportionately punish the Serbian forces. These restrictions are \nmilitarily foolish, and serve only to set up NATO forces as targets for \nSerb antiaircraft fire as they come in over preannounced targets at \nspecified times. Allied air power in Bosnia has been reduced to a farce \nby the misguided political calculations of U.N. civilian officials.\n  These restrictions do not pertain to the retaliation that has been \noutlined for NATO. NATO retaliatory airstrikes will be swift, \nunannounced, and directed at targets of NATO's choosing, encompassing \nany Bosnian Serb military facility or formation. These strikes will be \ndisproportionate and massive, rather than the pinpricks that have been \nconducted in the past. NATO has resolved to continue, to punish the \nSerbs even if they resort again to such dastardly tactics as using U.N. \npersonnel or civilians as human shields to protect their military \nfacilities. Regarding military action in the face of hostage-taking, \nthe presumption outlined in the NATO decision is that operations will \ngo forward.\n  According to the North Atlantic Council decisions last night, the \nstrikes will take place when NATO and U.N. military commanders--\nmilitary commanders, not civilian authorities--determine that Serb \npreparations pose a threat to Gorazde. The chain of command stops at \nthe military level, not at the political level, according to the North \nAtlantic Council decision document.\n  Under the ``dual key'' process, U.N. civilians are allowed to make \nmilitary decisions, which does not and has never made military sense. \nOnce a decision has been made by civilian authorities to carry out \nairstrikes, military commanders should be, and must be, trusted to \ncarry out that decision in the most effective manner, and in a manner \nthat best protects their striking forces. NATO commanders must be given \nthe freedom of action to make good military judgments, to strike at \ntargets that pose the greatest danger to NATO, and to strike at targets \nthat will inflict the greatest damage to the Serb forces.\n This is what is necessary to let the Serb forces know that this \n\n[[Page S10700]]\ntime, we mean business. Peaceniks at the United Nations cannot be \nallowed to overturn military options to the tragedy in Bosnia. New York \nshould be out of the Bosnia loop.\n\n  At the United Nations, political entanglements also entangle military \noperations. Aside from decisions being made by United Nations civilians \nwith little or no military experience, opportunities exist for Bosnian \nSerb supporters to undermine the effectiveness of NATO airstrikes. I \nunderstand that the Russians are opposed to the NATO decision to \nundertake airstrikes against the Bosnian Serb forces, but this is \nunderstandable. Russia has ancient ties to the Serbs of both Serbia and \nBosnia, ties of religion and of history. But Russia, with its vote on \nthe United Nations Security Council, should not be allowed to \njeopardize NATO decisions and NATO actions. Russia is not, at least not \nyet, a member of NATO. I respect the views of those who would \nacknowledge Russian concerns in this matter, but I venture to surmise \nthat the Russians would not allow consideration of NATO's views to \nhandcuff decisions made and actions taken by Russian military forces, \nregardless of the voice and veto of NATO members on the United Nations \nSecurity Council.\n  I believe that, differences over the passage of the bill lifting the \narms embargo aside, the Members of this body are united in opposition \nto the existing and cumbersome ``dual key'' decision-making process. It \nhas been a critical element in the failure of the United Nations \noperation in Bosnia, and it has been a critical element in the failure \nof previous NATO attempts to shore up the U.N. operations in Bosnia. If \nthe action taken to lift the embargo leads to the departure of the \nUnited Nations or our European allies from Bosnia, with all the danger \nthat operation might entail, the elimination of this ``dual key'' \nbecomes even more important. If the United States participates in the \nwithdrawal, as President Clinton has suggested, I believe we all would \nagree that we do not want the United Nations in a position to crimp \nNATO's ability to react.\n  The Secretary General's statement is an endorsement of the major \nchange in the way NATO does business in Bosnia. It will permit allied \nair power to do what it is designed to do, as characterized by the \nfollowing statement from the NATO Secretary General, which is that \n``there is a strong feeling among Allies that such operations, once \nthey are launched, will not lightly be discontinued. In the face of the \ninherent strike, the Alliance is determined.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \npertinent materials.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                       The Secretary of State,\n\n                                        Washington, July 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: Working with our NATO Allies, the United \n     States has embarked on a stronger and firmer approach to \n     preserving the UN mission in Bosnia. New command and control \n     arrangements agreed to in Brussels last night, combined with \n     British and French decisiveness in using their Rapid Reaction \n     Forces to secure routes into Sarajevo, are vivid examples of \n     our heightened resolve.\n       Last night in Brussels, NATO acted resolutely to confirm \n     and implement decisions taken at last week's International \n     Meeting on Bosnia in London. After intensive review by NATO \n     military authorities, the North Atlantic Council approved \n     detailed planning for use of substantial NATO airpower to \n     deter or respond to Bosnian Serb attacks on the UN safe area \n     of Gorazde. These plans include a broader range of options \n     for commanders, who for the first time will have the ability \n     to use NATO airpower within a wide geographic area against a \n     variety of targets which may pose a threat to the safe area.\n       Of equal importance, NATO military authorities were \n     instructed to formulate plans for protecting other safe \n     areas, particularly Bihac, on the basis of the new approach \n     adopted for Gorazde. Authority for the decisions taken at \n     NATO already exists under current UN Security Council \n     resolutions. NATO Secretary General Claes communicated the \n     NATO decisions to UN Secretary General Boutros-Ghali last \n     night.\n       These steps, which confirm decisions taken in London, \n     reflect unanimous Allied endorsement of a substantial change \n     to the dual key previously in effect. This would be \n     accomplished through the anticipated new delegation of \n     authority from UN and NATO political authorities to theater \n     and field commanders, consistent with military practices.\n       These new arrangements will ensure that the use of airpower \n     is substantial and decisive. They are consistent with the \n     requirements of the U.S. military and have its endorsement. \n     The Alliance recognizes that there are risks involved in use \n     of substantial airpower, but will not be deterred. In short, \n     there will be no more pinpricks.\n       I hope the Administration can count on your support.\n           Sincerely,\n     Warren Christopher.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 26, 1995]\n\n         NATO Gives U.N. Officials Veto on Airstrikes in Bosnia\n\n                         (By Craig R. Whitney)\n\n       Brussels, Wednesday, July 26--Four days after the United \n     States, Britain, and France threatened the Bosnian Serbs with \n     the heaviest air strikes yet if they attacked the Muslim \n     enclave of Gorazde, NATO officials said early this morning \n     that they had agreed that no large-scale bombing could start \n     unless United Nations civilian officials gave the go-ahead.\n       Far from doing away with the cumbersome ``dual key'' \n     arrangement that the United States says has hampered NATO's \n     ability to protect United Nations peacekeepers on the ground, \n     the NATO allies in effect have sided with United Nations \n     Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has been saying \n     nobody could take his key away from him.\n       The allies agreed to make what one NATO official called a \n     ``strong recommendation'' to Mr. Boutros-Ghali to leave it to \n     his military field commanders on the ground in Gorazde and \n     elsewhere to decide when the time had come to start bombing \n     the Serbs if they attacked.\n       But since Mr. Boutros-Ghali has been extremely cautious \n     about approving air strikes in the past, what was meant to \n     sound like a roar in London four days ago appeared likely to \n     have been throttled down to something more like a growl by \n     the time NATO ambassadors finished grappling with it in the \n     small hours of Wednesday morning.\n       ``It's falling apart,'' an American military officer said \n     of the previous allied indications that in the event of an \n     imminent attack on Gorazde, military leaders could decide on \n     their own to proceed with bombing of the Serbs. (Field \n     commanders already have the authority to call in close air \n     support in the midst of battle, though that power has seldom \n     been used.)\n       A senior NATO diplomat said as the Brussles meeting dragged \n     on, ``What we came up with tonight has to be endorsed by \n     Boutros Boutros-Ghali.'' As for the ``dual key'' arrangement, \n     he said, ``We have to live with it.''\n       The main pressure to preserve a decision-making role for \n     Mr. Boutros-Ghali came from Britain and France. With nearly \n     15,000 soldiers on the ground in Bosnia who could suffer the \n     consequences if bombing and Serb reactions to it spiral out \n     of control, the countries pressed, in effect, for a series of \n     political fire walls against precipitate American action from \n     the air.\n       In particular, French officials deny that they ever agreed \n     last Friday in London to launch automatically what the \n     American Secretary of Defense William Perry called a \n     ``disproportionate response'' to an attack on Gorazde. \n     Americans had emerged from the London meeting describing an \n     agreement to sidestep the Secretary General, but apparently \n     that was exaggerated.\n       The emerging decision would represent a serious setback for \n     the United States, which wanted the allies to leave all \n     decisions on bombing from now on to NATO officers and United \n     Nations military commanders on the ground in Bosnia.\n       An American diplomat said, ``We're just trying to get the \n     best deal we can.''\n       NATO ambassadors endorsed a detailed military plan prepared \n     by their uniformed chiefs and then planned to call on Mr. \n     Boutros-Ghali to delegate to as low a level as possible his \n     authority to approve air strikes if the Serbs attacked \n     designated ``safe areas'' in Bosnia, one participant said.\n       The allies took two full days and part of a third to decide \n     what to do about Gorazde despite the fact that most of them \n     had been present in London when the problem was discussed \n     last Friday. And NATO has had authority to bomb Bosnian Serb \n     heavy weapons in Gorazde and all the other United Nations-\n     designated ``safe areas'' in Bosnia since April of 1994.\n       The senior United Nations commander in Bosnia, Gen. Rupert \n     Smith of Britain, has frequently reached agreement with his \n     NATO counterpart, Adm. Leighton Smith of NATO's Southern \n     Command in Naples, an American, on conducting air strikes.\n       In the past, some of these have then been vetoed by Gen. \n     Bernard Janvier, the overall commander of United Nations \n     peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia, but many more have \n     been disapproved by Mr. Boutros-Ghali or his civilian \n     representative there, Yasushi Akashi.\n       While the plan discussed here was devised to deter a \n     Bosnian Serb attack on Gorazde, NATO officials said they \n     would try to adapt it as quickly as possible for the western \n     Bosnian enclave of Bihac, where Bosnian Serbs, Croatian \n     Serbs, and renegade Muslim forces are fighting Bosnian \n     Government troops.\n       Mr. Boutros-Ghali, who has insisted on retaining ultimate \n     authority over air attacks \n\n[[Page S10701]]\n     ever since last week's tough talk in London by American officials about \n     cutting him out of the decision-making process, was to be \n     informed of the allies' latest decision by NATO Secretary-\n     General Willy Klaes.\n       The coldest feet here apparently belonged to Britain and \n     France. ``We have to have at least a nihil obstat from the \n     United Nations at the political level, in the most practical \n     and least obstructive way possible,'' one French official \n     explained, referring to the Vatican's expression when \n     approving a book for publication. Officials said that \n     Britain, too, was adamant about keeping the United Nations in \n     the decision-making loop as far as possible.\n       But the allies said that Mr. Boutros-Ghali would need no \n     additional Security Council resolutions to authorize his \n     subordinate military commanders to approve a bombing \n     campaign. If he asked for such a resolution, Russia would \n     almost certainly veto it. The Russian Foreign Minister, \n     Andrei V. Kozyrev, refused to go along with the London threat \n     last week.\n       The allies also agreed that they would have to meet again \n     before any decision to actually begin a campaign of \n     widespread air strikes against Bosnian Serb air defenses and \n     other military targets, and that Mr. Boutros-Ghali would have \n     to agree that it should go ahead, officials said.\n       Mr. Boutros-Ghali attended last Friday's meeting in London, \n     where the U.S., Britain, and France promised ``substantial \n     and decisive response'' to any attack on Gorazde, but he said \n     little publicly there.\n       President Jacques Chirac had described the London decisions \n     to threaten bombing as ``not entirely what we were hoping \n     for.'' He has pressed for a thousand British and French \n     troops to be dispatched to reinforce the United Nations \n     peacekeepers in Gorazde.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank again the distinguished Senator from Kansas for her \ncourtesy, and the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy].\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see my colleague from California on the \nfloor. I understand she would like to address the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/26/senate-section/article/S10699-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10701-S10709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RYAN WHITE CARE REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you so much. I rise in support, very \nstrong support, of the Ryan White CARE Act. I want to thank my friend \nand colleague from Massachusetts for giving me just a short period of \ntime to make a few remarks.\n  I hope I will not have to rush back to the floor to defend against \nharmful amendments and mean-spirited amendments that attempt to drive a \nwedge between Members.\n  The way I view life, we are all God's children, and when we are sick, \nwe should help each other. That is what this bill is all about.\n  I also want to thank the Senator from Kansas, the chairman of the \ncommittee, for moving this legislation to where it is today. It \ncertainly means a lot to many people across this great country that we \nare responding to the AIDS epidemic.\n  Indeed, it is an epidemic. An estimated 150,000 people infected with \nHIV are living in California. That is a huge number of people, Mr. \nPresident, who are looking to Members for help. We cannot solve every \nproblem for every person. We know that. But the Ryan White CARE Act is \nthe basis for having matching dollars flow into our communities, to \nhelp those who need it most. The Ryan White CARE Act provides funding \nfor health care and supportive services for people living with AIDS.\n  Title I of the act talks about the cities that are under great stress \nand great duress because of this epidemic. In California, we have seven \ntitle I cities: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Oakland, Anaheim in Orange \nCounty, Riverside/San Bernardino, San Diego, and Santa Rosa/Petaluma. \nTwo more cities, San Jose and Sacramento, unfortunately, are expected \nto qualify for funding next year. I say ``unfortunately'' because it \nmeans that the devastation of AIDS continues to spread to new cities--\nnot only in my State of California, Mr. President, but across this \ngreat Nation.\n  Through this act, we provide funding for statewide programs that \nreimburse patients for the cost of medicine. They provide insurance \ncoverage and health and supportive services. And, title III(B) supports \ncommunity-based health care clinics that are so important to outpatient \nservices.\n  Title IV, Mr. President, supports pediatric, adolescent, and family \nHIV care programs.\n  Mr. President, at this point I want to mention a name of a woman who \ndied who had dedicated her life to making sure that we paid attention \nto pediatric AIDS. That is Elizabeth Glaser, one of the greatest people \nI have ever met in my entire life. I feel blessed that somehow I \ncrossed her path in my life.\n  This is a woman who saw tragedy, who got the HIV virus through a \ntransfusion, and unknowingly--because it was so early in the epidemic--\npassed it on to two children. Her husband, Michael, who has taken up \nthe cause, has lost so much love from his life, but yet he remains \ndedicated to making sure we find a cure for AIDS, and that we prevent \nthe AIDS virus being transmitted from the pregnant woman to her child.\n  We are seeing some breakthroughs, Mr. President, in this regard. The \nearly use of AZT seems to work in many, many cases so that the children \ndo not get HIV and they are born healthy.\n  It is very important that we continue the Ryan White CARE Act and all \nthe titles in the Ryan White Act. We know the Ryan White CARE Act is \ncost effective. The lifetime cost of treating a person with AIDS is \nover $100,000, with an average yearly cost of $38,000. People say, why \ndo we spend money in the Federal Government? In this case and in other \ncases we could point to, we really save money in the end, because this \nact works to keep people out of the hospital where the care is the most \nexpensive. It allows individuals to continue on with productive lives \nin their communities.\n  One California study found that individuals receiving managed \noutpatient care services spent 8 less days in the hospital, saving \n$22,000 per person, or a total of $13 million in health care costs per \nyear.\n  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues on the committee are aware \nof this program supported by the Ryan White CARE Act. Senator Feinstein \nmentioned it in her wonderful opening remarks today. There is a program \nthat operates in California called Project Open Hand. Saturday, I went \nto visit the program. I was really moved to see the kind of community \nspirit that this program promotes. We talk about saving money. This \nprogram feeds people with HIV and AIDS who need that kind of help, \npeople who may be too tired or too sick to cook healthful meals for \nthemselves.\n  It is interesting to note that there are huge donations to Project \nOpen Hand, and an enormous number of volunteers. When we look over the \nbudget, 18 percent of the budget comes from Ryan White funds, but all \nof rest of it flows into the program in a 5-to-1 ratio. The Ryan White \nmoney brings in a match of almost 5 to 1 to Project Open Hand, which \nserves more than 1,000 people every day. It is extraordinary to see the \nway it is done.\n  I watched them prepare the meals there. They have different diets for \ndifferent people. Some have to be no salt, some low salt--and it is all \ndone in a way that is so efficient. So many volunteers give of \nthemselves.\n  Mr. President, even with Ryan White funds, title I cities have \ntremendous unmet needs. For example, in California, 62 percent of those \nin need of HIV primary care do not receive those services in Los \nAngeles; 73 percent of people with HIV in Orange County cannot get case \nmanagement services; 45,000 publicly-funded home health care visits are \nneeded for people with AIDS and HIV in Alameda County and there are no \nfunds to help people with their transportation costs. They have no way \nto get to outpatient clinics.\n  Mr. President, 40 percent of HIV infected individuals in Riverside \nand San Bernardino County--which we call the inland empire in \nCalifornia, that is inland from the coast--40 percent of those HIV-\ninfected individuals there are receiving services through the Ryan \nWhite CARE Act because they have no health insurance whatsoever.\n  In San Diego, we have at least 900 additional people with AIDS in its \nsystem who were diagnosed and reported elsewhere. In other words, they \ncame from Mexico and other areas to get treatment in San Diego, so \nthere is a terrible problem there.\n  An estimated 1,000 people with HIV are homeless in San Francisco.\n  So, in conclusion, to my friends whom I thank so very much for \nbringing this bill forward, this bill is crucial. It is crucial to \npeople with HIV \n\n[[Page S10702]]\nand AIDS. And I want to point out something that is often lost. The \ngroups today that are most at risk are heterosexual women and our young \npeople. So, if there is an attempt on this Senate floor to ghettoize \nthis disease, I will be back to speak out. Again, we are all God's \nchildren. We must help each other. We are all Americans. We are in this \ntogether. We must confront AIDS forcefully and directly, provide the \nnecessary funding that will be matched by States and localities, and a \nvery generous private sector.\n  So I am very pleased to be here in support of this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, we had many of the opening statements \non Friday and are prepared to move forward with amendments now. The \nSenator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] has suggested I go ahead with \nan amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1852\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the adoption by States of the CDC guidelines \n                          for pregnant women)\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas, [Mrs. Kassebaum], for herself and \n     Mr. Kennedy proposes an amendment numbered 1852.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . CDC GUIDELINES FOR PREGNANT WOMEN.\n\n       (a) Requirement.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, a State described in subsection (b) shall, not later \n     than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, certify \n     to the Secretary of Health and Human Services that such State \n     has in effect regulations to adopt the guidelines issued by \n     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concerning \n     recommendations for immuno- deficiency virus counseling and \n     voluntary testing for pregnant women.\n       (b) Application of Section.--A State described in this \n     subsection is a State that has--\n       (1) an HIV seroprevalance among child bearing women during \n     the period beginning on January 1, 1991 and ending on \n     December 31, 1992, of .25 or greater as determined by the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; or\n       (2) an estimated number of births to HIV positive women in \n     1993 of 175 or greater as determined by the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention using 1992 natality \n     statistics.\n       (c) Noncompliance.--If a State does not provide the \n     certification required under subsection (a) within the 1 year \n     period described in such subsection, such State shall not be \n     eligible to receive assistance for HIV counseling and testing \n     under the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) \n     until such certification is provided.\n       (d) Additional Funds Regarding Women and Infants.--\n       (1) In general.--If a State described in subsection (b) \n     provides the certification required in subsection (a) and is \n     receiving funds under part B of title XXVI of the Public \n     Health Service Act for a fiscal year, the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services may (from the amounts available pursuant \n     to paragraph (3)) make a grant to the State for the fiscal \n     year for the following purposes:\n       (A) Making available to pregnant women appropriate \n     counseling on HIV disease.\n       (B) Making available outreach efforts to pregnant women at \n     high risk of HIV who are not currently receiving prenatal \n     care.\n       (C) Making available to such women testing for such \n     disease.\n       (D) Offsetting other State costs associated with the \n     implementation of the requirement of subsection (a).\n       (2) Evaluation by institute of medicine.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall request the Institute of Medicine of the National \n     Academy of Sciences to enter into a contract with the \n     Secretary for the purpose of conducting an evaluation of the \n     extent to which grants under paragraph (1) have been \n     effective in preventing the perinatal transmission of the \n     human immunodeficiency virus.\n       (B) Alternative contract.--If the Institute referred to in \n     subparagraph (A) declines to conduct the evaluation under \n     such subparagraph, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall carry out such subparagraph through another public or \n     nonprofit private entity.\n       (C) Date certain for report.--The Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services shall ensure that, not later than after 2 \n     years after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     evaluation required in this paragraph is completed and a \n     report describing the findings made as a result of the \n     evaluation is submitted to the Congress.\n       (3) Funding.--For the purpose of carrying out this \n     subsection, there are authorized to be appropriated \n     $10,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1996 through 2000. \n     Amounts made available under section 2677 for carrying out \n     this part are not available for carrying out this subsection.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise to offer this amendment on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Kennedy, the ranking member of the Labor \nand Human Resources Committee. This amendment is aimed at preventing \nthe prenatal transmission of HIV from mothers to newborn infants. \nBecause new research findings show that when pregnant women with HIV \ntake AZT--which is a treatment that shows positive results for those \nwho have contacted the AIDS virus--it can protect their infants if \ntaken at the right time. I believe we should make testing and treatment \navailable to all who could benefit from this approach. Our amendment \nwould begin to meet this objective.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention recently released guidelines for voluntary HIV counseling \nand testing of pregnant women. These guidelines call for health \nproviders to offer HIV testing to all women.\n  The CDC guidelines were developed after recent research showed that \nHIV transmission to newborns from infected mothers could be \ndramatically reduced. If pregnant women with HIV take AZT during \npregnancy, they can decrease the transmission rate to their newborns \nfrom 25 to 8 percent--this is a dramatic reduction.\n  In response to these findings, and from a desire to protect the \nhealth of newborns, the amendment we offer would require States with \nthe greatest number of HIV-infected newborns to implement the CDC \nguidelines. Under this proposal, 11 States plus the District of \nColumbia, which account for 80 percent of all newborn HIV cases, would \nqualify to receive grants from the Public Health Service to help offset \nsome of the costs of testing and treatment.\n  I offer this amendment as an alternative to a proposal which is being \nadvanced in the House of Representatives, by Congressman Coburn of \nOklahoma. To address this problem, the Coburn amendment would test \nnewborn infants for HIV. I believe this is the wrong approach. It seems \nto me that it is most important that we test the mother at a time in \nthe process in which we could potentially intervene. The Coburn \namendment would allow for voluntary testing of the mother but would \nmandate testing of those babies whose mother had failed to be tested \nduring her pregnancy. I regret that, under the Coburn amendment, it \nseems to me, that testing of newborns would not prevent HIV \ntransmission. This why I think it is important to start the process at \nan earlier period of time, rather than after the birth of the newborn \ninfant.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I would actually prefer mandatory \ntesting of all mothers during pregnancy for HIV. I support such an \napproach because I believe it would be the most effective way to \nprevent HIV transmission to newborns. However, I am not advancing a \nmandatory testing approach at this time because of the concerns that \nhave been raised by many. These include increased Federal Medicaid \nexpenditures, unfunded State mandates, and a decrease in pregnant women \nseeking prenatal care.\n  For all of those reasons I decided it was best to not make it \nmandatory, but to follow the CDC guidelines in the 11 States where 80 \npercent of the cases have, in the past, occurred. I believe this \namendment, which will provide funding to States to implement the \nvoluntary CDC HIV counseling and testing guidelines, and is an \neffective way to protect our Nation's newborn infants. As such, I urge \ncolleagues' support for this measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment \nput forward by the Senator from Kansas. It represents a responsible \napproach to an important issue. I am pleased we are taking action on it \nat the outset of this debate. The CARE Act is about providing health \ncare and \n\n[[Page S10703]]\nhope to people living with HIV disease. It is about making the promise \nof advances in biomedical research a reality in the lives of our fellow \nAmericans in need.\n  Research has demonstrated we can reduce the transmission of HIV from \nmother to child by providing HIV positive pregnant women with AZT, \nduring the second or third trimesters of pregnancy and during delivery. \nIn so doing, we can save young lives and help keep families together.\n  In response to this important discovery, public health officials and \nmaternal and child health care providers have worked closely with the \nCenters for Disease Control to design guidelines for standards of \nmedical practice that will help to maximize the impact of this \ndiscovery. Earlier this month, the CDC issued guidelines recommending \nthat all pregnant women receive counseling about the benefits of \nseeking HIV testing, and that such testing be made available on a \nvoluntary basis.\n  Where this is currently being done, more than 95 percent of the women \nhave sought voluntary HIV testing. I think that is really the heart of \nthis whole amendment that Senator Kassebaum has talked about.\n  We have a nationwide problem. The amendment is focused in the areas \nwhere there is the greatest need, and has been encouraged by voluntary \ncounseling. And where we get the voluntary testing and where we have \nthe appropriate kind of counseling consistent with the CDC guidelines, \nyou get 95, even higher percentage. Dr. Koop, who has been working in \nthis area, talks about areas and communities that are up to 98 percent, \nwhich is what, obviously, we are interested in doing. If effectively \nimplemented, the guidelines will make a tremendous difference.\n  So the amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas will ensure that \nthese guidelines are implemented in those States with the most \nsignificant problems. We know that more than 80 percent of the cases of \npediatric AIDS occur in 11 States, including my own State of \nMassachusetts. The amendment will ensure action by these States. It \nauthorizes funds to assist them with that action.\n  This approach is supported by the Academy of Pediatrics, the American \nMedical Association, the March of Dimes, the Governors, the State \nHealth Officers, the State AIDS Directors, the Pediatric AIDS \nFoundation, and a host of other public health and social service \norganizations.\n  We talked with Dr. Koop yesterday, who strongly supported this action \nas the most responsible means of moving toward this important issue.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge the Senate to accept it. I think what we \nhave found out in the whole battle on AIDS is where we work toward \nencouragement and work with consultation and counseling, we get a very \npositive response. That is what this particular measure does. If we \nwere to come back in a more compulsive situation which has been \nrecommended by others, what has happened--and the data reflect this--is \nthat there is less of a desire and willingness to move ahead and get \nthe test.\n  This I think makes sense from a public health point of view. It makes \nparticular sense with regard to the children. And it makes sense from a \nscarce-resource point of view.\n  So I commend the Senator for this amendment and urge its adoption. I \nthink it is a very, very important one. It is the a result of research \nthat has been going on at the Centers for Disease Control.\n  We have 7,000 infants that are born each year that are HIV. Three-\nquarters of those will be free and on their own within about a year or \na year and a half. But, as the Senator's amendment points out, with the \naddition of AZT treatment, that number comes down to only about 8 \npercent.\n  So the way that the Senator has proposed I think maximizes the \nopportunities to help and assist the infants, and also will get them \nthe most positive response and do it in a way which is financially most \nresponsible.\n  I commend her for this approach and urge our colleagues to accept \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I do not know how anybody can oppose this. I certainly \nsupport it. I think that we should expedite the consideration of this \nbill by letting all amendments possible be approved on voice vote, and \nnot get into any high-jinks about second degree. I am not going to \nsecond-degree anybody's amendment. We can save a lot of time if we do \nnot get involved in that, and can get this Ryan White bill behind us.\n  I certainly approve of this amendment. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Kassebaum-Kennedy \namendment to S. 641 which essentially adopts the guidelines of the U.S. \nPublic Health Service [PHS] which require counseling and voluntary \ntesting of pregnant women who are at risk for HIV infection.\n  The PHS has issued guidelines in the following areas: Information for \nboth infected and uninfected pregnant women which will help improve \ntheir health and that of their infants; laboratory considerations \ninvolved in HIV testing of these populations; and necessary follow-up \nservices for HIV-infected women, their infants and other family \nmembers.\n  The guidelines released this month by the PHS are an excellent model. \nThey recommend that health care providers ensure that all pregnant \nwomen are counseled and encouraged to be tested for HIV infection. This \nwill allow women to know their infection status, which can both help \nthem maintain their own health and reduce the risk for perinatal HIV \ntransmission.\n  The guidelines also emphasize that HIV testing should be voluntary. \nHealth care providers should counsel and offer HIV testing to women as \nearly in pregnancy as possible so that informed and timely therapeutic \nand reproductive decisions can be made.\n  The issue of mandatory testing is one I have studied in great detail. \nI understand the reasons why requiring mandatory testing of pregnant \nwomen or newborns may seem like a good idea. However, I have concluded, \nthat such a mandate, while well-intentioned, often has the opposite \neffect of turning those women who are most likely to be infected with \nthe HIV virus away from the system.\n  The issue boils down to access and trust; mandatory testing \naccomplishes neither.\n  My reasoning is as follows:\n  The idea of mandatory testing creates a great deal of apprehension \nand fear in precisely those women whom we would want to test.\n  Some women fear that if there were mandated testing, it may not be \naccompanied by necessary informed consent.\n  Others fear they may not be informed of the results of their HIV \nstatus.\n  We unfortunately have a tragic precedent for this with the infamous \nTuskegee experiments; African-American men in the South were tested for \nsyphilis and were not treated if found to be positive for the disease. \nThe fact that they were uninformed about the testing and not treated, \ncontinues to tarnish the reputation of the public health establishment.\n  For many, especially the poor who utilize the public health system, \nthere is often very little trust of a system which is not responsive to \ntheir health care needs, poorly staffed, over-crowded and ill-equipped \nto provide the necessary services.\n  Mandating treatment for all pregnant women independent of their risk \nfactors for HIV significantly increases the rate of false positive \nresults.\n  In other words, due to the sensitivity and specificity of testing for \nHIV, indiscriminate mandatory testing increases the likelihood that \nwomen who are falsely positive will be treated.\n  And, as I understand it, while AZT is a potentially life saving \nmedication which has helped literally thousands of people, it is not \nwithout significant side-effects and morbidity. We should not be \nsubjecting individuals who may not be HIV positive to unnecessary \ntreatment.\n  Mandating testing without providing the treatment merely sets up the \nlargely false expectation that services will be provided.\n  This would be a cruel hoax for those individuals who may test \npositive and not have the access to appropriate medical services. \n\n[[Page S10704]]\n\n  Scientific prospective clinical trials reveal that early detection of \nHIV-infected mothers and subsequent treatment with AZT reduces the \ntransmission rate of HIV to the newborn by a third.\n  The key to prevention and appropriate treatment is education and \ncounseling of the pregnant woman.\n  I think that the Kassebaum-Kennedy amendment address these issues in \na responsible way.\n  This amendment shows that the Senate is on the side of counseling and \nvoluntary testing as advised by our Nation's top public health experts. \nEducation and prevention remain our best weapons against this horrible \nepidemic.\n  I thank Senators Kassebaum and Kennedy for developing this dialog, \nand hope this amendment is a position we can maintain in conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1852) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the \nSenator from North Carolina. I am glad to start off with such a \npositive amendment and share with him that I think it is important to \ndebate these amendments, just the value of amendments as they are \npresented. I think that we both share the desire to move forward on \nthis legislation. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, as the Senate proceeds to the consideration of the \nproposal to reauthorize the so-called Ryan White CARE Act of 1990, \nthere are so many ironies, that I feel obliged to call attention to \nsome of them. Although the homosexual activists of America have created \na virtual minefield for any Senator who dares raise a question about \nthe legislative history of this proposal.\n  These homosexual activists have managed to convince the news media, \nand a surprising number of Senators, that it is irrelevant to talk \nabout who and what really caused the death of Ryan White--Ryan White, \nthe 18-year-old hemophiliac who died of AIDS because tainted blood was \npumped into his veins, blood that was tainted in the first place by a \nhomosexual conduct somewhere generations back.\n  The Centers for Disease Control was quite candid in the early 1980's \nas to when and how the AIDS disease was brought to America. The CDC may \nbe somewhat politically correct now.\n  In any event, I have in hand a volume which I obtained on loan from \nthe Library of Congress, a book authored by Randy Shilts entitled ``And \nthe Band Played On.'' Newsweek magazine described this book in 1987 as \n``compelling and often shocking, impassioned, and path breaking, the \nbest book yet on AIDS.''\n  The Washington Post described it as ``a monumental history.''\n  Time magazine called the book ``stunning and impressively researched, \na richly detailed narrative.''\n  The Chicago Tribune described it, ``It reads like a good medical \nsleuth story. But it is not fiction. It is a painstakingly detailed \nhistory.''\n  Mr. President, let us emphasize how virulent the AIDS virus is. A \nCanadian airline flight attendant, who knew he had AIDS and whose name \nis a matter of record, flew into the United States, and over a period \nof time--I am quoting from page 147 of Mr. Shilts' book--the Canadian \nairline flight attendant ``established sexual links between 40 patients \nin 10 cities. The role played by the flight attendant was remarkable,'' \nMr. Shilts says. And he continues, ``At least 40 of the first 248 \nhomosexual men diagnosed with HIV or AIDS in the United States as of \nApril 12, 1982 either had had sex with the flight attendant or had had \nsex with someone who had.''\n  Mr. Shilts continued, ``The links sometimes were extended for many \ngenerations of sexual contacts, giving frightening insight into how \nrapidly the epidemic had spread before anybody knew about it.''\n  Mr. President, I include those details to emphasize the virulence of \nHIV, AIDS, and it has been that way since the very beginning. Yet, I \nknow of not one homosexual organization that has advocated abstinence \nfrom engaging in the incredibly offensive and revolting conduct that \nhas led to the proliferation of AIDS; not to this good day has there \nbeen even a hint that abstinence should be followed. No. The homosexual \nactivists have gone precisely in the other direction, demanding more \nand more Federal funds for research and special funding for personal \ncare available to no other Americans suffering and dying of other \ndiseases like cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's.\n  This is a unique piece of legislation. It was in 1990, and it still \nis. There has never been a bill like this for any other disease.\n  The ferocity of the lobbying and the intensity of media criticism of \nanyone raising a question about all of this has caused many in Congress \nto go along with the questionable demands of the homosexual lobby.\n  I myself, Mr. President, have taken the heat, but I will not be \ndeterred. The Senate probably will pass this bill again, and the House \nhas already passed it. And it may become law because President Clinton \nwill rush and sprain his ankle grabbing a pen to sign it.\n  I have intended to have my say, and I have intended to offer a number \nof amendments for the consideration of Senators to vote for or against \nas they please. But I think the Senate ought to go on record.\n  Let us examine some of the support the American taxpayers are forced \nto give to a comparison of diseases. Let us start off with AIDS.\n  This year, $2,700,000,000 for AIDS. That is the tab Congress has \ndemanded that the American taxpayers furnish.\n  That is more money than for any other disease.\n  The Congressional Research Service breaks down the money like this:\n  This year, $1.548 billion for research, $491 million for so-called \nprevention or education programs--and I will get into that in just a \nminute--and $664 million for treatment. And this is only for fiscal \nyear 1995.\n  The fiscal year 1996 request totaled a whopping $2.9 billion --$1.819 \nbillion for research, $526 million for prevention or education, and \n$555 million for treatment programs.\n  Now, the disease AIDS ranks No. 8 in America among all of the \ndiseases in terms of causing death. The No. 1 killer is heart disease \nfollowed by cancer, followed by stroke and lung disease, diabetes, \nParkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, and so forth.\n  But do they get money like this? No. AIDS is No. 8--No. 8--yet AIDS \ngets more Federal money than any of the other diseases. If memory \nserves me correctly, the original 1990 Ryan White bill was funded with \nmoney taken from a fund originally allocated for Alzheimer's disease. \nThe Federal Government spends $91,000 for every patient who dies of \nAIDS. The Federal Government spends $5,000 for each American who dies \nof cancer.\n  I know the advocates of this Ryan White reauthorization bill will \nclaim that comparisons are odious, but there is a great big odor rising \nfrom the manner in which Congress is falling all over itself to do what \nthe homosexual lobby is almost hysterically demanding that Congress do.\n  Now, then, I am a little bit fascinated by a clause in this existing \nbill that is now the pending business, language which authorizes--and \nlet me quote from the bill--``appropriations of such sums as may be \nnecessary for each of the fiscal years 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, and \n2000.''\n  Supporters of the bill say, ``Oh, well, do not worry about that, \nJesse. That does not mean anything. It still will have to go through \nthe authorization and appropriations process each year.''\n  Well, if that is so, Mr. President, if it does not mean anything, let \nus take out that reference to ``such sums as may be necessary.'' I will \nbet you a quarter not one of the proponents will agree to that. Of \ncourse, it means something. \n\n[[Page S10705]]\n\n  While I am at it, let me raise a question about the provision in this \nRyan White bill's title V which creates new education and training \ncenters related to homosexuality and AIDS.\n  Mr. President, this bill is silent in seven languages about teaching \nthe importance of abstinence. It is not even mentioned. Abstinence, I \nsay again and again and again, is the only way AIDS will ever be \nbrought under control. And the activists do not even use the word or \npermit it to be used.\n  There is general agreement among scientists that the biggest risk for \ncontracting HIV or AIDS is the number of sexual partners homosexuals \nhave. The more promiscuous a homosexual, the greater his risk of \ncontracting HIV or AIDS, and, by the way, infecting innocent people \nlike little Ryan White, whose name is being exploited in this \nlegislation, who had nothing to do with that. He was innocent.\n  Reliable surveys, Mr. President, show that many homosexuals average \n16 different sex partners every month, 182 partners per year. And my \nsource for that is a document ``Hepatitis B Cohort Study of 1980,'' and \nI have it available for any Senator who wants to see it.\n  Now, is it not clear, Mr. President, that AIDS is a chronic disease \nof sexually promiscuous people? And a lot of innocent people like Ryan \nWhite are caught up in it, unknowingly and without any misconduct on \ntheir part.\n  Let me move on. Mr. President, you would not believe the stonewalling \nthat has been going on in and by the Clinton administration to prevent \nmy staff and me from obtaining statistical information about how these \nmillions and billions of dollars of the taxpayers' money are to be \nspent and have been spent in the past. You call HHS--and we have the \ndate and time and the name of the people we talk with--and they say \nthey do not know, that there is no monitoring going on.\n  Stonewalling, that is what we have. But I say this, and I say it with \nall the sincerity I possess, that before the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee acts on this bill, S. 641, I hope Senators Hatfield and Byrd \nand all of the members of the Appropriations Committee will insist on \ncredible documented information about who has received the Ryan White \nfunds since the enactment of the 1990 version of the Ryan White CARE \nAct.\n  That is all I ask. If Senator Robert C. Byrd says it is all right, \nafter he has looked at the information, I will be reasonably satisfied \nbecause I trust Senator Byrd. We do not belong to the same party. We do \nnot agree on everything. But I respect him as an honorable gentleman. I \nthink the American people will be appalled by what their hard-earned \ntax dollars are supporting in fact. Nobody knows now. I am sure Nancy \nKassebaum has no idea what is going on because I know this lady. I know \nher inclinations, and I know her character. But a lot of things are \ngoing on that have not been discussed or disclosed to the Congress of \nthe United States let alone the American people.\n  For example, I have a brochure from the Gay Men's Health Crisis.\n  By the way, I hate to use the word ``gay'' in connection with sodomy. \nThere is nothing gay about these people. ``Gay'' used to be a beautiful \nword. It has been corrupted, but that is another argument for another \nday.\n  This Gay Men's Health Crisis organization put out a brochure \ndescribing various and sundry methods of homosexual sex. Now, I have \nbeen around the track a long time, and I have seen a lot of things in \nmy lifetime, but I can just imagine how the average American would \nreact if they could see what this is all about. Not once--I reiterate, \nnot once--is abstinence mentioned as the way to avoid HIV infection. \nThey do not want abstinence.\n  Senators may be interested in an advertisement by another homosexual \noutfit, the so-called Whitman Walker Clinic in Washington. This \nadvertisement says: ``If you visit a bath house remember to always use \na latex condom. Used properly latex condoms prevent HIV, AIDS and other \nsexually transmitted diseases.''\n  Now, this statement is blatently false. It is inaccurate. It is \nmisleading. And yet taxpayer funds are being used to circulate this \nfalsehood, giving false hope to homosexuals in their many and various \nliaisons.\n  Then there is the Washington Blade, which is a homosexual newspaper \npublished here in Washington, DC. They have a pink section they call \nLights Out. The implications are obvious on that. This pink ``Lights \nOut'' section is dedicated exclusively to advertising for anonymous \ndates, sexual encounters. No names are given. You just pick this one \nthat sounds good to you, and there you go. Decency prevents me from \nreading the so-called classified ads out loud on the Senate floor. \nSuffice it to say here comes the Whitman Walker Clinic again. This time \nimplying, ``Just do it, but do it with a condom.'' And they know that \nis not so. They know that it is not so. The Whitman Walker Clinic, \nwhich receives Ryan White CARE Act money from the American taxpayers, \nwho care for people with HIV or AIDS, leads homosexuals to believe that \nas long as you use a condom it is safe to have anonymous sexual \nencounters.\n  Now, what kind of use of the American taxpayers' money is that? \nPeople say, it is hateful for Jesse to talk about this. But somebody \nneeds to talk about it. Somehow the American people need to know and \ndeserve to have an understanding of what is going on, not get up here \nwith all of the plaintive remarks about Ryan White. Let us talk about \nwhat killed Ryan White. Who furnished the tainted blood? Where did it \ncome from? I met the little boy one time. I was sorry for him then, and \nI am sorry that he is dead now. But it was not accidental. There was \nsomebody who did not care, who furnished tainted blood.\n  Now, the Gay Men's Health Crisis and the Whitman Walker Clinic are \nnot the only such homosexual outfits receiving Ryan White funds \nadvocating so-called safe sex. As I said earlier, I do not believe \nSenators could possibly believe the stonewalling by the Clinton \nadministration to prevent us, my staff and me, from obtaining accurate, \nverifiable statistical information on precisely how these millions and \nbillions of dollars have been spent and will be spent. I think it is a \nlegitimate question for the legislative branch to ask the executive \nbranch. But not the Clinton administration. Nobody. That is off limits. \nThey have got a deal. The Senate is debating whether or not to \nreauthorize this act for appropriations of such sums as may be \nnecessary, and nobody can tell me and nobody can tell the American \npeople exactly where this money is going and for what it is being \nspent.\n  Oh, you hear all of the wonderful stories about how these people say \nit is being spent. And I suppose some of it is being spent for good \npurposes. But Congress does not monitor this, and HHS will not let \nanybody monitor it. So it is sort of a closed shop, do you not see?\n  Incidentally, speaking of the word ``care,'' I have been the butt of \na lot of diatribes lately, like the New York Times, which put words in \nmy mouth that I had not said. And these editorial writers around the \ncountry somewhere along the line gave up this responsibility of \nchecking for themselves what the facts are and what was really said. \nThey pick up a report from the New York Times, and they rush to their \nlittle hot typewriters or little hot microphone or camera and say, \n``Oh, you cannot talk about this. This is a hateful thing to do.''\n  It is all right with me what they say. I do not care. I do not talk \nto them much anyway because they will take a snippet here and a snippet \nthere and about 5 seconds here and 5 seconds there, and they will make \nthe quote say what they want it to say. The first amendment does not \nrequire that they be honest or fair about anything.\n  For the record, Mr. President, let me say that I do not hate anybody, \nbut I have been accused of it in editorial after editorial. I do not \nhate homosexuals. I do not even know any homosexuals. But what I do not \nlike is for the Congress of the United States to bow and scrape to \nhomosexual pressure and give them Federal funds and rights and \nprivileges that other Americans are denied. That is what I do not like. \nAnd, yes, Mr. President, I have a deep sympathy for homosexuals who are \ndying of AIDS because of their having deliberately--deliberately--\nplaced their lives at risk. I have deep sympathy for anybody who sticks \na loaded pistol in his mouth and pulls the trigger. You are playing \nRussian roulette \n\n[[Page S10706]]\neither way. And homosexuals are losing and losing and losing, and they \ndo not want to talk about abstinence.\n  Now, homosexuals know the risk they are running with their sexual \nconduct. They go on television programs. I saw one or two on ``60 \nMinutes'' the other night, 2 or 3 weeks ago. They discussed why they \njust cannot abstain and why it is so much more intimate not to try to \nprotect themselves from being infected with AIDS or preventing others \nfrom being infected. They are not interested in abstinence. They are \nnot interested. In all candor, Mr. President, when you get down to the \nguts, feathers and all, they do not give a damn.\n  But the rest of us do. A lot of us are sick and tired of all the \npretenses of injured innocence. They are not innocent. They know it. \nAnd that is why they are so belligerent in their demands that \nhomosexuality be accepted as just another lifestyle--indeed, a \nspecially protected and encouraged lifestyle. And that is not a \nreckless statement because I am about to explain what I mean. I do not \nbelieve they will ever sell that bill of goods to the American people.\n  But back to Senator Hatfield, the distinguished chairman of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, and Senator Robert C. Byrd, who has \nserved with distinction as chairman of that committee in the past, and \nhe serves now, of course, as ranking minority Member. The Department of \nHealth and Human Services has declined to make any useful information \navailable to my staff or me. They say they have no records of how many \nhomosexual advocacy groups receive or have received Ryan White funds. \nThey have no record of what they do with it. But to that I say, why? \nWhy? And I think the American people are entitled to say, why? It is \nnot HHS money. It is not Jesse Helms' money, and it is not Nancy \nKassebaum's and certainly not Ted Kennedy's money, or any of his \naides'. It is the American people's money. They have a right to know \nthe full information.\n  Senators Hatfield and Byrd and other members of the distinguished \nSenate Appropriations Committee might start by inquiring officially and \nformally how much Federal money was delivered to, for example, the Gay \nMen's Health Crisis Organization in New York, or right here in \nWashington, how about the homosexual outfit, the Whitman Walker Clinic? \nSurely, the Appropriations Committee is entitled to know. Surely, the \nMembers of the Senate are entitled to know.\n  During the past 15 years, Mr. President--and I shall conclude \nshortly--AIDS has killed 270,000 people in this country.\n  Heart disease kills more than that in less than 5 months. Less than 2 \npercent of the deaths last year in America were the result of AIDS.\n  I go back to Ryan White. I was sorry for that young man then, and I \nam sorry for him now. He died at age 18 of AIDS, a disease that he \nalmost certainly contracted from that tainted blood that had its origin \nas a result of that homosexual airline flight attendant who was the \nfirst documented instance of the AIDS disease being brought into North \nAmerica from Africa.\n  We will never know, of course, the precise list of individuals who \npassed the HIV virus along--in what they call the generational series \nof homosexuals--to drug users, and one or more of them contributed to \nthat blood transfusion that Ryan White got.\n  But you know one thing, they were involved in it and they know it, \ntoo, but they want to obscure that. They usually go around Ryan White \nto attract sympathy for them, undeserved sympathy. I am talking about \nthe ones who have not caught it yet, but they are playing Russian \nroulette and they want the discovery to be made so it will be safe for \nthem. I do not think there is ever going to be a protection of that \nnature developed by science. I find myself hoping that it will be, but \nI just do not believe it is going to happen.\n  Ryan White was without blame. He was a hemophiliac who had to have a \nblood transfusion, but he did not deserve a fatal tainted blood \ntransfusion.\n  Ryan White was innocent, and I pass no judgment on any member of his \nfamily or any other family who has lost in such a way a member of their \nfamily. I do not have any real problem--I do not understand it--but I \ndo not have any problem with Ryan White's name being exploited by the \nkind of people who have acknowledged that they either cannot or will \nnot even try to restrain their impulses to prevent the further spread \nof AIDS.\n  Michael Fumento, an associate of the Competitive Enterprise Institute \nin Washington, has written a book that all Senators should read, but \nprobably will not. The name of the book is ``The Myth of Heterosexual \nAIDS.''\n  I wish some of the people in the press gallery would read it. Mr. \nFumento relates that he called the offices of a number of Senators to \ninquire about the fairness of devoting so much of the taxpayers' money \nto one disease at the expense of other diseases. He said he asked in \neach Senate office for a statement on the fairness of it all. And then \nhe wrote:\n\n       Wonder of wonders, I got no answer.\n\n  He concluded this way:\n\n       And while several Senators claim that as President they \n     would be tough enough to deal with America's foreign \n     adversaries, when it comes to AIDS activists, they go \n     crawling for the deepest foxhole.\n\n  I am not looking for a foxhole. What I want is for the American \npeople to be informed as to how this money is to be spent, where it is \nto be spent and by whom it is to be spent. Do not take the word of \nSenators who say, ``Well, we had in our State this situation,'' or \nothers, ``We had our situation and it's terrible,'' and so forth and so \non. Of course, it is terrible, but that does not address the problem. \nLet us find out how this money is being spent. That is all I have said \nat any time along the line. No foxhole for me. We will find out sooner \nor later what happened.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an op-ed column written \nby Mr. Fumento, published on June 19 by the Washington Times, be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, for the guidance of the clerk, the headline \nin the article is ``Bill Oils the AIDS Squeaky Wheel.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Times, June 19, 1995]\n\n                    Bill Oils the AIDS Squeaky Wheel\n\n                          (By Michael Fumento)\n\n       Grab your wallet, folks! The Senate is about to demonstrate \n     its boundless compassion again by spending billions of your \n     dollars. But this time it won't just be unfair to taxpayers \n     but to the great majority of Americans suffering from serious \n     diseases.\n       The subject of this latest act of largesse is the cynically \n     named Ryan White Act, which is up for reauthorization. With \n     58 co-sponsors, its Senate approval is virtually guaranteed, \n     though for the moment its passage is blocked by North \n     Carolina Republican Sen. Jesse Helms.\n       Enacted in 1990, ostensibly to provide care for such \n     victims as Ryan White, the measure was a sham from the start. \n     Young Ryan White was a hemophiliac who won the heart of the \n     nation after he contracted AIDS. He died at age 18. But only \n     2 percent of AIDS victims in 1990 were hemophiliacs, \n     according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention. Today it's 1 percent. Less than 2 percent of AIDS \n     victims are under the age of 20.\n       One wonders how the bill would have fared had it been named \n     the Robert Mapplethorpe Act, after the late homosexual \n     photographer famous for such depictions as bullwhips \n     extending from people's posteriors.\n       The Ryan White Act was also sold as a means of helping, as \n     National Commission on AIDS Chairwoman June Osborne put it, \n     the ``many parts of rural America [that] are about to be \n     blind-sided by the epidemic.'' Yet then, as now, cases from \n     non-metropolitan areas amounted to 5 percent of those \n     reported.\n       Predictably, almost all of the money went to those places \n     that had the most AIDS cases. This means not Ryan White's \n     town of Cicero, Ind., but rather New York City, Los Angeles, \n     San Francisco and other areas that also happened to be \n     Democratic strongholds. In other words, it followed the same \n     supply lines as all the Democratic pork of that era. The \n     money went for those who make up the bulk of\n      AIDS victims: homosexual men and intravenous drug abusers.\n       Further, even on a per-patient level, the bill resulted in \n     allocating several times more money per victim in larger \n     cities than in less-populated areas.\n       Misnaming and misrepresenting the act has paid handsomely. \n     In its first five years, spending more than doubled from $276 \n     million in 1991 to $664 million for this year, for a total of \n     over $2 billion.\n       This time around, the bill is sponsored by Kansas \n     Republican Sen. Nancy Kassebaum. When I called her office, \n     her aide cited--\n\n[[Page S10707]]\n     yes--the rural AIDS bogeyman. One wonders if the good senator knows \n     that Kansas has all of 245 AIDS cases last year, just 3 \n     percent of the national total. Of those, eight were children.\n       In fairness, Sen Kassebaum has rewritten the act so that \n     more money will be authorized for rural areas. But with so \n     few patients there, the money must necessarily flow right \n     back through the old pork pipeline established in 1990.\n       The biggest difference this time is that the estimated cost \n     will balloon from slightly more than $2 billion to $3.6 \n     billion. This even though the AIDS epidemic is declining. New \n     AIDS cases are being reported at a rate well below the 80,000 \n     of last year.\n       Yet even if the bill weren't such a budget-buster, it would \n     be terribly wrong.\n       Ryan White provides no money for medical research, so no \n     one will ever be cured of AIDS with all those billions of \n     spending. Along with some allocations for education that are \n     redundant with the $500 million\n      federal AIDS education budget, the Ryan White Act simply \n     provides money for treatment, drugs, free meals, in-home \n     care and the like.\n       It's nice that sick people can get such services regardless \n     of their income levels. But for anybody with any disease \n     besides AIDS the sign on the door reads, ``Go away!'' There \n     is no Gilda Radner Act for victims of ovarian cancer, no \n     Ronald Reagan Act for Alzheimer's disease patients. Some \n     elderly and indigent people with such diseases can qualify \n     for programs like Medicare and Medicaid, but then so can AIDS \n     patients.\n       No, the Ryan White Act was a gift to one extremely squeaky \n     wheel. Not content with a medical research budget that dwarfs \n     that of every other disease but cancer--despite being only \n     the ninth-greatest killer of Americans--the AIDS activists \n     demanded and got privileges that persons with other diseases \n     can't even dream about.\n       Quite simply, the homosexual activists want special \n     treatment because they themselves, and their friends, have an \n     extraordinary chance of contracting the disease. Somehow they \n     have translated ``Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!'' into a cry for \n     compassion. Long gone are the days when AIDS activists begged \n     merely to be treated no worse than the victims of diseases \n     not associated with behaviors society finds distasteful.\n       I called the offices of both Sen. Kassebaum and the other \n     Kansas senator, Bob Dole, for a statement about the fairness \n     issue. Wonder of wonders, I got none. To a Congress always \n     eager to take money from all of us and give it to some of us \n     to buy votes, fairness is a four-letter word. And while \n     several senators claim that as president they would be tough \n     enough to deal with America's foreign adversaries, when it \n     comes to AIDS activists they go crawling for the deepest \n     foxhole.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I would like to answer, some of the \nquestions that were raised by the Senator from North Carolina. I know \nhow much Senator Helms genuinely cares about this issue. I would like \nstart by saying that many of the 64 cosponsors of this legislation were \ncosponsors of the legislation in 1990. So they, I hope, are familiar \nwith what was in the bill then and what is in the bill now.\n  We have had a through hearing on this bill. A GAO report on the \nfunding equities and distribution, which had been requested by Senator \nBrown of Colorado and myself was used as the basis for that hearing. \nThe report had been requested because of our concern about equity of \nfunding for all individuals with AIDS.\n  I share with Senator Helms a concern about the fact that sometimes we \nare not able to do the type of oversight that we should, but with the \nhearing and the GAO report we were able to propose in this bill changes \nto provide equity in the distribution of funds.\n  It is sad, but true, that there are many who have been victims of \nHIV. Some individuals like Ryan White contracted this disease through \ncontaminated blood. Unfortunately, this illness has had a ripple effect \nwith involvement of individuals from many walks of life but also the \nfamily members of those infected have also suffered. So we have to be \nmindful of all who have suffered. I think that this epidemic must be \nviewed in the broader sense of the epidemic and the tragedy.\n  Senator Helms quoted figures related to the amount of money that has \nbeen expended for the major causes of deaths in this country. I lost a \nniece, several years ago to cancer. She had two small children. I \nremember through the years of her struggle with cancer discussing \nFederal Government funding levels for cancer. She questioned why there \ncould not be more expended for cancer research than we were spending on \nAIDS. I spent time researching this important question in hopes of \nfinding an answer. One thing that became apparent to me was that money \nthat goes into research for HIV is also very valuable for other \nillnesses like cancer.\n  The figures that Senator Helms gave were only for research, and I \nwould like to give figures that include not only the research \nexpenditures but also the moneys that come from Medicare, Medicaid, \nSocial Security disability funding, and the Public Health Service \nmoneys. For HIV and AIDS, it is about $5.4 billion a year; for cancer, \nabout $15 billion a year; for heart disease, about $34 billion a year.\n  One of the reasons that the Ryan White CARE legislation came into \nbeing, Mr. President, was to help provide assistance to those who were \nnot eligible for Medicare; because they were not yet of age to receive \nMedicare or to receive Medicaid, because they had an income level which \nwould not allow them to qualify. As we all know such medical care \nservices even those that are basic can be very costly.\n  That was the genesis of the Ryan White legislation. It has grown \nsignificantly in funding since 1990, but so have the number of AIDS \nvictims.\n  I suggested in 1990 that we do such sums. I do not think that this a \ngood approach for defining the level of authorizations. I would propose \nan amendment, if this would be of any benefit, to say define the \nfunding level for the first year which would be consistent with the \nappropriated levels reported recently by the House of Representatives. \nThe House appropriation figure just recently passed is $656 million for \n1996; then such sums in the following years. At least that puts a \nbenchmark which gives some consistency between the House and Senate.\n  Senator Helms mentioned a new title, title V, which was is slated to \nreceive a small amount of funding, $17 million, in this year's \nauthorization. I would like to explain this program a bit further. \nTitle V is for AIDS Education Training Centers [AETC]. This title is \nnot new. It has been moved from the health professions bill to this \nlegislation. It seemed appropriate to consolidate those efforts related \nto AIDS into one legislation.\n  AETC's are not a new program. It has been funded for many years. \nUnder this program, health providers are educated and trained in the \nbest ways to treat individuals with AIDS, particularly children and \nwomen. Given the complications and numerous illnesses which individuals \nwith AIDS often acquire, health providers benefit from this type of \neducation. I believe that patients also benefit from better trained \nphysicians and other providers. This explains why there is a new Title \nV, although we must remember that this is not new, but rather a program \nmoved from the Health Professions program to this legislation.\n  Mr. President, this is not a piece of legislation that is \nenthusiastically embraced by everyone. It raises fears. It raises \nconcerns. It certainly raised emotional levels and questions of \nmorality, which Senator Helms has noted.\n  I think the Senator from California earlier today, Senator Feinstein, \nspoke with real eloquence, of two people she personally knew, and how \nit affects so many. Sometimes people who do not fit the pattern that \nSenator Helms has mentioned are also infected.\n  AIDS touches people, not only those who are ill and/or dying, but it \ntouches many others as well. That is why the Ryan White bill came into \nbeing--not to take his name in vain. The intention was to provide \nservices that could be of help to families who are suffering--and to \npatients--who are infected with this disease.\n  I yield the floor. I do not know whether there are other amendments \nto be considered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1853\n\n    (Purpose: To require spousal notification in cases in which an \nindividual is diagnosed with infection with the human immunodeficiency \n                                 virus)\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have some amendments to come before the \nSenate. I do not intend to second-degree anybody else's amendment, and \nI hope we can just have up-and-down votes and get this bill out of the \nway.\n  Now, Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask it be \nstated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1853.\n\n\n[[Page S10708]]\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . SPOUSAL NOTIFICATION.\n\n       (a) Prohibition on the Use of Funds.--The Secretary shall \n     not make a grant under this Act to any State or political \n     subdivision of any State, nor shall any other funds made \n     available under this Act, be obligated or expended in any \n     State unless such State takes administrative or legislative \n     action to require that a good faith effort shall be made to \n     notify a spouse of an AIDS-infected patient that such AIDS-\n     infected patient is infected with the human immunodeficiency \n     virus.\n       (b) Definitions.--As used in this section--\n       (1) AIDS-Infected Patient.--The term ``AIDS-infected \n     patient'' means any person who has been diagnosed by a \n     physician or surgeon practicing medicine in such State to be \n     infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.\n       (2) State.--The term ``State'' means a State, the District \n     of Columbia, or any territory of the United States.\n       (3) Spouse.--The term ``spouse'' means a person who is or \n     at any time since December 31, 1976, has been the marriage \n     partner of a person diagnosed as an AIDS-infected patient.\n       (c) Effective Date.--Subsection (a) shall take effect with \n     respect to a State on January 1 of the calendar year \n     following the first regular session of the legislative body \n     of such State that is convened following the date of \n     enactment of this section.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Let me sum up this amendment. I think we had two votes \nagainst it the last time.\n  This amendment requires that States receiving Federal funds for AIDS \neducation and prevention take specific legislative and/or \nadministrative steps to make sure that spouses--that is, the wife or \nhusband--of an individual infected with the HIV/AIDS virus, that the \nspouse be promptly notified.\n  Let me say why I think we ought to vote on this again. Some years \nback, 2 or 3, I forget how long ago, there were several circumstances \nthat led me to draft this amendment at that time.\n  It began when I received a call from a young woman who worked on the \nHouse side of the Congress who said, ``Senator, my mother wants to come \nby and talk with you on a matter of confidence. She doesn't want you to \never use her name,'' and I shall not. They came, a lovely lady and her \nbeautiful daughter. I shall never forget that visit. The meeting did \nnot last long. After the usual amenities--and I had no idea what the \nlady wanted to discuss--but after the usual amenities, I seated them. \nThe three of us began to discuss why she had come and what I might be \nhelpful to her about.\n  At that point, tears welled up if that mother's eyes as she began to \ntell the story. She took a deep breath and stated the bottom line. She \nhad AIDS, she said, ``and I am dying.'' Her bisexual husband, you see, \nhad infected her with the AIDS virus. He had not informed her he was \ninfected, and State law in her State forbade the family doctor from \ntelling her--which I consider to be outrageous.\n  Now, Mr. President, we hear so much about protecting the \nconfidentiality of AIDS-infected patients, yet we hear nothing about \nthe fatal consequences of confidentiality laws. The homosexuals march \nin Washington, and they demand their rights, but what about the rights \nof this lovely lady and the thousands of others like her, potentially, \nwho, through no fault of their own, have become infected with the \ndeadly AIDS virus, or may be infected in the future?\n  Do they not have rights, too? Should there not be laws to protect the \ninnocent spouses, instead of those who hide behind the confidentiality \nlaw and, as in this case, are causing others to die?\n  What a terrible tragedy. Only 12 States protect the lives of spouses \nof HIV-infected citizens, only 12 States. Eighteen States provide for \nnotification of partners, but they are silent on the rights of spouses. \nWhat kind of fair play is that? And you know what I mean when I say \n``partner.''\n  Does this not lead to the conclusion that some States may appear more \nconcerned with protecting the interests of the HIV-positive spouse \ninstead of the life of the unsuspecting innocent spouse?\n  This amendment does not require States to initiate a spousal \nnotification program. It simply says that if States want Federal money, \nwhich they take from the taxpayer--if States want money to combat the \nAIDS virus, the AIDS disease, those States are going to have to make a \ngenuine and concerted effort to protect innocent spouses from being \nexposed to the AIDS virus.\n  It is time to start treating AIDS as the public health issue that it \nis, rather than the civil rights issue that it has become. I have no \ndoubt that if we take this step, it will help curb, to some extent at \nleast, the spread of this lethal disease.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, maybe, as a clarification of what we \ndid last year, it is my understanding that, in law, from what we had \nbefore, that each State is required to set up its own notification \nsystem. Is that correct?\n  Mr. HELMS. Not to my knowledge. But even if it is, if you will \nforgive me, it will not hurt the Senate to go on record again.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. No, I have no problem--I was just asking the Senator \nif he knew if that was not correct that each State is required to set \nup its own?\n  Mr. HELMS. My expert is sitting to my left, and sometimes to my right \nas well, and she says she does not know about that. And so, of course, \nI do not.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum for \na minute until we look at the language and get some comparison, so \nmaybe we can accept that.\n  Mr. HELMS. That is fine, just so there is no attempt to second-degree \nmy amendment, because then we will have protracted debate.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. No, I agree with the Senator. I know the effect of a \nsecond-degree amendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the pending \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I hope that this amendment will be \naccepted by the membership. I intend to vote for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment. On this question, \nthe yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett], is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Illinois [Mr. Simon], is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate turn \nto the consideration of S. 908, the State Department reauthorization \nbill, immediately following the disposition of S. 641, the Ryan White \nbill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I object. Let me just respond.\n  I was under the impression that we had an agreement that following \nthe disposition of the Ryan White Act, we would go back to the \nlegislation relating to gifts. That has been everyone's understanding. \nI am hopeful that we can do that. I think we are very close. I think we \ncould work under a time agreement.\n  I had the opportunity to talk to a number of those who have been \nactively involved in the negotiations, and I think progress is being \nmade. So there is really absolutely no reason at this point to move on \nto other legislation until we resolve that. I hope that all our \ncolleagues will understand that and will persist in keeping to the \nschedule that everyone was working under the assumption we would have, \nbeginning with the disposition of the Ryan White Act.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I might respond to the distinguished \nminority leader's comments, there is a lot of work underway on the gift \nrule issue. I think progress is being made. There are a couple of \ndifferent packages that are out there, with some potential amendments \npending. I do not think that we have come to closure on that, although \nwe are continuing to work in a bipartisan way, and we have meetings \nlater on tonight to see exactly where we are.\n  We would like to get some sort of understanding about what the \nprocedure would be for it to come up. I think we are getting there, but \nI do not think we are quite ready to go to the gift rule issue yet. It \nmay be that tomorrow we will be. I think the leader would like to do \nthat, intends to do that before this week is out, and we will continue \nto move in that direction.\n  In order for us to make sure that we have legislation ready to go, we \nneed to make this effort. But in view of the objection----\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I can respond briefly, and I \nappreciate the explanation given by the Senator from Mississippi, I \nsuspect what this means is there will be cloture motions filed. \nFrankly, I think the message that that sends is not the one that many \nof us would really like to see.\n  No one is holding up State Department authorization. No one is \nholding up foreign aid appropriations. No one is holding up any \nlegislation of which I am aware. So to lay down cloture motions under \nthese circumstances seems to me, first, premature, and then second, in \nviolation of what I thought was an understanding we had on both sides \nthat we would go to gifts.\n  There was not any axiom to that, any corollary that said it was only \nif we had some agreement about the procedure or about amendments that \nwe would return to gifts. The issue was, would we do gifts and lobbying \ntogether this week? The answer was, yes, we were going to do that. Now \nwe do not have that understanding. It is a violation, certainly, of the \nunderstanding that we have had on both sides.\n  So I am very disappointed, frankly, that the majority has seen fit to \nfile cloture motions prior to the time we even have any appreciation as \nto whether or not there are objections to the bills themselves or even \ngoing to the bills. There are none, to my knowledge.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to say as one who has been \nactively involved in trying to move these negotiations along this week \nand feeling we made great progress and actually came to conclusion on a \nunanimous vote on a lobby reform bill--I wonder how many people would \nhave thought that was possible 1 week ago. We did it.\n  We are now working feverishly to try to come to a reasonable \nagreement on the gift rule issue. There is no intent to not keep \ncommitments, and the fact is to keep them. We would like to continue to \ndo it in a low-key, reasonable and bipartisan way. We are going to do \nthat.\n  The leader has every intention of us doing what we said we would do \non gifts. He has kept his commitment to bring up both of them. We are \nworking. I think what he is hoping for is that those of us who are \ninvolved would get to a point and say, ``Yes, we are ready to go \nback.'' Both sides right now would say we are not quite there.\n  Having said that, also with regard to the cloture motion, while you \nmight say in the classic sense we have not had any filibusters this \nyear, in fact every bill we have had up this year, with maybe one or \ntwo exceptions, has been very lengthy with hundreds of amendments. I \nreally wonder sometimes how the Senate looks when we have 127 \namendments pending on a bill. What happened to the committee process \naround here?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Without getting into a further argument on that, if we do \nnot file a cloture motion now, then we would not be able to get a vote \non that by Friday. If we are going to be able to complete very vital \nlegislation before we leave for the August recess period, we have to \ncomplete the gift issue, hopefully we could complete regulatory reform, \nwe have State Department authorization.\n  You would think we would all like to get to conclusion on State \nDepartment authorization. We have the foreign aid authorization bill \npending, the DOD authorization bill pending, DOD appropriations and \nwelfare reform, all of which we would like to get done. If we are going \nto get them done, we cannot spend a week each on every bill. I will be \nglad to yield.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Just for a clarification. I am interested in knowing if \nthe cloture motions are on the bill or the motion to proceed, and if \nthey are on the motion to proceed, can the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi inform us on the number of filibusters on motions to \nproceed to bills so far this year?\n  Mr. LOTT. They are both on the motion to proceed and in anticipation \nof likely resistance to proceed. Maybe it will not occur, but that \npossibility does exist and there had been some indications that might \nhappen. Maybe it will not be necessary.\n  Let me say this, too. We always have the option--if we work out \nagreements, if we are making progress--we can vitiate these. But if we \nwait until Friday and we do have a filibuster on a motion to proceed \nand we are not making progress, it is too late then to file a cloture \nmotion, and then we are over to Saturday or next Monday or next \nTuesday.\n  I understand how the minority leader feels about this, and I know \nsometimes that filing cloture motions make it more difficult for us to \nsort of get together. But you must also understand, as the majority \nleader did in the previous Congresses, you have to try to find a way to \nmove things along.\n  It is not easy. It is very hard. I had no appreciation whatsoever of \nwhat the majority leader is up against in the Senate, when Senator \nMitchell was the majority leader. Now I have had a chance, being a \nlittle closer as the whip, to see what the majority leader goes through \nof either party, and it is a very tough job with the rules we have in \nthe Senate.\n  This is not intended to slight anybody. It is not intended to make \nanybody mad. It is intended to try to have an opportunity to move the \nprocess along, and I hope that it will be taken in that spirit. The \nlast time a cloture \n\n[[Page S10710]]\nmotion was filed, I think it was vitiated. We did not go through with \nit. But we have to have that option, as we move this legislative \nprocess through.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will be very brief. Let me just say, I \nappreciate the answers given by the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi.\n  He did not answer my question as to the number of votes cast, or I \nshould say the number of cloture votes taken, or the number of \nfilibusters actually endured as we consider the motion to proceed. If I \nrecall, there is not one.\n  Last year and the year before, there were many occasions when the \nmajority leader was compelled to file a cloture petition because there \nwas a filibuster on the motion to proceed.\n  I will simply restate for clarification, we had an agreement. The \nagreement was we go back to gifts when this legislation is finished. We \nare in violation of that agreement, No. 1. No. 2, I think it sends the \nwrong message about the desire of the majority to work with us in \ntrying to accommodate an agenda. We were only given this a couple of \nminutes ago.\n  I am surprised and disappointed. We will work through it and we will \ncertainly do our best to accommodate the schedule. We also would like \nto see a completion of a lot of these items. I think we can do so \nwithout throwing cloture petitions down prior to the time we even have \nsome consultation as to whether it is necessary.\n  I thank the Senator. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just one further response, and I think we \ncan move this issue along. One of the reasons we perhaps have not \nalready finished the gift rule issue is that the majority leader wanted \nto accommodate the President on the Bosnian resolution question.\n  He deferred action from last week over to this week by agreement on \nboth sides, and in an effort to accommodate the President and allow \nmore time to pass so that maybe something different would change in \nBosnia, or with regard to the situation in the United Nations. That is \nwhy we went back to Bosnia. Everybody understood that. We were not \nquite ready anyway on gift.\n  Plus, I might note, I do not believe there was any agreement that we \nwould go to Ryan White before we went back to gift. We went to the Ryan \nWhite bill because there was agreement that we could take it up and \nhopefully complete it, and in the meantime we could continue to work on \nthe gift rule.\n  We already have not done exactly what maybe was intended, but for \ngood reason. We went to the Bosnia resolution because we did not \ncomplete it by agreement last week. We went to Ryan White because we \nwere ready to go, and then we can keep working on the gift bill.\n  We will continue to work with the distinguished Democratic leader, \nand hopefully be able to finish all of these bills that we have \nscheduled before the week is out, and at a reasonable hour on Friday, \nalso.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/26/senate-section/article/S10709-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I want to talk to my colleagues for a \nmoment regarding the situation which has arisen on the question of \nholding public hearings on the charges brought by the Senate Ethics \nCommittee against Senator Packwood, and as a result of remarks on the \nfloor last Friday by the Ethics Committee chairman.\n  First, I want to briefly tell Members of the Senate where the process \nnow stands, in terms of the Ethics Committee. The Ethics Committee \nrules provide for a three-tier process. The first stage, preliminary \ninquiry; second stage, initial review; and the investigation phases.\n  The Ethics Committee completed its preliminary inquiry and voted on \nMay 16 of this year to skip the initial review phase and move into the \nfinal investigative phase.\n  Since the three-tier process was created, only four other cases have \ngone to the final investigative stage. The committee found there is \nsubstantial credible evidence that a violation may have occurred in 18 \nincidents of alleged sexual misconduct, intentional tampering with the \nevidence, and improperly soliciting financial assistance.\n  At that point, under our rules, the committee offered Senator \nPackwood an opportunity to appear before the committee, and he availed \nhimself of that opportunity on June 27-29.\n  As the media has reported, when the Senate returned from the July 4 \nrecess, the committee began meeting again. At that point in the \nprocess, it was time for the committee to make a decision on what else \nneeded to be done in the investigative phase, including the question of \nholding public hearings. That is where the process stood when the \ncommittee met on July 11 and 12; meetings which have been duly reported \nin the media.\n  I went to the July 12 meeting thinking we would vote that day on the \nquestion of holding public hearings. The media has reported that the \ncommittee did not vote that day and that the meeting set for July 13 \nwas canceled. The chairman of the Ethics Committee acknowledged on the \nfloor last Friday that no other meetings are planned.\n  One thing I want to make clear, without getting into a long debate at \nthis time on the merits of public hearings, is that holding public \nhearings in this case would be consistent with a long and well-\nestablished precedent. Those of us who are advocating public hearings \nare not trying to change the rules of the game. All four other cases \nwhich went into the final investigative phase had public hearings. \nIndeed, every major ethics case this century has had public hearings. \nThis would be the first case to be the exception.\n  The process needs to move forward. I know of no reason the Ethics \nCommittee has not met nor any reason why the committee has not voted on \nthe question of holding public hearings. I am fully prepared to do so. \nWe have now gone 2 weeks without a committee hearing.\n  Today I wrote the chairman, appealing to him to call a meeting of the \nEthics Committee this week for the purpose of voting on the question of \nholding public hearings. Whatever may happen or not happen on the floor \nis a separate issue. There is simply no reason for the committee to \ndelay further, and I hope the chairman will establish a meeting time \nthis week so the committee can proceed with its business.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. And I thank my colleagues for \ntheir accommodation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/26/senate-section/article/S10711-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10711-S10712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RYAN WHITE CARE REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1854\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of amounts made available under this act \nfor the promotion or encouragement of homosexuality or intravenous drug \n                                  use)\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have an amendment. I send it to the desk \nand ask it be stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1854.\n       At the end, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . PROHIBITIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF FEDERAL \n                   FUNDS\n\n       (a) Promotion or Encouragement of Certain Activities.--No \n     funds authorized to be appropriated under this Act may be \n     used to promote or encourage, directly or indirectly, \n     homosexuality, or intravenous drug use.\n       (b) Definition.--As used in subsection (a), the term `to \n     promote or encourage, directly or indirectly, homosexuality' \n     includes, but is not limited to, affirming homosexuality as \n     natural, normal, or healthy, or, in the process of addressing \n     related `at-risk' issues, affirming in any way that engaging \n     in a homosexual act is desirable, acceptable, or permissible, \n     or, describing in any way techniques of homosexual sex.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as the distinguished clerk has just \nindicated, this amendment is simple. Forest Gump could understand this \none.\n  I do not intend to take up a lot of time. I just say it is just a \nsimple act of responsibility on the part of the Senate to make sure \nthat no taxpayers' money--not a cent, not a farthing--distributed under \nthe Ryan White legislation, shall be used in the promotion of \nhomosexuality as being natural or normal--or that poppycock about just \nanother lifestyle. None of the above is the case.\n  This amendment, therefore, takes another important step toward \nremoving the Ryan White Act from politics. It provides a safeguard to \nmake sure that Federal funds--that is to say the American taxpayers' \nmoney--ostensibly provided to help victims of the AIDS virus, these \nfunds shall not be used to push the radical agenda of the homosexual \nactivists.\n  I have said many times--and a lot of people do not like my saying it; \nthat suits me all right. I do not like them not liking it. But, if the \nproponents of this bill really want to help those in need, let us make \nsure that we help those in need and not let the Ryan White funds be \nused for such outrageous, extraneous things.\n  This is not the first time I brought up this subject. About 8 years \nago, I think it was, I submitted an amendment that prevented any funds \nused by the Centers for Disease Control for \n\n[[Page S10712]]\n\nAIDS education, the kind of education that would be used to promote \nhomosexuality. And, believe me, it was going on.\n  This amendment passed the Senate 94 to 2. I certainly can think of no \nreason why this amendment, the pending one, should not pass by a \nsimilar margin. But if any Senator wishes, he or she can come by this \ndesk and we can look at the rollcall of 7 or 8 years ago. We do have \nit.\n  The promotion of homosexual conduct as acceptable or permissible or \njust another lifestyle flies directly in the face of what a sound AIDS \npolicy ought to be. Mr. President, 53 percent of AIDS cases, more than \nhalf of the AIDS cases in America, have come about through male/male \nsexual relations. This being true--and the Centers for Disease Control \nhas documented it to be true--then why on Earth should any Federal \nmoney, even a penny, be used to promote activity that has proven to be \nthe leading cause of AIDS?\n  Mr. President, I wish I had a nickel for every time I have come on \nthis floor and implored Senators to treat the AIDS disease as a public \nhealth issue instead of a civil rights issue. But, judging from the \nclamor and shouting over the past several weeks, these words continue \nto be ignored--certainly in the media, and certainly by the AIDS \nactivists. They have run up and down the corridors of the Senate, \nbuttonholed Senators, and all the rest of it. We will see how effective \nthey have been.\n  If this bill passes without any one of the amendments that I intend \nto offer, we will know something about the effectiveness of the AIDS \nlobbyists.\n  I am going to say it again and be through. AIDS is not a civil rights \nissue, it is a public health issue and a serious one, and the money \nought to be spent in that regard, not for the promotion of \nhomosexuality or the advocacy that homosexuality is just another \nlifestyle. The last thing Congress should do is to allow any of the \nAmerican taxpayers' money to be used to promote the very behavior that \nis responsible for spreading this disease.\n  What homosexuals do behind closed doors is their own business. But \nthey have no claim--none--on the taxpayers' money. This amendment \nsimply prevents the use of tax money to portray homosexual conduct as \nacceptable or permissible. The Federal Government has no business \nfinancing the promotion of homosexuality, it never should, and as long \nas I am a Member of the Senate, I am going to be on my feet protesting \nthe use of moneys in that way--or the misuse of it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I was trying to get a copy of the \nlanguage that had been used. The Senator from North Carolina mentioned \nwe had passed that before? He mentioned it had passed by a large vote \nbefore. I was just wondering if it was the same language as in this, \nthe exact same language?\n  I do not think anyone could quarrel with the language that would say \nnone of the funds authorized under a title should be used to fund AIDS \nprograms or to develop materials to promote, encourage, directly or \nindirectly, homosexuality or intravenous drug use. But I was uncertain \nabout getting into a definition of homosexuality. But I clearly have no \nobjection to say that no funds should be authorized to be used for \npromotion. If I may, I want to look at the language that we passed \nbefore.\n  Mr. HELMS. If the Senator, the manager of the bill, let me know if we \ncan get the yeas and nays, to set this one aside, and make it one back-\nto-back rollcall vote at 6 o'clock.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is 20 minutes of. We have been interested in getting \nto this amendment. I was just handed this amendment. It is on a subject \nmatter that I am hopeful that we can work through in terms of what I \nthink would be an agreeable--may not be agreeable to all--but at least \nan approach which I think would achieve the stated objective but would \nnot necessarily prohibit medical services, for example, to a targeted \ncommunity. But quite frankly I did not have this. We just received this \namendment, and I have no idea what the next amendment is. So as much as \nI would like to move this along, we could move along much faster if we \ndid have an opportunity to examine the amendments prior to the time \nthat they are addressed and called up.\n  Mr. President, we all agree that it is not the business of the \nFederal Government to promote or encourage any kind of sexual \nactivities whether they are homosexual or heterosexual, and it is \ncertainly not the business of Government to promote or encourage \nillegal activities such as drug use. I hold that view, as do 99 of my \nSenate colleagues, I am sure. But that is not to prohibit desperately \nneeded funds for organizations on the front lines of this epidemic. The \nthrust of the amendment has been to deny funding to organizations that \nserve gay communities or HIV drug users, like the highly respected AIDS \nAction Committee in Boston or AIDS Atlanta. Over the years similar \namendments have been offered to restrict the use of AIDS prevention \nfunds under the theory that targeted AIDS education that acknowledges \nthe existence of homosexuality or drug use somehow promotes such \nactivity.\n  That is the nub of the concern that we would have, or at least I \nwould in terms of the reaction to the Senator's amendment.\n  We have, as the Senator from Kansas pointed out, addressed this at \nother times. If we had had the opportunity to at least know that this \nwas going to be up, we would have been able to be perhaps more \nrelevant. But the thrust of this amendment has been to restrict the use \nof any AIDS prevention funds under the theory that targeted AIDS \neducation that acknowledges the existence of homosexuality or drug use \nsomehow promotes such activity.\n  If you had an organization, for example, that is providing services, \nand that included volunteers, are you encouraging, are you promoting or \nare you not promoting? Are you effectively limiting the opportunities \nfor those organizations that are attempting to try and deal with the \npublic health issue? Are you curtailing their opportunities to have \nsome kind of impact in a public health way?\n  I think this is the principal concern that we would have on this \nparticular issue.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I appreciate being able to see a copy \nof what perhaps was before, which was an amendment on the \nappropriations bill, not the Ryan White legislation. And it did not \nhave a definition in it either. Again, it was language designed to \nprohibit funds to be used for promotion activities. As I said, I \ncertainly think there would be concurrence with that.\n  If the Senator from North Carolina wants the legislation in the \namendment that he has presented to be voted on without any need of \namending it, I certainly respect that and we will have an up-or-down \nvote. I will intend later on to offer an amendment which would be the \nsame language as the Senator from North Carolina but without the \ndefinition part, and would suggest perhaps, if we want to go ahead with \nthe second amendment, as the Senator says, we could have back-to-back \nvotes.\n  Mr. HELMS. It is not necessary to get the yeas and nays yet on this \npending amendment.\n  So we will lay that aside, if the Chair will permit us to do so, and \nI ask unanimous consent to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator be good enough to yield for the purpose \nof a quorum call?\n  Mr. HELMS. Certainly.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/26/senate-section/article/S10711-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10712-S10713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE KOREAN WAR\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the 40th anniversary of the Korean war \nwill \n\n[[Page S10713]]\nbe celebrated in the Nation's capital, indeed in Korea, and in many \nother places this week. I was privileged to have a small and modest \nparticipation in that war as a member of the U.S. Marine Corps. I \nvolunteered for a second period of active military service, having \nserved briefly at the end of World War II.\n   The three of us in the Senate--as far as I know, there are only \nthree who served in the Marines in Korea--are going to address the \nSenate in sequence over the next 3 days. It is my privilege to make \nbrief remarks today. My understanding is that the distinguished Senator \nfrom Ohio, Mr. Glenn, who was in Marine Corps aviation, will speak \ntomorrow, and on the third day our distinguished colleague from Rhode \nIsland, Senator Chafee.\n  Mr. President, it is most fitting at this time to pause to reflect on \nthe service and sacrifice of America's 5.7 million Korean war veterans \nand those from 21 other nations which made up a multinational force \nthat responded to the call of freedom with the invasion by North Korea \ninto the South Korean province.\n  I take great pride in having had the opportunity to have served in \nthe U.S. Marine Corps. I entered service on October 3, having \nvolunteered during the summer of 1950. I went to Quantico with a group \nof officers, most of whom had, like me, served for a brief period in \nWorld War II. And then eventually most of us saw service in Korea.\n  To go back historically, on June 25, 1950, the North Korean People's \nArmy had invaded the Republic of Korea in a forceable effort allegedly \nto unify that landmass into a Communist state. The North Koreans swept \nover the 38th parallel and occupied Seoul, South Korea's capital, in a \nvery short period of time.\n  The U.N. Security Council immediately called upon the free world to \nrender assistance to the struggling South Korean Government. President \nHarry S. Truman, a very courageous President and one who was a strong \nfoe of communism, saw this as an effort of communism to spread in the \nworld, and immediately he responded to the U.N. call for assistance and \nordered the 7th Fleet and the Far Eastern air units to support the \nSouth Korean military forces.\n  Truman's Far Eastern Commander, Gen. Douglas MacArthur, made it clear \nthat only American ground forces could prevent the complete collapse of \nthe Republic of Korea.\n The President agreed. And in early July American forces joined the \nSouth Korean military forces on land, sea and air, and in operations \nagainst the North Korean's People's Army. At the outbreak of the Korean \nwar the U.S. Marine Corps was in the condition of less than full \nreadiness.\n\n  Recalling that period of history very vividly, because having served \nfor approximately 2 years in the Marine Corps Reserve prior to this, I \nwas well aware, as were all other marines, that our funds had been cut \nback severely in that period of time, and the readiness was at less \nthan full state. That was because of 5 years of declining budgets. The \nMarine Corps' strength had dropped from nearly half-million men and \nwomen in 1945 to only 75,000 men and women in June 1950.\n  Nevertheless, Gen. Clifton B. Case, then Commandant of the Marine \nCorps, felt that the marines, many of whom were seasoned veterans of \nWorld War II, could effectively meet the challenge of battle. He \ntherefore, together with the Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Forrest D. \nSherman, advised MacArthur that the 1st Marine Division would be ready \nfor action whenever called.\n  General Case foresaw MacArthur's response and put his marines \nworldwide on alert. He recommended additionally a recall of Reserves in \nan effort to bring the Marine Corps' strength up. And how well I recall \nthe first basic class of which I was a member in October 1950. They \nwere all Reserves recalled to active duty, as I said, many having \nserved for periods during World War II. Within a very brief period, the \nmarines once again would be sailing across the Pacific to answer their \nNation's call to arms to defend freedom.\n  Mr. President, as I rise to make these brief remarks today, I am \nreminded of those with whom I was privileged to serve who gave their \nfull measure, who gave their life in the cause of freedom in that \nconflict.\n  I was, for a brief period, with a squadron in the 3rd Marine Air \nWing, and eventually with an air group, Marine Air Group 33. And each \nday sorties were flown. And, regrettably, periodically a number did not \nreturn.\n  I shall recall one individual very well. His name was Captain Cole. \nCaptain Cole had been a member of VMF 321, a marine squadron operating \nout of Anacostia, prior to its transformation to a helicopter base. We \nhad been very close friends, as I likewise was a member of the Reserves \nin that squadron. Captain Cole was a school teacher. He had served in \nWorld War II but when his squadron, VMF 321 was called to active duty, \nhe unhesitatingly responded and joined.\n  On November 11, 1951, by chance the airplane in which I was then an \nobserver landed at an airfield where Captain Cole was stationed. And \nthat was the last time I saw him. Four weeks later he was killed in the \nline of duty in Korea. And I am everlastingly grateful that his family \nhas allowed me to hang in my office a picture of my dear friend, \nCaptain Cole. I mention him only because there were many others, but he \nwas an example of an American having come back from World War II, \nremaining in the Reserves so this country could be strong. Dedicating \nhis life to teaching children. And unhesitatingly responding to the \ncall of battle. I recently had the opportunity to meet with his son who \nwas a very young person at the time of his death. So that I could \nconvey to him some of my recollections about his father.\n  Mr. President, I am privileged to join here in these remarks. And I \nlook forward to hearing the remarks of two other veterans of that \nconflict, Senators Glenn and Chafee, who were far more active in the \ncombat role than I. And who deserve the great respect for having made \ntheir contribution in this conflict in the cause of freedom.\n  I yield the floor. And I thank very much my colleagues for allowing \nme to make these brief remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/26/senate-section/article/S10712-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10713-S10714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RYAN WHITE CARE REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  Are we back now on the Helms amendment?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. We would be. My understanding, Mr. President, is that \nthere are some negotiations on the Democratic side of the aisle that \nare ongoing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At the present time the Chair announces the \nHelms amendment No. 1854 has been set aside.\n  So we are simply on the bill.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to speak briefly.\n  First of all, in transition, let me thank the Senator from Virginia \nfor his remarks. I did not mean to make such an abrupt transition from \nyour very personal and powerful remarks. I apologize. Sometimes we rush \nso much we are impolite. I hope I was not.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I was unaware. I was totally absorbed in \nwhat I was saying. But I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. President, this amendment, which I gather has been set aside, and \nI gather there are some negotiations going on, would set a prohibition \non the use of Federal funds. And, as I look at this, community-based \norganizations--part of the definition would be the promotion or \nencouragement of certain activities--``No funds authorized to be \nappropriated under this act may be used to promote or encourage, \ndirectly or indirectly, homosexuality, intravenous drug use.'' Let me \ntalk about ``encourage, directly or indirectly, homosexuality.'' We \nwent through this debate before, Mr. President, when we were talking \nabout any activities in schools that would promote directly or \nindirectly homosexuality. \n\n[[Page S10714]]\n\n  Mr. President, with all due respect to my colleague from North \nCarolina, I do not know--I have to believe that this is not the \nintended effect--but what the effect of this amendment would be, the \neffect of this amendment would be very cruel and mean spirited and \nharsh and beyond the goodness of the vast majority of people in this \ncountry, because the way this amendment reads--and I certainly hope \nthere will be some change--if you had community-based clinics, say you \nhave the Minnesota AIDS project, and some young man came in and he was \ntalking to some of the people there and he said, ``Look, I am gay, and \nmy family is ashamed of me and a lot of my friends shun me. And I do \nnot want to live. I am thinking about taking my life. I feel \nworthless.'' If those men and women that are working at that community-\nbased clinic said to that young man, ``The fact that you are gay does \nnot make you any less of a human being. You are a person of worth, \ndignity and substance. And, for God's sake, you do not want to take \nyour life. You can live a life of contribution to community. You can \nlive a life of contribution to country, a contribution to world. And \nyou certainly do not want to take your life,'' by the wording of this \namendment, those individuals that were working at this community-based \nclinic would be encouraging homosexuality as a way of life.\n  We cannot have amendments worded like this on the floor of the \nSenate. This is just too cruel. I am not going to say that the intent \nof it is too cruel because I do not want to believe that. But the \neffect of it would be cruel and harsh. It goes beyond the goodness of \npeople in the country and it goes beyond the goodness of Senators \nregardless of their political party. And this amendment as now worded \nshould be defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The absence of a quorum has been \nsuggested.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. May I ask a question before the Senator asks for the \nquorum call?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I withdraw the request.\n  Mr. HELMS. What is up? We are supposed to be working on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Excuse me. We are under a quorum call.\n  Does the Senator from North Carolina ask for it to be dispensed with?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I withdraw it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the quorum call is \ndispensed with.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Certainly. Please explain to me. We were trying to be \nthrough, finished with this bill at 6. And I, as a matter of courtesy \nto the Senator from Massachusetts, permitted him to enter a quorum \ncall.\n  I had the floor. I did not have to do that.\n  When can we expect some action on these amendments and the bill? I \nunderstand the Democrats have a problem with something else that I have \nnothing to do with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome working out a process and \nprocedure by which we can get a determination and a judgment on these \nmeasures. I have been told that there will be objection to having the \nvotes this evening, that we would not be able to move toward the votes. \nBut we could work out an agreement which would permit a vote up or down \non the Senator's amendments, and also other amendments as well, that \nwould be related to the Senator's amendments. I was consulting with the \nchairman of the committee to try and see how that process could be \nrealized.\n  Obviously, I have no objection to the Senator talking or speaking or \ndebating these matters. What I was trying to do was work out with the \nfloor manager at least a process and a procedure so that we could get \nvotes on the amendments of the Senator from North Carolina and also on \namendments that are related to the similar subjects and do that in a \nway which will accommodate the greatest number of Members.\n  Mr. HELMS. But the Senator just said they were not going to permit \nany more votes tonight. Who is not?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. There is objection to moving towards the conclusion of \nthe votes, to having votes this evening.\n  Mr. HELMS. So what the Senator is saying then is that the \nannouncement I made that we would attempt to have two more rollcall \nvotes and then finish the debate on the remaining amendments and go to \na vote tomorrow morning on two remaining amendments and final passage \nof the Ryan White bill, that is being objected to, now, is that it?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I want to say to the Senator, the Senator made that \nrequest at 5:30 without us getting a chance to review those amendments. \nAs far as I am concerned, we ought to get a judgment, and I am quite \nprepared to stay here to get a judgment. But there has been an issue \nand question in terms of the scheduling, as a result of the requests \nthat have been made by the acting majority leader. Those matters are \nbeing discussed by the leadership, and they believe that if we could \nwork out at least a process by which we could debate or discuss these \nmatters tonight with a judgment so that we could vote on these matters \nand matters related to those issues tomorrow, that that would be a way \nof proceeding.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from North \nCarolina will yield to me just for a moment to pose a question.\n  Mr. HELMS. Certainly. I hope you can clear it up. I do not understand \nwhat he is saying.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Maybe I can try. I think that the minority leadership \nwas concerned about the cloture motions that were filed and how that \nwould affect scheduling. It has nothing to do with the Ryan White CARE \nlegislation. It does, unfortunately, pose a problem for us. And it is \nmy understanding there would not be an objection if we could put down a \nlisting of all of the amendments yet to be debated. We can debate some \ntonight and then the votes would be tomorrow; is that correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That would be it.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I wonder if we can suggest the absence of a quorum at \nthis point and see if we can put together a UC agreement which all \nparties could support.\n  Mr. HELMS. I will agree to that if I may ask unanimous consent that \nwhen I choose to ask that the quorum call be rescinded, that I be \nrecognized to do so and that it occur.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Did the Senator from North Carolina ask not \nonly that he be recognized to call off a quorum call but that the \ncalling off of the quorum call be guaranteed?\n  Mr. HELMS. Absolutely, 100 percent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is a request that cannot be granted, as \neach Senator has the right to object to the unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. HELMS. I will retain the floor. We will stand in limbo.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield? Can we ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senator be recognized after the quorum call is terminated?\n  Mr. HELMS. That would be all right.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \ntermination of the quorum call, the Senator from North Carolina be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMON.

Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suppose I am like a great many Americans on this whole subject, and \nwhat we are dealing with in the problem of recognizing homosexuality, \nand this problem in our society.\n  I grew up in a home where we had strong opinions against prejudice, \n\n[[Page S10715]]\n  against people because they were African Americans or Jewish Americans. \nBut frankly, I did not understand this problem. I was not hostile to \npeople who were gay, but I did not understand that they faced some \nspecial problems. The reality is, they do. I think we have to recognize \nthat factor.\n  I also would add, because it is not only this bill, but we face it in \nthe military and other places. When I was in the military, I was in \npart of something that no longer exists, the Counter Intelligence \nCorps. Among other things, we screened people for security clearances.\n  If there were people who were gay, they did not get security \nclearances. This goes back to 1951 to 1953. I happen to think that was, \nat that point, a very legitimate reason for not having security \nclearances, because people could be blackmailed.\n  If we decide we are not going to have people that are gay in the \nmilitary, say we have an emergency, and then we have to have selective \nservice, we conscript people, are we going to say that anyone who is \ngay is not going to be drafted? We are going to end up with an awful \nlot of gays in this country if we determine that.\n  I think there are practical problems. I think we should recognize \nthis. Now, does that mean that everyone approves of this lifestyle? \nThat is not the question. The question is discrimination.\n  For those--and I run into this at town meetings, and I am sure the \nPresiding Officer has--people who say, what about the Bible. The ten \ncommandments include adultery. Some of the other things did not get \nmentioned.\n  I recall my army days. If we had decided we would kick everyone out \nwho was involved in adultery, our branches would have been thinned \nappreciably.\n  I think we have to recognize that there are weaknesses in society, \nbut that discrimination is not the route that we ought to be going.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/26/senate-section/article/S10714-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10715-S10728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RYAN WHITE CARE REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1855\n\n(Purpose: To limit amounts appropriated under title XXVI of the Public \n Health Service Act to the level of such appropriations in fiscal year \n                                 1995)\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask it \nbe stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1855.\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. . Notwithstanding any provisions of this Act, there is \n     authorized to be appropriated for each of the fiscal years \n     1996 through 2000, amounts that do not exceed the amounts \n     appropriated under this Act in fiscal year 1995.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as the clerk has indicated, and I say the \namendment as read speaks for itself, this amendment proposes to freeze \nFederal funding authorizations for the years 1996 through 2000 at an \namount not exceeding the fiscal year 1995 funding for HIV-AIDS. The \namount appropriated for fiscal year 1995 totals $633 million of the \ntaxpayers' money.\n  I consider this amendment is essential--imperative, as a matter of \nfact, to close a vast loophole in the pending bill. As currently \nwritten, the Ryan White Reauthorization Act authorizes funding for the \nRyan White programs:\n\n       At such sums as may be necessary in each of the fiscal \n     years 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000.\n\n  As I said earlier, some of the proponents say, ``This does not mean \nanything. It still has to go through the authorization and \nappropriations process,'' which is true. But it has a psychological \neffect, when it has been written into the Ryan White authorization bill \nthat the appropriations will be ``such sums as may be necessary.''\n  So, as I said earlier, if it does not mean anything let us take it \nout. Because whenever I see vague, open-ended funding language such as \nthis, I can understand why the Federal debt is approaching $5 trillion. \nIt stands at about $4.9 trillion now.\n  Congress should never write a blank check for any purpose. The least \nwe can do for the American taxpayers is to specify the amount of \nFederal funding, with no obfuscation, no vagueness, no whatever.\n  Taxpayers will be interested to know that the total estimated outlays \nunder the current act are $3.68 billion. That is $3,680,000,000 over a \n5-year period. So we are not talking about chickenfeed. We are talking \nabout real money; real money that can run up the debt, the Federal \ndebt, that will be on the backs of the young people of this country for \ngenerations.\n  This $3.68 billion does not include NIH funding or the many other \nFederal programs dealing with HIV-AIDS.\n  Federal funding for AIDS research and prevention within the Public \nHealth Service has increased from $200,000 in 1981--$200,000 in 1981--\nto $2,700,000,000 in 1995.\n  When all the other Federal funds spent on HIV-AIDS are included, the \ntotal is about $7.1 billion for fiscal year 1995.\n  We have an arrangement in the process, I will say parenthetically, \nthat I will present each of my amendments.\n  Have we obtained the yeas and nays on the amendment set aside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been requested on \nthe amendments set aside.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on that \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not appropriate to ask for the yeas and \nnays on an amendment which is not before the body. The Senator can ask \nunanimous consent.\n  Mr. HELMS. I ask, for the purpose of obtaining the yeas and nays, \nthat these two amendments be considered the pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I send an unprinted amendment to the desk \nand ask it be stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an amendment pending.\n  Mr. HELMS. I ask unanimous consent that it be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1856\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure that Federal employees will not be required to \n            attend or participate in AIDS training programs)\n\n  Mr. HELMS. I withdraw that amendment and send another amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1856.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . OPTIONAL PARTICIPATION OF FEDERAL EMPLOYEES IN AIDS \n                   TRAINING PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provisions of \n     law, a Federal employee may not be required to attend or \n     participate in an AIDS or HIV training program if such \n     employee refuses to consent to such attendance or \n     participation. An employer may not retaliate in any manner \n     against such an employee because of the refusal of such \n     employee to consent to such attendance or participation.\n       (b) Definition.--As used in subsection (a), the term \n     ``Federal employee'' has the same meaning given the term \n     ``employee'' in section 2105 of title 5, United States Code, \n     and such term shall include members of the armed forces.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the pending amendment was made essential \nbecause of a directive issued by President Clinton on September 30, \n1993, in which he ordered all heads of executive departments and \nagencies to develop and \n\n[[Page S10716]]\nfully implement a comprehensive HIV/AIDS workplace policy and employee \neducation prevention program. The White House staff made it mandatory \nfor every Federal employee--an unreasonable requirement on its face, \nand particularly so considering the nature of these so-called education \nprograms.\n  For the record, the White House Office of National AIDS Policy issued \nmandatory ``guidelines'' stating:\n\n       HIV/AIDS workplace training is mandatory for every Federal \n     employee . . . (and) the duration of the training session \n     should be not less than 2 hours, although 3 hours is the \n     recommended length . . .\n\n  Mr. President, it may be useful to examine one agency's training \nprogram. The Department of Agriculture's AIDS program--which employees \nare compelled to attend--counsels Federal employees on the proper ways \nto engage in oral and anal sex and other similarly inappropriate \nsubject matters.\n  This is an editorial judgment on my part. I consider it outrageous--\nnot just inappropriate, outrageous. I took it up with the Agriculture \nDepartment, and we are having a go at that.\n  This is an arrogant and nauseating abuse of power by the homosexuals \nin the Federal bureaucracy. Most Federal employees resent it.\n  We have had scores of Federal employees to protest to us and ask us \nto do something about it.\n  For example, let me to read from a letter I received from a USDA \nemployee in North Carolina after the employee attended one of these so-\ncalled training classes:\n\n       This week we were required to attend a mandatory HIV/AIDS \n     training session which is apparently required by the \n     President of all Federal employees. This results in millions \n     of dollars in lost man-hours and consequently wages. We also \n     were required to take a pre- and post-class test . . . Since \n     we are mostly biological scientists we learned essentially \n     nothing.\n\n  The employee continued:\n\n       Some of the material is not appropriate for the workplace \n     (e.g. how to have safe oral sex, page 28), and it does not \n     seem too necessary for government time and money.\n\n  That is an understatement by the employee.\n  Mr. President, I also have at hand a copy of a directive issued by \nthe Foreign Agriculture Service which states:\n\n       To comply with this Presidential mandate, the Foreign \n     Agriculture service is presenting the attached MANDATORY HIV/\n     AIDS training sessions.\n       Please attend the session scheduled as indicated or arrange \n     to switch session with a coworker.\n       Supervisors are responsible for disseminating this \n     information to there (sic) . . .\n\n  They misspelled the word ``there,''   t-h-e-r-e. They \nmeant t-h-e-i-r. They will learn how to spell that word next week.\n\n     employees and for certifying that all employees under their \n     supervision attend a session of the mandated training . . . \n     THIS IS MANDATORY TRAINING FOR ALL FEDERAL EMPLOYEES . . . \n     ATTENDANCE WILL BE TAKEN. . .\n\n  You see the intimidation there.\n  Mr. President, so that there may be no confusion in the mind of any \nFederal employee, my pending amendment simply stipulates that hereafter \nall HIV/AIDS training programs will be made optional for Federal \nemployees.\n  To put it another way, nobody shall be compelled to attend a program \nthat describes how to participate in oral and anal sex.\n  In addition, my amendment forbids that any Federal department or \nagency can take retaliatory actions against any Federal employee who \nchooses not to attend such classes. It makes no sense to say to an \nemployee ``this class is optional, but we'll be taking attendance and \nyour absence will be noted,'' because the employee will be \nunderstandably intimidated.\n  By the way, Mr. President, there are many who may be wondering why we \nare spending the taxpayers' money on these programs at all. I am one of \nthem. There are today about 3 million Federal employees. It does not \ntake a rocket scientist to do the arithmetic on how much this mandatory \nprogram is costing the American taxpayers. Even if the class costs only \n$1 per employee--and the actual cost is much more than that--even at $1 \nper hour, the American taxpayers are being soaked for $3 million for \nthis HIV/AIDS training.\n  Mr. President, at issue in this amendment is whether all Federal \nemployees are to continue to be forced to attend these programs.\n  At the risk of being repetitious, I do not see any point in forcing \nFederal employees to attend a session where the subject is the kind of \nsex conducted by homosexuals.\n  Like AIDS education in the public schools, Federal AIDS training \nprograms are nothing but thinly-veiled attempts to restructure the \nvalues and attitudes of Americans in favor of homosexual lifestyles.\n  So the question is obvious. Since when does a free and democratic \nsociety mandate that its civil servants attend such classes to learn \nabout--let us use the word--sodomy? The bottom line is that the Federal \nGovernment has no business requiring its employees to sit through \nembarrassing and sometimes disgusting classes on HIV/AIDS.\n  Mr. President, I have several insertions for the Record that I want \nincluded.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following documents \nbe printed in the Record:\n  First, President Clinton's Guidelines for the Federal Workplace HIV/\nAIDS Education Initiative ``Aids At Work,'' April 7, 1994,\n  Second, a letter from a North Carolina Federal employee who works for \nthe USDA,\n  Third, the Foreign Agriculture Service's ``Mandatory HIV/AIDS \nTraining'' memo dated January 1, 1995, and\n  Fourth, a March 29, 1995, Washington Times article entitled, \n``Mandatory Federal AIDS Classes Cited as Promoting Gay Agenda''.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Guidelines for the Federal Workplace HIV/AIDS Education Initiative \n                            ``AIDS at Work''\n\n\n                               I. purpose\n\n       On September 30, 1993, President Clinton signed a directive \n     (Directive) instructing all Federal departments and agencies \n     to provide comprehensive HIV/AIDS in the workplace training \n     for their employees. The Directive mandates that all initial \n     training be either carried out or scheduled by World AIDS \n     Day, December 1, 1994. In addition to providing HIV/AIDS \n     prevention information, all federal employees must receive \n     information on workplace policies and procedures related to \n     persons living with HIV and other chronic illnesses. Human \n     resources staff is required to review workplace policies and \n     procedures to ensure that the federal workplace encourages \n     people with any chronic illness, including those living with \n     HIV/AIDS, to continue productive employment as long as their \n     health permits.\n       The President has committed his Administration to a leading \n     role in the fight to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Until there \n     is a cure, educating people on assessing their own risk and \n     taking appropriate steps to protect themselves from infection \n     with HIV is the best way to stop the epidemic. As the \n     epidemic matures and medical advances proceed, more and more \n     people living with HIV/AIDS will be in the workforce. Since \n     HIV cannot normally be transmitted in a workplace setting, \n     people living with HIV/AIDS should be encouraged to continue \n     working so long as their health allows them to be productive \n     employees. The Federal Workplace HIV/AIDS Education \n     Initiative (FWAEI) will serve as a model for all businesses \n     on how to provide employees the information they need to \n     prevent infection with HIV and the type of personnel policies \n     and procedures which encourage people with any chronic \n     illness, including HIV/AIDS, to continue productive work for \n     as long as their health permits.\n\n\n                             II. background\n\n       Based upon comprehensive research and evaluation of many \n     private-sector workplace programs, the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention (CDC), Business Responds to AIDS, and \n     the National Leadership Coalition on AIDS recommend that the \n     following five components be included in any comprehensive \n     HIV/AIDS workplace education program: Policy/Procedures; \n     Training of Supervisors and Managers;\n      Employee Education; Family Education; and Community Service/\n     Volunteerism.\n       The Office of National AIDS Policy (ONAP) has produced the \n     following guidelines for all Federal departments and agencies \n     to assist in the development of comprehensive HIV/AIDS in the \n     workplace programs. In order to succeed, the development and \n     implementation of a training program must take into account \n     the particular needs of each department or agency. The \n     guidelines that follow are minimum requirements and are not \n     intended to preclude any additional training that a \n     particular department or agency determines is appropriate for \n     its own employees. These guidelines will assist departments \n     and agencies in creating developmentally appropriate, \n     technically accurate, training programs whose success can be \n     measured.\n                          ii. target audience\n\n       HIV/AIDS workplace training is mandatory for every Federal \n     employee. The initial training must be conducted or scheduled \n     by World AIDS Day, December 1, 1994. The Directive does not \n     require that contractors receive training. Departments or \n     agencies may \n\n[[Page S10717]]\n     require that contractors receive training, particularly in those \n     locations where they share the same workplace as Federal \n     employees. Contractors should not be trained with Federal \n     staff.\n       Managers and supervisors should receive more in-depth \n     training that includes dealing with issues of \n     confidentiality, how to approach any necessary counseling and \n     referrals, and how to help a chronically ill employee \n     continue working and remain productive.\n                            iii. class size\n\n       Class size is critical to the successful implementation of \n     the Federal Workplace AIDS Education Initiative. Employees \n     need to have their questions answered, and large classes \n     prevent employees from getting the response time they need. \n     Class size should be limited, optimally to 30, but never more \n     than 50, participants.\n\n\n                         iv. length of training\n\n       The duration of the training session should be not less \n     than 2 hours, although 3 hours is the recommended length to \n     allow ample time for questions and discussion. Allowing for \n     breaks will give staff an opportunity to digest the \n     information presented. Additional time may be required for \n     supervisor and manager training.\n\n\n                    v. records/evaluation instrument\n\n       Of the most difficult tasks you will encounter is the \n     documentation of how the Directive is being implemented and \n     whether it has an impact on the knowledge, attitudes, beliefs \n     and\n      behavior of the employees. To accomplish this, accurate \n     records of training sessions, including: the names of \n     participants; the date of the training session; and the \n     total number of employees trained, are essential. All \n     individuals receiving training should have an appropriate \n     ``official training form'' sent to their personnel files, \n     and/or the attendance information should be entered into \n     their training records database. Keeping a monthly list of \n     class sizes and participants will expedite the formulation \n     of the regular quarterly reports.\n       Ideally, your instructor should ask each participant to \n     complete pre- and post-training knowledge assessments. These \n     assessments will indicate whether participants increased \n     their understanding of HIV/AIDS in these training session. An \n     increased understanding of the pathology of HIV/AIDS does not \n     necessarily indicate a concomitant change in the behavior of \n     participants.\n       To determine the effectiveness of the training session it \n     is important to gauge the quality of instruction. An \n     instructor/class evaluation should be administered at the end \n     of each training session. These assessments should be no more \n     than one page and ask participants to grade the class \n     comment, the instructor's ability, the quality of questions \n     and discussion, and whether the training session was \n     worthwhile. Evaluation instruments used during your training \n     should not be referred to as ``tests.'' If the evaluation \n     instruments indicate that the training session was not well \n     received, you should consider appropriate remedies including \n     altering course content or securing a different instructor.\n                              vi. content\n\n       The following topics are suggested for class content. The \n     percentages attached to these topics are intended as guidance \n     for the development of individual sessions. Discussion and \n     questions at each department or agency will vary depending on \n     the group addressed. Because discussion and questions are \n     important, and there are always time constraints, an \n     instructor must be flexible in practice.\n       30% Prevention Education (The discussion must include how \n     HIV is transmitted and how to prevent transmission, including \n     both abstinence and safer sexual practices. Note: It is \n     especially important to provide sufficient time for questions \n     and answers in this part of the training and no question is \n     too dumb.)\n       30% Workplace Issues Discussion/Education (Includes a \n     discussion of why this training and associated workplace \n     policies are important, why support services are necessary, \n     and data related to employees needs.)\n       30% Policy Discussion/Education (Includes a discussion of \n     federal and legal protections as well as the policies of your \n     department or agency.)\n       10% Resources and Closing Questions and Answers.\n\n\n                            VII. INSTRUCTORS\n\n       The instructor is key to a successful HIV/AIDS education \n     program. Instructors (Federal or non-Federal) should be \n     trained comprehensively in HIV/AIDS issues and have \n     experience with HIV/AIDS training. Instructor certification \n     is not necessary unless required by your organization. \n     (Certification may not always guarantee quality instruction \n     for your HIV/AIDS education program.) You may want to rely on \n     your department or agency's contractor policies in \n     determining who will be the most suitable instructor. In many \n     cases, members of non-governmental community based \n     organizations have a wide range of experience in HIV \n     prevention that may be helpful for all or part of a training \n     session. It is also important to note that more than one \n     instructor may be needed to present the full range of \n     information necessary. The instructor should be experienced \n     enough to tailor the session to the audience (i.e., the type \n     of questions and concerns voiced by lawyers, support \n     personnel, analysts, economists, etc. could be quite \n     different).\n       A Federal employee, knowledgeable about all human resources \n     related policy issues, should present the department or \n     agency policies and procedures regarding HIV/AIDS and other \n     life-threatening chronic illnesses. Policies and procedures \n     regarding Federal employees and managers must not be \n     presented by private-sector contractors or non-Federal \n     employees.\n       If your agency uses a contractor for the HIV/AIDS \n     presentations, be sure they follow these recommended \n     guidelines. Ask the contractor for information regarding the \n     teaching history and the educational experience of the \n     instructor. Include in your contract language that permits \n     the replacement of an instructor with whom you are \n     displeased.\n       Before training Federal employees or contractors, all \n     instructors may want to read at least two texts from the \n     ``Suggested Reading'' section of these guidelines, preferably \n     AIDS in the Workplace. The Guide to Living with HIV, or \n     Managing AIDS in the Workplace.\n\n\n                           VIII. METHODOLOGY\n\n       The training must be tailored to the needs of each \n     department or agency. The primary goals of the educational \n     component shall be: (1) increasing employee's knowledge on \n     issues of HIV transmission; (2) increasing awareness of HIV/\n     AIDS in the workplace issues and available relevant \n     resources; (3) creating positive attitudes about working \n     alongside people living with HIV/AIDS; and, (4) encouraging \n     the participation in activities, both at work and in the \n     community, that will stop the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\n       Effective HIV/AIDS prevention methodology for people at \n     high risk for HIV infection (i.e., anyone engaging in \n     unprotected sex with more than one partner or people sharing \n     dirty needles), requires targeted, continuous, linguistically \n     specific and culturally based information. It is impractical \n     to divide up a workplace based on risk factors. The training \n     sessions should provide sufficient information for employees \n     to assess their own risk for HIV infection. Resource \n     information provided as part of the training session must \n     provide the employees with locations where they may obtain \n     more targeted interventions if they perceive themselves to be \n     at high risk for HIV infection.\n       If, for expediency in implementing the Directive, you must \n     place all members of the same department or office together, \n     the training must be relevant to all those present. Staff \n     must be made aware that some of the issues discussed will be \n     related to sexual practices and injecting drug use. Although \n     departments and agencies are encouraged to be linguistically \n     specific in covering the issues, the training sessions should \n     not present material patently offensive to an average \n     employee. If participants find the material offensive, it is \n     often counterproductive to the goal of encouraging an \n     accurate self-assessment of risk for HIV infection.\n       Classes should be interactive and allow time for \n     individuals to ask questions and to process the information \n     presented. Employees must receive materials on workplace and \n     community resources available to address any concerns raised \n     by the training session.\n\n\n                        ix. video presentations\n\n       Video presentations should not represent more than 30 to 35 \n     minutes of the total class time. A video presentation alone \n     is insufficient. A discussion and question period is \n     essential for some people to adequately assess their personal \n     risk factors. Presentations may use videos to provide a \n     standardized source of information for all individuals, but a \n     video must not be the sole source of information. Individuals \n     representing policy, personnel, or employee assistance \n     programs should always be an integral part of the HIV/AIDS \n     educational program and their presentations should not be \n     substituted with video.\n\n\n            x. general objectives for all employee training\n\n       Based upon the time allocated for the class, prioritize \n     class content using the following objectives:\n\n                          Knowledge objectives\n\n       Participants should be able to:\n       1. Define HIV.\n       2. Define AIDS.\n       3. Know how HIV & AIDS are related.\n       4. Understand the disease process.\n       5. Know how HIV is transmitted:\n       a. Primary risk factors (i.e., exchange of bodily fluids \n     from a person living with HIV to someone who is not)\n       b. Secondary risk factors (e.g., how the use of drugs or \n     alcohol may impair judgement about HIV risk, importance of \n     self esteem)\n       6. Know how HIV is not transmitted.\n       7. Understand relevant universal precautions for \n     application in the workplace.\n       8. Know how to assess their personal level of risk for HIV \n     infection.\n       9. Describe HIV antibody testing and encourage those that \n     perceive themselves at high risk to ascertain their HIV \n     status.\n       10. Understand the rights of employees with a chronic \n     illness, including HIV/AIDS.\n       11. Understand basic applications of laws, regulations or \n     policies such as disability, health and leave benefits, the \n     Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act of 1990, and the Family and Medical Leave \n     Act, as these apply to people living with HIV/AIDS in the \n     workplace.\n       12. Know agency expectations, specifically policies and \n     procedures which address co-worker responses to employees who \n     are chronically ill, including those who are living or \n     perceived to be living with HIV/AIDS.\n     \n[[Page S10718]]\n\n       13. Identify what are discriminatory behaviors/actions in \n     the workplace.\n       14. Understand workplace behaviors or actions that are \n     valued in terms of maximum productivity and optimum work \n     environment.\n       15. Understand the importance of teaching young people how \n     to protect themselves from HIV infection, and how to talk \n     about HIV with children and adolescents.\n\n                         Attitudinal objectives\n\n       Ideally, participants will indicate they:\n       1. View persons living or perceived to be living with HIV/\n     AIDS no differently than persons with other life-threatening \n     illnesses.\n       2. Feel more comfortable working with employees who are \n     chronically ill, including those who are living or perceived \n     to be living with HIV/AIDS.\n       3. Are more supportive of reasonable accommodations for \n     employees who are chronically ill, including those living or \n     perceived to be living with HIV/AIDS.\n       4. Feel less judgmental toward persons who are chronically \n     ill, including those living with or perceived to be living \n     with HIV/AIDS (with respect to the presumed or known \n     behaviors that resulted in their infection).\n       5. Experience little or no fear of interacting with \n     employees who are chronically ill, including those living or \n     perceived to be living with HIV/AIDS.\n                         Behavioral objectives\n\n       Participants should be able to:\n       1. Assess their own levels of risk for HIV infection.\n       2. Adopt behaviors that eliminate transmission risks.\n       3. Provide support for chronically ill employees including \n     those who are living with HIV/AIDS.\n       4. Express willingness to participate in work assignment \n     adjustments necessary to provide ``reasonable accommodation'' \n     for chronically ill employees, including those living with \n     HIV/AIDS.\n       5. Share HIV prevention information with others.\n       6. Apply information about the Federal Rehabilitation Act \n     of 1973, Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, Equal \n     Employment Opportunity, Family and Medical Leave Act, as well \n     as leave disability and health benefits information.\n\n\n                 xi. objectives for managerial training\n\n                         Behavioral objectives\n\n       Managers should be able to:\n       1. Apply policies and procedures for managing employees who \n     are chronically ill, including those living or perceived to \n     be living with HIV/AIDS.\n       2. Manage employee disclosures assuring that \n     confidentiality is maintained. This is critical for staff who \n     may want to disclose they are living with HIV/AIDS and for \n     other staff that may want to voice concerns about working \n     with someone living with HIV/AIDS.\n       3. Appropriately provide any necessary reasonable \n     accommodation in collaboration with Human Resources personnel \n     and the employee.\n       4. Manage the performance of employees who are chronically \n     ill, including those living or perceived to be living with \n     HIV/AIDS.\n       5. Discuss concerns with Human Resources or employee \n     assistance personnel during the employee disclosure, \n     accommodation, or referral process.\n       6. Manage sensitive documents reporting an employee's HIV \n     or health status.\n\n\n                         xii. policy statements\n\n       As indicated above, the Presidential Directive requires all \n     departments and agencies to review their personnel policies \n     to ensure that they provide adequate protections for \n     employees with a chronic illness, including those living with \n     HIV/AIDS, while ensuring a comfortable and safe work \n     environment. To accomplish this we suggest the following:\n       Review the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Federal \n     Personnel Manual Letter (FPM) 792-21 (March 1988) and \n     Attachment of FPM Letter 792-21 (April 24, 1991), ``Acquired \n     Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in the Workplace.'' \n     Applying the basic guidance from the FPM letter, establish or \n     revise your own organizational policies. OPM is in the \n     process of establishing a repository for all the policies \n     from the various departments and agencies. Upon completion of \n     your organization's policy statement, please send a copy to: \n     Chief, Employee Health Services Branch, U.S. Office of \n     Personnel Management, 1900 E Street, NW, Room 7412, \n     Washington, DC 20415. If you have questions concerning the \n     FPM letter or applicable policies, you may call the office at \n     (202) 606-1269.\n       Each training participant should receive specific written \n     policy information, as well as information outlining \n     procedures for the disclosure process, counseling, disability \n     and health insurance benefits. Distribution of a policy \n     statement is not enough; each employee should receive a \n     document that contains the names, locations and telephone \n     numbers of the individuals associated with the administration \n     of the following.\n       1. Equal Opportunity Employment.\n       2. Interpretation of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of \n     1973.\n       3. Interpretation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n     1990 (where applicable).\n       4. Health and disability retirement benefits information, \n     Employee Assistance Programs and Counseling.\n       5. Family and Medical Leave Act.\n       6. State and local government interpretations.\n       7. Local union representatives (where applicable).\n       8. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) \n     guidelines, especially those related to possible occupational \n     exposure to HIV.\n\n\n          xiii. general policies for supervisors and managers\n\n       Each department or agency should develop policies and \n     procedures for employees with serious illnesses, including \n     those living with HIV/AIDS, that are flexible enough to \n     accommodate individual circumstances. In some situations it \n     will be necessary to negotiate with the employee an \n     appropriate workplace accommodation. This process should \n     always include a designated representative from the Human \n     Resources Department or the Employee Assistance Program (and \n     may include a union representative).\n       Each department or agency must consult with their General \n     Counsel in developing specific policies and procedures for \n     employees with serious illnesses, including those living with \n     HIV/AIDS. The following guidelines should be considered in \n     developing those policies and procedures. A department or \n     agency may develop policies that are more specific than those \n     addressed here.\n                       Privacy and confidentially\n\n       An employee's health condition is personal and \n     confidential. Employees have understandable concerns over \n     confidentiality and privacy about medical documentation and \n     other information related to an HIV/AIDS diagnoses that is \n     submitted for purposes of an employment decision.\n       Precautions must always be taken to protect information \n     regarding an employee's health condition. It is inappropriate \n     to report disclosures to other upper-level supervisors unless \n     there is a documented ``need to know.'' (These cases are \n     minimal and should be confirmed with your Human Resource \n     Department.) Employees living with HIV/AIDS or other life-\n     threatening illnesses are entitled to full coverage under the \n     Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans With \n     Disabilities Act of 1990, sick leave, Family and Medical \n     Leave Act, leave bank programs, disability benefits, and \n     equal employment opportunity. Should questions arise \n     concerning such matters, contact your Human Resources \n     Department.\n       Some employees work in occupations that may put them at \n     greater risk of HIV infection (e.g., medical facilities, \n     laboratories, security personnel who might come in contact \n     with blood, etc.). These employees should attend a training \n     session with special emphasis on the use of universal \n     precautions where there might be exposure to blood-borne \n     pathogens. These guidelines can be obtained from OSHA.\n\n              General practices for discussing disclosures\n       Generally, when employees disclose any life-threatening \n     illness, including HIV/AIDS, a supervisor should not \n     immediately initiate any sudden changes in the employee's \n     working environment. Be sensitive to the possible \n     contribution of anxiety over this condition to work behavior. \n     Any part of the disclosure process should include discussions \n     with the employee, the first-line supervisor, and a \n     representative from the Human Resources Department or the \n     Employee Assistance Program (and may include the employee's \n     union representative.)\n\n                  Making ``Reasonable'' accommodations\n\n       The purpose behind reasonable accommodations is to provide \n     alternatives for employees living with disabilities, in this \n     case HIV/AIDS, to continue productive work as long as \n     possible. Reasonable accommodations provide a work \n     environment where individuals living with disabilities can \n     maximize their productivity and continue to be part of the \n     workforce. The implementation of reasonable accommodations \n     usually has a positive impact on all staff, as it \n     communicates the willingness of managers to care for the \n     individual needs of employees.\n       What reasonable accommodates does not mean is that \n     employees with disabilities, including those living with HIV/\n     AIDS, are held to significantly different performance \n     standards than employees without disabilities in similar \n     positions. It also does not mean new jobs must be created to \n     accommodate any employee living with a disability.\n       When look at an individual employee's condition, consider \n     changes in work assignments like job restructuring, \n     reassignment, liberal leaves or flexible schedules for \n     employees living with HIV/AIDS in the same manner as for \n     other employees whose medical conditions affect their ability \n     to perform safely and reliably. In so doing, observe \n     established policies governing qualification, internal \n     placement, transfers and other staffing requirements. \n     Alternate work scheduling is often the least expensive and \n     simplest accommodation.\n\n                    Addressing co-workers' concerns\n\n       Be sensitive and responsive to co-workers' concerns, and \n     emphasize the need for education. Be clear that mistreatment, \n     harassment, malicious gossip, or hurtful actions in the \n     workplace will not be tolerated. Through educational efforts \n     and private discussions, teach employees that no medical \n     basis exists for refusing to work with a fellow employee, or \n     clients of a department or agency, living with HIV/AIDS.\n\n\n                       xiv. training suggestions\n\n       The following recommendations are made by the Office of \n     National AIDS Policy to assure quality in this initiative. By \n     following \n\n[[Page S10719]]\n     these suggestions you can reduce training obstacles, ensure quality \n     standards, and expedite the educational process.\n       1. Upon reviewing these guidelines, examine your \n     organizational structure, the composition of your workforce \n     and any logistical considerations that impact on training. By \n     looking at other training programs offered by our department \n     or agency, you may determine the most appropriate method for \n     conducting HIV/AIDS workplace training for your staff.\n       2. To achieve consistency, coordinate the training at every \n     level throughout the organization. Request initial input from \n     department heads who can ensure the plan is carried out \n     consistently. Develop a network of HIV/AIDS coordinators \n     throughout your organization. Share the educational plan with \n     them, develop a strategy and schedule the sessions. Also, you \n     may want to include union representatives in your network of \n     coordinators.\n       3. Establish a local-area network (LAN) bulletin board for \n     questions and answers concerning HIV/AIDS issues, employee \n     benefits, leave programs, interpretation of the Family and \n     Medical Leave Act, policies affecting the terminally ill, \n     etc. Keep entries into the system confidential.\n       4. Collect questions anonymously and publish answers in \n     employee newsletters. If your own organization does not have \n     a newsletter, perhaps your union does.\n       5. If your organization employs someone living with HIV/\n     AIDS, and he/she feels comfortable talking to a group, you \n     may invite the employee to a question and answer\n      session or to make brief presentations, especially for World \n     AIDS Day, December 1. These presentations, if included in \n     the training, should not exceed 20 minutes.\n       6. For workplaces where the risk of occupational exposure \n     to HIV may be greater (i.e., occupations in which employees \n     routinely, or are likely in some circumstances, to come in \n     contact with blood or blood products), a special training \n     session on ``Bloodborne Pathogens/Universal Precautions'' in \n     addition to the general HIV/AIDS training session may be \n     appropriate. Be sure to inform the class of the exact date, \n     time and location. Detailed, or specific questions about \n     bloodborne pathogens and universal precautions can be \n     answered in the Bloodborne Pathogens session.\n       7. Keep the education and policy modules together and offer \n     them as one session, including a discussion of workplace \n     policies and procedures. (Managers and Supervisors may need \n     more details from the policy representative.)\n       8. When asked hypothetical questions that demand complex \n     explanation, maintain credibility and try to negotiate the \n     discussion back to the facts and objectives. Politely refer \n     ``highly improbable'' questions to designated Human Resource \n     or employee assistance personnel. You may want to visually \n     tract the questions (using a flipchart etc.), ensuring that \n     each question is addressed by the end of the session. \n     However, if too many questions are deferred, the instructor \n     may lose credibility. A skilled, experienced instructor will \n     strive to provide the necessary balance.\n       9. Conduct pilot sessions to validate your training \n     sessions and ask for input from unions, human resources, \n     training and employee assistance departments. Optimally, \n     retain the same effective instructors throughout your \n     agency's or organization's program.\n       10. Before conducting the pilot sessions, take time with \n     the instructor to discuss the employees who will be attending \n     the sessions. (Are they analysts, lawyers, accountants, \n     support staff?) The instructors will not need great detail, \n     but a little background information will make the instructor \n     more at ease and ``set the stage'' for successful training.\n       11. Work with your training departments and ensure that \n     basic components of the HIV/AIDS training, especially policy, \n     are incorporated in required managerial training and new \n     employee orientation. If you do not have a new employee \n     orientation program, maintain accurate records and provide \n     future HIV/AIDS training sessions as needed. Remember this \n     initiative is ongoing and HIV/AIDS workplace education must \n     become a part of all employee's ongoing training.\n       12. As an option, offer some weekend or evening sessions to \n     include family members, friends of employees, and other \n     members of the community who interact with your department or \n     agency.\n       13. During the training, provide supplemental information \n     regarding discussions of HIV/AIDS with children and teens. \n     The theme for World AIDS Day, December 1, 1994, will be \n     ``AIDS and the Family.'' You may want to offer seminars or \n     workshops emphasizing ``AIDS and the Family'' throughout the \n     year, or during the week of December 1, 1994.\n       14. Provide additional information to all employees to \n     enhance and reinforce understanding about the nature and \n     transmissions of HIV/AIDS. Use news bulletin, personnel \n     management directives, meetings, guest experts. Q sessions, \n     films and video newsletters, union publications, fact sheets, \n     pamphlets.\n\n\n                          xv quarterly reports\n\n       Each department and independent agency is required to send \n     quarterly reports to the Office of National AIDS Policy. \n     These reports are compiled and sent directly to the \n     President. Accurate record keeping will expedite the report \n     writing process. The FWAEI Quarterly Report should include:\n       1. The number of staff trained during the quarter, \n     including number of classes and average class size.\n       2. The total number of staff trained since inception of the \n     initiative (September 30, 1993).\n       3. The percentage of the total staff of the department or \n     agency that (2) represents.\n       4. Any difficulty faced in implementing the HIV/AIDS \n     education program (logistical problem, unclear \n     communications, personnel resistance).\n       5. Progress made in updating and revising departmental non-\n     discrimination policies.\n       6. Future plans and milestones in implementing the HIV/AIDS \n     initiative within your department or agency. (How many \n     employees are scheduled during the next quarter, and foreseen \n     barriers to full implementation.)\n       7. List private-sector and non-profit organizations who \n     have visited with you about their training programs.\n       8. Other activities you plan or have scheduled to re-\n     emphasize AIDS Awareness, especially for World AIDS Day, \n     December 1, 1994. Include any press articles about your \n     implementation of the Federal Workplace AIDS Education \n     Initiative.\n       9. For the last report of the year, your future plans \n     section must include what will be your plans for conducting \n     training for the following calendar year. This shall include \n     how many people you estimate to be trained per quarter for \n     the following year.\n       Due dates for future reports are June 15, September 15, \n     December 15. All reports should be faxed or mailed to the \n     Federal Workplace AIDS Education Coordinator. Mailing \n     information follows.\n\n                 Office of National AIDS Policy contact\n\n       For information about these guidelines, contact the Federal \n     Workplace HIV/AIDS Education Coordinator, Executive Office of \n     the President, Office of National AIDS Policy, 750 17th \n     Street, Suite 1060, Washington, DC 20503, telephone (202) \n     690-5560 or FAX (202) 690-7560.\n\n                          Interagency meetings\n\n       Each month the Office of National AIDS Policy Conducts a \n     meeting to discuss questions, as well as to present materials \n     that have been developed by organizations for the FWAEI. The \n     meeting is open to Federal and non-Federal employees. Meeting \n     notices are normally faxed and not confirmed by a mailing. \n     Please be sure that your contact name, address, telephone \n     number and fax number are correct with the Office of National \n     AIDS Policy. (See Office of National AIDS Policy Contact.)\n\n\n                             xvi. resources\n\n       The Office of National AIDS Policy, the Department of \n     Energy, the Office of Personnel Management, and other Federal \n     agencies have collaborated with the Department of Health and \n     Human Services' employee assistance program to develop \n     training packages which comply with these guidelines. \n     Supervisor training materials are nearly completed and your \n     agency FWAEI contact will be notified when these training \n     packages are available.\n       Materials should include resources and information provided \n     by local community based organizations who work with HIV/AIDS \n     related issues. The CDC National AIDS Clearinghouse can help \n     you find information (800) 458-5231. The Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention's National AIDS Hotline number, 1-800-\n     342-AIDS, must be included in all resource information. \n     Throughout the training, this number should be clearly posted \n     in the room.\n                        xvii. suggested readings\n\n                              Periodicals\n\n       ``A Case of AIDS'' by Richard S.

They tell trainers \n     to use the words ``sex partners'' instead of ``husband and \n     wife'' and ``injecting drug user'' instead of ``addict.''\n       Would-be trainers have to discuss their views on \n     ``homosexuality for my child'' as part of the selection \n     process.\n       A federal worker who underwent training this month said she \n     was offended when the instructor, a private contractor, began \n     talking about her grandmother's likely sex practices.\n       ``I was shocked and upset when the instructor personalized \n     anal sex for each person in the room by saying our \n     grandmothers probably practiced birth control by \n     participating in anal sex,'' said the worker, who described \n     the three-hour session on the condition that she not be \n     identified.\n       ``I was highly offended,'' she said, ``I have a very godly \n     grandmother, and I just broke down and cried. I guess they're \n     trying to say homosexuals do it that way and so did your \n     grandmother.''\n       The guidelines are in documents from the departments of \n     Energy, Health and Human Services, and Agriculture. Other \n     departments are believed to use similar guidelines, which are \n     coordinated and approved by the White House.\n       Aimed at the 2.1 million federal employees, the ``Federal \n     Workplace AIDS Education Initiative'' was authorized last \n     year by Mr. Clinton, whose campaign received political and \n     financial support from the homosexual community.\n       Administration rules for AIDS instruction tell trainers:\n       To avoid certain terms, such as ``husband and wife,'' \n     ``homosexual men,'' ``promiscuous,'' ``sexual preference'' \n     and ``addict.''\n       To deflect ``homophobic comments'' during a training \n     session by saying, ``There is some division of opinion on \n     that point.''\n       To watch out for troublemakers among the pupils. A federal \n     worker who takes an ``intransigent point of view'' on condom \n     distribution in schools or needle distribution is pegged as a \n     ``partisan.'' A ``heckler'' is someone who ``expresses \n     disbelief, disgust or scoffs at content and processes.'' A \n     ``moralist'' believes that ``people who are HIV-infected \n     through sex or drug use deserve what they get.''\n       To suggest that a person use his own drug-injection \n     equipment or try ``disinfecting with bleach'' to avoid \n     getting the human immuno-deficiency virus, which causes AIDS.\n       The Department of Energy's AIDS program is titled, \n     ``Walkin' the Talk'' and includes a discussion of ``serial \n     monogamy,'' which it defines as an ``exclusive sexual \n     relationship with one individual at a time.''\n       ``Practicing serial monogamy and therefore having several \n     sexual partners, even over an extended period of times, may \n     place one at risk for HIV infections unless he or she \n     practices safer sex,'' the program says.\n       One of the training manuals included a scoring system \n     titled ``Values About HIV/AIDS-Related Issues.'' It was used \n     to select AIDS instructors.\n       Candidates were asked to rate their opinion on several \n     topics, including ``sex without love,'' ``sex outside of a \n     committed relationship,'' ``homosexuality for my child,'' \n     ``stiff sentences for injection-drug users who share needles \n     and other drug-injection paraphernalia,'' and ``laws to \n     protect homosexuals from discrimination in housing, jobs and \n     public accommodations.''\n       Jim Woodall, a vice president of the conservative group \n     Concerned Women for America, said President Clinton should \n     ``cease and desist'' the training. He said the goals could be \n     achieved by giving employees a Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention brochure on AIDS prevention.\n       ``We have been suspecting for a long time that AIDS \n     education is being used as a facade to promote the homosexual \n     lifestyle,'' Mr. Woodall said. ``AIDS education used in \n     public schools and college campuses has now invaded our \n     government, where the president is mandating federal \n     employees to sit down for four hours for this type of \n     education. It's a fraud.''\n       Mr. Woodall's 600,000-member organization is compiling \n     information on the program.\n       ``I do not have any problem with gays relating to gays when \n     talking about sex,'' he said. ``The issue is, the U.S. \n     government is promoting that agenda using taxpayer dollars.''\n       Richard Sorian, White House spokesman on AIDS policy, \n     disagreed with the group's characterization of the program. \n     ``The effort has been a very successful effort to supply \n     people with information that allows them to protect \n     themselves and protect their family,'' he said.\n       He said Concerned Women for America is misinterpreting some \n     of the training material. For example, he said, the section \n     on ``breaking down audience resistance'' based on religion is \n     an effort to have workers air those concerns so they can be \n     discussed.\n       ``They are not trying to change someone's religious beliefs \n     at all,'' Mr. Sorian said. ``What they are talking about is \n     beginning the instruction with any concerns they have or \n     religious belief that might make them uncomfortable with the \n     discussion so they can be comfortable in the discussion.''\n       Mr. Sorian said such words as ``addict'' are avoided for a \n     good reason: ``If you say drug addicts are susceptible to \n     HIV, but they don't consider themselves an addict, then they \n     don't recognize themselves as an addict.''\n       He said he has received ``positive feedback'' from \n     participants who have used the \n\n[[Page S10721]]\n     information to educate others. The program is scheduled to end this \n     week. The White House AIDS office then will know how many \n     workers were reached.\n       Some federal workers have objected to the training.\n       A defense Department employee said he walked out during his \n     department's session.\n       ``I don't believe I should sit next to a female and be told \n     how to do intercourse, no matter how sidetracked they go,'' \n     said the employee, who requested anonymity. ``I don't want to \n     be in mixed company and talk about a lifestyle I'm not \n     involved in, that I don't approve of. I don't care to be \n     instructed by Big Brother in things I avoid.''\n       A Drug Enforcement Administration worker who objected to \n     attending AIDS training was ordered to attend or be \n     disciplined for insubordination.\n       Mr. Woodall said the system ``weeds out any people who have \n     a problem with the gay lifestyle.''\n                                                   March 31, 1995.\n     Senator Jesse Helms,\n     Century Post Office Building,\n     Raleigh, NC.\n       Dear Senator Helms: At a time when our total federal budget \n     is under scrutiny, it seems appropriate to study all \n     expenditures. Within USDA,ARS our budgets for agricultural \n     research are particularly tight. Nevertheless, we spend a \n     tremendous amount of time in all types of training sessions. \n     This week we were required to attend a mandatory HIV/AIDS \n     training session which is apparently required by the \n     President of all Federal employees. This results in millions \n     of dollars in lost man hours and consequently wages. We also \n     were required to take a pre- and post-class test. \n     Unfortunately, at least in our agency, there is no way to \n     test out of the class time. Since we are mostly biological \n     scientists we learned essentially nothing. The enclosed \n     material was to be read prior to the class and thereby using \n     more of our valuable time. Some of this material is not \n     appropriate for the workplace (e.g. how to have safe oral \n     sex, page 28), and it does seem to be necessary for \n     government time and money.\n       I hope you and other congressional members will carefully \n     consider the cost/benefits of our numerous training sessions. \n     The taxpayer's money can be better spent on research in our \n     agency than in peripheral training sessions not suited to us.\n           Sincerely,\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \nprevious amendment so that I can offer another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1857\n\n(Purpose: To limit amounts appropriated for AIDS or HIV activities from \n               exceeding amounts appropriated for cancer)\n\n  Mr. HELMS. I now send an amendment to the desk and ask that it be \nstated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1857:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . LIMITATION ON APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the total \n     amounts appropriated for any fiscal year for AIDS and HIV \n     activities may not exceed the total amounts discretionary \n     funds appropriated for such fiscal year for activities \n     relating to cancer.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. As the clerk has read, Mr. President, this amendment \nproposes that the Ryan White CARE Reauthorization Act of 1995 have this \nprovision to guarantee that any and all Federal funds authorized and \nappropriated for HIV/AIDS will not exceed the total Federal funds \nauthorized and appropriated for and in connection with the disease of \ncancer.\n  The leading cause of death in America today is heart disease, \nfollowed closely by cancer. HIV/AIDS ranks ninth, No. 9--I believe, as \na matter of fact, they lowered it to No. 8. So make that read HIV/AIDS \nranks eighth in the number of deaths it causes. It is of interest that \nHIV/AIDS receives $2.7 billion per year in Federal funding, which \nexceeds Federal funding in connection with any other disease. Heart \ndisease, for example, Mr. President, kills more than 720,000 Americans \nevery year, and $805 million in Federal funds are allocated and \nappropriated for heart disease. Cancer kills 515,000 Americans, and it \nreceives $2.3 billion.\n  I think the arithmetic of all of this, Mr. President, speaks for \nitself. I want the Record to show that I hope a cure for HIV/AIDS is \nfound tomorrow morning, and I encourage every research effort toward \nthis end. However, I have to make it clear that I am appalled at what \nhas become a total politicization of Federal funding for medical \nresearch and health services.\n  The pending amendment stipulates that Congress may not authorize or \nappropriate more money for HIV/AIDS than is authorized and appropriated \nin connection with the disease cancer. More people are dying from heart \ndisease and cancer and stroke and lung disease and accidents and \npneumonia and diabetes and Alzheimer's and suicide than die from AIDS. \nEach one of these kills more people than does the disease AIDS, yet \nAIDS receives a disproportionate amount of the taxpayers' money.\n  On average, the Federal Government spends about $91,000 on every \nperson who dies of AIDS. The Federal Government spends about $5,000 for \nevery person who dies of cancer.\n  Now, I have my own ideas about priorities, but that is an issue for \nanother day. And I think I am correct in my impression that Americans \nagree that this discrepancy is neither fair nor equitable.\n  In a nutshell, the pending amendment will bring a measure of equity \nand fairness to the existing priorities in the area of HIV/AIDS \nfunding. As long as cancer kills 18 times as many people as AIDS, and \nAIDS nonetheless receives more Federal funding, it is time I think that \nCongress established some new equitable priorities.\n  Mr. President, I ask that all of my previous amendments be set aside \nenabling me to ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested. Is \nthere a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I am not sure if we are ready to \npropound a unanimous-consent agreement yet or not.\n  Mr. HELMS. I am certainly ready to hear it.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. No, I guess we are not. So if I may just for a moment \nrespond to several of the amendments that have been put forward by \nSenator Helms. On the amendment that talks about promotion of \nhomosexual activity. I certainly have great sympathy for wanting to \nlimit what the activities might be supported. I will be introducing an \namendment which addresses that same issue but perhaps not in the same \nway as Senator Helms. I will not get into a definition of the \namendment. Since the unanimous-consent agreement has not been put \nforward yet, I am not sure whether we should go ahead and send our \namendments to the desk, but perhaps we will get them all out and then \nwe can decide what to do.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1858\n\n     (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for certain activities)\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I send to the desk an amendment. I ask unanimous \nconsent to set aside the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report the amendment of the Senator from \nKansas.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1858.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . PROHIBITION ON PROMOTION OF CERTAIN ACTIVITIES.\n\n       Part D of title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 300ff-71) as amended by section 6, is further amended \n     by adding at the end thereof the following new section:\n     \n[[Page S10722]]\n\n\n     ``SEC. 2678. PROHIBITION ON PROMOTION OF CERTAIN ACTIVITIES.\n\n       ``None of the funds authorized under this title shall be \n     used to fund AIDS programs, or to develop materials, designed \n     to promote or encourage, directly, intravenous drug use or \n     sexual activity, whether homosexual or hetero-sexual. Funds \n     authorized under this title may be used to provide medical \n     treatment and support services for individuals with HIV.''.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. The amendment I have sent to the desk will prohibit \nthe use of the Ryan White CARE Act funds to support activities which \npromote homosexuality. This provision will assure that the funds \nallocated under this act would be used to provide treatment for \nindividuals. There would be no funds to be used for promotion of \nhomosexual activities. I offer this amendment because I am aware that \nsome of my colleagues are concerned that the CARE activities may lead \nto increased sexual activity or to increased drug use. Specifically, \nsome are concerned that needle exchange programs and prophylactic \ndistribution programs may lead to increased homosexuality or drug \nabuse. Whether or not these concerns are valid, my amendment makes it \nclear that none of the funds expended under this act could be used for \nsuch promotion activities. Rather, this provision would assure that \nCARE Act funds would be used for treatment. In this regard, it is more \nnarrow than the amendment that has been offered by Senator Helms in \nthat it clearly states that the CARE Act funds are for treatment only, \nnot prevention or homosexual promotion activities.\n  I offer this amendment because I would like to have us fully consider \nsome of the language and implications of that language, and that will \nbe set aside at such time as we come to a vote on the legislation.\n  Senator Helms also put forward an amendment to ensure that Federal \nemployees will not be required to attend or participate in AIDS \ntraining programs. I would for myself think that is a very sensible \namendment. Mr. President, it does seem to me that we should not have to \nrequire attendance of Federal employees for such programs. I would like \nto say, though, I do not believe that the intent was to design these \nprograms to change the lifestyle of Americans. I think the intent was \nto really try to have an understanding of AIDS, what it was about, what \ntype of disease it was. But I really myself strongly will support \nSenator Helms and say that in my mind it should not be a required \nattendance.\n  Another amendment that Senator Helms put forward was on the funding. \nHe would hold the funding levels to the same as they are in 1995. Mr. \nPresident, the House Appropriations Committee has appropriated $656 \nmillion for 1996. If we take the 1995 level, that is $651 million. But \nholding it until the year 2000 when AIDS cases are increasing at 20 \npercent a year seems to me to be a very difficult way for us to address \nthis issue at this time. And I think it clearly should be left up to \nthe appropriators. I know that the appropriators today--the Presiding \nOfficer is on the Appropriations Committee--are not going to be \nfrivolous in the moneys they spend. And I have a great deal of \nconfidence that they will take into consideration the needs that are \naddressed that have to be met in the Ryan White CARE legislation and \nwill consider wise and sensible use of those funds. So that amendment I \nwould just have to oppose because I think putting that type of \nrestraint until the year 2000 clearly would do a disservice to many who \nare in serious need.\n  The other amendment was regarding funding equity. And I will be \nconsidering another amendment to address that issue because, as I \nmentioned earlier, it is of great concern. And one of the things where \nwe would differ is what moneys go to research and is discretionary \nfunding and what moneys come from, say, Medicare and Medicaid and the \nSocial Security disability funding. That makes a big difference in the \ntotal amount, and I think it is important that there is an \nunderstanding regarding that difference. So, I will be putting forward \nanother amendment on funding equity a bit later as we complete this \ndebate.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will just take a moment because the Senator from \nKansas has outlined what I think has been a very responsible and \nthoughtful series of options for the Senate to make a judgment and a \ndecision upon. They will be available to the Members as they examine \nthese issues over the nighttime, and then we will have a chance to \naddress them tomorrow and, hopefully, reach a final resolution. I think \nshe has summarized the reasons and justifications for the positions \nwhich she has outlined, and I am in very substantial agreement. With \nsome issues along the way we may have some difference. But I think \nthere will be a series of alternatives for the Members to make a \njudgment on these matters on tomorrow and, I think, for the Members to \nmake a final judgment on these questions tomorrow as well.\n  What remains will be the Gregg amendment, which deals with the \nexports of various pharmaceuticals and medical devices that have not \nbeen approved by the FDA or, for that matter, approved by the other 21 \ndifferent countries that have regulatory agencies. He will best \ndescribe his amendment. This is a matter which is before the Human \nResources Committee, and it certainly was my impression up until this \nafternoon that that would be a part of the whole FDA reorganization and \nstructure. It is appropriate that it should be because we have a \ndifferent criteria, for example, for pharmaceuticals and how the FDA \ntreats those versus biotech and medical device legislation. So, I had \nthought we would be addressing that as part of our total FDA review.\n  It has been the judgment of the Senator from New Hampshire to offer \nthat measure, which initially, as I understand it, was a Hatch measure \nto this proposal. And we will have a chance to discuss that in the \nmorning and make some judgment on that issue. And I would certainly \ninvite our colleagues to pay close attention to the debate that will, \nhopefully, take place at 9:30 if we are able to work through our \nconsent agreement.\n  Mr. President, I have more extended remarks on some of these measures \nwhich I will either make this evening or include in the Record. \nHopefully, we are at a point where we might be able to consider a \nconsent agreement, and I have been here long enough to know that, if \nthat is possible, it is wise to try to take advantage of the \nopportunity before it may escape.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I ask unanimous consent that the name of the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, Senator Domenici, be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. It is my understanding we are close to being able to \nput forward the unanimous-consent agreement. I think there still needs \nto be a couple of additional checks made.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. If the Senator will yield.\n  It is perfectly acceptable to me, Madam President.\n  It will take a unanimous consent to vary the order in which the \namendments were presented, is that not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HELMS. Just so there will be no accidental mistake made, I ask \nunanimous consent that all amendments be voted on tomorrow morning in \nthe order in which they were presented.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could the Senator state again what the request was? As I \nunderstood it, we were in the process of trying to work out a consent \nrequest to cover the disposition of the measures tomorrow.\n  Mr. HELMS. If the Senator will yield. I am not suggesting anything \nthat would vary the unanimous consent that I hold in my hand. I favor \nthat. I simply want to be sure that all amendments are voted upon in \nthe order in which they were presented.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see the Senator from Kansas on the floor.\n  \n[[Page S10723]]\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Well, I did not present my amendment regarding \npromotional activities until you had completed presenting all of your \namendments. I wonder in the voting if they could not follow each other, \nso that we are----\n  Mr. HELMS. Is that the one where you deleted the second half of mine?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Yes. Although it is changed.\n  Mr. HELMS. You did not change the language in the first half?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Yes. It is a different approach because it is just \ntargeted to the care, but using some similar language.\n  We are going to end up voting on the Senator's amendment. This says \nthe same thing but does not get into a definition.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I am going to have to suggest the absence \nof a quorum on this one because that is a contradiction of my \nunderstanding. Perhaps I can correct it. May I see a copy?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. The Senator has it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I ask that it be in order for the Senator \nfrom North Carolina to ask for the yeas and nays on final passage on \nthe Ryan White bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is in order.\n  Mr. HELMS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1859\n\n  (Purpose: To strike provisions relating to the medicare wage index)\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Graham of Florida for immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] for Mr. Graham \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1859.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 41, line 7, strike ``the product of--'' \n     and all that follows through line 15, and insert the \n     following ``an amount equal to the estimated number of living \n     cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome in the eligible \n     area involved, as determined under subparagraph (C).''.\n       On page 43, strike lines 1 through 13.\n       On page 43, line 14, strike ``(E)'' and insert (D)''.\n       On page 43, line 24, strike ``(F)'' and insert (E)''.\n       On page 44, line 3, strike the end quotation marks and the \n     second period.\n       On page 46, line 5, strike ``the product'' and all that \n     follows through line 14, and insert the following ``an amount \n     equal to the estimated number of living cases of acquired \n     immune deficiency syndrome in the eligible area involved, as \n     determined under subparagraph (D).''.\n       Beginning on page 46, line 17, strike ``means the'' and all \n     that follows through line 8 on page 47, and insert the \n     following: ``means an amount equal to the sum of--\n       ``(i) the estimated number of living cases of acquired \n     immune deficiency syndrome in the State or territory \n     involved, as determined under subparagraph (D); less\n       ``(ii) the estimated number of living cases of acquired \n     immune deficiency syndrome in such State or territory that \n     are within an eligible area (as determined under part A).''.\n       Beginning on page 48, strike line 1 and all that follows \n     through line 14 on page 49.\n       On page 49, line 15, strike ``(F)'' and insert (E)''.\n       On page 49, line 19, strike ``(G)'' and insert (F)''.\n       On page 50, line 4, strike ``(H)'' and insert (G)''.\n       On page 53, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC. 7. STUDY ON ALLOTMENT FORMULA.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     (hereafter referred to in this section as the ``Secretary'') \n     shall enter into a contract with a public or nonprofit \n     private entity, subject to subsection (b), for the purpose of \n     conducting a study or studies concerning the statutory \n     formulas under which funds made available under part A or B \n     of title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act are allocated \n     among eligible areas (in the case of grants under part A) and \n     States and territories (in the case of grants under part B). \n     Such study or studies shall include--\n       (1) an assessment of the degree to which each such formula \n     allocates funds according to the respective needs of eligible \n     areas, State, and territories;\n       (2) an assessment of the validity and relevance of the \n     factors currently included in each such formula;\n       (3) in the case of the formula under part A, an assessment \n     of the degree to which the formula reflects the relative \n     costs of providing services under such title XXVI within \n     eligible areas;\n       (4) in the case of the formula under part B, an assessment \n     of the degree to which the formula reflects the relative \n     costs of providing services under such title XXVI within \n     eligible States and territories; and\n       (5) any other information that would contribute to a \n     thorough assessment of the appropriateness of the current \n     formulas.\n       (b) National Academy of Sciences.--The Secretary shall \n     request the National Academy of Sciences to enter into the \n     contract under subsection (a) to conduct the study described \n     in such subsection.

The Comptroller General shall \n     review the study after its transmittal to the committees \n     described in subsection (c) and within 3 months make \n     appropriate recommendations concerning such report to such \n     committees.\n       On page 53, line 21, strike ``7'' and insert ``8''.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, this amendment has been agreed to by \nboth sides. It addresses a problem that would exist particularly in \nFlorida regarding formula. It is designed to be of assistance in \naddressing that in a way that we have all agreed we think works, to \neveryone's benefit.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I urge the acceptance of the amendment. \nThis addresses some of the special needs of the State of Florida. I \nthink it is justified. I hope the amendment would be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1859) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, they are trying to put together a final \nagreement so that they can go out tonight. Until they do, let me take a \nfew minutes and express myself on the Ryan White bill.\n  Madam President, people are dying. People are dying and we have the \nchance today or tomorrow to enact legislation that will really make a \ndifference--really make a difference in their lives, and the lives of \ntheir families and friends who love them.\n  We have the chance to enact legislation that will help alleviate some \nof the pain and suffering of individuals who are infected with HIV.\n  We have a chance to enact bipartisan legislation showing that \nCongress cares more about people--about people who are critically ill \nand need our help--than about how those people got ill.\n  Madam President, in 1981, two physicians unknown to each other, on \nopposite ends of the United States, made similar observations that they \nwould \n\n[[Page S10724]]\nthen publish in their respective medical journals.\n  They noted that a small group of their otherwise healthy patients \nwere becoming infected with organisms that would normally affect \nindividuals who were for some reason immune-suppressed. In layman's \nterms--these patients had a weakened immune system.\n  By the end of the following year, 1982, almost a thousand cases of \nthe disease had been reported to the Centers for Disease Control. \nCongress had appropriated $8 million for research to combat this \nmysterious virus.\n  Over the next few years, the number of such cases dramatically \nincreased and began to spread throughout the country, as did our \nrealization that the virus, now called acquired immune deficiency \nsyndrome, AIDS, was not going to be eradicated overnight.\n  Funding for research rose to $44 million in fiscal year 1983, $104 \nmillion in fiscal year 1984 and by fiscal year 1990 had reached $3 \nbillion. By 1987, there were cases in each of our 50 States.\n  As I look back, I recall how AIDS began to touch on each of our daily \nlives, as the number of cases grew, and the need for increasing \nresearch and service-related funding for this growing epidemic.\n  We began to expand funding beyond the Department of Health and Human \nServices, to the Department of Defense, the Agency for International \nDevelopment, and the Bureau of Prisons.\n  We funded the Department of Labor, the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development and the Veterans Administration. We provided funding \nthrough the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.\n  Our response grew with the magnitude of the disease, as it should \ncontinue today.\n  As I think back to the early days of AIDS, and how the growing \nnumbers of infected individuals and the resultant death toll caused \nthis country so much alarm and panic.\n  Unfortunately, as with any unsuspected crisis, the immediate response \nfrom many--including members of both houses of Congress--could be \ncharacterized as denial, anger, and blame. Fortunately, over time, our \ncompassion has grown for those infected with this insidious virus, as \nour understanding about the causes of and treatments for this \ndevastating disease increased.\n  As I look back, I think of the swift reaction of our health care \ncommunity, yet how painfully clear it was that both our research and \nservice delivery infrastructures lacked the capacity to address the \ngrowing number of cases of HIV infection.\n  I talked about our growing research effort. I did not talk about the \ndedication of our scientists, and their ensuing frustration, as a \ncure--or even a vaccine--continued to elude our grasp.\n  Today, they still remain outside our grasp.\n  As I look back, I recall how the service delivery programs evolved--\nthe AIDS service demonstration projects, the home and community-based \nhealth services grant programs, and the AIDS drug reimbursement \nprogram--yet we still could not keep pace with the need for services in \nour communities.\n  They came out of our Labor Committee, and we were proud to authorize \nthose programs which have really served to help people. But they were \nnot enough.\n  Out of this great need for community-based, compassionate care was \nborn the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency [CARE] Act \nof 1990, a bill I was pleased to author with my colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy.\n  We named the bill after Ryan White, a courageous, intelligent and \ncaring young man from Indiana, who worked tirelessly to educate others \nabout HIV and AIDS. Ryan helped replace fear and indifference with hope \nand compassion. One of the great lessons of his life--that we should \nnot discriminate against those with the HIV virus of other illness--\nremains true today. His tireless efforts, indeed his legacy, is being \ncarried on by his mother, Jeanne White. And I met with her a number of \ntimes. And I have to say she is doing a good job.\n  There are so many others who have spoken out with the same spirit and \neloquence, including Mary Fisher, founder of the Family AIDS Network, \nwho is a tireless crusader against AIDS, and our much-missed friend \nElizabeth Glaser, who established the Pediatric AIDS Foundation which \nhas done so much to improve the lives of children infected with HIV.\n  I can remember when she first walked into my office. I did not know a \nlot about pediatric AIDS. I knew about adult AIDS. But I did not \nrealize so many children were being infected at that time. When she \nwalked in and explained it to me, I have to say we decided to help her. \nOur colleagues, Senator Metzenbaum and others, helped her raise her \nfirst million dollars for the Pediatric AIDS Foundation at a wonderful \ndinner here in Washington, DC and she went on from there to raise \nseveral more million dollars in the fight against AIDS, and, of course, \nshe is one of the most valued heroines in this country, as far as I am \nconcerned. There have been so many unnamed others in countless \ncommunities across the Nation.\n  Today, we have before us reauthorization of the Ryan White CARE Act.\n  My message is simple: it is an important act. It must be \nreauthorized.\n  The need continues.\n  Let me discuss a few dramatic facts in order to highlight the \ntremendous impact of this disease and explain why this bill should be \npassed.\n  The most revealing fact is that the No. 1 cause of death for males \naged 29 to 44 is now AIDS.\n  In the last decade, the proportion of cases represented by women has \nalmost tripled.\n  Even in my small home state of Utah, it is estimated by the \nDepartment of Health that there are 5,000 people infected with the HIV \nvirus. To date, 1,110 have been diagnosed with full-blown AIDS, and 644 \nhave died.\n  Indeed, our knowledge of AIDS has expanded dramatically since those \nearly days.\n  We now know that AIDS is not a gay disease, or a Haitian disease.\n  We know that it cannot be transmitted by casual contact.\n  We know that it affects man, woman and child, whatever race, whatever \nnationality.\n  AIDS does not play favorites. It affects rich and poor, adults and \nchildren, men and women, rural communities and the inner city.\n  We know much, but the fear remains.\n  Madam President, things have changed since 1990. But the need for \nthis legislation remains.\n  The number of cases continues to increase. At the end of 1994, the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention had recorded 441,528 cases \nof HIV. The number continues to grow.\n  The emotional and economic burden for HIV patients and their families \nis substantial, and it continues.\n  The Ryan White CARE Act has made a difference and should continue to \nmake a difference.\n  There is so much that remains to be done.\n  Since its enactment in 1990, the Ryan White AIDS Care Act has \nprovided the necessary assistance to those persons and their families \naffected by the AIDS epidemic. Often, the funding provides for models \nof HIV service delivery that are considered to be some of the most \nsuccessful health care delivery models in history.\n  I am very proud of Utah's Ryan White program. Let me tell you of some \nof our accomplishments.\n  Ryan White funds were used to establish a home health services \nprogram which provides much needed homemaker, health aide, personal \ncare, and routine diagnostic testing services.\n  A drug therapy program has been established that offers AZT and other \ndrugs to individuals infected with HIV.\n  Ryan White funds have been used to provide health and support \nservices through an HIV Care Consortium, which offers vital services \nsuch as dental, mental health counseling, transportation, benefits \nadvocacy, eye exams and glasses, legal advocacy, information and \neducation, nutrition counseling, and substance abuse counseling.\n  These are programs which are in place and which are working. They \nshould be continued.\n  I believe it is vital that we reauthorize the Ryan White Act.\n  Madam President, many have noted that AIDS brings out the best and \nworst in people. Let us hope that this debate reflects the best of the \ngreat American traditions of reaching out to those in our community.\n \n[[Page S10725]]\n\n  I plead with my colleagues today, and I will tomorrow, let us not \nbackslide on this. I wish to compliment the distinguished chairman of \nthe Labor and Human Resources Committee, and the ranking member, \nSenators Kassebaum and Kennedy, for the work that they have done and \nfor the courageous way that they have gone about it and for the work \nthey have done on the floor here this day. I personally respect both of \nthem very much, and I appreciate what they are doing in this bill.\n  Our progress has been great, but we have so much more to do to wipe \nout this virus. Let us hope and pray that one day, like smallpox, the \nHIV virus will be eradicated as a public health problem, and that is \nwhat we are talking about, public health, for everybody. Until then, \nRyan White programs offer the only glimmer of hope to thousands of \nAmericans who are living with HIV.\n  So I wish to thank my esteemed colleagues, especially our floor \nmanagers today, Senators Kassebaum and Kennedy and others who have \nworked so hard to move this important piece of legislation forward. I \nwill work with them in any way I can to see that this legislation is \nsent to the President as quickly as possible, and I again hope that we \ncan do this probably tomorrow morning.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, I wish to express appreciation to \nthe Senator from Utah. Senator Hatch, as he mentioned, was the original \ncosponsor along with Senator Kennedy of the Ryan White CARE Act in \n1990. If it had not been for the leadership he provided, I am not sure \nwe would be here today debating renewal of that legislation. It was \ncrucial at that time to help develop an understanding of what it was \nall about, and I think without Senator Hatch's strong and forthright \nand dedicated concern at that time, it would have been extremely \ndifficult to have the public awareness and support that it has. I just \nwish to express that appreciation to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, I certainly thank her for her \nkind remarks, but I feel equally disposed to congratulate her and to \nthank her for the work she is doing this year and has done in the past. \nShe and Senator Kennedy have done a very good thing here. So I thank \nher very much.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I would just say Senator Hatch, of course, we miss on \nthe Labor Committee, where he was at one time chairman and ranking \nmember, and I have big shoes to follow in that leadership on the Labor \nand Human Resources Committee.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, earlier today during the debate on S. 641, \nthe Ryan White CARE Reauthorization Act, the distinguished senior \nSenator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] raised questions concerning \nwhere the appropriations for the Ryan White Program have been going. He \nindicated that he had been unable to receive any detailed information \nfrom the Clinton administration. He further stated his hope that the \nAppropriations Committee would be able to provide such information in \nconnection with the fiscal year 1996 appropriations bill. I have asked \nthe staff to look into this matter and get such information as is \navailable as quickly as possible. For now, I have a CRS Report dated \nMarch 31, 1995, entitled ``Health Care Fact Sheet: Ryan White CARE Act \nReauthorization.'' This report sets forth the programs which are \nauthorized for funding under the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS \nResources Emergency Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-381). Under that act, this \nreport states that:\n\n       Grants are made to States, to certain metropolitan areas, \n     and to other public or private nonprofit entities both for \n     the direct delivery of treatment services and for the \n     development, organization, coordination, and operation of \n     more effective service delivery systems for individuals and \n     families with HIV disease.\n\n  It further states that for fiscal year 1995, $633 million has been \nappropriated for these purposes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the report be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n CRS Report for Congress--Health Care Fact Sheet: Ryan White CARE Act \n                            Reauthorization\n\n       The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS (acquired immune \n     deficiency syndrome) Resources Emergency (CARE) Act of 1990 \n     (P.L. 101-381) authorized a set of Federal grant programs to \n     provide emergency assistance to localities disproportionately \n     affected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic. \n     Grants are made to States, to certain metropolitan areas, and \n     to other public or private nonprofit entities both for the \n     direct delivery of treatment services and for the \n     development, organization, coordination, and operation of \n     more effective service delivery systems for individuals and \n     families with HIV disease. Total FY 1995 appropriations were \n     $633 million. CARE Act programs are currently authorized \n     through FY 1995. On Mar. 29, 1995, this Senate Committee on \n     Labor and Human Resources ordered reported S. 641, the Ryan \n     White CARE Reauthorization Act of 1995. The bill would modify \n     the CARE Act programs and extend authorizations through FY \n     2000.\n\n\n                  current ryan white care act programs\n\n       Title I of the Act provides emergency formula and \n     supplemental grants to disproportionately affected, eligible \n     metropolitan areas (EMAs). Eligible areas with more than \n     2,000 cases of AIDS, or where the cumulative per capita \n     incidence exceeds one quarter of 1% may apply for title I \n     funds. Half of each year's appropriation is distributed to \n     EMAs under a formula based on cumulative caseload and \n     incidence; the remainder is used for supplemental grants \n     awarded on the basis of applications by EMAs. Forty-two EMAs \n     received funds for FY 1995, up from 16 in FY 1991. Title I \n     funds are directed to the chief elected official \n     administering the public health agency providing outpatient \n     and ambulatory services to the greatest number of persons \n     with AIDS in the designated area. The official must establish \n     an HIV Health Services Planning Council which further sets \n     priorities for care delivery in accord with Federal \n     guidelines.\n       Title II provides formula grants to States and Territories \n     for comprehensive care services including home and community-\n     based care, continuity of health insurance coverage, payment \n     for pharmaceuticals and other treatments to prevent \n     deterioration of health, and other services. Grants are \n     allocated on the basis of recent AIDS caseload and State per \n     capita income. States reporting 1% or more of the national \n     AIDS caseload are required to match Federal funds ($1 State \n     for every $2 Federal in FY 1995) and must use\n      50% or more of their grant toward establishing an HIV health \n     and support services consortium. The Secretary withholds \n     10% of Title II appropriations to support special projects \n     of national significance (SPNS), a grant program that \n     promotes advancements in the delivery of health care and \n     support services to the HIV population.\n       Title III(b) provides early intervention categorical grants \n     to public and private nonprofit entities already providing \n     primary care services to populations at risk of HIV. Services \n     allowed under title III(b) include counseling and testing, \n     case management, outreach, medical evaluation, transmission \n     prevention, and risk reduction strategies. (Title III(a), \n     authorizing early intervention grants to States, has never \n     been funded.)\n       Title IV authorizes a number of different HIV-related \n     programs, of which only one, pediatric demonstration grants, \n     had been funded. These grants foster collaboration and \n     coordination between clinical research and health care \n     providers and target HIV infected children, pregnant women, \n     and their families.\n       Appropriations for FY 1995 total $633 million as follows: \n     $357 million for title I, $198 million for title II, $52 \n     million for title III, and $26 million for title IV. (On \n     March 2, the full House Committee on Appropriations rejected \n     a subcommittee reported rescission of $13 million in FY 1995 \n     funds.)\n\n\n        S. 641, the Ryan White CARE Reauthorization Act of 1995\n\n       As reported, S. 641 authorizes appropriations of such sums \n     as may be necessary for all titles for FY 1996 through \n     FY2000. It makes numerous changes in CARE Act programs, \n     including expansion of permissible services, stronger \n     planning and coordination requirements, and a greater \n     emphasis on services to minorities and to women and children. \n     There are also important funding changes, as follows:\n       A single appropriation would be authorized for titles I and \n     II. For FY1996, 64% of funds would go to title I; a method \n     for distribution for later years would be developed by the \n     Secretary.\n       Allocation formulas for titles I and II would be based on \n     estimated persons living with AIDS (rather than cumulative \n     cases) and would include a new factor reflecting area \n     variation in the costs of services. These changes would \n     redirect funds to the areas where the epidemic is growing \n     most rapidly; temporary hold-harmless provisions would \n     prevent sharp funding reductions for existing grantees.

KOHL. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor and enthusiastic \nsupporter of S. 641, the Ryan White CARE Act reauthorization.\n  The AIDS epidemic is a continuing crisis in our Nation that shows no \nsign of abating. Once a problem for only a few big urban areas, the \ncrisis has increasingly impacted people in smaller cities and rural \nareas. More and more Americans are seeing friends and relatives \nstricken with HIV disease and are struggling to find adequate services \nfor their loved ones.\n  Mr. President, over 2,700 Wisconsinites have been diagnosed with HIV \ninfection and AIDS since 1985. As of March 1995, the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention has reported 481,234 cases of AIDS \nnationwide. The Ryan White CARE Act has been critical for communities \nresponding to the AIDS crisis by helping to establish coordinated \nhealth care systems. Over 300,000 people afflicted with the disease \nreceive life-prolonging treatment through the act.\n  This bill continues programs that help hard-hit municipal areas, \nsupport coordinated State efforts to combat AIDS, and provide primary \ncare to special populations, including pregnant women and children. The \nRyan White CARE Act represents the most effective type of government \ninitiative; it targets State and Federal Government resources to fund \ncomprehensive plans under the guidance of community leaders, medical \nprofessionals, affected populations, and officials at municipal, State, \nand Federal levels.\n  Since the enactment of the Ryan White CARE Act, Wisconsin has \nutilized its limited allocations to reach underserved areas of the \nState while concentrating resources on hard-hit communities. Care is \navailable to citizens in every part of the State, not just a few \ncities. All funding in Wisconsin is provided through a consortium of \ncommunity-based groups. This community oriented approach has allowed \ndelivery of services to AIDS patients in their home, avoiding costly \nlong-term hospitalization until absolutely necessary. The result is \ncompassionate care for the afflicted and considerably less Medicaid \nspending, which saves State and Federal resources.\n  The Ryan White CARE Act has proven invaluable in meeting the AIDS \ncrisis, but like most government programs, has room for improvement. I \nam pleased to say that this bill does not simply continue the status \nquo of the original legislation. There are substantial changes that \nbetter target Federal resources while meeting the current threat of HIV \nand AIDS. These consensus changes were carefully worked out with input \nfrom those who fight the AIDS tragedy every day.\n  The bill resolves longstanding formula inequities that pitted groups \nagainst one another. The new formula responds to the evolving dynamics \nof the epidemic. Using General Accounting Office recommendations, \nfunding would now be distributed based on those currently living with \nAIDS and the changing cost of care.\n  States where AIDS is widespread, but without cities designated as \n``eligible metropolitan areas,'' have not qualified for title I \nfunding. Such States, like Wisconsin, have relied on limited \nallocations of title II funding in order to reach the afflicted in both \nurban and rural areas. The revised bill changes title I and title II \nfunding by including an estimation of the number of individuals \ncurrently living with AIDS and the costs of providing services. The new \ntitle II formula is adjusted so that cases are not double counted, \nwhich unfairly advantages some States that also have title I cities. \nProvisions are also included to prevent service disruptions due to the \nformula changes.\n  We must improve our response to AIDS given the alarming growth of the \nepidemic. Few would question that AIDS is one of the leading public \nhealth threats facing our Nation and the world. As such, a unified \nresponse must be maintained. This bill contains positive changes to \nequitably distribute funding and allows communities to continue working \ntogether to provide the most effective treatment for AIDS victims.\n  Mr. President, let us not get bogged down in extraneous issues that \ncloud the purpose of this legislation. The nature of this crisis \ndemands targeted, compassionate treatment for those afflicted with a \ndevastating disease. Women, children, and men of all ages and \nbackgrounds are victims of HIV. Families and whole communities have \nbeen devastated by AIDS. They deserve our continued commitment.\n  The Ryan White CARE Act received strong bipartisan support when \noriginally enacted. With 63 current cosponsors of S. 641, the Senate's \nresolve to advance this important measure is clear and should remain \nundeterred.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Ryan White CARE Act and provide \nquick passage.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I am going to vote against S. 641, the so-\ncalled Ryan White CARE Act.\n  This is not going to be a popular vote, and I am sure that many will \nsay that I am being unfair to AIDS victims and their families. But, I \nbelieve that this it is this bill that is unfair.\n  Unfair to persons suffering from other diseases, and their families. \nUnfair to small States, like New Hampshire. Unfair to the taxpayers.\n  First of all, let me make it clear that I take a back seat to no \nSenator in my concern for those inflicted with HIV and AIDS. I have \nalways supported Federal AIDS research. But, we are already funding \nAIDS research.\n\n[[Page S10727]]\n\n  In fact, AIDS research is by far the most heavily funded area at the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n  Earlier this year, I was sent a table from the American Heart \nAssociation regarding the distribution of research dollars at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. The table tracks HHS research \nfunding dollars spent per death in fiscal year 1993.\n  It tracks five diseases--HIV-AIDS, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, \nand stroke. We are spending $36,763 per HIV-AIDS death, $5,421 per \ndiabetes death, $3,708 per cancer death, $1,032 per heart death, and \n$731 per stroke death.\n  Clearly, relative to other diseases, the Federal Government has \ndemonstrated a firm commitment to funding AIDS research. In fact, the \nAmerican Heart Association materials go on to say that HHS--\n\n     spends 36 times more research funding per death of an AIDS \n     victim than was spent per death of a victim of heart disease. \n     Similarly, with regard to dollars spent per death, AIDS \n     funding exceeded stroke funding by 50 to 1.\n\n  It seems that, in an effort to demonstrate our commitment to AIDS, we \nhave seriously shortchanged many other devastating illnesses.\n  As you can see, AIDS research is already being funded. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that this bill will cost $3.7 \nbillion over the next 6 years. So, where is this $3.7 billion going to \ngo? If it is not research, what exactly is the Ryan White CARE Act?\n  One of the architects of the Ryan White Program, the senior Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, summarized in his opening statement how Ryan White \nfunds have assisted the city of Boston:\n\n     15,000 individuals are receiving primary care, 8,000 are \n     receiving dental care, and 9,000 are receiving mental health \n     services. An additional 700 are receiving case management \n     services and nutrition supplements.\n\n  I am very pleased to hear that so many people are being assisted in \nthis way, particularly in Boston--right across the border.\n  But, Mr. President, what makes someone with AIDS more entitled to \nfederally funded mental health or dental services than someone with \ncancer or diabetes or Alzheimer's?\n  No other disease has its own program like this.\n  I am not saying that we should pit one disease against another, and \nsay that they ought to all receive the same amount of funds.\n  What I am saying is that we are already spending huge amounts of \nmoney on AIDS, without this bill.\n  Would I like to see AIDS victims receive these services? Of course I \nwould. I would like for everyone to receive these services.\n  But, we need to face the budgetary realities. Our national debt \nrecently climbed over the $4.9 trillion mark. It is rapidly reaching $5 \ntrillion. We can't just keep plowing full speed ahead with these sorts \nof spending programs without contemplating how we are going to pay for \nthem.\n  But, Mr. President, what concerns this Senator in particular is how \nmy State of New Hampshire gets shortchanged in the funding formula in \nS. 641.\n  The Senate Labor Committee provided me with a State-by-State \nbreakdown of 1996 funds under this bill. According to the Labor \nCommittee, when you combine titles I and II, my State of New Hampshire \ngets about $1,125,000.\n  It is difficult to look at this number and determine whether this is \nhigher or lower than what we should be getting. So, my staff \ncalculated, using Census Bureau population statistics, how much each \nState gets back for every dollar it contributed for this bill. This new \nbreakdown clearly shows where most of the money is going.\n  New Hampshire gets only 20 cents on the dollar.\n  That is, for every dollar we put in, we only got 20 cents back, while \nthe State of New York gets $3.18 for every dollar they put in.\n  Washington, DC, gets $7.26 for every dollar.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this State-by-State breakdown be \nincluded in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n FISCAL YEAR 1996 FUNDING BREAKDOWN FOR S. 641, THE RYAN WHITE CARE ACT \n

Mr. President, as I look at this table, it seems to me \nthat my State would be better off funding its AIDS programs on its own.\n  If we collected $10 in State taxes, we would have $10 to spend on \nAIDS services.\n  But, under this formula, we give the Federal Government $10, and \nUncle Sam writes us a check for $2, and then tells us how to spend it.\n  I would urge my colleagues to take a look at this breakdown, and \nconsider how their own State does, before supporting this bill.\n  Mr. President, I have to congratulate the proponents of this \nlegislation. They have done a superb job at packaging it up with a \nglitzy title, lots of cosponsors, and a masterful press campaign.\n  Everyone knows the story of Ryan White, the courageous 13-year-old \nboy who fell prey to this devastating disease.\n  It is a very effective technique. You name your bill after a person \nwith a heroic story who is deeply admired by millions of Americans, \nlike Ryan White, and people are afraid to vote against it.\n  This makes for good politics, but, too often, bad policy.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, if Ryan White were alive today, because he \nwas from Kokomo, IN, and not a big city, he would not qualify for \nassistance under the emergency relief program--which accounts for $368 \nmillion--nearly half of next year's funds.\n  The only funds that he might qualify for would be under the ``CARE \ngrant program'' (title II) which are distributed by a formula using the \nnumbers of AIDS cases, rather than the size of the cities. But, \naccording to CBO, the formula in this bill only allocates $205 million \nfor this section--just over half the amount allocated for the big \ncities.\n  So, the big cities get $368 million, the rest of the country--\nincluding those same big cities--get to divide up the $205 million that \nis left over.\n  If we are trying to help all AIDS victims, like Ryan White, why are \nmost of the funds being funneled into large cities?\n  Some would argue that they get more funds because they have more AIDS \ncases. That is not why they do better under this bill.\n  That might be the reason that States with big cities get more money \nunder title II, the $205 million CARE program. But the bulk of funds in \nthis bill go to title I--$368 million.\n  That section says that big cities, cities with more than 500,000 \nresidents, get all of the money, as long as they have more than 2,000 \ncases of AIDS.\n  If you have 499,000 residents, and a huge AIDS population, forget it. \nYou get nothing. This has nothing to do with AIDS cases, or fairness, \nor need--only size.\n  Suffice it to say that my State does not have any cities that are \nthat big.\n\n[[Page S10728]]\n\n  Manchester has about 100,000 people.\n  Nashua has about 80,000.\n  Concord has about 36,000.\n  So, this bill says ``tough luck for the State of New Hampshire, and \nmany other States.''\n  That is not to say that New Hampshire does no have an AIDS problem. \nWe have the same problem that every other State has.\n  I would urge my colleagues to take a look at the state-by-state \nbreakdown that I put in the Record earlier and see how your own State \ndoes.\n  But, we could have the highest incidence of AIDS in the Nation, and \nthat would not matter. Under title I, it is cut and dry. Unless you \nhave 500,000 residents, you don't get a nickel.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, it would be very easy for me to look \nthe other way and vote for this bill. I would probably save myself a \nlot of grief and controversy.\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, I think we have now reached an \nagreement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be the only \namendments in order to S. 641, and that no second-degree amendments be \nin order to the amendments: the pending amendment is No. 1854. Then \nfollowing, Helms amendment 1855; Helms amendment 1857, regarding \nfunding equity; Helms amendment 1856, regarding training; Kassebaum \namendment 1860, regarding funding equity; a Kassebaum amendment \nregarding promotion, 1858; a Gregg amendment regarding FDA, and a \nKennedy amendment regarding FDA.\n  Further, that all debate time be used on the above-listed amendments \nthis evening with the exception of the amendment to be offered by \nSenator Gregg, and the amendment to be offered by Senator Kennedy.\n  Further, that at the hour of 9:15 a.m. on Thursday, Senator Reid be \nrecognized for up to 15 minutes for general debate on the bill, to be \nfollowed at 9:30 by Senator Gregg, to be recognized to offer his \namendment on which there would be 1 hour to be equally divided in the \nusual form.\n  I further ask that following the conclusion of the debate on the \nGregg amendment, Senator Kennedy be recognized to offer his amendment \nregarding FDA, on which there would be 30 minutes to be equally divided \nin the usual form, and that following that debate the Senate proceed to \nvote first on the Helms amendment 1854, followed in sequence with two \nback-to-back votes on other amendments in the order in which they were \noffered, and that there be 10 minutes for explanation between each of \nthe remaining votes, to be equally divided in the usual form, and that \nfollowing the disposition of the above-listed amendments, the Senate \nproceed to third reading and final passage, all without any intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Further, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat any votes occurring after 12:30 p.m. as a result of this agreement \nbe postponed to occur at a time to be determined by the two leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, there are no further votes for this evening.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I ask unanimous consent that further proceedings \nunder the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HIPP\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, over the past 40 years, South Carolina \nhas enjoyed tremendous economic growth, and has emerged as one of the \nNation's leading centers for commerce and industry. Many people have \nhad a role in this success, and I rise today to pay tribute to one \nperson who made many contributions to our State's prosperity, Mr. \nFrancis Moffett Hipp, who passed away earlier this week at the age of \n84.\n  Mr. Hipp was recognized throughout South Carolina as both a community \nand a business leader. His father founded the Liberty Life Insurance \nCo., which Francis eventually took over and ran as its chairman. Under \nhis direction, the company grew and diversified, even acquiring a chain \nof television stations, including one in Columbia, SC. The Liberty \nCorp., as it is now known, is one of our State's largest insurance \ncompanies, employing literally thousands of people and contributing an \ninestimable benefit to South Carolina and its economy.\n  Because of his stature as a businessman, and his concern for the \nfuture of our State, Mr. Hipp also served as the chairman of both the \nSouth Carolina Development Board and the South Carolina Research \nAuthority. Both these organizations have played important roles in \nexpanding the Palmetto State business community, and during his tenure \nat those agencies, Mr. Hipp's dedication and vision helped greatly to \ndevelop industry in our State. Thanks to the concerted efforts of \nFrancis Hipp, and those who worked with him, our State stands both \nfinancially stronger and better positioned to compete in the 21st \ncentury global marketplace.\n  Mr. President, Francis Hipp led a full and productive life, and \nthrough his work, he left a tremendous mark on South Carolina. He was a \ngifted businessman, a committed citizen of our State, and a dedicated \nand loyal family man. I was proud to count this man among my friends \nand regret that the Senate schedule prevented me from attending his \nmemorial service today. My sympathies and condolences go out to all who \nknew Francis Moffett Hipp, especially his sons; Hayne and John; and \ndaughter, Mary Jane Hipp Brock. We will all miss this man of integrity, \nability, and vision.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/26/senate-section/article/S10728-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE? LOOK AT THE ARITHMETIC\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on that evening in 1972 when I learned that \nI had been elected to the Senate, I made a commitment to myself that I \nwould never fail to see a young person, or a group of young people, who \nwanted to see me.\n  It has proved enormously beneficial to me because I have been \ninspired by the estimated 60,000 young people with whom I have visited \nduring the nearly 23 years I have been in the Senate.\n  Most of them have been concerned about the magnitude of the Federal \ndebt that Congress has run up for the coming generations to pay. The \nyoung people and I always discuss the fact that under the U.S. \nConstitution, no President can spend a dime of Federal money that has \nnot first been authorized and appropriated by both the House and Senate \nof the United States.\n  That is why I began making these daily reports to the Senate on \nFebruary 22, 1992. I wanted to make a matter of daily record of the \nprecise size of the Federal debt which as of yesterday, Tuesday, July \n25, stood at $4,940,346,340,499.40 or $18,753.63 for every man, woman \nand child in America on a per capita basis.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/26/senate-section/article/S10728-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10728-S10729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         IRISH-AMERICANS IN MISSISSIPPI TO HONOR CHOCTAW NATION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this year marks the 150th anniversary of \nthe beginning of the Great Famine in Ireland. While large numbers of \nmen, women, and children were dying of starvation in Ireland in those \ntragic years, a group of Native Americans in this country tried to \nhelp.\n  The Choctaw Nation of North America raised $170 in 1847--the \nequivalent of about $3,000 today--for the victims of the Irish famine. \nTheir contribution may have been small in terms of its \n\n[[Page S10729]]\nability to affect the massive human tragedy taking place in Ireland, \nbut it was a generous symbol of the compassion of the Choctaw Nation \nfor those in desperate need. Sixteen years before the famine began, the \nChoctaws themselves were the victims of a forced displacement following \npassage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which compelled most Native \nAmericans to move west of the Mississippi River. Many died on the \njourney known as the Trail of Tears. Yet despite their own tragic \ncircumstances, the Choctaw reached out to the Irish people, whom they \nsaw as more in pain and in need than themselves.\n  Earlier this year, President Mary Robinson of Ireland visited the \ntribal headquarters of the Choctaw Nation in Durant, OK, to thank the \nChoctaws personally for their ancestors' extraordinary generosity to \nthe Irish people. President Robinson often evokes the story of the \nChoctaw Nation when talking about the Famine and about how the echoes \nof Ireland's tragic past continue to reverberate in Ireland today, \ngiving the Irish a special affinity for those around the world who face \nhunger and oppression.\n  Everyone familiar with global humanitarian efforts knows that Irish \naid workers are often the first to arrive to help at places of \ndevastation around the world. President Robinson herself was one of the \nfirst to visit Somalia, and to call the world's attention to the \nstarvation there.\n  His Eminence Bernard Cardinal Law, the Archbishop of Boston, recently \ninformed me that Irish-Americans in Mississippi will honor the Choctaw \nNation on September 9 and 10 with a picnic at the Jim Buck Ross \nAgricultural Museum in Jackson, MS. The sponsors are hopeful that \nIrish-Americans in other parts of the country will enhance the success \nof this tribute. Anyone interested in learning more about this \nauspicious occasion should contact Mr. Sean McGuinness at the Celtic-\nAmerican Heritage Society, Post Office Box 5166, Jackson, MS 39296-\n5166.\n  I commend the Hibernian Society for this well-deserved honor for the \nChoctaw Nation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/26/senate-section/article/S10728-4", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    ANNOUNCEMENT OF POSITION ON VOTE\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, earlier today the Senate held three \nrollcall votes relating to United States policy in Bosnia. Regrettably, \nI was necessarily absent during these votes due to my attendance at a \nfuneral in South Carolina. Had I been present at the time, I would have \nvoted for the Cohen amendment, for the Nunn-Graham amendment, and for \nfinal passage of the Dole-Lieberman bill (S. 21).

Mr. President, I rise today to share with you the story \nof Marla Garber, a free spirit who rode the length and breadth of the \nUnited States on her motorcycle accompanied only by her dog Skooter.\n  She was a remarkable young woman; one of those ``rugged \nindividualists,'' constantly seeking adventure in her life and \ntraveling into the depths of the country in her pursuit of it. She \nshared the stories of the fascinating people she met on her journey's \nand the memories of the places she had seen with much of the American \npublic, writing for several motorcycle magazines. In this way, she was \nable to leave her mark on society and the people of the country.\n  Marla Garber was a woman of vision and strength, a pioneer in her \ntime. A friend of hers described her as one of those who ``followed \ntheir callings to and beyond the ends of the known world and came back \noverflowing with stories of strange places * * * and wondrous things \nthey'd seen.'' Marla Garber was unique for this day and age, and I \nadmire her spirit.\n  We all suffer from her loss, as surely as we all benefitted from \nhaving her among us.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/26/senate-section/article/S10729-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered by \nMr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 70.

Mr. President, I offer a bill similar to one I \nintroduced in the last Congress. My bill, the National Voter \nOpportunity To Inform Congress Effectively on Term Limits--or VOICE--\nAct, would authorize a national advisory referendum on term limits for \nMembers of Congress. It is a companion bill to legislation being \nintroduced today in the House by Congressman Pete Hoekstra of Michigan.\n  In recent years, the American people have come to realize that the \nseniority system, coupled with the overwhelming electoral advantages of \nincumbency, has created a class of career politicians--a class not \nenvisioned by our Founding Fathers.\n  Our Founding Fathers envisioned the Congress as a body of citizen-\nlegislators. People who had trades, professions, or businesses would \nserve for a period of time, bringing with them experience and fresh \nideas to shape the laws that would govern commerce and quality of life.\n  There has been a vigorous grassroots effort mounting in this country \nto return us to this vision. Especially over the past few years, the \nmovement to limit congressional terms has gained significant ground. \nDespite the Congress' reluctance to impose term limits on itself, the \npeople have chosen to press forward without us by passing ballot \ninitiatives to limit the terms of their own Federal representatives. In \n23 States--nearly half the country--the people have spoken \noverwhelmingly and unequivocally that they want the terms of their \nCongressmen and\n Senators to be limited.\n\n  Last May, the term limits movement suffered a major blow with the \nSupreme Court's ruling in U.S. Term Limits, Inc. versus Thornton. In a \n5-to-4 decision, the Court said the State-imposed term limits violate \nthe Constitution and that any effort to limit congressional terms must \nbe done through a constitutional amendment. This ruling effectively \noverturned all 23 States term-limits laws that had been passed up to \nnow.\n  The House's failure to pass an amendment last March proves that there \nis virtually no chance for term limits in this Congress. Even in this \nChamber, a recent rollcall survey found that we are still 24 votes shy \nof having enough support to approve a term-limits amendment. Congress \nis truly out of touch with America on this issue.\n  That is why, Mr. President, I feel it is so important that we give \nevery American, in all 50 States, an opportunity to speak directly to \ntheir Federal representatives on the term-limits matter. My bill would \ndo just that by conducting a nonbinding, national referendum. It would \nplace a simple and straightforward question on every ballot in the 1996 \nelection, ``Should Congress approve a constitutional amendment to limit \nthe number of terms that a Member of the United States House of \nRepresentatives and United States Senate can serve in office? Yes or \nNo.''\n  Let me hasten to add that this legislation would not create an \nunfunded Federal mandate. This bill provides that States would be \nreimbursed at a rate of 4 cents per voter for the cost of putting the \nquestion on the ballot. This Federal reimbursement would be offset by \ncorresponding reduction in the franking budget for Members of the House \nand Senate.\n  Mr. President, I want to urge my colleagues to join me in giving the \nAmerican people a voice in the next election on whether the terms of \ntheir representatives in the U.S. Congress should be limited. Rather \nthan debating about what we think the American people want and need, \nlet's give them the opportunity to tell us themselves, clearly and \ndirectly. It is time we invoke the communicative power of democracy and \nask the people what they think.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN (for herself, Mr. Simon, and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 1074. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nexpanding and intensifying activities of the National Institute of \nArthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases with respect to lupus; \nto the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                 the lupus research amendments of 1995\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing with \nSenators Simon and Inouye the Lupus Research Amendments of 1995. This \nbill would provide the funding so desperately needed by NIH to increase \ncurrent education, prevention, and treatment efforts.\n  Systemic lupus erythematosus [lupus] is a painful, potentially \ndevastating chronic autoimmune disease that occurs mostly in young \nwomen of childbearing age. Lupus causes the body's defense system to \nmalfunction and attack its own healthy organs. Every element of the \nvictim's musculoskeletal system is susceptible, ranging from the skin \nand joints to the blood, heart, lungs, and kidneys.\n  Health officials estimate that between 1.4 million and 2 million \nAmericans, 90 percent of whom are female, are afflicted with lupus. \nBoth the cause and a cure for lupus are currently unknown. Treatments \ncan be effective but can lead to adverse side effects which cause \nsevere and sometimes incapacitating pain, making it impossible for \nvictims to maintain jobs and live normal lives. Increased and intensive \nresearch, thus, offers the best hope for prevention and better \ntreatment of lupus and its related disabilities.\n  The Lupus Research Amendments of 1995 would expend clinical research \nfor the discovery and evaluation of new treatments; encourage the \ncoordination of improved screening techniques; and improve information \nand education programs for health care professionals and the public. In \naddition, researching the cause of lupus may reveal other abnormalities \nof the immune system, and this knowledge could help experts better \nunderstand related illnesses. It is to this end that I reintroduce this \nlegislation, which authorizes funding of $20 million for fiscal year \n1996 and such sums as may be necessary for both fiscal years 1997 and \n1998.\n  This legislation can make a real difference to the millions of \nAmericans, particularly women, who are afflicted with lupus. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nincluded in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1074\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Lupus Research Amendment of \n     1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) lupus is a serious, complex, inflammatory, autoimmune \n     disease of particular concern to women;\n       (2) lupus affects women 9 times more than men;\n       (3) there are 3 main types of lupus; systemic lupus, a \n     serious form of the disease that affect many parts of the \n     body; discoid lupus, a form of the disease that affects \n     mainly the skin; and drug-induced lupus caused by certain \n     medications;\n       (4) lupus can be fatal if not detected and treated early;\n       (5) the disease can simultaneously affect various areas of \n     the body, such as the skin, joints, kidneys, and brain, and \n     can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms of lupus \n     are similar to those of many other diseases;\n       (6) lupus disproportionately affects African-American \n     women, as the prevalence of the disease among such women is 3 \n     times the prevalence among white women, and an estimated 1 in \n     250 African-American women between the ages of 15 and 65 \n     develops the disease;\n       (7) it has been estimated that over 500,000 Americans have \n     been diagnosed with the disease, and that many more have \n     undiagnosed cases;\n\n[[Page S10731]]\n\n       (8) current treatment of the disease can be effective, but \n     may lead to damaging side effects; and\n       (9) many victims of the disease suffer debilitating pain \n     and fatigue, making it difficult to maintain employment and \n     lead normal lives.\n\n     SEC. 3. EXPANSION AND INTENSIFICATION OF ACTIVITIES REGARDING \n                   LUPUS.\n\n       Subpart 4 of part C of title IV of the Public Health \n     Service Act (42 U.S.C. 285d et seq.) is amended by inserting \n     after section 441 the following new section:\n\n\n                                ``lupus\n\n         ``Sec. 441A. (a) In General.--The Director of the \n     Institute shall expand and intensify research and related \n     activities of the Institute with respect to lupus.\n         ``(b) Coordination With Other Institutes.--The Director \n     of the Institute shall coordinate the activities of the \n     Director under subsection (a) with similar activities \n     conducted by the other national research institutes and \n     agencies of the National Institutes of Health to the extent \n     that such Institutes and agencies have responsibilities that \n     are related to lupus.\n       ``(c) Programs for Lupus.--In carrying out subsection (a), \n     the Director of the Institute shall conduct or support \n     research to expand the understanding of the causes of, and to \n     find a cure for, lupus. Activities under such subsection \n     shall include conducting and supporting the following:\n       ``(1) Research to determine the reasons underlying the \n     elevated prevalence of lupus in women, including African-\n     American women.\n       ``(2) Basic research concerning the etiology and causes of \n     the disease.\n       ``(3) Epidemiological studies to address the frequency and \n     natural history of the disease and the differences among the \n     sexes and among racial and ethnic groups with respect to the \n     disease.\n       ``(4) The development of improved screening techniques.\n       ``(5) Clinical research for the development and evaluation \n     of new treatments, including new biological agents.\n       ``(6) Information and education programs for health care \n     professionals and the public.\n       ``(d) Authorization of Appropriations.--For the purpose of \n     carrying out this section, there are authorized to be \n     appropriated $20,000,000 for fiscal year 1995, and such sums \n     as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 1996 and \n     1997. The authorization of appropriations established in the \n     preceding sentence is in addition to any other authorization \n     of appropriations that is available for such \n     purpose.''.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1075. A bill to reauthorize and improve the Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Act; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n   the individuals with disabilities education act amendments of 1995\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, 20 years ago this November, Congress \nenacted Public Law 94-142, the Education for All Handicapped Children \nAct, now known as part B of the Individuals With Disabilities Education \nAct [IDEA]. The purpose of this law is simple--to assist States and \nlocal communities meet their obligation to provide equal educational \nopportunity to children with disabilities in accordance with the equal \nprotection clause of the 14th amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n  I believe that IDEA is an excellent law. Prior to the enactment of \nPublic Law 94-142, 1 million children with disabilities were excluded \nentirely from receiving a public education and more than half of the \nchildren with disabilities in the United States did not receive \nappropriate educational services that would enable them to enjoy full \nequality of opportunity.\n  Because of IDEA, millions of children with disabilities are now \nreceiving a free and appropriate public education. Educational outcomes \nfor children with disabilities have improved dramatically over this 20-\nyear period.\n  For many parents who have disabled children, IDEA is a lifeline of \nhope. As one parent recently told me:\n\n       Thank God for IDEA. Because of IDEA our child is achieving \n     academic success. He is also treated by his nondisabled peers \n     as ``one of the guys.'' I am now confident that he will \n     graduate high school prepared to hold down a job and lead an \n     independent life.\n       The rewards of IDEA go beyond the classroom and into the \n     very being of our family. IDEA gives us the strength to face \n     the challenges of bringing up a child with a disability. We \n     know that our son is entitled to an appropriate education \n     just like his nondisabled peers. We also know that IDEA \n     provides us with the tools to ensure that the promise of \n     equal educational opportunity is realized.\n\n  In May, Danette Crawford, a junior at Urbandale High School in Des \nMoines, IA, testified before the Subcommittee on Disability Policy. \nDanette explained that she has cerebral palsy which greatly limits her \nability to carry out any personal care tasks and fine motor activities \nsuch as writing. She uses a wheelchair for mobility. Danette testified \nthat:\n\n       My grade point average stands at 3.8 and I am enrolled in \n     advanced placement courses. The education I am receiving is \n     preparing me for a real future. Without IDEA I am convinced I \n     would not be receiving the\n      quality education that Urbandale High School and the \n     Talented and Gifted Program provide me. After graduating \n     high school I hope to attend Carleton College in \n     Northfield, Minnesota, focusing on a double major in \n     political science or history and Spanish. Carlton is \n     sometimes referred to as the ``Harvard of the midwest.'' I \n     hope to pursue a law degree.\n\n  However, despite the great progress that has been made over the past \n20 years, significant challenges remain. As Secretary Riley points out, \ntoo many students with disabilities are still failing courses and \ndropping out of school; enrollment in postsecondary education is still \ntoo low; and too many students are leaving school ill-prepared for \nemployment and independent living.\n  As ranking member of the Subcommittee on Disability Policy, I am \npleased to introduce, along with Senator Kennedy, the ranking member of \nthe Labor and Human Resources Committee, the Clinton administration's \nbill reauthorizing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n  With this reauthorization we have the opportunity to take what we \nhave learned over the past 20 years and use it to update and improve \nthis critical law.\n  I commend Secretary Riley, Judy Heumann, Assistant Secretary for \nSpecial Education and Rehabilitative Services, Tom Hehir, Director of \nthe Office of Special Education Programs, and their staffs for \ndeveloping a carefully crafted bill that will enhance educational \nopportunities for over 5 million children with disabilities.\n  The administration has developed their bill based on numerous \nmeetings and discussions with all interested parties, including \nparents, educators, and administrators across the country. The \nadministration has reviewed over 2,000 recommendations sent in response \nto a call for comment last fall on suggestions for improving the IDEA.\n  I do not believe that everyone will be in complete agreement about \neach of the provisions in the bill. But, I do believe that the \nadministration has achieved a necessary balance that is so important in \nthis law.\n  I fully support the six key principles on which the administration's \nproposal are based:\n  Aligning IDEA with State and local education reform efforts so \nstudents with disabilities will benefit from them;\n  Improving results for students with disabilities through higher \nexpectations and meaningful access to the general curriculum, to the \nmaximum extent possible;\n  Addressing individual needs in the least restrictive environment for \nstudents;\n  Providing families and teachers with the knowledge and training to \neffectively support students' learning;\n  Focusing on teaching and learning; and\n  Strengthening early intervention to ensure that every child starts \nschool ready to learn.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Frist, the chair of the \nSubcommittee on Disability Policy, Senator Kassebaum the chair of the \nLabor Committee, and other colleagues to craft a consensus bill in the \ntradition of this committee. It is my hope that the administration's \nbill will be used as the vehicle for achieving this consensus.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter of transmittal \nof the administration's bill from Secretary Riley to Al Gore, in his \ncapacity as President of the Senate, be inserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 U.S. Department of Education,\n\n                                                    June 30, 1995.\n     Hon. Albert Gore, Jr.,\n     President of the Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Enclosed for consideration of the \n     Congress is the ``Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n     Amendments of 1995,'' the Administration's proposal for \n     improving and restructuring Federal education programs for \n     children with \n\n[[Page S10732]]\n     disabilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n     (IDEA). Also enclosed is a section-by-section analysis \n     summarizing the contents of the bill. I am sending an \n     identical letter to the Speaker of the House.\n       Since enactment of P.L. 94-142, the Education for All \n     Handicapped Children Act of 1975, results for children with \n     disabilities have improved dramatically. Before the enactment \n     of that ground-breaking law, one million children with \n     disabilities were excluded from school altogether, and many \n     were housed in dehumanizing institutions. Today, one of the \n     basic goals of the IDEA has been largely met--children with \n     disabilities have access to education. As we undertake a \n     review of this legislation, we reaffirm our commitment to the \n     basic purposes of the IDEA and the recognition of the Federal \n     role in ensuring that all children with disabilities are \n     provided the equal educational opportunity that the \n     Constitution guarantees. With this reauthorization, we have \n     the opportunity to take what we have learned over the past \n     twenty years and use it to update and improve this important \n     law.\n       Despite the great progress that has been made, significant \n     challenges remain. Too many students with disabilities are \n     failing courses and dropping out of school. When appropriate \n     interventions are not provided, these students often get in \n     trouble with the law and spend significant time in jail. \n     Enrollment in postsecondary education is still low, and \n     students are leaving school ill prepared for employment and \n     independent living. Children from minority backgrounds and \n     children with limited English proficiency are often \n     inappropriately identified as disabled and placed in special \n     education classrooms with low expectations. In addition, \n     school officials and others complain that the current law is \n     unnecessarily prescriptive, that it focuses too much on \n     paperwork and process, that it imposes unnecessary costs, \n     that it creates barriers to effective discipline, and that it \n     spawns too much litigation.\n       Our reauthorization proposal addresses these issues and \n     makes improvements to ensure that the fundamental objectives \n     of the law are achieved, while preserving and maintaining \n     existing rights and protections for children and their \n     families. We based our reauthorization proposal on six key \n     principles that clearly define our mission to improve results \n     for students with disabilities, beginning as early as \n     possible in the child's life.\n       (1) Align the IDEA with State and local education reform \n     efforts so students with disabilities can benefit from them.\n       (2) Improve results for students with disabilities through \n     higher expectations and meaningful access to the general \n     curriculum, to the maximum extent appropriate.\n       (3) Address individual needs in the least restrictive \n     environment for the student.\n       (4) Provide families and teachers--those closest to \n     students--with the knowledge and training to effectively \n     support students' learning.\n       (5) Focus on teaching and learning.\n       (6) Strengthen early intervention to ensure that every \n     child starts school ready to learn.\n       Aligning the IDEA with State and local education reform \n     efforts so students with disabilities can benefit from them \n     underlies our entire proposal.\n       We need to stop thinking about ``special education'' as a \n     separate program and separate place to put students and start \n     thinking about the supports and services children need in \n     whatever setting is the least restrictive--whether it be the \n     regular classroom, a resource room, a separate classroom, or \n     a separate school. We must promote the transformation of our \n     current categorical education system into a system for all \n     children that meets the individual needs of each child.\n       We envision an education system that sets higher \n     expectations for all students, gives all students the \n     opportunity to learn to challenging standards, and takes \n     responsibility and is accountable for the success of all \n     children. The strategies we describe below are critical to \n     the development of a system that meets this vision.\n       Our second principle is that the IDEA must focus on \n     improving results for students with disabilities through \n     higher expectations and meaningful access to the general \n     curriculum, to the maximum extent appropriate.\n       We know that most children work harder and do better when \n     more is expected of them. Disabled students are no different. \n     When we have high expectations for students with \n     disabilities, most can achieve to the challenging standards \n     established for all students, and all can achieve more than \n     society has historically expected.\n       One strategy for increasing expectations and access to the \n     general curriculum is improving the individualized education \n     program (IEP). Our proposal would refocus the IEP process on \n     educational results and include requirements that make more \n     sense. The new IEP would include meaningful annual objectives \n     for the student and focus on enabling the child to \n     participate and achieve in the general curriculum. Parents \n     would be informed of their children's progress, by means such \n     as report cards, with the same frequency used to inform \n     parents of nondisabled children. The IEP procedures would be \n     revised to require the participation of at least one regular \n     education teacher in the IEP meeting, and provide for earlier \n     transition planning to help ensure that each student \n     completes secondary school prepared for employment or \n     postsecondary education and independent living.\n       A related strategy for promoting high expectations and \n     access to the general curriculum is the inclusion of students \n     with disabilities in State and district-wide assessments. \n     While civil rights laws already prohibit the discriminatory \n     exclusion of students with disabilities from participation in \n     assessments, some States exclude over 90 percent of all \n     students with disabilities from those assessments. Of course, \n     a small number of students with significant cognitive \n     disabilities cannot appropriately be included in general \n     State and district-wide assessments. States and districts \n     would conduct alternate assessments for these few students.\n       Our long-range strategy is that each State would use \n     assessment results and other data it collects on students, \n     such as drop-out rates, to assess and report on its progress \n     toward meeting goals the State would establish for the \n     performance of children with disabilities. We believe that \n     when States assess students with disabilities and report to \n     the public on the results, they will focus more on ensuring \n     that students with disabilities receive the help they need to \n     participate and achieve in the general curriculum and meet \n     the challenging standards established for all students.\n       The third principle underlying our proposal is addressing \n     individual needs in the least restrictive environment \n     appropriate for the student.\n       A central purpose of the IDEA is to ensure that each child \n     receives an effective and individualized education that \n     addresses the child's particular needs in the least \n     restrictive environment. Today, children are often identified \n     and served according to the disability category within which \n     they are labeled rather than according to what they need to \n     achieve their full potential. Several critical changes will \n     help defeat this unfortunate categorization.\n       Our first strategy is to ensure that Federal and State \n     requirements and funding systems do not create disincentives \n     for appropriate placements and services. We propose that the \n     Federal funding formula be changed to allocate to States all \n     new funding above their fiscal year 1995 grants on the basis \n     of the total number of children in the State, not just \n     children with disabilities. This change in the formula would \n     remove disincentives for States to undertake improvements \n     such as the increased provision of early intervention \n     services, and would remove incentives for States to over-\n     identify students as disabled. We are also proposing that any \n     State that bases State aid on the type of settings in which \n     children are served demonstrate that its funding formula does \n     not result in placements that violate the IDEA's least-\n     restrictive-environment requirement or agree to change its \n     formula.\n       Our second strategy is to promote better ways of \n     identifying and serving students. Under the current IDEA, \n     students must be identified as being in one of 13 specific \n     disability categories to be served. This fosters an \n     undesirable categorical approach to evaluating, labeling, \n     placing, and serving children. We propose to use a new \n     eligibility definition which, together with changes in \n     reporting requirements, would encourage States to move toward \n     less categorical approaches, while permitting States to \n     retain their current eligibility criteria if they choose to \n     do so. Evaluation procedures would also be streamlined so \n     that what is educationally relevant is not lost and resources \n     can be better devoted to helping students. Currently, States \n     are required to conduct extensive evaluations and \n     reevaluations that are costly and of limited utility in \n     making decisions regarding a student's particular educational \n     needs. Under our proposal, agencies would be required to \n     convene an evaluation team every three years to consider the \n     need for additional data, but they would no longer have to \n     conduct tests to re-determine whether the child has a \n     disability unless the agency or parent believes it is \n     necessary. Our proposal would increase the focus of \n     evaluations and reevaluations on instructionally relevant \n     information and whether modifications are necessary to \n     achieve the IEP objectives for the child.\n       Our fourth principle is that families and teachers must \n     have the knowledge and training to effectively support \n     student learning.\n       We must provide families and teachers--those closest to \n     students--with the knowledge and training to effectively \n     support students' learning.\n       There are 14 categorical programs in the IDEA, and over the \n     past two decades there has been much good work done in each \n     of them. However, despite some real successes, we believe \n     that these programs need significant reform. Having developed \n     separately over the years to address specific issues, the 14 \n     programs are fragmented and too narrowly focused. We \n     envisioned a streamlined, comprehensive, and coordinated \n     approach for the discretionary programs that will be more \n     effective in improving results for children with \n     disabilities, while also making more effective use of \n     resources. To achieve this, our proposal would replace the 14 \n     current programs with five flexible authorities. This action \n     would reduce duplication and fragmentation, while fostering \n     collaborative, coordinated efforts across\n      disciplines. The programs would concentrate on developing \n     meaningful and timely information on improving results for \n     students with disabilities and then putting that \n     information into the hands of those who need it: States, \n     school districts, educators, and parents. To ensure that \n     issues concerning the special needs of children with low-\n     incidence disabilities, such \n\n[[Page S10733]]\n     as deaf-blindness, continue to be adequately addressed, there would be \n     a minimum ``floor'' for discretionary spending across the \n     new discretionary authorities to meet the needs of these \n     children.\n       Family involvement is at the heart of the IDEA. Our \n     proposal will more fully involve parents in decisions about \n     where and how their child is educated. For example, our \n     proposal would require parents to be involved in the decision \n     regarding the child's educational placement. Currently, \n     parents are entitled to participate in the IEP meeting in \n     which decisions are made about the services to be provided, \n     but they are not entitled to participate in placement \n     decisions, and are, therefore, often excluded. Detailed \n     notice to families of their rights is another critical \n     safeguard, yet families currently receive duplicative notices \n     with excessive and confusing information. Our proposal would \n     streamline the notice requirements while ensuring that \n     families would receive all the necessary information whenever \n     they need it.\n       We also want to reduce unnecessary lawsuits that create \n     emotional and financial burdens for parents and school \n     districts. While the right of parents to ``due process'' \n     hearings to resolve disputes is central to the implementation \n     of the law, recourse to these hearings should be a last \n     resort when less adversarial methods have failed. In States \n     that have mediation in place, parents and school districts \n     report that mediation not only helped them to clarify and \n     resolve their particular disagreement, but that it also \n     helped them to work together better and avoid future \n     conflicts. Our proposal would require that mediation be \n     offered to all parents as an option to resolve disputes.\n       Many children with disabilities have significant health and \n     other needs that cannot and should not be met by schools \n     alone. Our proposal would give States and districts the \n     flexibility to use some of their IDEA funds to help support \n     the development of State or district-wide systems for \n     coordinating education, health, mental health, and social \n     services.\n our fifth principle is to increase the focus on teaching and learning\n\n       Over the past 20 years, the IDEA has focused on process \n     without sufficient attention to educational results for \n     children with disabilities. Too often, the fundamental \n     purpose of the law is lost. To achieve the improvements we \n     are seeking, we must maximize the extent to which resources \n     are used for teaching and learning. The proposals I have \n     described above for improving IEPs, eligibility \n     determinations, and evaluations of children will help to \n     redirect considerable resources toward more instructionally \n     relevant activities that support higher achievement for \n     children with disabilities. We also propose to reduce \n     unnecessary paperwork for schools, while improving services \n     for students, by allowing schools to use their IDEA funds to \n     pay for special education services in the regular classroom \n     for the purpose of benefiting students with disabilities \n     without having to track whether nondisabled students also \n     benefit.\n       Requirements imposed on State and local educational \n     agencies also drain resources that could be better used to \n     improve teaching and learning. For example, current \n     application requirements direct States to document their \n     compliance with various procedures. To establish their \n     eligibility for funding, States routinely submit to the \n     Department boxes of documents containing copies of all State \n     policies and procedures for special education. Yet, States \n     are not required to plan for improving educational results. \n     To reduce unnecessary burden, our proposal would eliminate \n     State plans. States would merely be required to update \n     documentation kept on file at the Department. Similarly, we \n     would give States the discretion to eliminate applications \n     from LEAs as long as appropriate documentation is on file.\n       A new State improvement authority would recognize the key \n     role that the States play in implementing the law and enhance \n     the ability of State agencies to carry out their own plans \n     for program improvement by providing flexible resources based \n     on an IDEA State Improvement Plan. Recognizing that the \n     essential element of school improvement is well-prepared \n     teachers and administrators, the authority would focus \n     substantial attention and funding on teacher preparation. \n     This authority would distribute funds to States on a formula \n     basis and would be an impetus for improving the entire IDEA \n     program by giving States additional resources to undertake \n     the strategies they have identified for meeting their \n     performance goals for children with disabilities. To assist \n     States in these efforts, States would also be given \n     flexibility to consolidate funds available for administration \n     of Part B programs.\n       Maintaining a safe and orderly environment is essential for \n     learning. Our proposal addresses the issue of school \n     discipline related to students with disabilities. We believe \n     the changes we are proposing to improve the educational \n     opportunities of students with disabilities and to promote \n     effective practices will help curb potential discipline \n     problems. However, prevention is not always sufficient, and \n     there are times when schools must take steps to address \n     misconduct. Our proposal would extend the Improving America's \n     Schools Act amendment to IDEA, which permits schools to \n     immediately remove a child from the classroom for up to 45 \n     days for bringing a gun to school, to cover other dangerous \n     weapons such as knives. We are also proposing that schools be \n     permitted to go to hearing officers to obtain quick decisions \n     about whether a child is dangerous and may be removed from \n     the classroom. Hearing officers already exist in every State \n     to address special education issues. This provision would \n     help schools to expedite decisions related to dangerous \n     conduct that does not involve weapons.\n       Our sixth principle is to strengthen early intervention to \n     help ensure that every child starts school ready to learn.\n       Support for families also means working with them to \n     address the early intervention needs of their infants and \n     toddlers. While States and communities have made tremendous \n     progress in implementing their early intervention systems for \n     children from birth through age two under Part H of the IDEA, \n     there remain two major challenges: ensuring that all eligible \n     infants and toddlers receive services, and supporting the \n     prevention of developmental delays by expanding the inclusion \n     of at-risk infants and toddlers within the Part H \n     comprehensive system of services. To address these \n     challenges, our proposal would give States greater \n     flexibility in their efforts to serve infants and toddlers at \n     risk of developmental delay. We also propose to draw on the \n     best expertise in the nation to evaluate the need for and \n     develop an appropriate definition of developmental delay in \n     infants and toddlers in order to help States ensure that all \n     children in need are identified and served.\n       I urge Congress to act favorably and quickly on these \n     proposals. Their enactment will help local communities in \n     their efforts to create safe, disciplined schools that have \n     high expectations for all their students, and well prepared \n     teachers, and will strengthen the involvement of families in \n     their children's education. I look forward to working with \n     you as we all strive to improve the IDEA in order to improve \n     results for children with disabilities.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the submission of this proposal to Congress \n     and that its adoption would be in accord with the program of \n     the President.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                 Richard W. Riley,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Harkin, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Disability \nPolicy of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, in introducing the \nClinton administration's bill reauthorizing the Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Act.\n  In its 20 years of existence, IDEA has greatly improved public \neducation for students with disabilities in the United States. It has \ngiven them the opportunity for a public education and the necessary \nservices to improve the quality of their lives and futures.\n  However, despite the significant advances made through IDEA over the \npast 20 years, we still have a long way to go. Educational outcomes for \nstudents with disabilities remain less than satisfactory. Enrollment in \npost-secondary education is low, and students with disabilities too \noften emerge from public education poorly prepared to find employment \nand live independently.\n  Moreover, children from minority backgrounds are often mislabeled and \nplaced in special education classrooms, subject to low expectations for \nachievement. In the majority of States, African-American students are \noverrepresented in special\n education programs, compared with their percentage of the overall \nstudent population. In fact, studies have shown that young African-\nAmerican males are often inappropriately placed in special education \nprograms, or placed in overly restrictive settings. Once there, they \ngenerally remain trapped there, often with very little opportunity to \nmove into regular classrooms, even when such transitions are obviously \nwarranted.\n\n  Currently, Federal and State funding contributes to this problem by \ncreating disincentives for appropriate placements and services. Some \nfunding systems base allocations on the number of disabled students \nthat each State educates. As a result, special education programs often \noperate in ways specifically designed to attract State and Federal \ndollars to local school districts--not to serve students best.\n  The administration's bill takes a significant step in addressing this \nproblem by changing the formula so that all new funding to States above \ntheir grants for the 1995 fiscal year is allocated on the basis of the \ntotal number of children in the States, rather than just the number of \nchildren with disabilities.\n  We have learned much over the past 20 years, and have gained an \nunderstanding about what does and does not work. We now have the \nopportunity to \n\n[[Page S10734]]\nmake significant improvements in the implementation and enforcement of \nthis important law. The Department of Education has worked diligently \nand carefully to develop legislation that makes substantial \nimprovements in areas that need revision, and to expand upon provisions \nthat have worked in the past.\n  Specifically, the legislation focuses on aligning IDEA with State and \nlocal education reforms, giving students with disabilities the same \nopportunity to benefit from those reform efforts as other students. The \nlegislation focuses on ensuring that each child receives an \nindividualized education that addresses the child's particular needs in \nthe least restrictive environment possible. It increases the focus on \nteaching and learning, and works to strengthen early intervention to \nhelp ensure that every child starts school ready to learn. It promotes \ntraining and education for parents and teachers to help them serve \ntheir students better.\n  The bill also promotes involvement by families of every economic \nlevel. Family involvement is a critical component of success in \neducation, and should be at the heart of education reform. Parents in \nall communities must be able to take a more active role in \ndecisionmaking concerning the education and placement of their \nchildren. The administration's bill takes effective steps to make this \npossible, and contains provisions to ensure that families, teachers and \nschool administrators have the knowledge and training they need to work \neffectively with students and with each other. It also provides \nmechanisms to encourage mediation as an available option for parents \nseeking to resolve disputes.\n  One of the most significant reforms of public education is to reduce \ncategorizing and labeling, and to focus instead on raising expectations \nand increasing access to the general curriculum for all students.\n  All children have the right and deserve the opportunity to receive \nthe proper education for their individual needs, whether or not they \nhave a disability. Each parent has a right to be involved in that \nprocess.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this vital legislation, and I commend \nSecretary Richard Riley and his staff for their efforts to make the act \nmore effective for all children with disabilities. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on the committee to reauthorize and improve \nIDEA and to achieve its great goals.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 1076. A bill to designate the Western Program Service Center of \nthe Social Security Administration located at 1221 Nevin Avenue, \nRichmond, California, as the ``Francis J. Hagel Building,'' and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               The Francis J. Hagel Building Act of 1995\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am honored to rise today to \nintroduce this legislation to honor a true hero among civil servants--\nFrank Hagel--a Federal employee who rose through the ranks to become a \ntop manager and whose leadership was sorely tested during a crisis at \nthe center a few years ago.\n  His death at an early age last January was mourned throughout the San \nFrancisco Bay area.\n  Frank Hagel was the seventh director of the Social Security Western \nProgram Service Center in Richmond, CA. Built in 1975, the center \nstands in the heart of Richmond, and has had as many as 2,000 \nemployees, but now down to 1,200 largely because of automation. In \naddition to updating the benefit payment rolls, center employees answer \nthe Social Security Administration's national toll-free number during \npeak times.\n  Hagel, a native of Missouri, began his Federal career as a file clerk \nin 1965 at what was then called the Kansas City Payment Center. His \nhard work and talent enabled him to work his way up through technical \nand managerial positions in the organization. His special abilities \nwere recognized at the highest levels in SSA. He was called upon \nfrequently to lead management review teams, to serve on strategic \nplanning task forces, and to lead national work groups on critical \norganizational issues. For his effort, he was recognized with the \nagency's highest honor award, the Commissioner's Citation.\n  In March 1986, he moved to California from Missouri to undertake the \nchallenge of providing Federal oversight and liaison to the State of \nCalifornia's disability determination process. He helped the State \nachieve consistency in timeliness and accuracy.\n  His continued success led to his promotion in December 1990, when he\n   became Assistant Regional Commissioner, processing center \noperations. This was a crowning achievement for a man who had started \n25 years earlier as a file clerk. Before the year was out, Hagel's \nskills and abilities would be tested again.\n\n  The Western Program Service Center suffered an outbreak of \nLegionnaire's disease in September 1991. This outbreak included two \ndeaths and serious illness to a dozen more employees from the disease. \nFear and panic were rampant but Hagel led his employees through this \nterrifying period. His first steps were to reassure employees by \nproviding information, health screening, and blood tests to all who \nwanted it. Hagel then began to put the center back in operation. \nBecause the building had to be closed, the entire 1,200-person work \nforce had to be relocated, and within 2 weeks the operation serving \nSocial Security beneficiaries was back on its feet.\n  Hagel's calm and steady hand at the head of the center during this \ncrisis earned him a second Commissioner's Citation in 1992.\n  In 1994, Hagel became Assistant Regional Commissioner, management and \nbudget, region IX. In this position, he had a broader set of \nresponsibilities to provide support to the entire regional operation, \nincluding 180 field facilities. Again, his leadership and his example \nproved invaluable to the region.\n  Hagel died on January 1, 1995, leaving a reputation for his \nwillingness to listen closely to everyone, unerring respect for each \nand every individual, broad lines of communication from labor to the \nbusiness community and most important, an intense caring for the \nAmerican people for whom he served.\n  That caring carried into his personal life. He counseled at-risk \nyouth at the high school level and encouraged other adults to \nparticipate.\n  Mr. President, hundreds of Social Security employees have petitioned \nme--from mail clerks to top managers--asking that we honor Frank Hagel \nby naming the building in which they work after their late leader. I am \nhonored to present legislation carrying out their wishes.\n  I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a copy of the bill \nand a resolution from the city of Richmond, CA, in support of this \nnaming bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1076\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize research, development, and demonstration \nof hydrogen as an energy carrier, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                    THE HYDROGEN FUTURE ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senators Akaka, Kyl, \nInouye, Bingaman, and Reid, I am introducing today a very important \npiece of bipartisan legislation, the Hydrogen Future Act of 1995. I \nwant to especially commend my colleague from Hawaii, Senator Akaka, for \nhis leadership in this area and for the good work he has done in \nputting together this bill. He continues a great tradition begun by the \nlate Spark Matsunaga as a national leader in the field of hydrogen \nenergy research and development.\n  Hydrogen is plentiful, efficient, and clean burning source of energy. \nIt is ideal in that it combusts to pure water, and leaves no \npollutants--no ozone depleting chemicals, no acid rain, no radioactive \nwaste. All you get is pure, clean when you burn hydrogen.\n  Hydrogen also efficiently powers fuel cells, the latest breakthrough \nin power. Unlike electricity, which it complements, hydrogen can be \nstored and it can be piped long distances with no energy loss. And \nhydrogen energy is not simply a pipe dream. It is already on the road, \npowering some buses in Vancouver. But much more work needs to be done \nto bring hydrogen energy to the point where it can be used on a \nwidescale basis.\n  With a modest investment in research and development, we can save \nbillions through improved efficiencies and better protect our fragile \nenvironment. If we don't act now to develop this alternative energy \nsource, our global competitors will clearly have an advantage. They are \nalready investing more than we are in developing hydrogen. For example, \nas of several years ago, Germany was spending about $50 million a year \non renewable hydrogen, five times our meager investment.\n  Our bill says that the United States is committed to hydrogen. We \nrecognize its great potential. And we are willing to make a very modest \nand cost effective investment to back up that commitment. As does the \nbill passed by the House, our legislation authorizes $25 million in \nfiscal year 1996, $35 million in fiscal year 1997, and $40 million in \nfiscal year 1998 for research on hydrogen energy. This bill is clearly \nnot everything I would want. It is a good faith attempt at a bipartisan \ncompromise to move us forward.\n  As you may know, the House has already passed H.R. 655, the companion \nto our bill. H.R. 655 was sponsored by Representative Bob Walker, chair \nof the House Science and Technology Committee, and it was passed by \nvoice vote on May 2, 1995. Representative Walker has been a real leader \nin this area and has done it not for political reasons, but out of a \ntrue commitment to science and a careful study of the great potential \nof hydrogen. So the Hydrogen Future Act has broad bipartisan support in \nCongress and I am hopeful that the Senate will follow the House in \nquickly and decisively passing this bill.\n  It is up to us to provide vision to the energy policy of this country \nby authorizing funds for hydrogen research. Then it is up to our \nscientists to provide focus to the hydrogen program, through the \nHydrogen Technical Advisory Panel, which our bill continues, and \nthrough peer reviewed research, which our bill emphasizes.\n  During the first energy crisis back in the seventies, I served on the \nHouse Science and Technology Committee shaping programs for renewable \nenergy and alternative energy production during the Carter \nadministration.\n  And we held dozens of hearings regarding energy and particularly the \nrole of technology in providing new sources of energy.\n  If one thing emerged from my 10 years on that committee, it was the \nunderstanding--the realization--that hydrogen is truly our best hope \nfor an environmentally safe sustainable energy future.\n  I carried that understanding with me to the Senate where I learned \neven more from giants like Spark Matsunaga. And I am proud to have \nsponsored the Renewable Hydrogen Energy Research and Development Act \nwhich built on Senator Matsunaga's work and is reflected in the \nlegislation we are introducing today.\n  I know hydrogen can be the answer to many of the energy and \nenvironmental challenges we face today. It can lead us down the road to \na better future. But it is up to us to pave that road. It is up to us \nto build it. We should fund hydrogen research until every American \nknows what the promise of hydrogen is, through his or her use of \nhydrogen in everyday life.\n  And I know we have begun. When I first became interested in solar \nhydrogen several years ago, the DOE program consisted of three or four \nbasic university research programs, exploring alternative methods to \nproduce hydrogen. The program has grown--much more slowly than I would \nhave liked--but it has grown.\n  In addition to the basic research into alternative hydrogen \nproduction techniques, DOE now funds programs in advanced hydrogen \nstorage, systems analysis, as well as the fuel cell for transportation \nprogram that has grown a lot faster than the hydrogen program itself.\n  Do we want a set of fuel cell automobile fleets and hydrogen \ndispensing stations? Or do we want a dozen photovolatic and wind \nhydrogen generating stations? Do we want to set a long-term goal of \nsupplying 1 or 5 or 10 quads of energy by 2105 from renewable hydrogen?\n  I would vote for all of the above.\n  But even if Congressman Walker, Senator Akaka, Senator Kyl, I and the \nother supporters of this legislation succeed in doubling or tripling \nwhat I consider to be a totally inadequate hydrogen budget, we could \nnot meet all of these goals.\n  So we have to be selective. We have to make choices. This bill does \nthat. We have compromised on the level of funding authorized and the \nactivities to be undertaken.\n  As I have indicated to you, there are many promising avenues of \nresearch for hydrogen. But I want to give one specific example so you \ncan understand the potential of hydrogen. Well, let me tell you about a \nmajor hydrogen project that I think is quite important for America. \nIt's called electro-farming.\n  As Joan Ogden of Princeton and other scientists have shown, hydrogen \nfrom biomass is probably the least costly source of renewable hydrogen \nwe have today. DOE does have a biomass energy program, and it has grown \nvery rapidly over the last few years. But the DOE biomass program is \nfocussed on either methanol production or direct electricity production \nvia steam generators--or on biomass gasification to drive gas turbines.\n  But, as far as I know, there is no program to maximize the hydrogen \nproduction in a biomass gasifier for use in a fuel cell. Electro-\nfarming would take advantage of one of our Nation's greatest \nunderutilized assets: the American agriculture production system.\n  What would that mean on the ground in a State like Iowa? Well right \nnow, the Federal Government pays farmers not to grow crops on 34 \nmillion acres of erodible land--the Conservation Reserve Program or \nCRP.\n  Just a couple of years ago, the Iowa legislature passed legislation \nmandating utilities to buy renewable electricity at 6 cents per \nkilowatt/hour. Well, I worked out a proposal which I presented to the \nHydrogen Technical Advisory Panel last year using present day input \ncosts What we found was that if farmers grew an energy crop like \nswitchgrass, the Government could save on CRP payments and the farmer \ncould earn a profit for growing biomass for energy.\n  In fact, based on preliminary numbers we found that an Iowa corn \nfarmer could earn 3-10 times more per acre growing switchgrass on an \nelectro-farm than growing corn on a conventional farm. The fact is \nelectro-farming is a win-win-win proposal. The Federal Government \nwins--cutting conservation reserve program payments, improving our \nenvironment, and reducing \n\n[[Page S10736]]\ndependence on foreign oil. The farmer wins--diversifying his earning \nbase, improving his income, and possibly even becoming energy \nindependent. And utilities win--adding capacity relative to demand and \nreducing transmission costs.\n  I think the electro-farm could form one foundation for what I believe \nto be a good midterm goal for the hydrogen program: sustainable energy \ncenters.\n  As I suggested to the hydrogen scientists last year, the Department \nof Energy should initiate one or more sustainable energy centers to \ndemonstrate the production, storage, and use of hydrogen as an energy \ncarrier.\n  The main purpose of these centers would be to prove to the public and \nthe business community\n the technical and economic potential of renewable hydrogen. This would \nshow to everybody that hydrogen can provide a zero emission fuel for \nthe future in a cost effective manner.\n\n  But unfortunately most people don't know about hydrogen. For most \ncitizens, hydrogen reminds them of the hydrogen bomb or, if you're \nolder, the Hindenburg. If we are to create a sustainable energy option \nfor the future based on renewable hydrogen, we have to educate people \non the merits of hydrogen. So the main purpose of the sustainable \nenergy centers would be to show people how hydrogen can be used safely \nand effectively to heat their homes, power their cars, and drive their \nfactories.\n  The sustainable energy centers would also serve as a training center \nfor hydrogen scientists and technicians. It would permit the testing of \nnew hydrogen components, and it would permit the integration of various \nproduction, storage, and utilization devices into a complete working \nenergy system. In addition, it would permit the evaluation of many \ncosts, to reassure private industry and interest them in developing \nhydrogen products on a commercially viable basis.\n  I believe that sustainable energy centers will take hydrogen the next \nstep--moving it from a university-based R program to a publicly \naccepted energy carrier to complement electricity.\n  And substantially increasing the hydrogen budget is critical to move \nhydrogen from a basic R program to a major sustainable energy option \nfor the 21st century.\n  In short, we all know what the vision is: hydrogen produced by \nrenewable energy with absolutely no pollution of any type, and no \nresource depletion of any kind--a truly sustainable energy option.\n  Now we need to put flesh and bones on that vision.\n  We need to make it real so people can feel the heat from a hydrogen \nfurnace, or drive a hydrogen powered car and see that there are no \nemissions from the tailpipe--or, in the case of a hydrogen fuel cell \ncar, see that there is no tailpipe at all.\n  By passing and implementing this legislation, we can pass on to our \nchildren and grandchildren a better future, a brighter future--without \nthe pollution, without the smog, and without the resource depletion \nthat is a fact of life today, but that can be a relic of the past \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1077\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, it is difficult to believe that the solution \nto U.S. air pollution and dependence on foreign oil could be solved by \nthe most abundant element in the universe--hydrogen. Yet we know that \nhydrogen can fuel our cars and cool our homes while producing water as \nits only byproduct.\n  We know that this is possible through research conducted by the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy. Unfortunately, we do not yet know how to extract \nhydrogen from water in large enough quantities or at a low enough cost \nto make it a viable fuel alternative in the United States.\n  While the Department of Energy has researched hydrogen as an \nalternative fuel for the last 5 years, the Governments of Japan, \nGermany, and Canada, where hydrogen-powered buses already run in \nVancouver, have out-spent and out-researched us. The United States is \nalready purchasing hydrogen fuel cells from Canada because they are not \nproduced here.\n  By implementing the Hydrogen Future Act and increasing our funding \nfor hydrogen research, we will remain competitive with other countries \nand will increase the likelihood that we will develop a nonpolluting \nalternative fuel which will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and \nenergy products.\n  This bill would make hydrogen research a priority without increasing \nspending for research and development within the Department of Energy. \nIt would also require non-Federal sources to pay for at least 25 \npercent of the research program costs and 50 percent of the costs \ndirectly related to any research development or demonstration project.\n  As I said before, we already know hydrogen can act as a power \ncarrier. We already know our major international competitors are \nseriously researching its possibilities. We need to know how to produce \nit in larger quantities and at a reasonable cost, and that is why the \nSenate needs to pass the Hydrogen Future Act.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I join my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Harkin, in introducing legislation to encourage the development \nof a fuel for the future--hydrogen.\n  Hydrogen is an efficient and environmentally friendly energy carrier \nthat can be obtained using conventional or renewable resources. There \nis growing evidence that hydrogen can be a solution for America's long-\nterm energy needs.\n  Our Nation's economy is heavily dependent on fossil fuels. Eighty-\nnine percent of our primary energy base consists of oil, natural gas, \nand coal. These fossil fuels are nonrenewable and eventually will be \nexhausted.\n  U.S. energy consumption has risen steadily for more than a decade and \nwill continue to rise over the next 20 years. From 1983 to 1992, our \nNation's consumption of energy from primary sources rose 17 percent. \nRecent projections by the Energy Information Administration suggest \nthat the United States' consumption of oil, natural gas, and coal will \nincrease by more than 1.0 percent each year through the year 2010.\n  I want to point out that last year, for the first time ever, more \nthan half of the oil used in our country came from foreign sources. \nSteadily rising demand for these finite energy resources dictates the \nneed for research on alternatives such as hydrogen.\n  Now is the time to increase research efforts to develop a new source \nof energy if we are to make a smooth transition to the next generation \nenergy source. Growing evidence points to hydrogen as the fuel to \nresolve our energy problems and satisfy a wide variety of the world's \nenergy needs.\n  One advantage of hydrogen is that it can be produced from renewable \nresources through biomass conversion. Biomass conversion uses crops and \nforest product residues to produce hydrogen. Ultimately, the direct \ngeneration of hydrogen from water will provide us with a continuous \nsupply of the fuel.\n  Hydrogen as a fuel is not a new concept, but technical progress \ntowards this goal has been slow. For more than two decades there has \nbeen continuing worldwide interest in hydrogen as a renewable fuel.\n  The Library of Congress reported in ``Hydrogen: Technology and \nPolicy'' that large quantities of hydrogen are being produced each year \nfor nonenergy uses, however, it would be difficult or impossible to \nmeet future energy demands with today's hydrogen technology.\n  Some of the problems facing the development of hydrogen as a fuel are \nthe high cost of production, storage, and distribution. More economical \nmethods of producing hydrogen are urgently needed. Currently, the cost \nof producing pure hydrogen from water by electrolysis is prohibitive, \nunless cheap electricity is available.\n  The vast majority of the hydrogen produced today is transported only \na short distance before use. An integrated production, storage, and \ndistribution system will also be required. These are only a few of the \nbarriers to making hydrogen fuel commercially viable.\n  Our Nation needs an active and systematic research, development, and \ndemonstration program to make the breakthroughs necessary so that \nhydrogen can become a viable alternative to fossil fuels. ``The Green \nHydrogen Report'' to be published by the Secretary of Energy's Hydrogen \nTechnical Advisory Panel this summer will detail a research agenda for \nthe fuel.\n  My predecessor, Senator Spark Matsunaga, was one of the first to \nfocus attention on hydrogen by sponsoring hydrogen research \nlegislation. The Matsunaga Hydrogen Act, as this legislation came to be \nknown, was designed to accelerate development of a domestic capability \nto produce economically renewable hydrogen in sufficient quantities to \nreduce the Nation's dependence upon conventional fuels. As a result of \nSpark Matsunaga's vision, the Department of Energy is conducting \nresearch that will decrease the costs of producing, storing, and using \nhydrogen. But Congress's continued support for this program is needed.\n  The bill introduced today expands the current research program \nefforts under the Matsunaga Hydrogen Act. This new initiative \nacknowledges the \n\n[[Page S10738]]\npotential of hydrogen; the need for a strong partnership between the \nFederal Government, industry, and academia; and the importance of \ncontinued support for hydrogen research. It fosters collaboration among \nFederal agencies, State and local governments, universities, and \nindustry.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Comprehensive Iran Sanctions \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Iran's Violations of Human Rights.--The Congress makes \n     the following findings with respect to Iran's violations of \n     human rights:\n       (1) As cited by the 1991 United Nations Special \n     Representative on Human Rights, Amnesty International, and \n     the United States Department of State, the Government of Iran \n     has conducted assassinations outside of Iran, such as that of \n     former Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar for which the \n     Government of France issued arrest warrants for several \n     Iranian governmental officials.\n       (2) As cited by the 1991 United Nations Special \n     Representative on Human Rights and by Amnesty International, \n     the Government of Iran has conducted revolutionary trials \n     which do not meet internationally recognized standards of \n     fairness or justice. These trials have included such \n     violations as a lack of procedural safeguards, trial times of \n     5 minutes or less, limited access to defense counsel, forced \n     confessions, and summary executions.\n       (3) As cited by the 1991 United Nations Special \n     Representative on Human Rights, the Government of Iran \n     systematically represses its Baha'i population. Persecutions \n     of this small religious community include assassinations, \n     arbitrary arrests, electoral prohibitions, and denial of \n     applications for documents such as passports.\n       (4) As cited by the 1991 United Nations Special \n     Representative on Human Rights, the Government of Iran \n     suppresses opposition to its government. Political \n     organizations such as the Freedom Movement are banned from \n     parliamentary elections, have their telephones tapped and \n     their mail opened, and are systematically harassed and \n     intimidated.\n       (5) As cited by the 1991 United Nations Special \n     Representative on Human Rights and Amnesty International, the \n     Government of Iran has failed to recognize the importance of \n     international human rights. This includes suppression of \n     Iranian human rights movements such as the Freedom Movement, \n     lack of cooperation with international human rights \n     organizations such as the International Red Cross, and an \n     overall apathy toward human rights in general. This lack of \n     concern prompted the Special Representative to state in his \n     report that Iran had made ``no appreciable progress towards \n     improved compliance with human rights in accordance with the \n     current international instruments''.\n       (6) As cited by Amnesty International, the Government of \n     Iran continues to torture its political prisoners. Torture \n     methods include burns, arbitrary blows, severe beatings, and \n     positions inducing pain.\n       (b) Iran's Acts of International Terrorism.--The Congress \n     makes the following findings, based on the\n      records of the Department of State, with respect to Iran's \n     acts of international terrorism:\n       (1) As cited by the Department of State, the Government of \n     Iran was the greatest supporter of state terrorism in 1992, \n     supporting over 20 terrorist acts, including the bombing of \n     the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires that killed 29 people.\n       (2) As cited by the Department of State, the Government of \n     Iran is a sponsor of radical religious groups that have used \n     terrorism as a tool. These include such groups as Hezballah, \n     HAMAS, the Turkish Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Front for \n     the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC).\n       (3) As cited by the Department of State, the Government of \n     Iran has resorted to international terrorism as a means of \n     obtaining political gain.

Mr. President, it is a privilege for me to bring \nto the attention of Members of Congress and the country the address \nmade last month by our friend and colleague, Senator Kennedy, to the \nInternational Symposium on Intellectual Disability held at the United \nNations in New York City. Once again, Senator Kennedy has made a \nvaluable contribution to international cooperation and progress on the \nwide range of issues relating to mental retardation. His words give us \nhope and move us forward.\n  Senator Kennedy has served the people of Massachusetts and the United \nStates for more than 30 years in the Senate. During this time, he has \nbeen a champion of social justice for all Americans and for citizens of \nmany other lands, especially for people with disabilities. He is \ncommitted to the fundamental principle that all individuals deserve \nsupport in achieving their true potential and living with dignity. \nSenator Kennedy does not just talk about these issues--he acts. And \nwhen others are tired and demoralized, he perseveres. He is a \ncourageous advocate and an effective leader, and I commend him for the \nimpressive difference he has made on these vital issues.\n  I hope that Members of Congress and many others will take the time to \nread Senator Kennedy's address about the remarkable progress that is \nbeing made in the world community to improve the lives of people with \nmental retardation, and the even more remarkable progress that is \nlikely to be achieved in the years ahead if all of us persevere. We \nhave made great strides in recent years, but there is still much more \nto be done. Senator Kennedy's address helps to light the way, and I ask \nthat the full text of his address may be printed at this point in the \nRecord.\n  The text follows:\n\nAddress of Senator Edward M. Kennedy: ``From Disability to Capability''\n\n       It is an honor and privilege to be invited here today to \n     speak at this hallowed place that holds the hope of the world \n     for peace, and to participate in this auspicious \n     international symposium on an issue that has been a central \n     focus of my life and my family's life.\n       For almost as long as I can remember, my family has had a \n     commitment to people with mental retardation and all people \n     with disabilities. So, I am especially inspired by the many \n     leaders from many nations who have come together here to pool \n     their knowledge and strengthen their dedication to this great \n     cause we share. And I welcome the contribution that this \n     Symposium will make to helping people with mental retardation \n     throughout the world.\n       I thank a great friend and great statesman, Lowell Weicker, \n     for his generous introduction. I never know whether to call \n     him Senator or Governor.\n       In his Senate years, he was a brilliant colleague in the \n     trenches and on the mountaintops for our cause, and a \n     stalwart champion of equal opportunity and civil rights for \n     all citizens, especially people with disabilities. As a \n     Senator, as the Governor of Connecticut, and most of all as a \n     loving parent, he has been a powerful and compassionate \n     leader on issues of mental retardation. I commend him for his \n     years of tireless achievement, including his remarkable \n     leadership \n\n[[Page S10743]]\n     this year in chairing the 1995 Special Olympics World Games.\n       I also thank the several sponsors of the Symposium for \n     making this dream of international cooperation a reality--the \n     National Institute of Child Health and Human Development at \n     the National Institutes of Health, the Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. \n     Foundation, the 1995 Special Olympics World Games, and most \n     of all, the United Nations and its Secretary General, Boutros \n     Boutros-Ghali. These organizations and the leaders associated \n     with them have made extraordinary contributions to the field \n     of mental retardation and have helped improve the lives of \n     millions of individuals and families in many different lands.\n       I would like to talk for just a moment about one of those \n     organizations which is particularly close to me. My sister \n     Eunice and her husband Sargent Shriver have guided the \n     Special Olympics since its founding in 1968, when they began \n     these very special games in their own backyard for the \n     benefit of 10 children with mental retardation.\n       From that modest start, a worldwide enterprise has grown. \n     The 1995 Special Olympics World Games that began this week in \n     New Haven has drawn 7,200 athletes and 2,500 coaches from 140 \n     countries. In the United States, 400,000 children and young \n     adults with mental retardation, 100,000 volunteers, and half \n     a million spectators participated in the various local and \n     state games that were held this year leading up to the \n     current world games.\n       The Special Olympics stand as a vivid example of the \n     achievements that are possible when we focus not on \n     disability, but on capability. As the games have \n     demonstrated, people with mental retardation can reach their \n     potential, if only they have the chance and the appropriate \n     encouragement and support.\n       The remarkable growth of the Special Olympics is a tribute \n     to the vision and dedication of two very special people and \n     the love they have for those with mental retardation \n     everywhere. Eunice and Sarge, we thank you.\n       For centuries, the institutions of our societies--\n     governments, schools, places of worship, professional \n     organizations, social gathering places, and the world of \n     commerce--all these institutions shut their doors to people \n     with mental retardation. Most of society felt that non-\n     disabled people had little to learn from people with \n     disabilities, and vice versa.\n       Even when the closed doors finally began to open, people \n     with mental retardation were often seen as objects of pity. \n     The new approach of so-called ``enlightened'' society was to \n     protect people with retardation from themselves, protect them \n     from society, protect them from even the most ordinary \n     challenges of daily living. As we know now, that approach may \n     have been somewhat less unenlightened than before, but no one \n     should have called it enlightened.\n       Just 30 years ago, over half of the 250,000 public school \n     districts in the United States denied a place for children \n     with severe mental retardation. State-operated institutions, \n     with over 200,000 residents, were the primary housing \n     option--but it was warehousing, not housing.\n       Concepts such as employment and self-sufficiency were \n     called ``revolutionary.'' The few laws then in effect to \n     protect citizens with mental retardation, while well-meaning, \n     also ``protected'' them from having a job, from living at \n     home, from choosing their friends, and from sharing in the \n     opportunities and challenges of life.\n       We created systems of separate living, separate \n     transportation, separate communication, separate recreation, \n     and separate education--separate and out of sight. Rarely was \n     it even dreamed that less protection and more assistance \n     could enable people with mental retardation to become valued \n     members of society.\n       Beginning with President Kennedy's New Frontier in the \n     United States, a peaceful revolution toward independent \n     living and community-based support was launched and continues \n     to this day. Gradually, we moved away from the paternalism \n     and protectionism that characterized public attitudes and \n     government policies toward people with mental retardation. \n     Old approaches such as institutionalization came to be seen \n     as out-dated policies that fail to adequately recognize the \n     true value of human potential. People with mental retardation \n     began to be thought of for what they are--real people with \n     real talents capable of meeting and mastering real \n     challenges.\n       As a result of this peaceful revolution, more and more \n     citizens with mental retardation moved out of the back wards \n     of institutions and into group homes and supported living. \n     They moved from sheltered workshops to supported employment. \n     They moved from being treated as perpetual children to \n     becoming citizens who vote. They moved from classrooms in the \n     basement to full inclusion in regular schools. They moved \n     from tax dependency to tax payers. Through participation in \n     education, employment, and may other aspects of community \n     life, people with mental retardation moved into the \n     mainstream--and we are all benefiting.\n       Empowerment is one of those words in common use today that \n     means different things to different people. When we talk of \n     empowerment for our fellow citizens with disabilities, \n     including mental retardation, we mean movement toward \n     independence, productivity, and integration. Independence \n     means a level of control and choice over their life. \n     Productivity means active participation in the workforce and \n     genuine contribution to a family or community. Integration \n     means developing real relationships with members of the \n     community, utilizing the same community resources available \n     to everyone else, and living in homes located in the \n     community.\n       That sense of empowerment has been the theoretical goal of \n     the world community since the passage of the U.N. Declaration \n     on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons in 1971. That high \n     purpose was re-stated in the Standard Rules on the \n     Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities \n     adopted by the United Nations in 1993. It is time--time now--\n     to issue a new call to action, so that in re-affirming that \n     goal and these vital principles, we also re-commit ourselves \n     to moving faster from theory to practice.\n       This International Symposium is an essential and rare \n     opportunity not only to share what we know, but also to shape \n     what we do. It is a unique chance for nations, non-\n     governmental organizations and public and private leaders \n     throughout the world to come together to discuss the ways and \n     means of imbuing families, schools, workplaces, communities, \n     and whole nations with the energies and talents of people \n     with mental retardation.\n       This Symposium is a forum to enable government officials, \n     policy makers, and advocates to compare recent successes, to \n     discuss the role of government and every other institution of \n     society in the empowerment of people with mental retardation, \n     and to develop sensible plans for moving forward.\n       By committing ourselves to action, by sharing state-of-the-\n     art knowledge about which laws are effective and which \n     program models can be implemented across national borders or \n     even worldwide, we can bring renewed spirit and deeper \n     understanding to the drive for progress in our own countries.\n       It is my hope that this Symposium will strive to make \n     empowerment not just a slogan but a reality in the daily \n     lives of people with mental retardation everywhere. Planning \n     takes vision, and action takes courage--may we have both as \n     we participate in this Symposium.\n       The kind of real social progress we seek is inspired, \n     initiated, and implemented by three sources: governments, the \n     advocacy community, and individuals. Each of these sources is \n     essential, and their efforts are often linked. The successes \n     of one are made possible by the support and actions of the \n     others.\n       In some societies, government leads the way and community-\n     based organizations and individuals work to implement the \n     policies it enacts. In other societies, the people lead, and \n     the government struggles to catch up. In all cases, as real \n     partnership emerges, real progress occurs.\n       The important point is that governments at all levels, \n     organizations of all kinds, and individuals of all abilities \n     must be actively engaged in bringing about the changes \n     necessary to empower people with mental retardation. As an \n     African proverb holds, ``It takes a village to raise a \n     child.'' A village can be a small town, a large city, a \n     nation, or the entire world. It takes a community to make the \n     promise of empowerment a reality in the daily lives of people \n     with disabilities.\n                         the role of government\n\n       I would like to talk now especially about the role of \n     governments, not because it is the most important, but \n     because it is the most familiar to me. As President Kennedy \n     said of government on America's Independence Day, 33 years \n     ago:\n       ``The greatest works of our nation's founders lay not in \n     the documents and declarations, but in creative, determined \n     action. Others may confine themselves to debate, discussion \n     and that ultimate luxury, free advice. Our responsibility is \n     one of decision, for to govern is to choose.''\n       Government has two basic functions to perform in meeting \n     the needs of people with mental retardation. First, it must \n     protect fundamental rights and freedoms. This means assuring \n     people with mental retardation the right to participate in \n     all aspects of life, free from injustice and invidious \n     discrimination. Ensuring these fundamental rights of \n     citizenship is the unique function of government.\n       The second basic role of government is the development and \n     support of programs and services to enable people with mental \n     retardation to become more productive and fulfilled citizens, \n     especially when other avenues fail.\n       No society can afford to waste the energy and talent of any \n     of its citizens, whether the waste results from irrational \n     fear, ignorance, or a misguided sense of paternalism.\n       The United States and many other countries have passed \n     specific laws in recent decades to advance that goal. Our \n     country passed a landmark Civil Rights Act in 1964, to assure \n     the rights of African Americans and other minorities to \n     participate equally in all aspects of American life. This \n     law, and the rights it guaranteed, were not easily enacted. \n     But they have stood the test of time and have made the United \n     States a stronger and better nation. In a similar way, South \n     Africa is currently building a multi-ethnic state by tearing \n     down the walls of apartheid.\n       In 1973, the United States passed a further law to prohibit \n     discrimination against people with disabilities in any \n     activity that receives federal financial assistance. Other \n     U.S. laws were enacted to protect children with disabilities, \n     to protect the rights of the institutionalized, and to \n     protect the right of \n\n[[Page S10744]]\n     people with disabilities to fair treatment in housing. But despite \n     these advances, many people with disabilities remained \n     unprotected from unjust treatment in the workplace, in public \n     accommodations, in transportation, and in many state and \n     local activities and services.\n       In 1990, all of that changed with the enactment of the \n     Americans With Disabilities Act, which was truly an \n     emancipation proclamation for our 49 million citizens with \n     disabilities. Through its broad prohibitions on \n     discrimination, that law is already making it possible for \n     people with disabilities, including mental retardation, to \n     lead more fulfilling and productive lives. It is our first \n     nationwide law protecting the fundamental rights of all \n     people with disabilities in all aspects of life.\n       Its passage was intended to clearly and unequivocally \n     eliminate the major barriers to their full participation in \n     society, and it has become a catalyst for action in other \n     lands. Australia and New Zealand have already enacted similar \n     legislation. Great Britain and Israel are considering such \n     laws, and Germany, Sweden, Japan, Ireland and the Czech \n     Republic have come to the United States to gather information \n     for action. It\n      is just this kind of international cooperation we hoped \n     would occur, and is what motivated us to write to world \n     leaders to encourage them to build on this breakthrough.\n       In addition to guarantees of basic civil rights, access to \n     education is a hallmark of a free society. It also is one of \n     the most basic services that government can provide to \n     advance the integration and independence of people with \n     disabilities. In 1975, we in Congress passed legislation \n     called the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, now \n     known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, to \n     guarantee a free, appropriate public education to every child \n     with a disability. Children with mental retardation were the \n     principal beneficiaries of this law, because they constituted \n     the largest group of children with disabilities who had \n     previously been shut out of public schools.\n       In the United States, this law made it increasingly \n     possible for children with and without disabilities to \n     interact with one another and learn from one another on a \n     daily basis. Our work has only just begun. Even today, only \n     seven in every hundred students with mental retardation in \n     the United States spend their entire school day in classrooms \n     with other children from their neighborhoods. Eleven out of \n     every hundred have no access at all to their community \n     schools, and attend special schools instead. Nevertheless, \n     educating all children, regardless of disability, in the \n     least restrictive environment is now an accepted standard \n     throughout the United States.\n       Enabling children and young adults with mental retardation \n     to participate in regular, public education is not just a \n     priority in the United States. Italy was the first country to \n     work toward mainstreaming students with special needs. Over \n     the past decade, Alvaro Marchasi, the Minister of State for \n     Education in Spain, has led an effort to make all schools in \n     Spain accessible to all children, including those with \n     disabilities and mental retardation.\n       This effort inspired last year's UNESCO conference on \n     inclusive education, which provided a framework for \n     integrating children with special needs into education \n     systems worldwide.\n       These examples are not limited to large wealthy nations. \n     The small country of Lesotho has launched a pilot project to \n     integrate every child with a disability into regular schools \n     in all towns and villages.\n       I hope that we can agree here that every country has an \n     obligation to do all it can to educate all its children, \n     including those with mental retardation and other \n     disabilities, in a manner that enables them to learn and grow \n     from each other, regardless of ability or disability. It is \n     possible. It is practical. It is essential. And it is also \n     cost-effective.\n       Governments everywhere must take concerted action to ensure \n     access to education, employment, and housing opportunities, \n     and to provide the supportive services that enable people \n     with mental retardation to reach their full potential.\n       We know, for example, that assuring basic necessities can \n     reduce the incidence of mental retardation by 50 percent. We \n     know that fetal malnutrition causes brain damage. Yet \n     millions of pregnant women go hungry every day. How long will \n     the world community pay the price?\n       We know that immunization works. Yet vast numbers of \n     children around the world are at high risk for diseases that \n     cause mental retardation. How long will the world community \n     pay the price?\n       We know that environmental toxins--from industry, from \n     pesticides, from lead, from lack of sanitation--are all\n      creating birth defects and learning disabilities. How long \n     will the world community pay the price? Governments can \n     make the difference. Governments must act.\n\n\n          the role of organizations, families and individuals\n\n       But even if government action establishes the legal \n     foundation for such progress--for independence and \n     integration--government action alone will never be enough. \n     The passage of wise laws does not guarantee effective \n     implementation or vigorous enforcement. To achieve real and \n     lasting progress, myths must be fought and attitudes must be \n     changed. It is the role of committed, persistent and \n     unwavering advocacy organizations, families, and individuals \n     with and without disabilities to keep the pressure on, and \n     ensure that the words of the law become a reality in people's \n     lives.\n       With the worldwide revolution of community-based services \n     and community-based support for people with developmental \n     disabilities, communication between service organizations has \n     never been easier or more important. The same can be said for \n     organizations which represent researchers, families, and \n     people with mental retardation.\n       Non-governmental organizations are increasingly working \n     together to improve service, support and research. We must \n     continue to involve all of these organizations to develop \n     better worldwide strategies. The United Nations is the \n     logical place to come together, and I hope that our coming \n     together here and now will lead to more and better \n     collaboration in the future.\n       We know the valuable contribution made by professionals, \n     from biomedical researchers discovering new miracles of \n     science, to teachers developing new methods of educating and \n     training, to community leaders providing new generations of \n     services.\n       The International Association for the Scientific Study of \n     Mental Deficiency has brought together professionals from a \n     wide range of disciplines to examine the most promising \n     research to improve the lives of persons with mental \n     retardation and their families.\n       We know the brilliant achievement that the past generation \n     made possible through mass screening and an alternative diet \n     for those with PKU. It is one of the great stories of medical \n     history, and it was achieved through international research \n     and cooperation. Today, a simple three-cent test can prevent \n     PKU retardation at birth, and save hundreds of thousands of \n     dollars in later costs for care and treatment.\n       Through international cooperation, a research team has \n     demonstrated a simple and cost effective way to prevent \n     another well-known cause of mental retardation, spina bifida. \n     By discovering the protective role of folic acid in early \n     stages of pregnancy, a joint team from the United States and \n     Ireland worked together to bring this amazing research to \n     fruition.\n       In most of the world, parents of people with mental \n     retardation are the driving force for supporting such \n     research, creating beneficial programs, and moving government \n     policies ahead for the benefit of their affected sons and \n     daughters. Through Inclusion International, parent \n     organizations around the world have come together to learn \n     from one another, and learn how governments can provide the \n     services and supports they need. They have shared ideas and \n     information and made strong cases for basic rights and \n     effective services.\n       These efforts will lead to improved lives for people with \n     mental retardation--but only if we, as public policy makers, \n     hear what they are saying, and turn their ideas and \n     information into meaningful action and assistance. Too often, \n     we fail by default or inaction. Our challenge is to take \n     their powerful and persistent words and ideas and turn them \n     into a reality for those with mental retardation.\n       Among the newest type of organizations addressing \n     disability issues are the international self-advocacy \n     organizations. They have many different names, but they are \n     generally known as ``People First'' in much of the world, and \n     as ``Self-Advocates Becoming Empowered'' in the United \n     States.\n       Like so many others before them, persons with mental \n     retardation have begun to join together in these \n     organizations to speak out for their rights and needs. For \n     the first time, these formerly left-out citizens are taking \n     their place at the conference tables of organizations \n     planning their future. International bodies and national and \n     local governments need to listen and communicate with these \n     self-advocate organizations in ways which recognize their \n     need for direct, clear discussion and involvement in the \n     issues.\n       Today, as never before, people with mental retardation are \n     redefining and reshaping their own interests. Who better can \n     articulate what it feels like to be senselessly defined only \n     by a disability, and not as a total human being? Who better \n     can condemn the effects of misguided private attitudes and \n     public policies? Who better can demonstrate the remarkable \n     potential of programs that empower, rather than entrap?\n       Sweden is the country which has advanced the concept of \n     self-advocacy the most in recent years. It has over 1,200 \n     associations of people with disabilities, and approximately \n     400,000 members. The Swedish movement consists to a high \n     degree of organizations of, and not for, people with \n     disabilities. They are led to a large extent by people with \n     disabilities themselves. In the last few years they have come \n     to function as successful pressure groups in many \n     communities. Self-advocates have much to teach us about \n     effective legislation, policy and programs. We must do more \n     to listen and learn from them.\n       People with mental retardation should be included in all \n     decisions that affect them--no ifs, ands, or buts. The board \n     of every organization should have substantial representatives \n     of the people to be served. Every government commission, \n     whether advisory or executive, should include people who are \n     directly affected by policy decisions.\n       The work of these organizations has brought a surge of \n     progress throughout the world in the movement from isolation \n     and exclusion to integration and inclusion. In \n\n[[Page S10745]]\n     the Czech Republic, there is growing use of community residences for \n     people with mental retardation, and equally growing use of \n     supported employment. The supports which exist there to help \n     all workers in acquiring and keeping a job are now also being \n     used to help people with intellectual disabilities enter the \n     workforce. There are now more than eight community \n     residential programs in the greater Prague area, thanks to \n     the growing parent movement there.\n       In Poland, a pilot project in Lublin is testing a \n     decentralized system for supporting people with mental \n     retardation, relying on local government and individual \n     citizens to develop needed services and support.\n       As in so many other movements for social change, \n     individuals are often the most effective catalysts for \n     change. As Margaret Mead said, ``Never doubt that a small \n     group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; \n     indeed, it's the only thing that ever does.'' We all benefit \n     when everyone can\n      contribute to their communities. In this effort, we all have \n     a vital individual role to play.\n       We must work more closely with other institutions--\n     especially schools, places of worship, and neighborhood \n     associations--to welcome persons with disabilities as \n     partners, including people with mental retardation. They have \n     much to give. As we move from seeing them as objects of \n     charity to people with gifts and talents to share, we will \n     open our hearts and minds as well to the extraordinary \n     diversity they bring to our common humanity.\n       Over the past two decades, there has also been an \n     increasing trend toward the use of less specialized and less \n     technical people in the networks of support for people with \n     disabilities. The real strength of these less specialized \n     people lies not in their expertise, but in their ability to \n     relate to, communicate with, and motivate people with mental \n     retardation and other disabilities.\n       Kindergarten students can be ideal companions. Elderly \n     volunteers can be mentors and friends. Religious leaders, \n     social service providers, employers, co-workers, teachers, \n     neighbors, friends--all can find effective roles, if only \n     they have the will to try.\n       In the United States, a government-funded program supports \n     people with disabilities in finding jobs. The Vocational \n     Rehabilitation Act provides hands-on support directly on the \n     job. Usually, this support is provided by outside personnel, \n     but it can also be performed by a co-worker. The idea that a \n     worker in a factory or an office can provide the necessary \n     support for a person with a disability was once dismissed as \n     impossible. It reminds me of a familiar saying a century \n     ago--``It is as impossible as flying.''\n       But it is happening today. The true visionaries--the \n     parents and families of people with disabilities--knew that \n     it was possible. The result is that tens of thousands of \n     people with disabilities are now gainfully employed, earning \n     pay checks and paying taxes. ``The difficult we do \n     immediately; the impossible takes a little longer.''\n       More and more communities are coming to accept and include \n     people with mental retardation as a result of all these \n     inspiring efforts. The late Rosemary Dybwad often told a \n     story from the International Congress in 1983 in Kenya. A \n     group of people with mental retardation, some of whom had \n     been confined to state institutions for thirty years, had \n     told the participants in that Congress about their own ideas \n     and recommendations for the future. In a challenge to all of \n     us, Rosemary asked eloquently:\n       ``If that can be done in a multi-national, multi-language, \n     multi-racial international meeting, why is it not done in \n     your community? And if it isn't, what can you, your friends, \n     your organization, do to help persons with severe \n     disabilities to represent themselves adequately, and to \n     participate in community affairs? What will we do to \n     translate this into action? Faith and works, I believe, are \n     the words to remember.''\n       In closing, I would leave you with five thoughts as a call \n     to action. First and most important, the essence of reform in \n     the field of mental retardation is an abiding respect for the \n     person. We are talking about citizens rather than recipients. \n     Let us never lose sight of the person in the policy.\n       Second, we must seize the moment and learn to move ideas \n     more rapidly into practice. We live in an information age, \n     and the information revolution can be a powerful source of \n     positive\n      social change. No one has to reinvent the wheel in any \n     nation. At the speed of light and the click of a mouse, a \n     practical idea being implemented in the morning in New \n     York can be tested in the afternoon in New Delhi.\n       Third, governments should pledge to play more of a \n     leadership role by moving at all levels to commit themselves \n     to the three empowerment principles--independence, \n     productivity, and inclusion. No longer can people with mental \n     retardation be treated as second class citizens. The global \n     community can no longer afford the cost of such prejudice and \n     exclusion.\n       Fourth, individuals everywhere must play a part in ensuring \n     that people with mental retardation have a fair chance to \n     participate in all aspects of life. I ask all of you at this \n     symposium--legislators, government officials, experts in \n     research, practitioners, teachers, family members, persons \n     with mental retardation, friends and media--to join in a new \n     commitment to action.\n       Finally, above all, individuals with mental retardation and \n     their families must be intimately involved as active \n     participants in designing policies and implementing programs \n     to meet their needs.\n       To open the White House Conference on Mental Retardation in \n     1963, President Kennedy spoke words that are equally \n     applicable today:\n       ``We have left behind prejudice, superstition and ignorance \n     which since the dawn of time distorted our thinking. We have \n     entered a new era of understanding, hope, and enlightenment. \n     We are on the threshold of an exciting and great achievement \n     which is a tribute to the skills and devotions of thousands \n     of dedicated scientists, professional persons, and public and \n     private citizens.''\n       My brother made an enormous difference on these issues in \n     the United States when, as head of state, he personally gave \n     voice and leadership to this cause. May each of your own \n     heads of state be encouraged by this symposium to make that \n     kind of difference too.\n       Achieving true and lasting social change is never easy. It \n     requires strength and persistence, courage and vision. We \n     have come far in our journey to empower people with \n     disabilities in our own countries and around the world. My \n     wish is this--may this Symposium be a bright milestone on \n     that journey. May what is imparted here accelerate all our \n     efforts, so that years from now, when we look back, we can \n     truly say, this is where it all began anew.\n       A story from India that I came across not long ago makes my \n     concluding point most vividly. An old man walking along the \n     beach at dawn saw a young woman picking up starfish and \n     throwing them out to sea. ``Why are you doing that,'' the old \n     man inquired. The young woman explained that the starfish had \n     been stranded by the tide on the beach, and would soon die in \n     the morning sun. ``But the beach goes on for miles,'' the old \n     man said, ``and there are so many starfish. How can your \n     effort make any difference?'' The young woman looked at the \n     starfish in her hand, and then threw it to safety into the \n     sea. ``It makes a difference to this one,'' she said.\n       Thank you for inviting me here, and thank you for the \n     difference that all of you are making.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/26/senate-section/article/S10742-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10745-S10746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO GEORGE F. COURTOVICH\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nGeorge F. Courtovich of Stratham, NH. George passed away suddenly on \nMay 21, 1995, at the age of 33.\n  George was a great American. Although his was not a name that would \nbe nationally recognized, George Courtovich was great because of the \nway in which he lived and influenced the lives of so many. He lived his \nlife to the fullest and gave of himself to the community in numerous \nways. Most notable was his volunteer work for the Stratham Fire \nDepartment where he was a member of the EMT rescue squad.\n  George left his parents, Dorothy and George, his brother, Jim, and \nhis wife, Debra, and daughter, Colleen, much too early. He will be \nmissed by his family, his friends, his colleagues, those whose lives he \nsaved through his EMT work, the elderly in the community to whom he \ndelivered meals on weekends, and those he taught to enjoy the sport of \nskiing while an instructor at Loon Mountain. George touched many lives \nand embodied what is best about the American spirit. He has left this \nworld for a new one, and though he is no longer with us, we are all \nenriched for having known him.\n  The celebration of George's life was poignantly related by his \nbrother Jim at the funeral service on May 24, 1995 at St. Michael's \nChurch in Exeter, NH. Mr. President, I ask that the text of the eulogy \nbe reprinted in the Record.\n  The eulogy follows:\n                  Eulogy Given by James C. Courtovich\n\n       Today we come to celebrate the life of George Courtovich, \n     my brother, my best friend. George had many qualities, but \n     none stronger than the love he had for his family, friends, \n     and even strangers. George enjoyed life to the fullest, and \n     more importantly, he wanted everyone to enjoy it with him. He \n     made it easier for us to do so.\n       George answered the call--whether as a volunteer fire \n     fighter, friend, neighbor, brother, son, father or husband--\n     he was there to help. He believed that we were here to leave \n     this place better than we found it. George did.\n       On Thanksgivings, before joining my parents and other \n     family members, George prepared and delivered dinners for \n     people for whom the day would have been nothing special \n     otherwise. His reward was, as in many instances, knowing he \n     helped make someone's day a little better.\n       It is hard to quantify all of the good George did, as he \n     was able to bring people together, help a neighbor, be a \n     supportive family member in a way that would leave people \n     grateful but not obligated--sometimes not knowing until later \n     what George had done for them. I wish I could talk to all the \n     people \n\n[[Page S10746]]\n     whom George helped as a volunteer E.M.T., but I know there were many. I \n     wish I could go back and find all of his friends he helped \n     along the way, but I know there were many. I just know, \n     however, that no matter where George was, he helped.\n       I remember running into George the day I was leaving for a \n     ski weekend. George spotted my attire and shabby skis. For \n     all of you who were close to George, you know this was \n     unacceptable to him and off we went to a ski store--and we \n     shopped like only George could--he was standing at the fore, \n     directing three salesmen in eight directions ensuring that I \n     arrived at the mountain outfitted for an Olympic tryout. As \n     he paid, George looked at me and said he could not let me go \n     skiing looking like I would have because it might have hurt \n     his image on the slopes. He didn't fool me, I knew he was \n     helping me, like he had so many times before. That was \n     classic George.\n       To understand George's love of family, you need look only \n     at the walls of his and Debbie's home, where Norman \n     Rockwell's four Freedoms hang. Freedom from Want hangs over \n     the dining room table, Freedom of Speech and Freedom to \n     Worship are in the living room, and Freedom from Fear watches \n     over Colleen's crib. This is how George wanted life to be, \n     for all of us. This is what George strived for. He helped us \n     all get one step closer to Rockwell's world.\n       George brought Debbie, and they together, Colleen into our \n     lives. They have made us stronger and richer. Deb, you are \n     the sister I never had. You brought George so much happiness \n     and joy. We take great comfort in knowing you have been part \n     of George's life and have made it better--as you have done \n     for all of us.\n       Mom and Dad, you stood by George and helped him along the \n     way. You were always there for him, as you are for me. Just \n     by moving no further than a few miles from you shows the love \n     he had for the both of you. Your commitment to him was clear, \n     your love, unquestioned.\n       My Grandmother, of course, has been here for all of us. We \n     know this is especially hard on you, but we can all rest \n     easier knowing George is with our grandfather now. Together, \n     with our many other beloved relatives, they are watching over \n     us.\n       And to all of you who have come to express your support and \n     sympathy, our family appreciates everything you have done for \n     us. We know that this is a tragedy we all share in and will \n     need each other to get through it. Just knowing that there \n     are so many of you there, comforts us greatly.\n       Today we have come to say good-bye to my brother, my best \n     friend. Today we will leave here with George in all of us; he \n     will live on in our memories and our hearts forever. George, \n     we love you.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/26/senate-section/article/S10745-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JULY 27, 1995\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM.
