Mr. President, when I was elected to the Senate in \n1992, I was one of five Republican Senators elected that year. But, I \nwas the only Senator who defeated a Democratic incumbent in the \nNovember election, in what many would consider a year dominated by \nDemocrats.\n  I was a new conservative voice, in a town where the Presidency and \nboth Houses of Congress were controlled by liberal Democrats.\n  During those first 2 years, I opposed many of the initiatives of the \ncoming out of the Congress. I voted against President Clinton's budget, \nbecause I did not think raising taxes was the answer to cutting the \ndeficit.\n  I opposed raising taxes on Social Security.\n  I opposed his health care plan, which I think would have nationalized \nhealth care in this country, which is the last thing we needed.\n  But the elections in November 1994 changed all of this. For the first \ntime in 40 years, the American people elected a Republican House and \nSenate. In my opinion, because of this, the changes have been dramatic.\n  For years, popular initiatives that the American public have wanted \nhave been stalled or bottled up in the Congress.\n  The 104th Congress--the Republican Congress--has finally broken the \nlogjam.\n  Look at what this Congress has passed. It has been significant.\n  We voted to apply to the Congress the employment laws that we pass \nwhich businesses have to put up with. As of a few days ago, many in \nCongress are getting a taste of the laws that we \n\n[[Page S356]]\nhave imposed on the employers of this country for many, many years. \nMany of the Congressmen are having trouble coping with them and have \nnot even begun to understand the implications of what we passed.\n  Both Houses have passed versions of a line-item veto for the \nPresident.\n  Both Houses passed legislation to increase penalties for child \npornography. This has been signed into law.\n  Both Houses have passed new gift rules for Members of Congress and \nstaff.\n  Both Houses have passed and signed into law a bill restricting \nunfunded mandates that we place on States--one of our most important \nand best pieces of legislation.\n  Both Houses of Congress have passed welfare reform, ending a \ndestructive 30 year entitlement program, and replacing it with \nassistance that requires personal responsibility and work. Regrettably, \nthe President vetoed the bill. He said he wanted welfare reform, and \nwhen we gave it to him he vetoed it.\n  The Congress passed legislation to provide a tax credit for families \nwith children. The Congress voted to repeal the Clinton tax increase on \nSocial Security. But, again, the President vetoed both of them.\n  The President also vetoed legislation that would balance the budget \nin 7 years. In fact, the President had to be forced after months--and \nthree budgets, to finally produce a budget that was balanced using \nhonest numbers.\n  Mr. President, the first session of the 104th Congress was an active \none--in which many important issues were addressed. I think the \nAmerican people can be pleased with the job the Republican Congress has \ndone.\n  Certainly, it has kept its promises--more than any other Congress in \nmy recent memory.\n  Even the President seems to have picked up on the message of the \nRepublican Congress. In his State of the Union, he said ``the era of \nbig government was over.'' And we will make it over quicker, if he will \nstop vetoing the legislation that we pass.\n  No longer are we talking about starting new Government programs, like \nhealth care, but we are talking about getting our fiscal house in order \nfor the future and stability of this country.\n  In the second session, there are a number of items I think we must \ntackle.\n  We need to take up regulatory reform. Compliance with these \nregulations is costly. It is destructive and time consuming. Regulatory \nreform legislation would impose a cost benefit analyses for regulations \nwith an annual cost of $50 million.\n  The Senate also needs to vote on term limits as soon as possible. I \nam an original cosponsor of legislation to limit Senators to two terms.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we need to take up the constitutional \namendment to balance the budget. Probably no issue is more important to \nour country than this one. We are nearly $5 trillion in debt, and it \nwill have to be increased right away. It is long past time that we pass \nthe balanced budget amendment.\n\n  Every year Americans work longer and harder just to pay their Federal \ntaxes, and every year more and more of that money is being used to pay \nthe interest on the debt. The debt grows, and the amount necessary to \nservice it grows with it. We are truly imposing a massive financial \nburden on our children and progeny yet unborn. It is wrong, and it is \nour responsibility to stop it.\n  In the Senate we fell only one vote short of passing a balanced \nbudget amendment. I hope the majority leader will bring this issue back \nbefore the Senate before we adjourn, and I certainly hope that one of \nthe Senators could be persuaded to change his view on this critical \nissue. It would mean more to the future and stability of this country \nthan anything I can think of at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/25/senate-section/article/S355-6", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  STATEMENT HONORING THE OLLISON'S FOR CELEBRATING THEIR 50TH WEDDING \n                              ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, these are trying times for the family in \nAmerica. Unfortunately, too many broken homes have become part of our \nnational culture. It is tragic that nearly half of all couples married \ntoday will see their union dissolve into divorce. The effects of \ndivorce on families and particularly the children of broken families \nare devastating. In such an era, I believe it is both instructive and \nimportant to honor those who have taken the commitment of ``til death \nus do part'' seriously and have successfully demonstrated the timeless \nprinciples of love, honor, and fidelity, to build a strong family. \nThese qualities make our country strong.\n  For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Raymond and \nCharlene Ollison who on February 2 are celebrating their 50th wedding \nanniversary and will renew their wedding vows. My wife, Janet, and I \nlook forward to the day we can celebrate a similar milestone. Raymond \nand Charlene's commitment to the principles and values of their \nmarriage deserves to be saluted and recognized. I wish them and their \nfamily all the best as they celebrate this substantial marker on their \njourney together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/25/senate-section/article/S356-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S356-S357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CURBING YOUTH ACCESS TO TOBACCO PRODUCTS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, after 2\\1/2\\ years of inexplicable \ndelay, on January 19, 1996, the Department of Health and Human Services \n[HHS] issued final regulations concerning tobacco sales to minors for \nthe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA].\n  These SAMHSA regulations implement the Alcohol, Drug and Mental \nHealth Block Grants [ADAMHA] Reauthorization Act of 1992, which \nrequired States to prohibit the sale and distribution of tobacco \nproducts to minors, take steps to enforce that prohibition and report \nannually to HHS, or lose Federal substance abuse block grants. While \nHHS dallied over the final SAMSHA regulations, the Food and Drug \nAdministration--itself an arm of HHS--proposed a highly intrusive new \nset of regulations governing tobacco sales, distribution, labeling, \nadvertising, and marketing.\n  I support the approach taken by the SAMSHA regulations. As Congress \nspecifically required in the ADAMHA Reauthorization Act, the SAMSHA \nregulations give States the maximum degree of flexibility while \nensuring that States do in fact take strong steps to stop the sale of \ntobacco products to minors. The SAMSHA regulations will accomplish the \nsame goal that FDA professes to want--reducing the use of tobacco by \nminors--in a shorter time for less money and with much less Government \ninterference.\n  The Kentucky General Assembly passed legislation in 1994 to address \nADAMHA compliance. As an example, the State Department of Agriculture, \nwith assistance from local law enforcement officials, must conduct \nrandom, unannounced inspections. Persons under the age of 18 may be \nenlisted to test compliance, provided that parental consent has been \ngiven. Kentucky has also established sign requirements, license \nrequirements, and vending machine restrictions.\n  Mr. President, I represent 60,000 hard-working tobacco farm families \nand thousands of hard-working individuals who are involved in the \nmanufacturing and retail of tobacco products. Under the SAMSHA \nregulations, tobacco growers and others involved in the tobacco \nindustry can rest assured that they will not be subjected to excessive \ngovernment interference. States where tobacco is grown will be free to \ncraft laws that take into account the needs and interests of tobacco \ngrowers. Tobacco growers will not be treated as the enemy. On the other \nhand, FDA's proposed regulations would treat nicotine as an addictive \ndrug and position the FDA to march on every tobacco farm in the United \nStates. FDA's proposal is unacceptable.\n  Tobacco already is one of the most heavily regulated products in the \nUnited States. More than a dozen Federal agencies have jurisdiction \nover some aspect of tobacco production, sales, or advertising. In light \nof this fact, Congress authorized SAMSHA not to imposed sweeping \nFederal tobacco regulations, but instead to encourage States to prevent \nyouth access to tobacco.\n  Mr. President, I strongly believe that minors should not use or \npurchase tobacco products. I also believe the most effective way to \nprevent minors from using or purchasing tobacco products lies in the \nstrict enforcement of laws already in effect in each of the 50 \n\n[[Page S357]]\nStates. A new Federal bureaucracy, as proposed by the President and \nFDA, is not needed. In 1992, Congress made a bipartisan decision that \nState officials, not a Federal agency, were best suited to deal with \nthe problem of underage tobacco use. The SAMSHA regulations are a \nconstructive, constitutionally appropriate and cost-effective way to \ndeal with underage tobacco use. The SAMSHA regulations take the right \napproach. FDA's approach is wrong, excessive, costly, and unnecessary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/25/senate-section/article/S356-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the impression will not go away: The $4.9 \ntrillion Federal debt stands today as a sort of grotesque parallel to \nthat energizer bunny that appears and appears and appears on television \nin precisely the same way and to the same degree that the Federal debt \nkeeps going up and up and up.\n  Politicians talk a good game--and ``talk'' is the operative word--\nabout reducing the Federal deficit and bringing the Federal debt under \ncontrol.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss what the Senate is \ndoing actually tomorrow on a very, very critical and important \nresolution that would put the Senate in recess for 1 month. To my way \nof thinking this could be the most irresponsible vote the U.S. Senate \nhas taken in a long, long time. A month--30 days, Mr. President.\n  I think that such action would be the height of irresponsibility. If \nwe think the American public is losing faith and confidence in our \nlegislative institutions, just wait and see how they react when they \nsee the Senate is voting to take a 30-day recess with all of the work \nthat lies ahead.\n  The Senate and the Congress as a whole has much work to do, a lot of \nwork to do. The shrinking amount of time in which to do it is something \nthat I would like to discuss for a few moments this afternoon.\n  The first session of the 104th Congress, Mr. President, was one of \nthe busiest that we have ever seen. Unfortunately, however, it was one \nof the least productive. I will cite my friend, Senator Bill Cohen's \nop-ed piece recently in the Washington Post when he said--I think I can \nquote--``There's a great deal of motion, but very little movement.'' I \nthink that aptly describes last year.\n  That first session of Congress lasted 365 days, 1 whole year. Only \ntwo other first sessions have lasted 365 days in the course of the \nRepublic's history, Mr. President, the 77th Congress in 1941-42 and the \n102d Congress in 1991-92.\n  The Senate, for example, was in session for 211 days. We took 613 \nrollcall votes. The House was in session 167 days. The House took 885 \nrollcall votes. What was the result of all of this movement and action, \nMr. President? Only 88 bills were signed into law, the smallest number \nof bills becoming law since 1933.\n\n  Mr. President, a 30-day recess, like the one that is being proposed \ntomorrow, is truly unprecedented. A review of the Senate's \ncongressional calendar shows the normal pattern for Congress is to \nbegin work after the State of the Union. A short recess around the \nPresident's Day holiday is the norm. However, to simply shut down the \nU.S. Senate, for us not to work until the beginning of March, is a \nremarkable inconsistency.\n  So what does that mean for us today? It means that there is a lot for \nus to do in a year already shortened by the Presidential election. Some \nhave even suggested that the Senate is arranging its schedule, \ndepending upon the primaries in New Hampshire and the special caucuses \nin Iowa. I am not here to argue whether that is true or false, but that \nis being charged.\n  There are bills awaiting our attention that must be addressed, not to \nfurther the Democratic agenda or the Republican agenda, but to help the \nAmerican people and to make their lives better and to live up to our \nresponsibility.\n  I rise today to talk about some of this imperative legislation that I \nthink we should be working on now rather than recessing tomorrow for a \nwhole month's period.\n  For example, we are in the midst of a crisis in agriculture, and this \naffects all of rural America. In fact, it affects all America.\n  On January 1, some 25 days ago, the 1990 farm bill expired. Because \nno Congress in 40 years has failed to pass a farm bill, we are still \nexploring the ramifications of what it means to live under an expired \nfarm bill. In short, chaos in rural America could very easily result. \nWe need action in this area.\n  What we know for sure is that because there is not a farm bill, \nAmerican agriculture is now, in large part, operating under laws \nenacted in the year 1949.\n  In the past several weeks, lawyers and staff at the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture began to piece together just what this means for \nfarmers, for consumers, and for the taxpayers. For example, while the \ncotton program operates as is until 1997, the rice program, as we know \nit, has now been terminated. Today across our country, there is no rice \nprogram. There has not been for 25 days. The so-called permanent law, \nor 1949 law, to which we are now reverting, includes provisions for \ncommodities, such as wheat or corn; however, no provisions for rice.\n  The Secretary of Agriculture has said he would have to use some \ngeneral authority under the CCC Charter Act to run a rice program, but \nresearch is still underway to see what kind of program he might legally \noperate.\n  There is great confusion. Arkansas grows 40 percent of all of the \nrice produced in our country, but other States, such as California, \nMississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, are also large rice producers. \nPulling together some kind of general authority and running a partial \nprogram could be devastating to the rice industry and to the rice \nfarmers in these five States.\n  It is not just rice farmers who are very anxious right now. As many \nof my colleagues have pointed out, most farmers cannot even find out if \nthey will be able to plant a crop, much less what that crop might be. \nNecessary operating credit, those loans that are so important to the \nAmerican farmer, will not be extended to many farmers unless the \nvarious lending institutions have some idea of what the rules or \nregulations are in rural America relative to the new farm proposals.\n  Mr. President, with all of this uncertainty hanging over us in rural \nAmerica, from producers to millers to ginners to seed salesmen to \ntractor dealers to processors and all the other businesses that serve \nthe agriculture sector, it is unconscionable, I think, for this \nCongress to even contemplate recessing for a 30-day period.\n  Let me give you another example of how the American people are paying \nas a result of congressional inaction.\n  Last year, Congress made a legislative error in the GATT treaty which \nis forcing American consumers to pay millions and millions of dollars \nmore for their prescription drugs every day. We had a debate on this \nfloor. We had a very close vote on this floor.\n  For instance, the world's largest drug company, Glaxo, today is \ngaining $6 million a day in undeserved enrichment--$6 million a day in \nundeserved enrichment and profits. This single company has so far \ngained $300 million, all of it subsidized by the American consumer from \nthis congressional mistake. We had a chance to correct it. We did not \nmeet that obligation. We must have that opportunity again.\n  Instead of acting quickly to fix it, Congress has let it drag on week \nafter week after week. If we recess for 30 days, consumers across \nAmerica will be paying another $180 million in unnecessary health care \ncosts for their drugs. That is outrageous. But there is no \n\n[[Page S358]]\ncompany in this country today who would love to see the Senate adjourn, \nrecess and leave town for the next 30 days more than the company of \nGlaxo. It means another $180 million to them in undeserved enrichment.\n  This is not the only important health care issue being held up. A \nbipartisan proposal which would require insurance companies to stop \ndropping people when they change jobs and to prevent insurers from \ndenying coverage for preexisting conditions is being blocked today from \nconsideration. There was an excellent article in this morning's \nWashington Post related to this situation.\n\n  This legislation, which would help almost 25 million Americans, is \nmuch too important to let die, it is much too important to let it be \ncrowded off the Senate floor schedule simply because we are not in \nsession, we are scattered to the four corners of the land and we cannot \nbe found to do our legislative duty.\n  There are a number of tax credits that have expired. They need to be \nextended. The education tax credit, which encourages employers to help \ntheir employees improve their education, the research and development \ntax credit, the targeted jobs tax credit, which helps employers who \nhire disadvantaged workers, are just some of the examples. These tax \ncredits are helping American business and workers all across this \ncountry today. But for 30 days, if we vote to go into this recess, they \nwill be ignored while the Congress leaves town.\n  There are other bills pending that would change tax policy and make \nlife simpler and better for Americans. For example, a bill to increase \nthe health care deduction for the self-employed lies idle. This \nbipartisan bill would give self-employed Americans more of the tax cut \nthat large corporations get for funding full health insurance.\n  Also put on hold is legislation introduced by the majority leader, \nmyself and 44 other Senators to ease the tremendous burden placed on \nfamily-owned businesses by the estate tax. This bill would benefit \nfarmers and family-owned businesses across our country.\n  Another bill on the sidelines is the Church Retirement Benefits \nSimplification Act, which would clarify the rules that apply to church \nretirement and welfare benefit plans and make it easier for churches to \nadminister their retirement and benefit programs.\n  These bills all try to make the tax system friendlier and fairer, and \nall Americans should not be ignored while the Congress takes a month-\nlong break.\n  Mr. President, in addition to these bills that I have discussed this \nafternoon, and many others that are also very important, there is also \nthe issue of the Federal budget. The House, today, is likely to pass a \n30-day continuing resolution to keep the Government running. We hope \nso. The Senate will probably pass it tomorrow. We hope so. And then \nwhat happens, Mr. President, is we all leave town. We will be doing \nnothing to resolve the basic problems that have prevented us from \nenacting a budget and passing the final six 1996 appropriations bills.\n  Mr. President, I am talking about finishing up the spending bills \nthat should have been completed last year. I have not even mentioned \nthe fact that the work on the 1997 budget should begin in 10 days when \nthe President submits his budget to the Congress. In addition, the debt \nceiling must be lifted by March 1, Mr. President. If we recess and come \nback on the 26th of February, we will be returning with only a precious \nfew hours to deal with this most important, very critical issue. \nMoody's has already issued a warning that they may downgrade Treasury \nbonds as a result of this pending uncertainty. The full faith and \ncredit of the United States of America rests on our actions. There \ncould be possible catastrophic results if we do not take action.\n  Finally, the people's business needs to be tended to--it is that \nsimple--from rural America to Wall Street, and tomorrow could be the \nmost irresponsible time that I have ever known for us to even consider \nbeginning a 30-day recess.

Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, I would like \nto address my remarks to those Government employees who were victimized \nby the process of shutting down the Government. I am sorry--and I think \nall of my colleagues would share in that sentiment--for that \nunfortunate set of circumstances. I would like to point out, Mr. \nPresident, before we, the Members of Congress, are designated as the \nsole villain, consider for a moment that both the House and the Senate \npassed a reconciliation bill to fund the Government fully until all \nappropriations bills were completed. Our President chose to veto that \nreconciliation bill. Had he not, there would not have been a shutdown \nin Government. It seems the media and many have forgotten that, \nincluding some Government employees.\n  Further, Congress passed a significant majority of the appropriations \nbills, sent them to the President, and the President vetoed about half \nof them. The President made that decision, just as he made the decision \nto veto the reconciliation bill. He could have signed the \nappropriations bills, and those Government agencies would not have been \nshut down.\n  So, as a consequence, as we look at the fallout associated with the \nshutdown of Government, the blame is not all on the Congress, by any \nmeans. The President must share that blame. I find it very disturbing \nthat the media does not seem to be able to pick up on that \nresponsibility. There are legitimate differences of opinion in the \nPresident's version of the adequacy of the appropriations bills we \npassed, and he has reason to veto them. But, by the same token, I think \nhe has to be realistic in recognizing that the responsibility is not \nCongress' alone.\n  Now, much has been said about the debt ceiling and the fact that \nsometime in March we are going to be asked to increase that debt \nceiling from $4.9 trillion to somewhere in excess of $5.3 to $5.4 \ntrillion, and if we do not, the Federal Government is going to go into \ndefault. Some of us feel pretty strongly that the only way to turn this \ntrain around of continued debt is to initiate a process that generates \na balanced budget in real terms. Real terms means in 7 years--but not 7 \nyears with cuts in the sixth and seventh year, as President Clinton \nproposes.\n  Clearly, in the sixth or seventh year, regardless of the election, \nPresident Clinton will not be around to bear the brunt of those cuts, \nand those cuts truly are draconian. Congress is not going to have the \nself-discipline to do it either. We simply have to get spending under \ncontrol. We have to reduce the rate of growth of the entitlements. That \nis basically what we attempted to do with Medicare--not cut it, simply \nreduce the rate of growth. Many of the public, the elderly, did not \nseem to catch that difference. Medicare would be increased next year \nover this year and the year after, but not at the same rate of growth. \nThe President's own Cabinet suggested that Medicare will be bankrupt in \n7 years if we do not address that. It is not being addressed under the \nPresident's proposal. The ramifications of that suggest business as \nusual.\n  Many do not seem to have really captured what this debate was all \nabout. It was not just about a balanced budget. It was about \nredirecting America, rededicating, if you will, that Washington does \nnot know all, control all, regulate all; but the responsibility should \nbe dictated, as much as possible, to the States and, more directly, to \nthe people. They are capable, and they are frustrated with the dictates \nfrom Washington. But that seems to be lost in this debate.\n  So the significance of where we are at this time, I think, needs real \nexamination, because if corrective action is not taken, if somehow we \ndo not get the attention of the administration to address a real \nbalanced budget, we are simply going to add to this accumulated debt, \nwhich, as I have said, is $4.9 trillion, and the interest on that is \nsome $236 billion, which is more than our annual debt. That means that \nwhat we are spending in excess of what we \n\n[[Page S359]]\nare generating in revenues is about $160 billion. Yet, our interest on \nthe accumulated $4.9 trillion is somewhere in the area of $350 billion.\n  You do not have to be an accountant to know that if your interest \ncosts on the outstanding principal that you owe are more in each year \nand each year you are increasing that by an added debt in the area of \n$160 billion, sooner or later you are going to pay the piper, and you \nare going to pay the piper through the consequences of a loss of \nconfidence in America's monetary system. That lack of confidence is \ngoing to be triggered by too much debt. It happened in Central America, \nit happened in South America, it happened in Europe, and it will happen \nin the United States if we do not address a meaningful balanced budget.\n  So as we look at the crucial times ahead, Mr. President, I do not \nknow what we are going to have to do to catch the attention of the \nadministration to get real about this process. Otherwise, we are going \nto pay the piper. There is a member of my staff whose wife is expecting \na baby in April. That child will come into this world with a share of \ndebt in the area of about $157,000.\n  Multiply that per capita in the United States--what are we going to \ndo, simply leave a legacy of debt? We must take the medicine now. We \nmust address the hard decisions now. Otherwise, it is simply going to \nbe too late. I wonder if it is not too late now. If we extend the debt \nceiling when we come back sometime in the future and we do not have a \ncommitment for a real balanced budget, we are doing a tremendous \ndisservice to the citizens of this Nation.\n  As a consequence, Mr. President, I think it is time that we go home \nand reflect on the significance of this crisis. This is very real. Talk \nto our constituents about the ramifications and share with them the \ndilemma that is going to be facing us when we come back and we are \nasked to increase the accumulated debt, the authorized debt, beyond \n$4.9 trillion. When the only leverage we have is to suggest it should \nnot be done, it is irresponsible to increase that until we have a \ncommitment for a balanced budget. Only when we achieve a balanced \nbudget can we begin to address that 4.9 trillion dollars' worth of \ndebt, and every Member of this body knows it, but not every Member of \nthis body or the House of Representatives is prepared to take the \naction. That is where we are today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/25/senate-section/article/S358-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S359-S361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          POLICY AND POLITICS\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, another matter I bring before this body \nconcerns the policy and politics related to mining law reform. As \nchairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I have been \nworking with Senator Craig and other members of the committee to craft \na mining bill that is realistic, that is responsive to change.\n  Many know that the 1872 mining law has been a topic of debate in this \nbody for many years. My good friend from Arkansas has spent many hours \nsuggesting reform. The environmentalists continue to cry for reform. \nThis year in an effort to enact a responsible reform we included \nseveral mining law provisions in the budget reconciliation package.\n  What did we send to the President? Specifically, for the first time \nin history, I repeat, for the first time in history, we required miners \nto pay a 5-percent royalty. For the first time in history, miners were \nrequired to pay a fair market value for patented land, and for the \nfirst time in history patented lands used for nonmining purposes would \nrevert back to the Federal Government. Patented land would have to be \nused for mining. If the land was used for non-mining purposes it would \nrevert back to the Federal Government.\n  For the first time in history we established an abandoned mines land \nfund to start the process of cleaning up the old abandoned mines and \ntry and address abuses that had taken place in the past.\n  We maintained the existing $100 per claim fee for 3 years and doubled \nthe fees to $200 per fee starting in 1999. The Congressional Budget \nOffice score over 7 years was approximately $157 million. This is \nsignificant reform.\n  What happened to the proposal, Mr. President? The President vetoed \nthe reconciliation package. What is the administration's proposal? \nPretty hard to get a feel for what they have in mind. Secretary \nBabbitt, continues to demand mining law reform, yet he does not offer a \nspecific solution. In fact, the administration has failed to submit a \ncomprehensive mining law reform proposal this year.\n  Now, let me read some comments made by the administration on mining \nlaw reform. ``This process has gone from distasteful to obscene. We \nsupport common sense reform that gets the taxpayers a fair return. \nCongress could and should act quickly to end this travesty.'' Secretary \nBabbitt, December 1, 1995.\n  Second: ``The idea that we are backing off of mining reform, grazing \nlaw reform, is just nonsense. We are totally committed to changing the \ncurrent policy.'' This was Vice President Gore, May 10, 1993.\n  Further: ``Just recently, a law on the books since 1872 that I am \ntrying hard to change, forced the government to sell minerals worth $1 \nbillion.'' President Clinton, November 4, 1995.\n  By reading these quotes one would think the White House wants action \non mining law reform. There is an old saying around here, ``actions \nspeak louder than words.'' In this case I can assure my colleagues we \nhave had no action on mining law reform from the administration this \nyear. What we have had, Mr. President, is a lot of words. There is \nanother old saying around here, ``What is good for the goose is good \nfor the gander.'' I guess it depends on who is the goose and who is the \ngander.\n  In today's Washington Times there is a very interesting and revealing \neditorial about Vice President Gore and Secretary Babbitt. Apparently \nthe Vice President's family has an interest in mining property in \nTennessee, a family interest I am sure--nothing wrong with a family \nhaving an investment in mining property. According to the Washington \nTimes the Vice President or his family receives a 4-percent net royalty \nfrom minerals mined on their land.\n  I find this interesting because Secretary Babbitt has been pushing \nfor a gross royalty as high as 12.5 percent. As everybody knows, I \nsupport mining in the United States. I am pleased that the Vice \nPresident and his family are in the mining business. What troubles me \nis this administration continues to demand a gross royalty for miners \nwhile the Vice President receives a royalty based on net. I agree with \nthe Washington Times, if a net royalty is good enough for the Vice \nPresident, why is it not good enough for the Secretary of Interior \nBabbitt?\n  We can take this process one step further. The Vice President \napparently supports exploration and development when it benefits his \npersonal interest, yet he opposes it almost everywhere else, \nparticularly on public land, and certainly in my State of Alaska. He \nopposes logging in the Tongass, he opposes exploration and development \nof the Arctic, including ANWR, for oil and gas.\n  Mr. President, what is the difference between mining and oil and gas \nproduction? Both are producing something from Mother Earth, providing a \nreturn, reducing our dependence on imported resources. It appears to be \na rather inconsistent policy, Mr. President.\n  I think it is appropriate that the Washington Times has highlighted \nthis because the Vice President is known as a champion of the \nenvironment. We appreciate his contribution to the environment, \nhowever, we are troubled by his strong opposition to oil and gas \nexploration, mining exploration, logging, grazing, and any other \ndevelopment of our natural resources. Yet here we have a personal \ninterest reflected on the families' ownership of the lead and zinc mine \nthat the Vice President and his family have in the State of Tennessee \nwhich has been highlighted in the Washington Times article.\n  That is why I question, Mr. President, what is good for the goose is \ngood for the gander.\n  Mr. President, a good deal of this is about politics. The \nadministration sees the environment as a political issue, and they will \ngo to any means to exploit it. We have seen the President's remarks--\nprotect the environment. Many of the issues are not environmental. They \nare jobs issues. Are we going to have blue collar jobs in this country \nin our timber industry, in our mining industry, in our grazing \nindustry, in our oil and gas industry? Or are \n\n[[Page S360]]\nwe going to continue to be dependent to an ever increasing degree on \nimports? We seem to be importing resources and exporting jobs.\n  Currently, over 51 percent of our crude oil consumption comes from \nimported oil. The Secretary of Energy has just come out with a forecast \nthat is truly alarming because it suggests that this is going to \nincrease dramatically in the coming years.\n  I note for the Record in the ``Inside Energy/with Federal Lands,'' of \nJanuary 22, 1996, a statement from the Secretary of Energy Secretary \nO'Leary decrying the deficiency budget. She says an oil crisis is \n``imminent.'' That is a pretty strong statement.\n\n       Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary last week predicted that an \n     oil crisis is ``imminent,'' and called on Congress [this \n     body] to help prepare for it by shifting resources from \n     fossil energy r to energy efficiency and renewable energy \n     r\n       O'Leary, speaking to reporters Tuesday, reiterated concerns \n     about a possible oil crisis stated earlier in the day by \n     Joseph Romm, DOE's Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for \n     Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. . . . \n       ``It's pretty clear there's going to be another oil crisis. \n     I would say, in the next 10 years,'' Romm said. . . . \n       O'Leary agreed with Romm, adding, ``with the trajectory \n     Congress has us on, we're not allowed to intervene with new \n     technology.''\n\n  I find that very revealing. It further reads:\n\n       ``Any interruption in the Persian Gulf or pipeline failures \n     could lead to supply disruptions.''\n       Comparing the situation to the blizzard that afflicted East \n     Coast cities earlier this month, O'Leary said, ``I see crisis \n     imminent and something we better take care of.''\n       Asked what DOE could do to avert it, O'Leary responded that \n     the department is ``beginning to pull away from the \n     traditional energy supply, shave some resources from \n     unnecessary national security programs and high-tech nuclear \n     programs, and put that effort to deploying energy efficiency \n     and renewable energy technologies. . . . \n\n  That sounds great. Some of it is attainable, but not all of it. There \nare not enough renewable energy resources out there. Yes, we can \nincrease energy efficiency. But to suggest we are moving our focus over \nthere from increasing energy supplies to alternatives is simply \nunrealistic, and anybody who is in the energy business, having to \nsupply this country with energy, will tell you, ``It just ain't so.''\n  ``Romm predicted that soon''--and this is the bottom line, and I will \nurge all my colleagues to reflect on it because one of these days it is \ngoing to come around and bite you, it will bite each one of us, because \nthe public is going to say, Where was Congress? Why did Congress not do \nsomething to avert this crisis of curtailing a supply of crude oil into \nthe United States?\n\n       Romm predicted that soon the Persian Gulf region's \n     percentage of the oil market will surpass its highest level \n     ever, which was 67 percent in 1974. That percentage, he said, \n     ``likely will go over 70 percent.''\n\n  There are solutions to the problem, and the three that are proposed \nby the Department of Energy suggest the following: Raise the price of \noil, make it scarcer; add to the burden of the family budget, the \nNortheast corridor that depends on oil for heating. What is that going \nto do for inflation, Mr. President? They suggest one of the answers is \nraise the price of oil. Is that not a bureaucratic answer to a \nshortage? You raise the price. Put in place regulations to increase \nfuel economy--there is nothing wrong with that, but you can only go so \nfar--and try to improve fuel efficiency technology. We have done that \ndramatically in our automobiles.\n\n  The indication here is that the administration is taking all three of \nthese approaches, but they blame Congress for opposing all three. We do \nnot oppose all three but we are being realistic.\n  It is interesting, spokesman Romm ``downplayed the effect that \nopening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling \nwould have on reducing oil imports. More oil would be saved by \nimplementing DOE's efficiency and renewable energy programs than would \nbe generated by ANWR, he said,'' if it was opened.\n  The inconsistency there, and what he does not tell you, is that \nPrudhoe Bay has been supplying this Nation with nearly 25 percent of \nits total crude oil production for the last 25 years. That field is in \ndecline. As I have said, currently we are importing 51 percent of our \ntotal crude oil. As Prudhoe Bay declines, if we do not find more \ndomestic reserves, we are simply going to import more. It is going to \ncome into this country in foreign vessels, so we are not going to have \nour U.S. maritime fleet as we have currently in the movement of Alaskan \noil which requires that all that oil be moved in U.S. tankers with U.S. \ncrews.\n  So here we have a situation where, as Prudhoe Bay declines, if we do \nnot find more domestic oil, if we do not look for it in the most likely \nplace where it is likely to be, and that is, the geologists tell us, in \nthe Arctic, we are simply going to be exporting more of our dollars and \nmore of our jobs overseas.\n  We hear a lot about the deficit balance of payments. That means we \nspend more than other nations spend buying from us. Half of it is made \nup in the cost of imported oil. So I find it extraordinary at this time \nthat we have a dire prediction that we are facing an oil crisis and the \nonly alternative that we pursue is greater efficiency and renewable \nenergy and do not prioritize increased domestic production.\n  This administration is selling America short. America has the \ntechnology. America has the engineering know-how to develop oil \nreserves in those delicate areas and do it safely. We have proven that \ntime and time again.\n  The difficulty we have in my State of Alaska is we happen to be a new \nkid on the block. We have only been a State for 38 years. We are trying \nto develop our land patterns. The rest of the States did it 100 years \nago, Virginia 200 years ago. Prudhoe Bay is the best oil field in the \nworld. Endicott was the 10th largest producing field when it came on \nline. Now it is the seventh. The footprint is 56 acres. That is the \ntechnology we have in industry. If we are allowed to go into ANWR, it \nwill generate $1.3 billion for the Federal Treasury resulting from \nthose lease sales. Developing the 1002 area could provide nearly \n700,000 jobs during the life of the field throughout the country. We do \nnot make pipe in Alaska. We do not make valves. We do not make all the \nseals, all the things that go into the development. We get these \nsupplies throughout the United States and this means jobs. And the \nindustry says they can do it in 2,000 acres.\n  What does ANWR consist of? It consists of 19 million acres. Out of \nthat 19 million, 8 million acres have been set aside as wilderness. The \nrest of it is in refuge, leaving 1.5 million that Congress set aside \nfor determination to be made of whether to allow exploration. Out of \nthat 1.5 million acres only 2,000 acres would see a footprint.\n  Think of the jobs in this country. Think of the dollars generated. If \nwe lose this opportunity, Mr. President, indeed our only alternative \nwill be to increase oil imports of oil coming in foreign vessels and \nthe export of U.S. jobs and the export of dollars.\n  So, as we look at the situation in general, and this administrations \nattitude towards development of public lands, I think we have, indeed, \na political situation. This administration sees these issues, and \ncertainly the environmental community does, as causes--causes for \nmembership, causes for more dollars coming in. Because the American \npeople cannot go up and see Prudhoe Bay, see the advances that have \nbeen made in the Arctic, see what we have done to increase the caribou \nherds in the central Arctic that were 3,000 or 4,000, and are now over \n20,000.\n  So, unfortunately, in their efforts to win political points, this \nAdministration is destroying our natural resource industries. These \nindustries have been significantly reduced--driving jobs overseas and \nincreasing our balance of payments deficit.\n  So, indeed, it is about politics--not policy. I hope my colleagues \nwill see through the smokescreen.\n  The editorial, which I ask unanimous consent be printed in the \nRecord, is about the Vice President's mine, and his interest in that \nmine. I encourage my colleagues to read the editorial. If it is good \nenough for the Vice President, it ought to be good enough for the rest \nof the Nation's miners.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Jan. 25, 1996]\n\n                      Bruce Babbitt as Gold Digger\n\n       Vice President Al Gore can afford to worry about whether \n     Earth's in the balance. He has a zinc mine at home in \n     Carthage, Tenn., that keeps his checkbook in balance. He gets \n     a \n\n[[Page S361]]\n     $20,000 check every year based on a 4 percent net royalty on the value \n     of the minerals mined on the Gores' property.\n       Now it may seen a little hypocritical for an \n     environmentalist like Mr. Gore to profit so handsomely from a \n     nasty old industry like mining. But the question for the \n     moment is, if the deal is good enough for Mr. Gore, why isn't \n     it good enough for Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt.\n       For months now, Mr. Babbitt and congressional Republicans \n     have been arguing over plans to reform the infamous 1872 \n     Mining Law as part of the overall budget reconciliation \n     package. The law provides, among other things, that mining \n     companies can get title to government lands for as little as \n     $2.50 an acre and then mine the minerals without paying \n     royalties.\n       That doesn't mean the government collects nothing from the \n     operation. Mining companies pay income taxes, company \n     shareholders pay taxes on dividends, and company employees \n     pay taxes on their wages. Such taxes make the government a \n     partner in almost any business enterprise, including mining.\n       Mr. Babbitt, however, seems to want a gross royalty of 4 \n     percent or higher, a demand to which even the formerly \n     Democrat-controlled Congress would not agree. One says \n     ``seems'' because it's not clear exactly what percentage he \n     wants. An Interior Department spokesman this week could not \n     provide a figure.\n       Republicans propose to make companies pay a 5 percent net \n     royalty as well the fair-market value of the land. The 5 \n     percent figure happens to be a percentage point higher than \n     what Mr. Gore gets, but it's not good enough for Mr. Babbitt. \n     A net royalty is ``riddled with loopholes,'' he says. Mr. \n     Babbitt means the kind of loopholes that allow business to \n     deduct the cost of their expenses before paying taxes.\n       Again, the business dealings of the Gore family are \n     instructive here. So eager were the Gores to capitalize on \n     the assets of Mother Earth that they actually sued the \n     company mining the family farm for cheating it out of royalty \n     payments. It seems that although the company had paid \n     royalties on zinc mined there, it had failed to pay \n     appropriate royalties on the germanium ore it dug up. \n     Arbitrators sided with the Gores.\n       ``My attorney proposed an accounting methodology,'' the \n     vice president's father said in 1992, ``which the arbitrators \n     accepted, to determine the value of germanium produced: Take \n     value of germanium produced from the ore and deduct refining \n     costs, insurance, freight and other charges. That's not \n     difficult accounting.'' No it's not.\n       It can cost millions, perhaps hundreds of millions of \n     dollars, to discover, explore and ultimately develop a mine. \n     Refusal to permit companies the same kind of deductions on \n     government lands that the Gores agreed to on their land is \n     simply another way to shut down mining there. That may be \n     what Mr. Babbitt wants, but employees and towns and schools \n     who directly or indirectly depend on mining jobs don't have \n     the luxury of handouts from Washington.\n       There's plenty of ``gold'' to be had from the Republican \n     mining reform proposal. It would raise an estimated $157 \n     million in federal revenues. But Mr. Babbitt needn't take \n     Republicans' word when it comes to mining income. All he has \n     to do is ask the Gores.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I wish the President \na good day.\n  I see another of my colleagues on the floor.

Mr. President, it is becoming difficult to open a \nnewspaper without reading another horrifying story of drug-related \nchild abuse.\n  From Brooklyn, we learn of Elisa Izquierdo, the 6-year-old girl who \nwas born to a crack addicted mother. Elisa's mother allegedly beat her \nto death, leaving New York's public welfare agencies to engage in the \nusual finger pointing. [New York Times, Nov. 28, 1995]\n  In suburban Chicago, a woman and two children are brutally murdered \nby a trio that includes a convicted drug dealer high on crack. [Time, \nDec. 4, 1995].\n  In Patterson New Jersey, a crack-addicted woman beats her 14-year-old \ndaughter with a three-foot board with a nail protruding, after a \ndispute over dirty dishes. [New York Times, Dec. 6]\n  To most of us, horrifying incidents like these seem nearly \nunimaginable. They demonstrate the incredible dangers of drugs like \ncrack cocaine--drugs so addictive that they could actually impel a \nmother to kill her own child.\n  These may be extreme cases, but they are instructive because they \nrepresent the extreme end of the kind of pressures facing young people \ntoday.\n  Indeed, sometimes it almost seems to me as if our culture is \ndedicated to separating children from their innocence. A recent \nCarnegie Foundation report put it this way:\n\n       Barely out of childhood, young people ages 10 to 14 are \n     today experiencing more freedom, autonomy, and choice than \n     ever at a time when they still need special nurturing, \n     protection, and guidance. Without the sustained involvement \n     of parents and other adults in safeguarding their welfare, \n     young adolescents are at risk of harming themselves and \n     others. [Report of the Carnegie Council on Adolescent \n     Development.]\n\n  Lately, the harm referred to in the Carnegie report has been taking \nthe form of increased drug use. A few numbers tell the story:\n\n       Last year the number of 12- to-17 year-olds using marijuana \n     hit 2.9 million, almost double the 1992 level [National \n     Household Survey on Drug Abuse, Nov. 1995].\n       LSD use is way up among high-school seniors--11.7 percent \n     of the class of 1995 have tried it at least once. That is the \n     highest rate since recordkeeping started in 1975. [Monitoring \n     the Future Study, released Dec. 11, 1995]\n       A parents' group survey released this November found that 1 \n     in 3 high school seniors now smoke marijuana [Survey released \n     Nov. 2, 1995 by Parents Resource Institute for Drug \n     Education].\n       Unbelievably, another survey shows that young people are \n     more likely to be aware of the health dangers of cigarettes \n     than of the dangers of marijuana [May 1995 survey by Frank \n     Luntz].\n\n  As I said, kids have it rough today. They are faced with adult \nchoices at an ever-earlier age, as the culture surrounds them with \nhedonistic messages. And it bothers me, frankly, when I read that \nsometimes our mass media, our educators, and our public officials are \nmaking things even worse.\n  Take the recent advent of rap and hip hop music, a kind of music that \nenjoys great popularity among young people. A lot of hip hop music is \nperfectly unobjectionable, although I have to admit it is not what I \nlisten to.\n  But take a look at these lyrics by the hip hop group Total \nDevastation and tell me if you hear what I hear--kids as young as 10 \nbeing encouraged to take drugs. Chart No. 1 reads:\n\n     When it comes to puffing blunts [blunts are a kind of \n           marijuana cigarette] I'm a 12-year vet.\n     And I wasn't 10 yet when I took my first hit.\n     I was headed out the house to school one day,\n     And guess what I found in my dad's ashtray . . .\n     Now there's only three things in life that I need\n     Money, safe sex, and a whole lot of weed. Total Devastation, \n           ``Many Clouds of Smoke'']\n\n  If my colleagues believe that this is an isolated phenomenon, let me \nquote from some other songs. This is ``Hits From the Bong,'' by the \ngroup Cypress Hill. Chart No. 2 reads:\n\n     Pick it, pack it, fire it up,\n     Come along, take a hit from the bong. . . .\n     [Cypress Hill, Black Sunday, Hits From the Bong]\n\n  Of course, for those of you who have led sheltered lives, a bong is a \nplastic pipe used for smoking marijuana. This is what our kids get hit \nwith every day.\n  This last chart has an excerpt from a No. 4 hit song by performers \nknown as ``Channel Live'' and ``KRS One''. Chart No. 3 reads:\n\n     Wake up in the mornin' got the yearning for herb\n     Which loosens up the nouns, metaphors and verbs\n     And adjectives ain't it magic, kid\n     What I'm kickin'\n     Multiflower bags and seeds for the pickin'. . . .\n     [Group: Channel Live and KRS One; Song: ``Mad Izm'']\n\n  This is not just talk, either. The author of this hit song told High \nTimes magazine: ``I love marijuana.'' ``Anything that gives a good \nfeeling the youth are going to gravitate towards. Period. Drugs are \npart of the human experience.'' [High Times, May 1995, p. 66]\n  From Atlanta we get the Black Crowes, known for unfurling large \nbanners on stage emblazoned with a marijuana leaf and bearing the words \n``Free Us.'' Crowes lead singer Chris Robinson explained to a reporter: \n``Everybody in this band smokes weed. . . . We did 350 shows, smoked \nevery night, and never got busted.'' [Hartford Courant, Mar. 12, 1993]\n  If you think it is easy to do something about this stuff, think \nagain. Baltimore deejay Marcel Thornton lost his job after he stopped \nplaying songs like ``First of the Month,'' by Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, a \nsong which according to the Washington Post talks about ``getting high \nand selling crack to welfare recipients.'' [Washington Post, Dec. 2, \n1995]\n\n  According to the Post, Thornton, who attended the Million Man March, \n\n[[Page S362]]\n  got a call from a female listener pointing out the contradiction \nbetween the ideals of the march and some of the lyrics he was playing--\ncoarse and sexually explicit lyrics that I would not repeat on the \nSenate floor. Thornton agreed; now he is unemployed.\n  Some people claim that music reflects values but has no influence \nover the way people really live. But how else to explain the following \nstory, reported in the December 18 Washington Post.\n  A homemade video shows a man sitting at a table packaging what \nappears to be crack cocaine. His 4-year-old son sits next to him--also \npackaging a crack-like substance. The father drinks from a bottle of \ngin. The 4-year-old takes a drink. The father pulls a 9 mm pistol and \nsubdues an assailant. The 4-year-old pulls a pistol--it may have been a \ntoy, we do not know--and turns it on a younger sibling.\n  Why was this child being trained, for lack of a better word, to be a \npredatory criminal? His father says they were making a rap music video.\n  Of course, there are two sides to every coin. America's music and \nentertainment industry has brought us greater access to more kinds of \nmusic than at any time in history. Music entertains us, but it also \nedifies us. It has always been a source of great inspiration to me. \nThere is so much in what the music industry produces for kids that is \npositive--even uplifting. And there are so many musicians out there who \nhave put forth antidrug and other positive messages for people.\n  I also speak as one who has been a big supporter of the music \nindustry. The digital performance rights bill that was recently signed \nby the President, and the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992, are only \ntwo of the more recent pieces of legislation that I have worked to \nenact.\n  But the industry has to admit that it just is not helpful to be \npeddling albums and artists whose music endorses this type of \ncompletely self-destructive activity.\n  To those of you at Arista, Sony, Interscope, Capricorn and Columbia \nRecords, and the many others who produce and distribute these groups \nand the ones like them, I ask: How can you sit by and look at 1.3 more \nyoung people--that is more young people than 2 years ago--smoking \nmarijuana? How can you ignore a 200-percent increase in marijuana use \nbetween 14- and 15-year-olds?\n  The recording industry has a positive role to play here, but I just \nhave to ask the people promoting these groups, do you not feel \nirresponsible distributing this garbage?\n  The record industries are hardly the only sector of the entertainment \nindustry that is sending mixed messages. In an episode of the hit TV \nshow ``Roseanne,'' Roseanne and her husband find a stash of marijuana \nin their daughter's room. After lecturing her boyfriend, whom they \ninitially suspect of buying the marijuana, they then as parents shut \nthemselves up in the bathroom and smoke it.\n  Now, that is one of the most popular shows on television. Why, I will \nnever know, but nevertheless it is. What can our kids get from stuff \nlike that? I, fortunately, missed this particular episode, but I \nunderstand that the writers treated it like it was something funny--as \nif the main characters in a top-rated show have no influence over our \nmores and our attitudes. [``Roseanne'' show aired Oct. 5, 1993.]\n  Small wonder, then, that 67 percent of adults and 76 percent of kids \nsay that pop culture--TV, movies, magazines, and pop music--encourages \ndrug abuse. There may be no direct causality, but there is certainly \npositive reinforcement of a truly negative message. [May 1995 survey by \nFrank Luntz.]\n  It is not just the mass media, of course. Kids are getting the wrong \nmessage from areas as diverse as the instructional materials they \nreceive in school, and even a new encyclopedia that glorifies drug use.\n  Schools all across this country hand out free copies of Scholastic \nUpdate, a magazine geared to youthful readers. Here is what an issue of \nScholastic Update had to say about illegal drugs:\n\n       Marijuana is back and coming out of the closet. Stars smoke \n     it. Musicians . . . celebrate it. TV shows like Saturday \n     Night Live and Kids in the Hall depict it as harmless fun. \n     Marijuana fashion has grown into a $10 million industry. . \n     .'' [Buschbaum, Herbert, ``Legalizing Drugs: Where do you \n     Stand?'' Scholastic Update, May 6, 1994 pp. 8-11].\n\n  The article gushes that ``America's antidrug policy is getting a \nfresh look'' with ``[a] small but increasing number of public figures * \n* * calling for legalization of all drugs, not just marijuana,'' and \nstrongly suggests that the Government treat drug use as a ``health \nproblem,'' providing addicts with controlled access to cheap drugs and \nclean needles.\n  Here is another example that surprised me. The 1995 edition of \nColliers Encyclopedia--the book our kids are going to be using to write \nbook reports in junior high and high school--tells us there is no \nreason to worry about drug use because ``[t]he desire of human beings \nto alter their state of consciousness is one of the few constants in \nhuman history.''\n\n  The Colliers entry on ``Drugs, Prohibition of'' was written by noted \nlegalization proponent Ethan A. Nadlemann. Among other novel theories \nDr. Nadlemann advances in this entry are that most drug laws, including \nthose banning cocaine and opiates, have their historic origin in racism \nand the desire to crack down on socialism and other forms of political \ndissent and nonconformity.\n  What bull. I cannot believe that an organization like Colliers would \ngo to this person to tell us and to tell our kids what is right with \nthe world. This is the kind of material we are giving to our young \npeople to read in school. Imagine what they are reading in their free \ntime.\n  Keeping our kids off drugs is critical for all the obvious reasons--\nplus one. Those who reach age 21 without using drugs almost never try \nthem later in life. Hard core drug abusers almost always start young \nand almost invariably start by smoking marijuana. Let us emphasize this \npoint. Marijuana is not harmless.\n  According to the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia \nUniversity, 12- to 17-year-olds who use marijuana are 85 times are more \nlikely to graduate to cocaine than those who abstain from marijuana.\n  The conclusion is clear. Glamorizing drug use is just reckless, \nwhether it is through music, TV, magazine articles, educational \nmaterials, or misguided Government policies.\n  Keeping kids away from drugs in the first place requires us to \nstigmatize drug use--a conclusion confirmed by numerous surveys and one \nthat, unfortunately, explains our recent upturn in youthful marijuana \nusage.\n  According to a University of Michigan study, youthful use began \nrising in 1992, just 1 year after declines in peer disapproval were \nfirst noted.\n  One organization that has been doing a great job in explaining the \ndangers of illicit drugs is the Media Advertising Partnership for a \nDrug Free America.\n  The Partnership brought us the famous frying egg with the voice-over \nsaying, ``This is your brain on drugs.'' They have come a long way \nsince the frying egg. Lately, they have been doing a terrific job of \nproducing ads that target all sorts of high-risk groups.\n  But they rely on donated air time--otherwise, a very expensive \ncommodity--to get their message out. This is becoming a problem for \nthis group. Partnership's ad placements are off more than 20 percent--\nfrom $365 million in 1991 to a projected $290 million this year. \nPartnership for a Drug Free America.\n  Network news coverage of the drug issue has fallen dramatically, from \n518 stories in 1989 to just 82 in 1994. Center for Media and Public \nAffairs.\n  We need to see more of these Partnership messages on TV, not fewer. \nThe media have to be more generous with their time and more proactive. \nUnless we want a generation of junkies, more violence, more abuse and \nneglect, and more crime on our streets, we had better stop singing and \nlaughing about drug abuse. It is a deadly serious matter.\n  I had one of the leading French law enforcement officials tell me how \ndifficult it is because Holland, a nation which has legalized drugs, \nhas become the sewer through which they are pouring in all the drugs \nand then out to the rest of the neighboring states in Europe. It is \njust devastating to the nations of Europe. We cannot let that happen \nhere.\n  All the recent news has not been bad. I am pleased that President \nClinton \n\n[[Page S363]]\nhas responded to Congress' call for expedited nomination of a new drug \nczar. Gen. Barry McCaffrey is an impressive nominee with a history of \ncourageous and energetic leadership. I am proud that he has been \nnominated. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss these and other \nissues with him before and at his confirmation hearings. I commend the \nPresident for finally grabbing the ball and doing something in this \narea.\n  I hope he will back General McCaffrey, who I do not think would take \nthis job if he was not going to have the backing of the President. I \nhope the President will back him and help him to get out there and do \nwhat needs to be done.\n  Mr. President, in the area of drug use, we have our work cut out for \nus. The Senate Judiciary Committee has been holding a series of \nhearings to bring national attention to bear on just how bad this \nsituation has become--and they are bipartisan hearings, I might add. We \nare going to begin the process of revitalizing the drug war.\n  Over the next 2 months I will be joining with Senators Dole and \nGrassley to look at specific approaches to dealing with the problem of \ndrug use. By working together I believe we will be able to reclaim the \nground that we have lost. But we cannot do it without people in America \nbeing aware of these problems that are just killing our country and \nkilling our young people, and just satiating them with substances that \nare horrifying, debilitating and wrong, and that will lead them down \nthe primrose path of drug abuse, drug addiction and ultimately death \nand degradation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, thank you. I just want to again thank my \ncolleague from Utah for his very eloquent remarks on the drug problem, \nespecially on marijuana. I say to my friend, I was listening, and he \npoints out some very good things. I, being the parent of two teenage \ndaughters, am as concerned as he is about the lyrics I hear on some of \nthese songs promoting the use of drugs, such as marijuana.\n  I cannot add to anything my friend from Utah said, except I heard him \nsay that hard-core drug users always start when they are young--and \nthat is true--and they usually start with something like marijuana. \nBefore that, they start on cigarettes. And unless and until we can get \nto that root problem of doing something about how these cigarette \ncompanies are pushing their products on young people we are fighting a \nlosing battle. We have to get to that too and stop them from getting \nhooked on cigarettes, because it is cigarettes and alcohol and then \nright on to illegal drugs.\n  So I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. I want to thank my colleague. I appreciate the kind \nremarks and hear him.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator has been a great leader on this issue, and I \ncommend him for it.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to do so.\n  Mr. LOTT. I wish to commend him for his remarks. I find them very \ninteresting and informative. I think we can all make use of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/25/senate-section/article/S361-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ORDER FOR ALLOCATION OF TIME\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I came to the floor today to talk about a \nletter I received just yesterday from the inspector general of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\n  Mr. President, over the last 6 years I have spoken frequently on the \nSenate floor about the problem of fraud, waste and abuse in the \nMedicare Program. For several years I chaired the appropriations \nsubcommittee that funded the Health Care Financing Administration. \nEvery year I would have one full day of hearings on fraud, waste and \nabuse in the Medicare Program.\n  Through the use of our subcommittee we have had a number of GAO \ninvestigations and the inspector general's investigations. I was \nwondering just what might be happening to these investigations because \nof some of the Federal Government shutdowns and slowdowns. As \nbackground, let me just say that the GAO has estimated that up to 10 \npercent of Medicare spending is lost to waste, fraud and abuse. And 10 \npercent out of a program running about $180 billion a year means that \nis $18 billion a year going for waste, fraud, and abuse. So it is not \njust a small item. It is a big item, and it is a direct hit to the \npocketbooks of taxpayers.\n  One of the main activities and one of the main positive forces we \nhave going after waste, fraud and abuse is the inspector general's \noffice. It is our main line of defense against Medicare fraud. As I \npointed out before, even at last year's level, they did not have enough \nresources to do the job. But it is absolutely essential in stopping \nthis terrible waste of taxpayers' dollars and saving us money.\n  So I was concerned about the possible impact of the Government \nshutdowns and the low level of temporary funding that the inspector \ngeneral is operating under, and what that would mean in our fight \nagainst Medicare waste, fraud and abuse.\n  Last year I wrote to Inspector General June Gibbs Brown to ask her \nwhat the impact was. Mr. President, I received her letter yesterday. I \nwant to share it with the Senate because it is absolutely shocking.\n  The inspector general has said that literally billions of dollars are \nto be lost to fraud and abuse if action is not taken now. Let me read \nsome portions of this letter.\n  First of all she says:\n\n       Dear Senator Harkin: Thank you for your recent letter \n     expressing concern about the extent to which the critical \n     anti-fraud and abuse activities of the Office of Inspector \n     General (OIG) in the Department of Health and Human Services \n     (HHS) are suffering from the government shutdowns and under \n     the current stop-gap spending bill. Specifically, you asked \n     the following questions:\n       Were major enforcement initiatives, investigations, and \n     audits suspended?\n       [Second,] [a]re fewer initiatives, investigations, and \n     audits being initiated?\n       [Third,] [w]hat is the potential impact on Inspector \n     General activities of being forced to operate under another \n     short-term funding measure similar to the one currently in \n     effect?\n\n  As I said, Mr. President, the answers are shocking.\n  I am not going to read the whole letter. I will put it in the Record. \nA few points need to be highlighted. On my question on investigations \nand audit activity, listen to this, Mr. President.\n  Cases to U.S. attorneys offices for prosecution dropped from 92 in \nthe first quarter of last year to 51 in the first quarter of this year. \nIndictments fell from 50 to 34.\n  Criminal convictions dropped from 84 for the first quarter of last \nyear to 36 for the same period this year.\n  Investigative receivables fell from approximately $77.7 million for \nthe first quarter last year to about $30.8 million for the same period \nthis year.\n  The Office of Inspector General issued 33 percent fewer reports, \nprocessed 30 percent fewer non-Federal audits, and identified 40 \npercent fewer dollars for recovery to the Federal Government compared \nto the same period last year.\n\n       The shutdowns [she went on to say] prevented us from \n     excluding individuals and entities from participation in \n     Medicare and Medicaid. Providers were allowed to continue to \n     bill the Medicare and Medicaid programs even though they \n     should have been excluded due to convictions or because they \n     [have been] abusive to patients.\n\n  Understand what she is saying. She is saying that certain individuals \nand entities should be excluded from participation because they have \nbeen convicted of criminal activities. They could not even keep them \nout because of the their lack of funds caused by the shutdown in the \nGovernment and because of their underfunding.\n  In comparison, she states that last year at the same time there were \n493 health care exclusions versus only 210 \n\n[[Page S364]]\nexclusions for the same period this year. Starts on 100 audit \nassignments were delayed or postponed.\n  But here is really the central point of the whole letter.\n\n       . . . Under the continuing resolution scenario, [the \n     Inspector General said] the number of completed inspections \n     may drop to approximately half [of the number of last year, \n     which was 68.] Considering the program savings generated in \n     past years as a result of such reports, as much as $1 billion \n     could be lost from the drop in program inspections alone.\n\n  That is $1 billion.\n\n       Program inspections identify sources of fraud and abuse and \n     recommend program adjustments to prevent future occurrences.\n\n  That is what will not be done this year, as she said, under the \ncontinuing resolution scenario.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \ninspector general's letter be printed at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Department of Health and Human Services, Office of \n           Inspector General,\n                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 1996.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Labor, HHS, and \n         Education, Senate Committee on Appropriations, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: Thank you for your recent letter \n     expressing concern about the extent to which the critical \n     anti-fraud and abuse activities of the Office of Inspector \n     General (OIG) in the Department of Health and Human Services \n     (HHS) are suffering from the government shutdowns and under \n     the current stop-gap spending bill. Specifically, you asked \n     the following questions:\n       Were major enforcement initiatives, investigations, and \n     audits suspended?\n       Are fewer initiatives, investigations, and audits being \n     initiated?\n       What is the potential impact on Inspector General \n     activities of being forced to operate under another short-\n     term funding measure similar to the one currently in effect?\n\n\n             Suspension and Curtailment of Pending OIG Work\n\n       [Note: Social Security related activities have been removed \n     from FY 1995 figures because the Social Security \n     Administration became an independent agency on March 31, 1995 \n     with its own Inspector General. The FY 1996 figures include \n     some activities funded by Operation Restore Trust--a limited \n     Medicare demonstration project funded through the Health Care \n     Financing Administration.]\n\n   Investigations and audit activity--comparison of the first fiscal \n                       quarters of 1995 and 1996\n\n       Presentations of cases to United States Attorneys for \n     prosecution dropped from 92 in the first quarter of Fiscal \n     Year (FY) 1995 to 51 in the first quarter of FY 1996 while \n     indictments fell from 50 to 34.\n       Criminal convictions dropped from 84 for the first quarter \n     of last year to 36 for the same period this year with civil \n     judgements going from 27 to 19.\n       Investigative receivables fell from approximately $77.7 \n     million for the first quarter last year to about $30.8 \n     million for the same period this year.\n       The OIG issued 33 percent fewer reports (54 reports \n     compared to 82 reports), processed 30 percent fewer \n     nonfederal audits (861 compared to 1,223), identified 40 \n     percent fewer dollars for recovery to the Federal Government \n     ($14.2 million compared to $23.8 million), and is collecting \n     30 percent fewer dollars approved for recovery ($83.2 \n     million compared to $120.1 million).\n\n                     HHS financial statement audits\n\n       The Government Management Reform Act requires that agencies \n     have financial statement audits beginning FY 1996. The HHS-\n     wide financial statement audit requires audits of eight \n     operating agencies accountable for about $280 billion. The \n     financial statements of the Health Care Financing \n     Administration alone comprise expenditures in excess of $230 \n     billion that are material to the overall departmental \n     financial statements and to the General Accounting Office \n     effort to report on governmentwide financial statements. If \n     travel funds are not obtained, all such audit work will be \n     suspended with resultant impact on HHS-wide and \n     governmentwide statements. Audit activity must be performed \n     at multiple State agencies and Medicare contractor locations, \n     all requiring substantial travel funds. In addition, funding \n     must be sought for expert medical assistance to review \n     medical claims.\n\n       Administrative sanctions--fines, penalties, and exclusions\n\n       The shutdowns prevented us from excluding individuals and \n     entities from participation in Medicare and Medicaid. \n     Providers were allowed to continue to bill the Medicare and \n     Medicaid programs even though they should have been excluded \n     due to convictions or because they are abusive to patients.\n       By comparison, there were 493 health care exclusions \n     implemented for the first quarter of FY 1995 versus 210 \n     exclusions for the same period this year. Approximately 400 \n     exclusion cases are presently awaiting implementation.\n\n\n                     impact on new oig initiatives\n\n       During the first quarter of last year, the OIG \n     investigations component opened about 560 cases and closed \n     about 605 cases. For the same period this year, under the \n     continuing resolution, we opened only 425 and closed about \n     390. During the furlough period this year, we opened and \n     closed only 2 criminal cases.\n       Starts on 100 audit assignments were delayed or postponed \n     indefinitely because of the furlough. An example of this is \n     the national review of prospective payment system (PPS) \n     transfers. The United States Attorney in Pennsylvania \n     proposed a joint review of PPS transfers based on prior audit \n     work that identified over $150 million of overpayment to \n     hospitals. If we are able to follow the Department of Justice \n     proposal, we anticipate recoveries of over $300 million under \n     the provisions of the Federal False Claims Act. The project \n     has been suspended due to the furlough and lack of \n     adequate travel funds.\n\n\n               Potential Effect of Continued Underfunding\n\n       Lack of funds for travel and other expenses of field work\n\n       For investigations, audits, and inspections not funded \n     under Operation Restore Trust, travel has been reduced to \n     about one-third of the prior year's expenditure for the same \n     period. If the underfunding of OIG activities continues, most \n     travel will be suspended and employees furloughed. \n     Approximately 60 percent of ongoing or planned audits will be \n     curtailed or severely reduced in scope because of travel \n     requirements with the resultant loss in program savings. The \n     FY 1995 audit-related savings totaled $5.5 billion.\n       Last year the OIG issued 68 program evaluation reports. \n     Under the continuing resolution scenario, the number of \n     completed inspections may drop to approximately half that \n     number. Considering the program savings generated in past \n     years as a result of such reports, as much as $1 billion \n     could be lost from the drop in program inspections alone. \n     Program inspections identify sources of fraud and abuse and \n     recommend program adjustments to prevent future occurrences.\n\n                      Effect on sanctions activity\n\n       The OIG expects a decline in potential settlements and \n     exclusions as a result of fewer investigative and audit \n     initiatives. In addition, since many of the false claim cases \n     originating from the Department of Justice are generated \n     through OIG investigations and audits, we expect a decline in \n     that caseload as well.\n       Currently, the OIG administrative sanctions staff has under \n     development 292 cases including false claims, Qui Tams, and \n     civil monetary penalties, all of which will be put on hold \n     during another furlough. Activity on them would be greatly \n     reduced if we are operating under a continuing resolution \n     with an inadequate level of funding.\n       Since the furlough, we have not been able to respond to \n     more than 2,217 inquiries from licensing boards and private \n     sector providers, who are required by law in inquire about \n     the exclusion status of a practitioner before hiring, \n     concerning the current status of a health care practitioner.\n       The minimum funding that would allow the OIG to meet its \n     basic obligations and maintain its infrastructure is the \n     amount shown in the Senate markup of the HHS appropriations \n     bill ($75,941,000). We have enclosed at Tab A a copy of the \n     Committee recommendation.\n       We sincerely appreciate the effort you have made toward \n     achieving a level of funding for the OIG that would allow us \n     to sustain basic services. We also appreciate your consistent \n     support year after year toward curtailing waste, fraud, and \n     abuse in Medicare, Medicaid and other HHS programs. The \n     attention you give to our findings and recommendations and \n     your enthusiastic encouragement assist us greatly in \n     strengthening the integrity of these important programs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 June Gibbs Brown,\n                                                Inspector General.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Much of the problem is they have no funds for travel. It is \ninteresting that their auditors and their investigators can come to \nwork and sit at a desk, but they cannot do anything. Much of the \ninvestigative work of the inspector general is involved in traveling \nand in investigative activities. So we have hundreds of these people \nsitting at their desks unable to do their jobs. Every day that the \nGovernment is either shut down or every day that they operate under the \ncontinuing resolution, with the short funding that they have, the \ncrooks and the con artists are picking Medicare's and the American \ntaxpayers' pockets costing us billions, as the inspector general said, \nif we fail to act.\n  So this is not just again some little item. It is very odd to me, Mr. \nPresident, we can pass a continuing resolution to provide a full year \nof funding to a number of important programs, including the Kennedy \nCenter for the Performing Arts--that is fine--and yet we do not fully \nfund the inspector general's office that goes out after the \n\n[[Page S365]]\ncrooks and the con artists and stops them and recovers money for the \ntaxpayers.\n  We cannot fund that. I just wish somebody could justify that to me. I \ndo not understand it. I guess we are going to be considering a new \ncontinuing resolution tomorrow.\n  I want to take this opportunity today to let my colleagues know that \nI intend to insist that that continuing resolution provide adequate \nfunding for the Office of Inspector General in the Department of Health \nand Human Services to fight Medicare fraud, waste, and abuse. If we do \nnot, then it is the crooks and the scam artists who will be smiling as \nthey rip off the taxpayers even further.\n  I just want to point that out, Mr. President. If there is a \ncontinuing resolution and they are going to fund some portions of the \nGovernment to go on, this is one portion of the Government that this \nSenator is not going to let sit there and not be adequately funded. \nPeople are talking about cutting Medicare and making our beneficiaries \npay more for their monthly premiums to make up for Medicare shortfalls \nin the future. I say, wait a minute, if the General Accounting Office \nis saying that up to 10 percent of Medicare money is lost to waste, \nfraud, and abuse, that is $18 billion a year each year for 7 years. We \nalready have more money than we need right there to make up for the \nMedicare shortfall that we face.\n  So this is an important matter and I intend to pursue it. I hope \nSenators will do so on both sides of the aisle--I do not say this is a \npartisan issue. I just hope we pay some attention to this issue and \nmake sure the Office of Inspector General is fully funded.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/25/senate-section/article/S363-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE 1996 FARM PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I know my colleague from Oklahoma is \nseeking the floor. I am going to take a few minutes on a different \ntopic. I want to mention how greatly concerned I am that Congress \nappears to be set to go into recess for a month while the details of \nthe 1996 farm program remain unresolved.\n  Farmers have been waiting for a long time to know what the program \nwill be for this year. They need to be able to make plans to line up \nseed, fertilizer, chemicals, and credit. As we all know, and as I know \nthe occupant of the Chair knows from representing his State and the \nfarmers in his State, farming is a very capital-intensive business. \nFarmers need to know what type of Federal policy they are operating \nunder so they know what they need in terms of capital in order to \narrange the credit for this year's expenses.\n  Second, the farm bill is not just for farmers, it is for everyone. It \nis for our consumers as well as our farmers. It is for exports. It is \nfor the whole infrastructure of processing, making and distributing our \nfood products in this country. The fact that we do not have a farm bill \nhas broad ramifications.\n  We should have had a full farm bill debate last year. I know of no \none on my side of the aisle who either filibustered or in any way \nindicated that he or she would filibuster a farm bill. We had some \ncommittee meetings last year under the able leadership of the Senator \nfrom Indiana, Senator Lugar. I will be very up front about it. Those on \nmy side of the aisle, the Democrats, proffered a farm bill proposal. We \ndebated it, we voted on it, and we lost. I understand that, but at \nleast we had the opportunity to debate it and vote on it.\n  Then the majority party, the Republicans, offered their farm bill in \ncommittee. We debated it and we voted on it. They won. I have no \nproblems with that. That is the way it ought to be. But then I expected \nthe bill to be brought to the floor of the Senate so that other \nSenators who have equal interest in agriculture and agriculture policy \ncould have their day to offer amendments, debate the bill, and then \npass it. Maybe some of those amendments would have been adopted, maybe \nsome would not have been, but that is the way the Senate should \noperate.\n  To this day, we still have not had an agriculture bill on the Senate \nfloor for debate, amendments, and passage. What happened was--I do not \ncast any broad nets or use any broad brush, but some people in the \nmajority party decided that they would sit down behind closed doors, \nwrite a bill, and put it into the massive budget reconciliation bill. \nAgain, there was no realistic opportunity to debate, offer amendments, \nor to reach compromise and do what is right for rural America and our \nNation.\n\n  Now I understand someone in the other body is saying that if there is \ngoing to be a continuing resolution, he wants to put his version of the \nfarm bill on it. That proposal is basically the same as was put in the \nbudget bill. Well, that is not the version I like. Maybe that is the \nversion that might eventually get through. I do not know for certain, \nbut I do not think so. I do not think it would have the votes to pass. \nBut at least it ought to be debated, and we ought to have a full and \nfair opportunity to discuss it, vote on it, and amend it. That proposal \nshould not be rushed through as part of a continuing resolution.\n  Farm policy is too important to be ramrodded through here without \nadequate time to debate it and amend it. We do not need much time. If \nwe had a day or two to debate a farm bill, I think we could pass it. It \nprobably would not be exactly what I want, but at least we would have \nour day to debate it, offer some amendments, and maybe we could reach \nsome compromises.\n  All I can say about that so-called Freedom to Farm Act that the \nchairman on the other side wants to attach to the continuing resolution \nis that they ran that up and down the flagpole a number of times last \nyear. It does not have the votes to get through. It cannot pass either \nthe House or the Senate on its own merits.\n  So on that so-called Freedom to Farm Act, we ought to just say the \nlast rites, move on and try to find some compromises we can work from, \nand let us do it in a bipartisan fashion.\n  I have worked on a number of farm bills in the past. At times they \nhave generated a lot of emotional and intellectual debate on farm \npolicy. They have been good debates, some of them pretty tough, but in \nthe end, we fashioned a bipartisan compromise, and we moved on. That is \nthe way we ought to do it again this year.\n  So, Mr. President, there are steps we can take. It is getting very \nlate in the year to try to fashion some entirely new program. I had \nhoped that we would have had a new program for this year, but we do \nnot. More and more, it seems the only feasible thing to do appears to \nbe extending the present farm bill for 1 year, and making some \nimmediate changes that we can all agree on--planting flexibility, for \nexample. Both sides agree it is needed. We agreed on that in committee. \nThat is no problem. We can reach agreement on how to deal with the \nrepayment of the 1995 advance deficiency payments. I think both sides \nagree on working that out. We could do that. So we could resolve those \nimportant issues, and at least farmers would know what to expect this \nyear, and they could get on with their business.\n  If I had my druthers, I would rather we did not have an extension of \nthe 1990 farm bill, but it is too late to do anything markedly \ndifferent now. So that seems the most likely outcome we are faced with \nnow, to extend the 1990 bill, make a few needed changes that we agree \nupon and then move on.\n  Mr. President, I thank you and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I listened with interest when the Senator \nfrom Utah was talking about some of the drug problems that are facing \nthis Nation and that concern all of us deeply. He made a comment that \nwe are all pleased that Barry McCaffrey, if he is confirmed, will be \ntaking over as drug czar to actually do something about it. It is long \noverdue.\n  I sat in the other Chamber and listened to the President during his \nState of the Union Message 2 days ago. He expressed this great concern \nabout the drug problem in America. Yet he has done nothing for the \nfirst 3 years about the drug problem.\n  We did, I guess, have a drug czar, but the number of personnel who \nwere supposed to be participating in the program to address the drug \nproblem in America was cut by 75 percent, from 100 down to 25 people. \nThe amount of money that was spent on the drug problem was actually cut \nin half. \n\n[[Page S366]]\n\n  I hope that Gen. Barry McCaffrey will be confirmed and will come out \nwith a very aggressive drug program. I only regret that we lost 3 years \nin the battle against drugs in America. Everything that the Senator \nfrom Utah said made a lot of sense to me.\n\n\n                              Peacemaking\n\n  I am also concerned about two other things that no one is talking \nabout, Mr. President. One is a statement that was made by the President \nof the United States, not one time but twice during his State of the \nUnion Message. He said that ``Americans should no longer have to fend \nfor themselves.'' Americans should no longer have to fend for \nthemselves. I got to thinking--and maybe I am making the wrong \ninterpretation on this--but is that not what made America great, what \ndistinguishes us from other countries? If you say that Americans should \nno longer have to fend for themselves, then that leads you to the \nincontrovertible conclusion that the Government should take care of us \ninstead. I think, in a subliminal way, that is perhaps what the \nPresident was saying.\n\n  If I were to single out the thing that bothered me the most about the \nmessage--not just the inconsistencies and the talk about the role of \nGovernment and the one-liners about large Government coming to an end \nand all of that--it was the statement that he made that almost went \nunnoticed regarding a new national policy that our military is no \nlonger to be used to defend America, but for peacemaking.\n  I have watched this progress, first when we made the commitment into \nSomalia--and that was not President Clinton, that was actually \nPresident Bush that made that decision after he had lost the election \nand before President Clinton was sworn into office--when our troops \nwere supposed to be there for 45 days. It was not until 18 of our \nRangers were killed almost a year later that President Clinton agreed \nto bring the troops home. Well, that was a concern to me. Haiti was a \nconcern, and Rwanda was, and now, of course, Bosnia is. We had our \ndebate on Bosnia, and now we are going to support our troops all we \ncan. I kept thinking that all these humanitarian gestures were kind of \nincidental things, or accidents that, well, if there is something that \nthe President seems to think is very significant in a part of the \nworld, we need to get involved because there are human rights \nviolations and murders going on and things that we all find deplorable.\n  But in his State of the Union Message, he made it national policy for \nthe first time, that our role is now peacemaking throughout the world. \nThis is not some idle remark--it is the President of the United States \nwho is making this statement, in a State of the Union Message which all \nof the world was watching. If I were sitting out there listening in any \nnumber of countries that are having problems right now, I would say, \n``Good, we do not have to worry because the good old United States is \ngoing to come in and solve our problems.''\n  Now, with a starved military budget--which in purchasing dollars is \nless than it was in 1980 when we could not even afford spare parts--we \nare diluting our force by sending troops around the world on \npeacekeeping missions. We now have a vetoed Department of Defense \nauthorization bill. In the veto message the President says he is \nvetoing it because we have money in there to complete our national \nmissile defense system, which I contend is about 85 percent complete \ntoday--as if there is something wrong with defending America.\n  We keep going back and talking about the 1972 ABM Treaty. Mr. \nPresident, as you will remember, that treaty was constructed back at a \ntime when our policy was one of mutual assured destruction. The \njustification was that we had two superpowers, the Soviet Union and the \nUnited States, and if we both agreed not to defend ourselves, not to \nhave the capability to knock down missiles as they were coming over to \nour countries, neither country would attack the other. Well, that was \nthe policy. Frankly, I did not agree with it at the time, but it at \nleast made some sense in that there were two superpowers.\n  Now we have a totally different environment. The interesting thing \nabout this is that Henry Kissinger, the architect of the ABM Treaty, \ntold me not long ago that it no longer has application today. Today we \nhave a proliferation of threats from places all over the world and it \nis not isolated in one place. To quote Dr. Kissinger, ``it is nuts to \nmake a virtue out of our vulnerability.'' That is the situation we are \nin today, which disturbs me so much as a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee and the Senate Armed Services Committee. But you do not have \nto go to those of us who may be accused of being overly concerned about \nmissile attacks on the United States of America. You can go to James \nWoolsey, former CIA Director, who was appointed not by a Republican \nPresident, but by President Clinton. Jim Woolsey said there are between \n20 and 25 nations that either are developing or have developed weapons \nof mass destruction, either chemical, biological, or nuclear, and are \nworking on the means to deliver those warheads.\n  This is what concerns me because we know right now that the threat is \ngreater than it was during the cold war. During the State of the Union \nMessage, the President said--and he got a rousing ovation--``For the \nfirst time, Russian missiles are not pointing at America's children.'' \nBut I can say this: At least when the Russian missiles were pointing at \nAmerica's children, we knew where they were. Now it could be Iran, \nIraq, Syria, North Korea, or China, any number of places. We do not \nknow where they are. But we know there are two dozen countries that are \ndeveloping the technology and capability of delivering missiles to the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. President, the ABM Treaty stated that it is all right to have a \ntheater missile defense system in place. It is all right if you are in \nthe Sea of Japan and you see two missiles coming out of North Korea, \none going toward Japan, which you can shoot down; but if one is going \nto the United States, you cannot shoot it down because that would \nviolate the ABM Treaty of 1972. I also have contended that the ABM \nTreaty was between two parties, one party of which no longer exists \ntoday.\n  So I will support the DOD authorization bill, even though I think it \nwas a bad decision to take the national missile defense language out of \nthe bill.\n  Before somebody comes running in the Chamber and starts talking about \nstar wars and all of these mythical things and making people believe \nthere is not a threat out there, let me just suggest, Mr. President, \nthat I am not talking, even right now, about space-launched missiles to \nintercept missiles. We are talking now about surface-launched missiles, \nthe technology of which we already have.\n  Anybody who watched CNN during the Persian Gulf war watched missiles \nknock down missiles. That is not supernatural; that is not something \nout of Buck Rogers or Star Wars; that is a technology that works today. \nWe have an investment of $40 billion in the Aegis system, which is \nabout 22 ships that have launching capability. We are trying to spend a \nlittle bit more over a 5-year period, approximately $5 billion more, \nfor that capability to reach to the upper tier. That would mean that if \na missile were launched from North Korea, taking about 30 minutes to \nget over here, we would be able to do something about it and knock it \ndown before it came into the United States. Between that and the THAAD \nmissile technology, which is already here, we could upgrade what we \nalready have billions of dollars invested in, and defend America.\n  I do not understand why this aversion toward defending America keeps \ncoming out of the White House. We know the technology that is here, and \nwe know what the North Koreans are doing. We know the type of missile \nNorth Korea is developing is going to be capable of reaching Alaska and \nHawaii by the year 2000 and the continental United States by 2002.\n  I saw something only yesterday that I would like to share.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire article in yesterday's New \nYork Times entitled ``As China Threatens Taiwan, It Makes Sure U.S. \nListens'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S367]]\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 25, 1996]\n\n         As China Threatens Taiwan, It Makes Sure U.S. Listens\n\n                         (By Patrick E. Tyler)\n\n       Beijing, January 23.--The Chinese leadership has sent \n     unusually explicit warnings to the Clinton Administration \n     that China has completed plans for a limited attack on Taiwan \n     that could be mounted in the weeks after Taiwan's President, \n     Lee Tenghui, wins the first democratic balloting for the \n     presidency in March.\n       The purpose of this saber-rattling is apparently to prod \n     the United States to rein in Taiwan and President Lee, whose \n     push for greater international recognition for the island of \n     21 million people, has been condemned here as a drive for \n     independence.\n       While no one familiar with the threats thinks China is on \n     the verge of risking a catastrophic war against Taiwan, some \n     China experts fear that the Taiwan issue has become such a \n     test of national pride for Chinese leaders that the danger of \n     war should be taken seriously.\n       A senior American official said the Administration has ``no \n     independent confirmation or even credible evidence'' that the \n     Chinese are contemplating an attack, and spoke almost \n     dismissively of the prospect.\n       ``They can fire missiles, but Taiwan has some teeth of its \n     own,'' the official said. ``And does China want to risk that \n     and the international effects?''\n       The most pointed of the Chinese warnings was conveyed \n     recently through a former Assistant Secretary of Defense, \n     Chas. W. Freeman Jr., who traveled to China this winter or \n     discussions with senior Chinese officials. On Jan. 4, after \n     returning to Washington, Mr. Freeman informed President \n     Clinton's national security adviser, Anthony Lake, that the \n     People's Liberation Army had prepared plans for a missile \n     attack against Taiwan consisting of one conventional missile \n     strike a day for 30 days.\n       This warning followed similar statements relayed to \n     Administration officials by John W. Lewis, a Stanford \n     University political scientist who meets frequently with \n     senior Chinese military figures here.\n       These warnings do not mean that an attack on Taiwan is \n     certain or imminent. Instead, a number of China specialists \n     say that China, through ``credible preparations'' for an \n     attack, hopes to intimidate the Taiwanese and to influence \n     American policy toward Taiwan. The goal, these experts say, \n     is to force Taiwan to abandon the campaign initiated by \n     President Lee, including his effort to have Taiwan seated at \n     the United Nations, and to end high-profile visits by \n     President Lee to the United States and to other countries.\n       If the threats fail to rein in Mr. Lee, however, a number \n     of experts now express the view that China could resort to \n     force, despite the enormous consequences for its economy and \n     for political stability in Asia.\n       Since last summer, when the White House allowed Mr. Lee to \n     visit the United States, the Chinese leadership has escalated \n     its attacks on the Taiwan leader, accusing him of seeking to \n     ``split the motherland'' and undermine the ``one China'' \n     policy that had been the bedrock of relations between Beijing \n     and its estranged province since 1949.\n       A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, asked to comment on \n     reports that the Chinese military has prepared plans for \n     military action against Taiwan, said he was awaiting a \n     response from his superiors. Last month, a senior ministry \n     official said privately that China's obvious preparations for \n     military action have been intended to head off an unwanted \n     conflict.\n       ``We have been trying to do all we can to avoid a scenario \n     in which we are confronted in the end with no other option \n     but a military one,'' the official said. He said that if \n     China does not succeed in changing Taiwan's course, ``then I \n     am afraid there is going to be a war.''\n       Mr. Freeman described the most recent warning during a \n     meeting Mr. Lake had called with nongovernmental China \n     specialists.\n       Participants said that Mr. Freeman's presentation was \n     arresting as he described being told by a Chinese official of \n     the advanced state of military planning. Preparations for a \n     missile attack on Taiwan, he said, and the target selection \n     to carry it out, have been completed and await a final \n     decision by the Politburo in Beijing.\n       One of the most dramatic moments came when Mr. Freeman \n     quoted a Chinese official as asserting that China could \n     act militarily against Taiwan without fear of intervention \n     by the United States because American leaders ``care more \n     about Los Angeles than they do about Taiwan,'' a statement \n     that Mr. Freeman characterized as an indirect threat by \n     China to use nuclear weapons against the United States.\n       An account of the White House meeting was provided by some \n     of the participants. Mr. Freeman, reached by telephone, \n     confirmed the gist of his remarks, reiterating that he \n     believes that while ``Beijing clearly prefers negotiation to \n     combat,'' there is a new sense of urgency in Beijing to end \n     Taiwan's quest for ``independent international status.''\n       Mr. Freeman said that President Lee's behavior ``in the \n     weeks following his re-election will determine'' whether \n     Beijing's Communist Party leaders feel they must act ``by \n     direct military means'' to change his behavior.\n       In recent months, Mr. Freeman said he has relayed a number \n     of warnings to United States Government officials. ``I have \n     quoted senior Chinese who told me'' that China ``would \n     sacrifice `millions of men' and `entire cities' to assure the \n     unity of China and who opined that the United States would \n     not make comparable sacrifices.''\n       He also asserted that ``some in Beijing may be prepared to \n     engage in nuclear blackmail against the U.S. to ensure that \n     Americans do not obstruct'' efforts by the People's \n     Liberation Army ``to defend the principles of Chinese \n     sovereignty over Taiwan and Chinese national unity.''\n       Some specialists at the meeting wondered if Mr. Freeman's \n     presentation was too alarmist and suggested that \n     parliamentary elections on Taiwan in December had resulted in \n     losses for the ruling Nationalist Party and that President \n     Lee appeared to be moderating his behavior to avoid a crisis.\n       ``I am not alarmist at this point,'' said one specialist, \n     who would not comment on the substance of the White House \n     meeting. ``I don't think the evidence is developing in that \n     direction.''\n       Other participants in the White House meeting, who said \n     they would not violate the confidentiality pledge of the \n     private session, separately expressed their concern that a \n     potential military crisis is building in the Taiwan Strait.\n       ``I think there is evidence to suggest that the Chinese are \n     creating at least the option to apply military pressure to \n     Taiwan if they feel that Taiwan is effectively moving out of \n     China's orbit politically,'' said Kenneth Lieberthal, a China \n     scholar at the University of Michigan and an informal adviser \n     to the Administration.\n       Mr. Lieberthal, who also has traveled to China in recent \n     months, said Beijing has redeployed forces from other parts \n     of the country to the coastal areas facing Taiwan and set up \n     new command structures ``for various kinds of military action \n     against Taiwan.''\n       ``They have done all this in a fashion they know Taiwan can \n     monitor,'' he said, ``so as to become credible on the use of \n     force.''\n       ``I believe there has been no decision to use military \n     force,'' he continued, ``and they recognize that it would be \n     a policy failure for them to have to resort to force; but \n     they have set up the option, they have communicated that in \n     the most credible fashion and, I believe, the danger is that \n     they would exercise it in certain circumstances.''\n       Several experts cited their concern that actions by \n     Congress in the aftermath of President Lee's expected \n     election could be a critical factor contributing to a \n     military confrontation. If President Lee perceives that he \n     has a strong base of support in the United States Congress \n     and presses forward with his campaign to raise Taiwan's \n     status, the risk of a military crisis is greater, they said. \n     A chief concern is that Congress would seek to invite the \n     Taiwan leader back to the United States as a gesture of \n     American support. A Chinese military leader warned in \n     November that such a step could have ``explosive'' results.\n       In recent months, American statements on whether United \n     States forces would come to the defense of Taiwan if it came \n     under attack have been deliberately vague so as to deter \n     Beijing through a posture of what the Pentagon calls \n     ``strategic ambiguity.''\n       Some members of Congress assert that the Taiwan Relations \n     Act of 1979 includes an implicit pledge to defend Taiwan if \n     attacked, but Administration officials say that, in the end, \n     the decision would depend on the timing, pretext and nature \n     of Chinese aggression.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in this article, entitled ``As China \nThreatens Taiwan, It Makes Sure U.S. Listens,'' the Times reporter \nreports on some ominous information recently passed to the National \nSecurity Adviser, Anthony Lake, concerning measures being taken by \nBeijing to facilitate military action against Taiwan and statements \nintended to deter the United States from coming to Taipei's assistance.\n  According to Charles Freeman, former United States Ambassador to \nChina and now an Assistant Secretary of Defense, a Chinese official \ntold him of the advanced state of military planning and that \npreparations for missile attack on Taiwan and the target selection to \ncarry it out have been completed and await a final decision by the \nPolitburo in Beijing. Freeman reported to Mr. Lake that a Chinese \nofficial had asserted that the Chinese could act militarily against \nTaiwan without fear of intervention by the United States because \nAmerican leaders ``care more about Los Angeles than they do about \nTaiwan,'' a statement Mr. Freeman characterized as an indirect threat \nby China to use nuclear weapons against the United States.\n  I do not think anyone who is watching what is going on in the world \ntoday can miss the threats that come both subliminally and directly \nfrom various countries. If those people watched Saddam Hussein during \nthe Persian Gulf war, they know that he would not have hesitated to use \nthis capability on the United States if he had had it. But today we \nhave more than two dozen countries that are developing such a \ncapability. \n\n[[Page S368]]\n\n  If I could single out this one thing that I heard from the \nPresident's State of the Union Message 2 days ago, this is the most \ndisturbing thing that came out of his message. We can concentrate on \nthe inconsistencies or the statements he made about wanting to have \nwelfare reform, when in fact he vetoed the very bill he says he now \nwants; and when Americans stood up and applauded when he said he was \ngoing to downsize Government, when he, in fact, is increasing the size \nof Government every day in assigning new tasks and putting more jobs \ninto job programs and into retirement programs and into environmental \nprograms--he mentioned 14 different areas of Government he wanted to \nincrease--in every area except for defense, he wants to increase \ngovernment.\n  ``Wait a minute,'' he said, ``Now I am very proud to tell you we have \n200,000 fewer Government employees than when I took office.'' Let me \ntell you where the employees came from. They came from the Defense \nDepartment. They came from our defense system. If you exclude the \ndefense system, our Government has grown dramatically, whether you talk \nabout the budget or whether you talk about the number of employees. It \nis very deceptive for the President to say that.\n  Again, all of that aside, as offensive as that may be to thinking \nAmericans, the thing that has to be looked at is this new role that our \nmilitary has of peacemaking as opposed to the role of defending \nAmerica.\n  I wish that more people in this Senate Chamber had been able to be \nwith me on the days following April 19 in Oklahoma City, in my \nbeautiful State of Oklahoma, where the most devastating terrorist \nattack, domestic attack, in the history of the world took place. When \nyou saw, as we saw in the Chamber the other day, Richard Dean, who went \nin there after he himself had gotten out of the building and dragged \nout three or four other people. The stories of the heroes of that \ndisaster were just incredible. Jennifer Rodgers, the police officer \nacknowledged during the State of the Union Message--and I appreciate \nthe President doing that--sure, ask Jennifer Rodgers or Richard Dean \nabout the devastation of that bomb in Oklahoma City. That bomb was \nmeasured as equal to 1 ton of TNT. The smallest warhead we know of \ntoday, nuclear warhead, is equal to 1,000 tons of TNT.\n  Now, that has to tell you, if you are concerned as we were about what \nhappened in one building and all the tragedy surrounding that, that if \nyou multiply that by 1,000--and I do not care if it is a city in \nOklahoma or New York or Washington or anywhere else in the world--that \nis a pretty huge threat that is out there. It is a very real threat. As \nyesterday's paper indicates, it is even a greater threat and a more \ndocumented threat than it was before. Yet the President has shown no \nregard for the defense of this country against this threat.\n  Mr. President, we will have a chance to address this. Yes, we do want \nto pass the Defense authorization bill even though missile defense has \nbeen taken out of it. But we will return to the battle over missile \ndefense, and to this new humanitarian role that our military has, in \nfuture debates.\n  I guess I will conclude with another concern that is not as life-\nthreatening. Of course, we are concerned about the lives that would be \nlost if we failed to defend ourselves, but in these various \nhumanitarian peacemaking missions that is the new rule of our military, \nsomebody has to ask the question: Who is going to pay for this? We have \na President who has taken virtually all of the money out of the \nmilitary budget that would go into equipment to defend America, and yet \nwe are going to have to come around and pay for all this stuff that is \ngoing on in Bosnia and elsewhere.\n  I picked up something the other day in last week's Defense News that \nI guess has the solution. Pentagon officials said on January 3 that the \nbudget cuts could come from areas where Congress has increased funding, \nsuch as missile defense, to pay the bill for these missions. This is \nfrom Pentagon officials. ``Congress increased Clinton's overall budget \nrequest by $7 billion in 1996. It is intuitive that any money above the \nPresident's request would be reprogrammed to pay for Bosnia,'' one \nsenior Pentagon official said on January 2.\n  That tells us two things. First of all, the $1.5 billion that the \nPresident says it will cost for the humanitarian exercise in Bosnia is \ngrossly understated. It could be up to $7 billion. The studies I have \nseen show it around $5 billion. I guess we not only are redirecting our \nmilitary to a new role and that new role is peacemaking, but we are \nalso going to pay for it with the dollars we would otherwise use to \ndefend America. This is wrong.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/25/senate-section/article/S365-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S368-S370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SENATE BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, tomorrow is the drop-dead date for \nCongress on how we will keep the Government going. In addition, the \ndeadline is fast approaching on honoring the full faith and the credit \nclause of the Constitution. I say not only to the people of this \ncountry but to people all over the world that we intend to honor the \ndebentures you hold, and we will pay you interest for helping us \nfinance our debt.\n  I have never really felt that when push came to shove, there would be \nany question about whether or not we would extend and raise the debt \nceiling. There still is not. I feel sure this will happen. If it does \nnot happen tomorrow, as it should, it will certainly happen by the last \nday of February. To do otherwise would be the height of \nirresponsibility. So I am not really worried about that, and I applaud \nsome of the comments I have seen by Mr. Armey and Speaker Gingrich on \nthat subject.\n  Now, tomorrow, as I understand it, the Senate will vote on a \ncontinuing resolution to keep the Government afloat until March 1. \nAlso, I understand that the continuing resolution will fund most of the \nprograms not covered by enacted appropriations bills at 75 percent of \nthe fiscal year 1995 funding level or the lower of the funding levels \nprovided by the fiscal year 1996 House or Senate appropriations bill, \nif that level exceeds the 75 percent funding level. However, programs \nfunded pursuant to the HUD-VA bill and State, Justice, Commerce bill, \nwill be funded at the levels provided in their conference reports.\n  Programs funded pursuant to the third bill on which we have a \nconference report, namely Interior, as I understand it, are going to be \nfunded instead as if the Interior bill did not have a conference \nreport. All the agencies funded in that bill will have to live on the \nlower of the House or Senate bill, or 75 percent of what they got in \n1995.\n  Mr. President, tomorrow when the debate on the continuing resolution \nbegins, I hope somebody will be able to tell me why we are treating the \nprograms funded by the Interior appropriations bill differently. I do \nnot like that. I see no reason not to treat Interior the same way we do \nHUD-VA, and State, Justice, Commerce.\n  Second, at some point tomorrow there is going to be a motion made by \nthe majority leader to adjourn the U.S. Senate until February 26. I can \ntell you categorically that I do not intend to vote for that motion. It \nis almost as unfathomable to me why we would leave here, with all this \nwork undone, until February 26, as it is why we want to shut the \nGovernment down all the time around here.\n  I have been here 21 years and things have happened here in the last 3 \nmonths that, in my opinion, are not only unfathomable and \nunexplainable, but inexcusable. We are supposed to be here to govern. \nWe are not supposed to be here making sure all 100 Senators and all 435 \nCongressmen, get their way. I think it was Longfellow who said one \ntime: ``You better be careful about what you pray for because you might \nget it.'' You have 100 Senators here and everybody is saying if I \ncannot have my way there will be no way. Governing is the art of \ncompromise. There are strong feelings on that side of the aisle and \nthis side of the aisle on hundreds of items.\n  I did not get my way on the space station or that sucker would have \nbeen dead a long time ago. One hundred billion dollars squandered. And \nwe say we need more money for education?\n  Congress has provided $7 billion more for the Defense Department than \nthe administration requested. ``We don't \n\n[[Page S369]]\nwant the extra 20 B-2's. It is true you only put $500 million in for 20 \nB-2's, but what is the total cost down the road? It is $30 billion. We \ndo not need them. We do not want them.'' Many times, when I used to \ncome out here if I was opposing something in the Defense bill, Members \non the other side of the aisle, who are prone to vote for every single \ndollar for defense no matter what it is, would say to me, ``You are \nopposed to this but the Secretary wants it, the President wants it, and \nall the Chiefs want it.'' So it would sail through here like a \nfirestorm.\n  Now I raise that issue with Members on the other side and I say: The \nPresident does not want it, the Secretary does not want it, and the \nChiefs do not want it. Why are you putting it in here? And they answer: \nWhat do they know? What do they know about building ships on a \nnoncompetitive basis? What do they know about 20 B-2 bombers that we \nsay they need and we do not care if they say they do not want them?\n  You see, if this were a perfect world and we had more money than we \nknew what to do with, I might not complain. Mr. President, 22 B-2 \nbombers and they would not dare fly one of them in Desert Storm for \nfear it would get shot down and that would kill the B-2 program, so \nthey just did not fly them. They would not even let a B-1 fly over in \nDesert Storm for fear it would get shot down.\n  Why am I concerned about that? Because I believe in balancing the \nbudget with compassion and with a concern for the future of the \ncountry.\n  When it comes to education, the people of this country have \ninvariably reported in the polls they would pay more taxes if their \nchildren got a better education. Some of us here labor in the vineyards \nof education. Some of us try to keep the National Endowment for the \nArts and the National Endowment for Humanities afloat because we \nbelieve culture is important. What has the majority done? They whack \nboth endowments by 40 percent. So if there happen to be a few children \naround who are interested in opera or drama or art or anything else, \nand they need a few bucks from the Federal Government--forget it. Then \nyou wonder why people act uncivilized. Why are people so rude? Most \npeople who are leaving here--and in record numbers--do not say it in \nthose words, but everybody knows that, perhaps not the principle \nreason, but one of the reasons is because civility no longer exists \nhere. What a tragedy.\n  So, what are we going to do to improve civilized conduct? Cut every \nsingle program that has as its intention to enhance the understanding \nof the importance of the culture of the Nation, the importance of \ncivilized conduct and civility, man-to-man, woman-to-woman, and so on.\n  They say the mining industry in this country can take billions of \ndollars' worth of gold, silver, platinum and palladium off lands that \nbelong to the taxpayers of this country and not pay one dime for it \nwhile we cut Medicare and Medicaid and education and the environment. \nCorporate welfare is too nice a name. I call it corporate ripoff.\n  I saw a report the other day, Mr. President, that said only 14 \npercent of the people in this country pay any attention to what is \ngoing on in Washington. That is the reason I can stand here and scream \nmy lungs out day in and day out about this mining law of 1872, where \nthe American mining industry has ripped this country off for billions \nand billions and continues to do so while we sit here and argue about \nhow much we are going to cut education and the National Endowments for \nthe Arts and the Humanities.\n  Mr. President, hundreds of millions of dollars were cut from \nenvironmental protection. A British philosopher once said there is \nnothing more impossible than undoing something that has already been \ndone. When you kill somebody you cannot bring him back to life. And \nwhen you rape and pillage the environment in a permanent way, you \ncannot bring it back.\n  What are we doing? We are cutting the legs right out from under the \npeople who enforce the environmental laws of this country, which over \nthe past 25 years have increased the ``swimmability'' and the \n``fishability'' of the lakes and rivers of this country. And there is \nnot a sober person in America who does not want to continue that.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to be supportive of the President. He \nmentioned just about everything in his State of the Union Address that \nI care anything about. I applaud his stand for saying we can balance \nthe budget without destroying everything we hold dear. We do not have \nto assault the elderly, we do not have to assault the poor, and we \ncertainly do not have to assault the children of this country in order \nto get a balanced budget.\n  If you made me king for 10 minutes, I will produce a balanced budget \nin 7 years that does not do any of those things. However, it now \nappears that the White House and the majority party may be in the \nprocess of agreeing on the inane, crazy idea of cutting taxes. I will \nsolve all of the problems of the balanced budget. You just give up on \nthat tax cut.\n  I would say both to the President and to the Speaker and the majority \nleader, if you absolutely insist on a tax cut, at least wait a year or \ntwo until this whole thing fleshes out and we find out. Is it going to \nwork? Once you put the tax cut in place, everybody knows you will not \never take it back.\n  So when you put the tax cut in place 7 years from now, CBO's estimate \nis that there will be $254 billion in savings to the Government just in \ninterest cuts alone. That may turn out to be zip, zero, nil. But the \n$200-plus billion in tax cuts is already gone.\n  So why does not the President or Senator Dole say, look, it is an \noxymoron to say we are going to cut taxes and balance the budget. We \ntried that, you know, back in 1981. What did we get out of it? We got a \n$4 trillion increase in the national debt. But people have forgotten. \nThe majority of the people in this body were not here in 1981 when we \ndid that. They do not remember, so I am reminding them.\n  I want it put on my epitaph that I was one of 11 U.S. Senators that \nvoted no on the proposal that claimed it would raise defense spending \nby 100 percent and cut taxes and balance the budget. People in Arkansas \nare taking a pretty big hit these days, but I can tell you one thing: \nPeople down there have enough sense to know that that one will not \nwork.\n  So, Mr. President, I look forward to tomorrow and what I hope will be \na civilized debate, an intelligent debate, and one that will say, do \nnot put the farm bill on this. That is a nonstarter. Pass a clean debt \nceiling bill. What we ought to do is adopt a clean continuing \nresolution to keep the Government going until March 1, and we ought to \npass a debt ceiling limit so that people in the world, not just in the \nUnited States--bear in mind, of the $5 trillion national debt, almost \n40 percent of it, a third of it, is held by foreigners.\n  The people in this country and the people in Congress may think this \nholding the debt ceiling hostage is cute and funny, but the Japanese \nand Germans do not think it is funny. When they hold a U.S. Government \nbond that is supposed to return them 6 percent interest, when it comes \ndue they want their 6 percent. They do not want all of this mickeying \naround about who is holding who hostage in the U.S. Congress. The very \nthought that we might falter in the payment of our interest on U.S. \nGovernment obligations is absolutely Byzantine.\n  Just to talk about things that have happened around here that you \nhave never seen before and hope to God you never see again, here is a \nfarm bill that the chairman of the Agriculture Committee in the House \ncould not even get out of his committee. He is chairman. His own \nRepublican membership reneged on him. It was brought up in the Senate \njust for talking purposes but not to be voted on, because everybody \nknew that it would be beaten soundly in the U.S. Senate. Called \n``Freedom to Farm,'' it never got out of the committee in the House, \nnever passed the House, never passed the Senate, never was even \nconsidered by the Senate Agriculture Committee, and they talk about \nputting that thing on the continuing resolution tomorrow?\n  The farmers of my State want something definitive so they can go to \nthe bank and borrow money and plant their rice and their soybeans. But \nthey do not want that sucker, and nobody else does either.\n  So why do we not extend existing law for 1 year and put the fears and \nthe apprehensions of the farmers of America at ease? \n\n[[Page S370]]\n\n  Mr. President, I am going to vote against the adjournment motion \nuntil some resolution of this farm program is made, and the rice \nfarmers of my State, who produce 40 percent of all of the rice in this \nNation, have some certainty. The first thing you know--as my colleague \nsaid in the press conference this morning, Senator Pryor--you keep \nmessing around so they cannot plant their rice, and the next thing you \nwill know we will lose all of our world markets for American rice. We \nhave squandered $1 to $1.5 billion mickeying around one-upping each \nother.\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me repeat. The people of the country \nlast year had a right to be angry. They were angry for all kinds of \ndifferent reasons. I will not presume to know precisely why everybody \nvoted the way they did. They were not voting for chaos. They were not \nvoting to see how much havoc we could create and impose on innocent \npeople. They wanted changes. They did not want to see the Government \ndismantled. They did not want to see the Government shut down and leave \nthe country defenseless, almost anarchistic.\n  So tomorrow I hope will be an interesting and enlightening and \nsensible debate. I hope when we leave here tomorrow night, if and when \nwe do, that we leave with a pretty good feeling that we finally have \nbegun to recognize each other's feelings about this and have finally \nbegun to get our act together and reassure the people of the country \nthat we are not really just a bunch of bickering children up here.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/25/senate-section/article/S368-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S370-S371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             NEW WORLD MINE\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, as everyone in this body knows I have \nbeen a vocal proponent of reforming the 1872 mining law. This 124-year-\nold anachronism continues to permit the extraction of billions of \ndollars' worth of hardrock minerals from public land without \ncompensating the taxpayers and in a manner that causes significant \nenvironmental degradation. Unfortunately, the new majority in Congress \nhas little or no interest in meaningful reform of the mining law.\n  During the congressional recess an article appeared in the New York \nTimes discussing the proposed New World gold mine which would be \nlocated within 2.5 miles of Yellowstone National Park. It is painfully \nobvious that unless action is taken soon, Yellowstone will be gravely \nimperiled. In fact, the World Heritage Commission recently designated \nYellowstone National Park a world heritage site in danger primarily due \nto the proposed mine.\n  Mr. President, some of my colleagues from the West argue that mining \nis a primary way of life in their States and any changes in the mining \nlaw that made it more difficult to pollute the land or provided for the \npayment of meaningful royalties would have a negative impact on their \nStates. However, as the New York Times article points out, their \nconstituents do not necessarily agree. In fact, much of the western \neconomy depends on pristine land, air, and water. Certain mining \noperations are not synonymous with such conditions, especially in the \nabsence of more stringent environmental restrictions.\n  The scars of previous mining operations are littered throughout the \ncountry. In fact, 59 sites on the Superfund national priority list are \ndirectly related to mining. According to the Bureau of Mines, there are \n180,000 acres of land and 12,000 miles of rivers that have been \npolluted by waste from abandoned mines. The cost to taxpayers to clean \nup this mess will be astronomical. Yet no one seems willing to do \nanything to prevent future disasters, such as the New World mine. Mr. \nPresident, I urge my colleagues to carefully consider what we may be \ndoing to our national treasures, such as Yellowstone Park, if we do not \nact.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a report that appeared in \nthe January 7 issue of the New York Times regarding the ``Montana \nMining Town Fights Gold-Rush Plan'' dealing with the gold mine that is \nabout to be built just outside the gates of Yellowstone, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 7, 1996]\n\n               Montana Mining Town Fights Gold-Rush Plan\n\n                           (By James Brooke)\n\n       Cooke City, MT.--From Canadian mining barons to President \n     Clinton to American environmentalists, the bitterest mining \n     controversy of recent months has swirled like an alpine \n     blizzard around this tiny mountain village of 80 people.\n       On one side, Canada's largest natural resources \n     conglomerate is determined to dig $750 million of gold and \n     silver out of a nearby 8,900-foot peak. On the other, \n     environmentalists assert that the mine would inevitably leak \n     acid into Yellowstone National Park, three miles to the west.\n       Often overlooked in the international clash of press \n     releases and lawsuits are the residents here who would be \n     affected. In a town founded by gold miners, one might expect \n     to find people enthusiastic about a plan to open the state's \n     largest gold mine on Henderson Mountain, a peak named after a \n     gold panner. But skepticism about the proposal is \n     surprisingly plentiful here, reflecting a growing hostility \n     to mining in Montana, a state that is shifting its economic \n     base from mining to tourism.\n       Even at the Miner's Saloon, amid mining decor of picks and \n     shovels, criticism is rife. ``I'm vehemently against it,'' \n     said Chris Warren, a 24-year-old resident, who was echoed by \n     the bartender and four men nursing drinks at the bar.\n       In dissent, the saloon keeper, Larry Wicker, said he \n     appreciated the younger generation's patronage, but not their \n     views on mining. ``If it weren't for the miners, Cooke City \n     would be part of little Russia,'' he said, referring to this \n     sliver of private land surrounded by Government land, \n     including Yellowstone and two national forests.\n       In a tribute to Montana's 19th century mining origins, the \n     state seal bears the motto, ``oro y plata,'' gold and silver. \n     But Montana's combined income from mining and logging was \n     surpassed in the early 1990's by recreational tourism--fly \n     fishing, elk hunting, snowmobiling, hiking, camping and river \n     rafting. Anglers alone spend $410 million a year in this \n     state.\n       The shifting political winds from this economic \n     transformation are buffeting the Henderson Mountain mine \n     project, which cannot proceed until it wins environmental \n     clearances from various state and Federal authorities. The \n     process could easily take two years or more.\n       On the far side of a mountain saddle here, the mining \n     company, Crown Butte Mines Inc., would hollow out Henderson \n     Mountain at the rate of 1,500 tons a day. Working at almost \n     9,000 feet, the miners would combat a forbidding climate that \n     includes 23 frost-free days a year and about 40 feet of \n     snowfall a year.\n       Crown Butte purchased the mining rights on the private land \n     after deciding that technological advances and new \n     discoveries would make mining profitable.\n       Environmentalists, pointing out Old Faithful geyser only 60 \n     miles to the southwest, said the proposed mining site is in \n     the nation's secondmost seismically active area after the San \n     Andreas Fault. They contend that an earthquake would rupture \n     a disposal site filled with potentially toxic waste from the \n     operation.\n       But Crown Butte Mines maintains that it would build a dam \n     strong enough to withstand any tremor of the magnitude \n     registered in the last 150 years. While mining advocates \n     often paint their environmental opponents as outsiders or \n     newcomers, polls indicate that Montana voters are \n     increasingly hostile to new mines and to economic growth, \n     especially if it means new residents.\n       In a poll of 817 registered voters conducted in December \n     for The Billings Gazette, 48 percent of the respondents said \n     that economic benefits would not outweigh possible \n     environmental damage from the project here, the New World \n     Mine. Only 29 percent favored the mine.\n       Montana, with a population of 850,000, has only six people \n     per square mile. But 31 percent of respondents called for no \n     more population growth, and 45 percent agreed with the \n     statement: ``We're approaching our limits.'' The poll's \n     margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage \n     points.\n       The dispute over the mine may heat up soon when the United \n     States Forest Service releases an environmental impact \n     statement.\n       In the six months leading up to this report, world \n     environmental attention focused on this remote mountain \n     village. A city in name only, Cooke has a one-room school and \n     a three-block-long Main Street that ends in a snowdrift half \n     the year.\n       On Aug. 25, President Clinton thundered over Cooke City's \n     proposed mine site in a military helicopter. Afterward, he \n     ordered a two-year ban on mining in the 4,500 acres of \n     National Forest land surrounding Henderson Mountain.\n       In September, the village visitors were members of the \n     World Heritage Committee, \n\n[[Page S371]]\n     which monitors sites designated by international treaty as having \n     ``universal value to mankind.'' Citing the mine project, \n     among other threats, the committee added Yellowstone to its \n     list of ``World Heritage in Danger.''\n       To drum up support, Crown Butte hired as a consultant Birch \n     Bayh, a former United States Senator with a record as an \n     environmentalist. The largest investor in Crown Butte is \n     Noranda Inc., Canada's largest natural resources company, \n     which is controlled by the Toronto financiers Edward and \n     Peter Bronfman.\n       The debate here speaks of larger tensions between mining \n     and recreation in the state. ``Mining is an anachronism now--\n     the town has become dependent on Yellowstone for its \n     livelihood,'' said Jim Barett, a local carpenter who is \n     chairman of the Beartooth Alliance, a local environmental \n     group that opposes the mine. ``To plop this huge industrial \n     complex into here would not only disrupt our lives, but would \n     have serious environmental consequences.''\n       Some people think the mine would mar tourism for a town \n     that has four campgrounds, three hunting outfitters, three \n     snowmobile rental companies and 15 hotels, motels and bed and \n     breakfasts. But at Joan and Bill's Family Restaurant on Main \n     Street, a patron, Lyle Hendricks, said the $100 million \n     mining investment would outweigh any harm to tourism. \n     ``People worry about the stress of losing a job when the mine \n     plays out in 20 years,'' said Mr. Hendricks, a bearded man \n     who builds steel Quonset huts here. ``What about the stress \n     of not having a job now?''\n       After Mr. Hendricks left, the waitress, Jennifer Mullee, \n     20, commented, ``In 10 years, the mining company will be \n     gone, and the land will be destroyed for our children.''\n       Opinion surveys of Montana adults indicate that women \n     oppose mining by far greater margins than men.\n       Mine supporters like the saloon keeper, Mr. Wicker, say \n     other mines have proved safe. In Jardine, Mont., he said, an \n     underground gold mine has burrowed to ``within yards'' of the \n     Yellowstone Park with no ill result.\n       A fifth generation Montanan and a mining engineer by \n     training, Mr. Wicker dismissed the mine's opponents as \n     ``flatlanders, people from Nebraska.'' ``Everyone who gets \n     here says, `I'm the last person here, I've got my little \n     piece of Montana,' '' said Mr. Wicker, who plans to open a \n     poker room and expand his saloon hours if the mine is \n     approved.\n       Cooke City is a far cry from the 19th century gold rush \n     days when 5,000 raucous miners packed the town.\n       For half the year, the only way to get to Cody, Wyo., the \n     nearest large city, about 40 miles away, is to travel by \n     snowmobile over Colter Pass. A year-round mining operation \n     would keep the road to Cody plowed.\n       Mining officials promise to leave local creek water cleaner \n     than when they found it. As a legacy of past mines, sections \n     of local streams still run rust red from acid drainage.\n       ``We can still use some of the money made from the mine to \n     clean up the area, to backfill the old mine sites,'' Joseph \n     J. Baylls, president of Crown Butte, said in a telephone \n     interview from Toronto. ``At the end of the day, it will be \n     better than today.''\n       But experience has left many Montanans skeptical of mining \n     companies. ``In 20 years, the town will boom and bust, just \n     like Butte,'' said Matt Schneider, the Mining Saloon's 22-\n     year-old antimining bartender.\n       Long fabled as ``The Richest Hill on Earth,'' the gold and \n     copper deposits of Butte, Mont., petered out in recents \n     decades, leaving a legacy of pollution and unemployment. The \n     Atlantic Richfield Company inherited much responsibility for \n     the environmental mess in 1983 when it bought the principal \n     Butte operator, the Anaconda Minerals Company.\n       In October, in a move that reflected Montana's tougher \n     stand towards mining companies, the State Justice Department \n     sent Arco a cleanup bill of $713 million.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Kansas is \nprepared, or does she need a little additional time to get ready?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I am ready to go and, rather than call \nfor a quorum, will get started on some comments that I would like to \nmake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  The Chair informs the Senator that there are 4 minutes remaining \nunder the control of the majority in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/25/senate-section/article/S370-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S371-S374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I would like to offer just a few \nobservations on comments that were made by President Clinton in his \nState of the Union speech the other evening regarding health insurance \nreform. I was pleased that President Clinton mentioned it, because I \nthink it is a subject of great importance to us.\n  As we debate the future of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, \nAmerican families are growing increasingly anxious about the \navailability, portability, and cost of their own private health \ncoverage.\n  While the comprehensive health reform debate ended well over a year \nago, the American people continue to rank health reform as a priority \nand health care as a top concern. A poll conducted late last year by \nPrinceton Survey Research Associates found that more Americans are \nconcerned about their own health coverage than crime, high taxes, the \n``political system,'' and the economy. Both the Princeton poll and a \nTimes Mirror poll also found that health care topped the list of issues \nAmericans most want the Presidential candidates to address.\n  The health insurance problem is not merely one of perception. The \nnumber of uninsured and underinsured Americans continues to climb:\n  First, there are now over 40 million Americans without health \ninsurance.\n  Second, over 1 million working Americans have lost health insurance \nin the last 2 years alone.\n  Third, and, over 80 million Americans have preexisting conditions \nthat could make it difficult for them to maintain health coverage when \nthey change jobs.\n  Mr. President, Congress has the opportunity this year to address \nmiddle-class Americans' concerns about the diminishing availability, \nportability, and affordability of health coverage in a bipartisan way.\n  A health insurance reform bill proposed by myself and Senator \nKennedy, S. 1028, passed the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee \nunanimously last August and now awaits action on the Senate Calendar. \nSimilar measures are pending in the House of Representatives, including \na companion bill introduced by Representative Roukema of New Jersey.\n  Through sensible, market-based reforms, the Health Insurance Reform \nAct would:\n  First, limit the ability of insurers and employers to impose \npreexisting condition exclusions;\n  Second, prevent insurers from dropping coverage when an individual \nchanges jobs or a family member becomes ill; and\n  Third, help small companies gain more purchasing clout in the market.\n  The General Accounting Office estimates that the Health Insurance \nReform Act would help at least 25 million Americans each year, and the \nCongressional Budget Office predicts that it would do so without any \ncost to American taxpayers.\n\n\n                   support for the health reform act\n\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act enjoys broad support. It passed the \nLabor and Human Resources by a 16 to 0 vote and has attracted 40 \ncosponsors--20 Republicans and 20 Democrats--from across the political \nspectrum. Moreover, it has been endorsed by a wide range of outside \norganizations, including the National Governors' Association, the \nNational Association of State Insurance Commissioners, the Consortium \nfor Citizens with Disabilities, Small Business United, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the \nAmerican Medical Association.\n  I believe the legislation has achieved broad consensus for two main \nreasons.\n  First, it is narrowly focused. It does not contain employer mandates, \nmandatory purchasing alliances, new taxes or new bureaucracies. It does \nnot remake the private health care system in the image of the United \nStates Post Office. Instead, the legislation focuses only on those \nareas where broad, bipartisan agreement existed during the health care \ndebate in the 104th Congress and where State insurance reforms have \ndemonstrated the ability to work.\n  Second, the legislation was crafted with significant input from \nconsumers, insurers, businesses, hospitals, and doctors. It is \ncarefully attuned to the rapidly changing private health care market. \nAs the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other employers said in a recent \nletter, the Health Insurance Reform Act would:\n\n     * * * improve health coverage for tens of millions of \n     American workers and their families * * * through carefully \n     designed rules that are workable for employers who \n     voluntarily sponsor health plans and for their employees.\n\n\n                          response to concerns\n\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act is not without some detractors. We \nhave worked closely with the health insurance industry, and insurers \ngenerally support the bill. For example, Blue-\n\n[[Page S372]]\nCross Blue-Shield and the Health Insurance Association of America \nsubmitted testimony in favor of the vast majority of the bill's \nprovisions. However, some continue to raise concerns about one \nprovision of the legislation that is designed to help individuals and \nfamilies who have played by the rules maintain health coverage if they \nlose their job or leave a job to work for an employer that does not \noffer coverage.\n  I believe, however, that this provision strikes a careful balance \nbetween the need to provide consumers some access to individual \ncoverage and the need to protect the fragile individual insurance \nmarket.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act would provide access to individual \ninsurance only for those who have maintained prior continuous coverage \nunder an employer-sponsored health plan for at least 1\\1/2\\ years, who \nhave exhausted their COBRA benefits, and who are ineligible for \ncoverage are under another group policy.\n  Moreover, S. 1028 contains no restrictions on premiums, and it leaves \nbroader reforms--such as guaranteed issue for individuals who have not \nhad prior coverage, guaranteed issue for the self-employed, and \nportability between individual health plans--to the States. As a \nresult, the bill requires individuals to pay into the system for years \nbefore being able to gain access to health coverage.\n  This group-to-individual portability provision is not far-reaching. \nIt is limited precisely to avoid potential premium increases and \nadverse selection problems that could result from broader individual \nmarket reforms. Testimony and analysis by the National Association of \nInsurance Commissioners and others has confirmed that this narrow \nprovision is unlikely to have a significant impact on the cost of \nhealth coverage in the individual market. The most recent estimates \nfrom the American Academy of Actuaries show that this provision would \nlikely affect premiums by only 2 to 3 percent.\n  It is true that some insurers who now thrive by refusing to cover \nthose in poor health may be unable to survive in a market characterized \nby competition based on quality, price, and service. In States like New \nHampshire, Vermont, and California that have enacted targeted insurance \nmarket reforms like those in the Health Insurance Reform Act, some \ninsurers have left the market--but others have replaced them, \ncompetition has flourished, rates have come down, and consumers have \nbenefited.\n  I do share the belief that State high-risk pools are one important \nway of providing access to insurance for certain individuals. That is \nwhy S. 1028 expressly provides that if a State has adopted, or adopts \nin the future, a high-risk pool or other means of allowing individuals \nto maintain health coverage, that State law or program will apply in \nlieu of the group-to-individual portability provision contained in the \nbill. Instead of preempting State reforms that are working or \nprescribing a one-size-fits-all solution from Washington, S. 1028 \nallows each State to fashion individual market solutions that are \nappropriate for individuals in that State. This is one of the main \nreasons that both the NGA and the NAIC support the bill.\n  Another argument that is sometimes made is that insurance reform \nshould be left entirely to the States. This argument also ignores \nreality.\n  While 48 States have enacted insurance reforms targeted to small \ncompanies, over 70 percent of workers with health coverage work for \nfirms with more than 100 employees. Moreover, the States are prevented \nby the broad preemption provisions of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act from providing portability to workers who receive health \nbenefits through self-insured, employer-sponsored health plans. I \nbelieve strongly that we should retain ERISA preemption. But as we do, \nwe must recognized that the vast majority of American workers cannot \ncarry their insurance from one job to the next unless we enact \nportability reforms on the Federal level.\n\n\n                       it is time to move forward\n\n  Mr. President, I think we all know people in our own States who would \nbe helped tremendously by this legislation. For nearly a decade, \nhowever, Congress has been unsuccessful in attempts to pass health \ninsurance reform legislation. We now have a historic opportunity to \nmove forward. And I believe we should seize that opportunity.\n  Last Congress, Republicans and the American people rejected the \nadministration's comprehensive health reform proposal. Instead, every \none of us signed onto market-based health reform legislation that was \nmore ambitious in almost every respect than the Health Insurance Reform \nAct.\n  Now, the President of the United States has endorsed our approach. \nAnd Senator Kennedy and other Democrats should be commended for working \nwith us to make positive change a realty, without letting the perfect \nbecome the enemy of the good.\n  While the political dynamic clearly has changed, I believe strongly \nthat Republicans' commitment to moving forward with common sense, \nmarket-based health reform legislation should not.\n  I want to make clear to all of my colleagues that I, for one, am \nabsolutely committed to passing health insurance reform legislation \nthis year--either as a freestanding bill or as an amendment to another \nvehicle.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act does not strike out in a bold, new \ndirection. But it is a very positive step forward that will reduce \nbarriers to health coverage for millions of working Americans. It is \nalso an opportunity to demonstrate to the American people that \nRepublicans and Democrats can work together to address their most \nserious concerns about the health care system. I believe we should \nstart by passing this legislation at the earliest possible opportunity.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  I again congratulate Senator Kassebaum for her leadership on this \nextremely important issue which can make an extraordinary difference to \nthe quality of life of millions of Americans who are, as she described, \nplaying by the rules, working hard, trying to participate in the \nworkplace, and also trying to fulfill some of their hopes and dreams \nfor the future.\n  As Senator Kassebaum has pointed out, our committee, as well as other \ncommittees, dealt with the broad issue of health care for all Americans \nin the last Congress. We were unable to pass that legislation. But \nduring the consideration of our committee, we had some 10 days of \nmarkup, which virtually every Member, Democrat and Republican, \nattended. Those were long days which began early in the morning, at 8 \nor 9 o'clock, and went sometimes until 8 to 10 in the evening with \nbrief recesses. Our committee delved into the various features of the \nhealth care debate. I thought we reached some important agreements on a \nnumber of those different measures, but there were areas of difference \nand we were unable to secure the kind of comprehensive coverage which I \nbasically support. At some other time, hopefully, we will have another \nchance to address it.\n  During that period of time, Senator Kassebaum provided great \nleadership by expressing her concern and also her commitment to try to \naddress one of the particular challenges in health care coverage that \nremains out there and works such an extraordinary hardship on millions \nof Americans--lack of guaranteed health insurance.\n  Millions of working Americans develop some preexisting condition and, \nunder the current system, often are individually dropped from their \nhealth insurance. Or if they are working in a small company, the \ncompany's health care costs go up enormously if they try to maintain \ntheir coverage, or otherwise all of the members, through no fault of \ntheir own or no fault of this individual, lose that coverage.\n  Or the individual who works hard and has an opportunity to obtain a \njob, maybe move up on the economic ladder, faces a circumstance where \nthe new opportunity will not provide health care coverage. This \nindividual is effectively in a position of job lock and is denied that \nopportunity again because of some preexisting condition or some ailment \nor some disability which is no fault of their own.\n  As the Senator from Kansas has pointed out, those individuals exist \nin the small towns and communities, rural areas, as well as cities in \nher own State of Kansas. And they exist in my State of Massachusetts. \n\n[[Page S373]]\n\n  Throughout this last year, very quietly, conscientiously, and \ndeliberately, Senator Kassebaum reached out, as she mentioned, to the \nconsumers, to the health care profession, to the business community, to \nothers, including the insurance industry, to try and fashion \nlegislation that could address one of the most egregious and serious \naspects of the health care crisis that we are facing.\n  After a very thorough examination of this issue and listening to a \nbroad range of interested individuals, as well as different groups, she \nfashioned this legislation, and I enjoyed the opportunity to work \nclosely with her and her staff to introduce this legislation. This \nlegislation takes into consideration a number of the points that were \nraised during the course of the hearings and a number of points that \nwere raised by Members of our committee. Then, in really a very special \nway, Senator Kassebaum was able to gain virtually the unanimous consent \nof all of the members of the committee, all 16 members of our Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee supported that legislation.\n  When we look today at some of the divisiveness which exists in the \ncourse of our legislative agenda, it always continues to impress me \nabout the willingness of those members and the various groups that they \nrepresent to come together to try and address something which has such \nimportant meaning to millions of our fellow citizens. And that is what \nwas done. The best of the ideas that were raised and the hearings were \nincorporated, some of the concerns were addressed, and out of the \nlegislative process came an even stronger bill than was even introduced \nby Senator Kassebaum and myself. And this legislation has been reported \nout of committee and has been on the agenda for some period of time \nnow.\n  During the course of many months we have had the opportunity to talk, \nand talk together, about what the possibilities were of getting to \npresent this to the Senate, to urge our colleagues to support this, as \nwell as to try to get our friends and colleagues in the House to \naddress this issue. And the time is moving along.\n  We are not here today to try and point the finger at individuals or \ngroups or constituencies that have resisted the opportunities to bring \nthis up and consider the legislation. But what we are basically \nindicating today is that the kind of response we have all received on \nthis issue is Republican and Democrat alike. The 40 cosponsors reflect \n20 Democrats and 20 Republicans with wide, diverse, different \nphilosophical viewpoints. When we are able to gain that kind of \nconfidence from our colleagues after they have had a chance to study \nthe legislation, it is worthwhile for this body to consider the \nlegislation, to consider any amendments that are directed toward the \nlegislation, and then to move the process forward.\n  I hope that we would have that opportunity in a timely way. I think \nthose of us who have supported the legislation believe that even though \nthere may be differences with Members on different items that are not \ndirectly related to this, that we can as an institution address this \nand see a successful conclusion of the legislation.\n\n  This is a modest program but a very important one. I underline both \nthose words. It does not do the comprehensive job that many of us would \nlike to do, but it will make an enormous difference in the quality of \nlife for millions--and I mean millions--of young and old alike. This \nlegislation will enable more people to live a life in our society where \nthey participate and pay their fair share of premiums for their \ncoverage in exchange for at least some degree of security in knowing \nthat they will have health insurance to provide some protection against \nfinancial devastation.\n  In terms of their health care situation, they will still, as \nindividuals, endure the anguish and the pain that comes from many \nphysical and mental challenges which they may face. They will have that \nfor the rest of their lives. We cannot pass any legislation to deal \nwith that. But with this legislation, they will know that they will be \nable to at least obtain decent, quality health care and that they will \nnot put in debt the members of their families and their loved ones with \nthe extraordinary kinds of costs that may be attendant to the treatment \nof some of the illness and sickness.\n  That kind of relief from the anxiety and the anguish for our fellow \ncitizens is enormously important. It does not show up on the bottom \nline of the expenditure column. But what it does do is it makes an \nextraordinary difference to our fellow citizens.\n  So, Mr. President, I welcome the opportunity to join with Senator \nKassebaum and urge that we consider this legislation. I know from \ntalking with her that we are prepared to do this in a timely way. We \ncan enter into various agreements so that individuals who have special \ninterests or concerns can make sure that they have a full opportunity \nfor debate and consideration of these views, and then let the Senate \nwork its will.\n  This is an extraordinary piece of legislation which includes the \nsupport of the chamber of commerce, the National Small Business United, \nthe National Association of Manufacturers, the ERISA Industry \nCommittee, the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans, and \nthe National Governors' Association, the National Association of State \nInsurance Commissioners, the insurance companies in the Alliance for \nManaged Care, the American Medical Association, and the Consortium for \nCitizens with Disabilities. In fact, the only opposition comes from \nthose who really profit from the abuses in the current system.\n  So, Mr. President, in the State of the Union Address, the President \nchallenged Congress to pass this legislation. We are aware that there \nare some Senators who place these, what we call, ``holds'' on a bill in \nan attempt to kill it. They know if the legislation is brought to the \nfloor of the Senate, it will pass overwhelmingly.\n  The only thing blocking action is the scheduling of the floor debate. \nSo I join Senator Kassebaum in urging our leader to bring this to the \nfloor. We welcome the opportunity to cooperate with him. With his \nresponsibilities as the majority leader in scheduling different \nmeasures, we are glad to work out whatever agreement that is necessary. \nWe are glad to speak to our colleagues. But we do think that it is time \nthat we address this legislation. It is time to break the logjam. The \nAmerican people deserve action, and they deserve it now.\n  Just finally, Mr. President--and then I will yield what remaining \ntime we have on this side to the Senator from Texas--I hope that we \nmight be able, as Senator Kassebaum has stated previously, to consider \nthis legislation in a forum where we can have the focus and attention \non this legislation.\n  The majority leader was extremely gracious in working out our job \ntraining program, which basically reorganizes the total training \nprograms, involving billions and billions of dollars, and provides a \nreduction in total funding. But we worked that out in a matter of just \nhours, again, in a strong bipartisan way, after reporting the \nlegislation out of our committee. I believe that in somewhat less than \n8 or 10 hours, we were able to consider a few amendments and then take \naction.\n  With the kind of support we have for this, I think we can do it in a \nsimilar timeframe, although we are not interested in cutting off any \nlegislation. But I hope that if we are not able to work that through, \nat least we would have an opportunity to raise this issue in the \nforeseeable future, if not as an independent measure, at least as an \namendment to another piece of legislation. I agree with Senator \nKassebaum that that would be a less desirable way to proceed, but I \nthink we may be forced into that kind of situation.\n  This year Congress has the opportunity to end many of the most \nserious health insurance abuses that victimize millions of Americans \nevery year. It is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss.\n  These abuses create endless unnecessary suffering. Millions of \nAmericans are forced to pass up opportunities to accept jobs that would \nimprove their standard of living or offer them greater opportunities \nbecause they are afraid they will lose their health insurance if they \nleave their current jobs. Many others have to abandon the goal of \nstarting their own business, because insurance will be unavailable or \nunaffordable. Still others lose their health insurance because they \nbecome sick, or lose their job, or change their job--even when they \nhave faithfully \n\n[[Page S374]]\npaid their insurance premiums for many years.\n  The private health insurance market in the United States is deeply \nflawed. More than half of all insurance policies impose exclusions for \npreexisting conditions. As a result, insurance is often denied for the \nvery illnesses most likely to require medical care. The purpose of such \nexclusions is reasonable--to prevent people from gaming the system by \npurchasing coverage only when they get sick. But current practices are \nindefensible. No matter how faithfully people pay their premiums, they \noften have to start again with a new exclusion period if they change \njobs or lose their coverage.\n  Eighty-one million Americans have conditions that could subject them \nto such exclusions if they lose their current coverage. Sometimes, the \nexclusions make them completely uninsurable.\n  Not only do insurers impose exclusions for preexisting conditions on \npeople who do not deserve to be excluded from the coverage they need, \nthey can deny coverage to entire firms if one employee of the firm is \nin poor health. Sometimes, entire categories of businesses, with \nmillions of employees, are redlined out of coverage. Even if a firm is \nin an acceptable category, coverage may be denied if someone in the \nfirm--or a member of their family--is in poor health.\n  Even if people are fortunate enough to gain coverage and have no \npreexisting condition, their coverage can be canceled if they have the \nmisfortune to become sick--even after paying premiums for years.\n  One consequence of the current system is job lock. Workers who want \nto change jobs to improve their careers or provide a better standard of \nliving for their families must give up the opportunity because it means \nlosing their health insurance. A quarter of all American workers say \nthey are forced to stay in a job they otherwise would have left, \nbecause they are afraid of losing their health insurance.\n  I am proud to have joined Senator Kassebaum in introducing \nlegislation that will address these problems effectively. The \nKassebaum-Kennedy Health Insurance Reform Act is a health insurance \nbill of rights for every American and for every business as well.\n  The legislation contains many of the provisions from the 1994 health \nreform debate which received broad bipartisan support--such as \nincreased access to health insurance, increased portability, protection \nof health benefits for those who lose their jobs or want to start their \nown business, and greater purchasing power for individuals and small \nbusinesses.\n  Those who have insurance deserve the security of knowing that their \ncoverage cannot be canceled, especially when they need it the most. \nThey deserve the security of knowing that, if they pay their insurance \npremiums for years, they cannot be denied coverage or be subjected to a \nnew exclusion for a preexisting condition because they change jobs and \njoin another group policy, or because they need to purchase coverage in \nthe individual market. Business--especially small businesses--deserve \nthe right to purchase health insurance for their employees at a \nreasonable price.\n  Our Health Insurance Reform Act addresses these fundamental flaws in \nthe private insurance system. The bill limits the ability of insurance \ncompanies to impose exclusions for preexisting conditions. Under the \nlegislation, no such exclusion can last for more than 12 months. Once \nsomeone has been covered for 12 months, no new exclusion can be imposed \nas long as there is no gap in coverage--even if someone changes jobs, \nloses their job, or changes insurance companies.\n  The bill requires insurers to sell and renew group health policies \nfor all employers who want coverage for their employees. It guarantees \nrenewability of individual policies. it prohibits insurers from denying \ninsurance to those moving from group coverage to individual coverage. \nIt prohibits group health plans from excluding any employee based on \nhealth status.\n  The portability provisions of the bill mean that individuals with \ncoverage under a group health plan will not be locked into their job \nfor fear that they will be denied coverage or face a new exclusive for \na preexisting condition. The portability provisions will benefit at \nleast 25 million Americans annually, according to the General \nAccounting Office. In addition, these provisions will provide greater \nsecurity for the 131 million Americans currently covered under group \nhealth plans.\n  The bill will also help small businesses provide better and less \nexpensive coverage for their employees. Purchasing cooperatives will \nenable small groups and individuals to join together to negotiate \nbetter rates in the market. As a result, they can obtain the kind of \nclout in the marketplace currently available only to large employers.\n  The bill also provides great flexibility for States to meet the \nobjective of access to affordable health care for individuals who leave \ntheir group health plans.\n  During the debate on health reform in the last Congress, even the \nopponents of comprehensive reform urged Congress to pass at least the \nreforms that everyone supported--portability of coverage, guaranteed \navailability of coverage, and limitations on exclusion for preexisting \nconditions. These are exactly the provisions included in this bill.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act is a modest, responsible, bipartisan \nsolution to many of the most obvious abuses in the health insurance \nmarket place today. The bill was approved by the Senate Labor and Human \nResources Committee last August by a unanimous vote of 16 to 0. It is \nnow cosponsored by 40 Senators--20 Republicans and 20 Democrats. It is \nsimilar to proposals made by President Clinton in his recent balanced \nbudget plan.\n  The measures it includes are also virtually identical to provisions \nof legislation offered by Senator Dole in the last Congress. Sponsors \nrange from the most conservative Members of the Senate to the most \nliberal--because these reforms represent simple justice. They are not \nissues of ideology or partisanship.\n  Support for the bill by outside groups is equally broad. Those who \nhave expressed their support for the legislation include the Chamber of \nCommerce, National Small Business United, the National Association of \nManufacturers, the ERISA Industry Committee, the Association of Private \nPension and Welfare Plans, the National Governors' Association, the \nNational Association of State Insurance Commissioners, the insurance \ncompanies in the Alliance for Managed Care, the American Medical \nAssociation, and the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities.\n  In fact, the only opposition to this legislation comes from those who \nprofit from the abuses in the current system.\n  In his State of the Union address, President Clinton challenged \nCongress to pass this bill. A few Senators have placed secret holds on \nthe bill in an attempt to kill it. They know that if the legislation is \nbrought to the floor of the Senate, it will pass overwhelmingly. The \nonly thing blocking action is the scheduling of the floor debate.\n  So I join Senator Kassebaum in urging Majority Leader Dole to bring \nthis bill to the floor. It is time to break the log jam. The American \npeople deserve action--and they deserve it now.\n  Mr. President, I yield whatever time remains to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/25/senate-section/article/S371-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S374-S376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor yielding the rest of his time, because I want to talk about the \nvery important issue that I think all Americans are looking at right \nnow, and that is the balanced budget and what is going to happen here \nand what will be the result after we finish the negotiations.\n  The great philosopher, Yogi Berra, once said, ``When you come to a \nfork in the road, take it.''\n  We are at a fork in the road in this country, and I think the \nAmerican people are beginning to see how very difficult it is when you \nhave a President and Congress on very different tracks, on very \ndifferent tracks about what they believe is the right course for our \ncountry.\n  We in Congress believe that we must change the direction of our \ncountry, \n\n[[Page S375]]\nthat we have been hurling, in deficits upon deficits upon deficits, our \neconomy into oblivion.\n  So we promised in 1994 that we would change the way they do business \nin Washington, that we would stand firm for a balanced budget. And now \nwe have put forward a very responsible plan to do exactly that.\n  Our balanced budget is over 7 years. Many of us go around the country \ntalking about 7 years. Why 7 years? Why not 5 years? Why not 10 years? \nWould it be easier if it were 10 years?\n  Seven years is very important, because 7 years was what we reasonably \nbelieved we could achieve with numbers that we could estimate with a \nprediction that would be reasonable. We believe that we can predict \nover 7 years. Any more than that would be very hard.\n  There will be changes in Congress. Will there be the same commitment? \nWill the promises be the same? Those would be the questions if we went \nbeyond 7 years.\n  Why not shorter? Why not 5 years? We believed that cutting spending \nand cutting the rate of growth of spending in such a drastic way might \nhurt our economy by causing a recession, having some sort of drastic \nimpact. That is why we believed 7 years was achievable by slowing the \nrate of growth rather than cutting spending in such a harsh way that we \nmight have a recession, but yet to be predictable. That is why 7 years.\n  Now we have the nugget of the problem. The nugget of the problem is \nwhat we are going to do with Medicare, Medicaid, welfare reform, and \nthe tax cuts. I think you have heard people speaking on the floor in \nboth Chambers of the Congress for the last few days about the tax cuts. \nSome people think they are terrible. Some people think it is awful to \nconsider giving money back to the people who earned it. I do not \nsubscribe to that theory, but it is one of the nuggets upon which the \nPresident and the Republicans in Congress disagree. So let us talk \nabout these nuggets.\n  The President says we can come together on the numbers if we can just \nput aside welfare reform, Medicaid reform, and Medicare reform. I think \nthe President of the United States knows that if you put aside those \nthree items, you are not going to be able to talk about taking the \nfirst step to a balanced budget, because if you do not reform the two \nbasic entitlements, Medicaid and welfare, you will not have a balanced \nbudget.\n  It is not a matter of how much we spend, it is a matter of who makes \nthe decisions. Is it going to be the Federal Government dictating to \nthe States, or is it going to be the State's right to decide what is \nbest for the people of that State and to have the money from the \nFederal Government without the strings so they can do it more \nefficiently? That is the only way it will work.\n  But the President believes that we must keep welfare and Medicaid \nwith the Federal strings. He will not allow entitlement reform, and \nthat is the crux of the disagreement between the President and \nCongress. We cannot set those things aside and have any predictability. \nSo we are saying, give Medicaid to the States to produce their own \nprograms in the most efficient way, and we are giving the President the \nability to change our welfare system in a most responsible and unique \nway. And that is to turn it back to the States with very few strings, \nand the strings are that there will be limitations on how long an able-\nbodied person can receive welfare. It would be 18 months and a lifetime \nlimitation of 5 years.\n\n  I know a number of people who are barely making ends meet. It is very \nimportant for these hard-working, taxpaying citizens to know that if \nthey are going to work hard to do something for their families that \nthey are not supporting people who can work but do not. Mr. President, \nthat is the welfare reform package.\n  The President vetoed our welfare reform package, but we have not seen \na substitute from the President. If he is going to take off the table \nthat we would have entitlement reform, then we will not be able to have \nwelfare reform because it will continue to grow out of control, just as \nit has for years in this country.\n  Tax cuts--that is the other major issue, that and Medicare reform. \nLet us talk about Medicare reform because that is the third piece of \nthe reform package. We are trying to save the Medicare system. The \nPresident's own Cabinet officers have said publicly we start this year \ngoing into a deficit in our Medicare system. This year we will spend \nmore than we take in, and we will use up the trust fund by the year \n2002. Now, that is the fact.\n  So what can we do to save it? In fact, we are slowing the rate of \ngrowth of Medicare at an even slower rate of growth than the President \npresented himself in his own health care plan. We are going to save the \nMedicare system if the President will work with us. So far, he has \nrefused to do that.\n  Now let us talk about tax cuts, the other issue upon which we \ndisagree so strongly.\n  I think it is a legitimate question, why tax cuts when we are trying \nto bring down the deficit? It is all part of the package that would \nease the impact on the economy. If we are going to slow the rate of \ngrowth of spending, that is going to have an impact on the economy. It \nis going to stop spending in some areas to which people have become \naccustomed. People who provide these services are going to get less.\n  So in order to ease that transition, we have decided to put money \nback in the system, not by more Government programs but by giving \npeople back the money that they earned. We are letting them have the \nright to spend their money. And by allowing them to do that, we will \nspur the economy, where we have slowed it down in the slowing of the \nrate of spending. So we now have tax cuts that will go to the middle-\nincome families of this country--a $500 per child tax credit. So a \nfour-person family with two adults and two children will get $1,000 \nback in the mail. Now, that is going to help them be able to spend that \nmoney for their families.\n\n  Capital gains tax relief. We are trying to spur the economy by \nallowing people to sell assets and trade assets, and that is going to \nput more money into the economy. All of the economists agree on that. \nIt will put money and investment into our capital, so that we will be \nable to have the jobs that that will create. We are going to spur jobs \nby having capital gains tax relief.\n  The third area is one that I have worked on since I came to the U.S. \nSenate, and that is equity for our homemakers in this country for their \nretirement security. We talk about the importance of the work done \ninside the home. Mr. President, I think the work done inside the home \nis more important than the work done outside the home. Yet, we say to a \nhomemaker, ``You cannot set aside $2,000 a year like those who work \noutside the home are able to do.'' So the homemaker, who is sacrificing \nto stay home and raise children will have the added disadvantage of not \nhaving the security in retirement that can be built up with the full \n$2,000 set aside; or if the homemaker loses his or her spouse after 15 \nor 20 years of marriage, there he or she is without that security in \nhis or her own name that would allow that security to be there for \ntheir futures.\n  Mr. President, that is why we have tax cuts, so that we can provide \nmore of an incentive for people to save. We have a new IRA that would \napply to homemakers, as well as those who work outside the home, so \nthey could put money aside that will build up tax free, and when you \ntake it out, you will not have to pay taxes on any of that income. Now, \nthat will be a spur for retirement security for our seniors. When you \nput that incentive in, now you are going to have the ability for people \nto take care of themselves better in their retirement years. Mr. \nPresident, that will make for a more stable America.\n  So we are fighting for a strong and stable America. We are really \nfighting for what made this country strong in the first place. Strong \nfamilies built this country. If we are able to give tax breaks to \nfamilies and more incentives to save for retirement security, that is \ngoing to strengthen the American family. That is one of the good \nresults of tax cuts and allowing people to spend more of their own \nmoney.\n\n  So, Mr. President, we are at a fork in the road and we have a choice. \nWe are standing for getting this country back on the right road so that \nwe will have a strong America and the opportunity that a strong America \nwill give for our children. \n\n[[Page S376]]\n\n  Mr. President, that is what the budget fight is about. That is why it \nhas been so difficult, because our vision for the future of our country \nmay be the same as the President's vision, but our ways of getting \nthere differ greatly.\n  We believe that the only way we can make our country strong again is \nto stand firm for a 7-year balanced budget, with help for our families, \ngiving incentives to people to save and invest, and giving people back \nthe money they worked so hard for. Mr. President, we are standing for \nthe hard-working, taxpaying, middle-class people of this country that \ndeserve a break, and we are trying to give it to them. That is what \nthis impasse is all about.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I ask unanimous consent that I may be permitted to \nproceed for 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/25/senate-section/article/S374-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S376-S377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE ``NORTH CAPE'' OILSPILL\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, last Friday, January 19, the barge North \nCape ran aground on a sandbar off the coast of my home State of Rhode \nIsland. It is estimated that more than 800,000 gallons of No. 2 diesel \nheating oil aboard the barge spilled into Block Island Sound, making \nthis the worst oilspill in Rhode Island's history.\n  Alarmingly, the North Cape is grounded 100 yards offshore of the \nTrustom Pond National Wildlife Refuge, an area set aside as an \ninviolate sanctuary for migratory birds. So far, oil has penetrated \nsalt ponds in the refuge, and along the southern coast, including Point \nJudith Pond, an important spawning area for winter flounder. The \nspill's effect may continue to have adverse impacts on fish and \nwildlife now that oil has entered the natural food chain in the area.\n  The cost to my State's environment and economy will be steep. \nAlready, more than 11,000 lobsters have been killed by the spilled oil. \nTheir carcasses, and those of clams, starfish, and other sea creatures, \nlitter southern Rhode Island beaches. The Fish and Wildlife Service has \ncollected over 300 oil-logged birds, of which more than 100 are dead, \nand 1 dead seal. Sadly, volunteers keep bringing in more casualties.\n  Because Rhode Island relies heavily on its coastal resources, the \nfinancial toll of the spill is heavy. Governor Almond has declared a \nstate of emergency and has requested Federal disaster relief. According \nto Timothy Keeney, director of the Rhode Island Department of \nEnvironmental Management, damage to marine industries ultimately could \nrun into the tens of millions of dollars.\n  I wish I could say that Rhode Island is a stranger to oilspills. \nUnfortunately, as recently as 1989, the World Prodigy oil tanker ran \naground on Brenton Reef and leaked 420,000 gallons of oil into \nNarragansett Bay. And there have been a number of other spills over the \nyears.\n  A constant theme in these crises has been the generosity and \nsacrifice demonstrated in the response of Rhode Islanders. Their \nresponse to the current spill is no exception. Volunteers--as many as \n500 a day--have been pitching in energetically: bathing waterfowl, \ncleaning beaches, donating paper towels. It is inspiring to see \nindividuals band together in an effort to combat a potential \nenvironmental disaster.\n  In addition, local environmental and emergency-preparedness officials \nhave dropped everything. Federal workers are giving their all. My hat \nis off to these Government workers; people like Joe Dowhan and Paul \nCasey of the Fish and Wildlife Service, and Charlie Hebert, our Rhode \nIsland Refuge Manager, who spent the first 36 hours of the crisis on \nhis feet. Our State owes a debt of gratitude to all who have rolled up \ntheir sleeves.\n  While the willingness of Rhode Islanders to respond to this spill has \nbeen the same as in years past, one thing is different this time \naround. That is the fact that there is in existence comprehensive \nFederal oilspill legislation, the Oil Pollution Act, which Congress \nenacted in 1990. While many questions remain to be answered about why \nthe North Cape spill occurred, the provisions of OPA 90 ensured that \nadvance planning had been undertaken to expedite the response to the \ndisaster. The law will also ensure that parties injured by the spill \nwill receive compensation.\n  OPA 90 established a new national planning and response system to \nprovide for more expeditious and well-organized responses to oilspills \nwherever and whenever they might occur. The system relies on a host of \ngroups of experts and agency officials at numerous levels, including a \nNational Response Unit, Coast Guard strike teams, 10 Coast Guard \ndistrict response groups, and area committees. This structure ensures \nthat battle stations are manned with alacrity. The immediate deployment \nof booms and other barriers along the south county shoreline, to keep \nthe oil from contaminating fragile habitat, speaks to the wisdom of \nhaving such a response system in place at all times.\n  Furthermore, OPA 90 is designed to make sure that the polluter pays. \nIn the case of the North Cape, its owner, Eklof Marine, based in Staten \nIsland, has laudably come forward to accept responsibility for this \naccident. The company has provided ships, manpower, and other resources \nto assist in the cleanup.\n  As for the fishermen and others whose livelihood and property have \nbeen harmed by the oil, OPA 90 entitles them to compensation for their \neconomic losses. The act mandates that a vessel that discharges oil is \nliable for the costs of the ensuing cleanup and damages, including \nthose caused by loss of profits or impairment of earning capacity.\n  The act also provides that the Government, acting as public trustee \nfor injured natural resources, may seek damages to restore the \nresources. This means that damages would be available to restore the \nfish and wildlife in Rhode Island's sensitive coastal areas, including \nhabitat within the national wildlife refuge.\n  OPA 90 establishes four other categories of damages for which \ncompensation is provided:\n  First, owners of real or personal property may seek damages for any \neconomic loss arising from destruction of their property.\n  Second, a person who relies on injured natural resources for \nsubsistence may seek damages for injury to those resources.\n  Third, the Government may seek damages for loss of tax revenue \nresulting from the spill.\n  Fourth, the Government may seek damages for net costs of providing \nadditional public services necessary during or after cleanup of the \nspill.\n  Moreover, OPA 90 requires vessel owners to demonstrate evidence of \nfinancial responsibility at least up to the amount of a statutory \nliability cap--in the case of the North Cape, $10 million. Should \nclaims be denied or left unsatisfied by the responsible party, OPA \nexpanded the list of items for which compensation may be sought from \nthe Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. The fund currently contains more \nthan $1 billion. In contrast, the former Clean Water Act Fund \ndesignated for oilspill cleanup was nearly bankrupt at the time of the \nWorld Prodigy spill. The current fund thus acts as a real safety net \nthat helps guarantee payment of all damages arising from a spill.\n  Stepping back for a moment, the oilspill in Rhode Island is a perfect \nexample of the need for strong environmental regulations. Thank \ngoodness for OPA 90. Without it, the State and Federal Government would \nhave been ill-prepared to cope with an oilspill of this magnitude, \ntaking place in such rough weather conditions. Without it, Fish and \nWildlife Service officials charged with the care of fragile waterfowl \nhabitat would see many of their hard-won gains eroded, possibly for \ngood. Without it, the lobster fishermen of southern New England would \nbe robbed of their livelihood.\n  Just this week, the Washington Post reported on the results of a \nsurvey just completed by Republican pollster Linda DiVall, which--once \nagain, I should emphasize--found strong, bipartisan backing nationwide \nfor Federal laws that protect the environment. Ms. DiVall concluded \nthat, ``Attacking the Environmental Protection Agency is a \nnonstarter.'' We should be emphasizing the safeguarding of reasonable \nand balanced environmental protection done in a more efficient manner.\n  Just about everyone in Rhode Island--and, indeed, anyone who has \n\n[[Page S377]]\n  viewed the oily sheen covering Rhode Island waters on the nightly \ntelevision news--would say that Ms. DiVall has it just right.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/25/senate-section/article/S376-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. McCathran, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/25/senate-section/article/S377-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION FOR FISCAL YEAR 1994--\n                   MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 112\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with section 308 of Public Law 97-449 (49 U.S.C. \n308(a)), I transmit herewith the Annual Report of the Department of \nTransportation, which covers fiscal year 1994.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend title 18 of the United States to prevent \neconomic espionage and to provide for the protection of United States \nproprietary economic information in interstate and foreign commerce, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n     the economic espionage and protection of proprietary economic \n                        information act of 1995\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, when France, Germany, Japan, and South \nKorea are included in a list of nations, we automatically assume that \nthis must be a list of America's allies--our military and political \npartners since the end of the Second World War. Unfortunately, this is \nnot only a list of America's trustworthy friends, it is also a list of \ngovernments that have systematically practiced economic espionage \nagainst American companies in the past--and continue to do so to this \nday.\n  The term ``espionage'' evokes images of the cloak-and-dagger side of \nthe United States-Soviet confrontation in the cold war. Since the end \nof the East-West struggle, however, an equally damaging and pervasive \nform of spying has received increasing attention--the spying that \nnations undertake against foreign-owned corporations in order to give \ntheir own firms an advantage in the increasingly cut-throat world of \ninternational business.\n  Unlike the politico-military espionage of the cold war, economic \nespionage pits friendly nations against each other. Instead of military \nstrategy and weapon technologies, the sought-after secrets in economic \nespionage are marketing strategies and production technologies. While \nthe cost of politico-military espionage was reduced military security, \nand damage from economic espionage comes in the form of billions of \ndollars annually in lost international contracts, pirated products and \nstolen corporate proprietary information. The direct cost of this \nespionage is borne by America's international corporations. The \nindirect costs are borne by the American economy as a whole--jobs and \nprofits are lost; the competitive edge is stolen away.\n  The 103d Congress adopted an amendment I sponsored requiring the \nPresident to submit an annual report on foreign industrial espionage \ntargeted against U.S. industry.\n  The unclassified version of the President's first annual report, \nwhich is very understated compared to the classified version, \nacknowledged ``the post-cold-war reality that economic and \ntechnological information are as much a target of foreign intelligence \ncollection as military and political information.'' The report goes on \nto state:\n\n       In today's world in which a country's power and stature are \n     often measured by its economic/industrial capability, foreign \n     government ministries--such as those dealing with finance and \n     trade--and major industrial sectors are increasingly look \n     upon to play a more prominent role in their respective \n     country's (economic) collection efforts. While a military \n     rival steals documents for a state-of-the-art weapon or \n     defense system, an economic competitor steals a U.S. \n     companies proprietary business information or government \n     trade strategies. Just as a foreign country's defense \n     establishment is the main recipient of US defense-related \n     information, foreign companies and commercially oriented \n     government ministries are the main beneficiaries of US \n     economic information. That aggregate losses that can mount as \n     a result of such efforts can reach billions of dollars per \n     year, constituting a serious national security concern.\n\n  According to Joseph Recci of the American Society for Industrial \nSecurity, ``American corporations are losing billions of dollars each \nyear in valuable technology and proprietary information to foreign \nespionage.'' In a recent survey of Fortune 500 companies, the society \nnotes that the number of corporations reporting that they have been \nvictims of economic espionage has grown by 260 percent since 1985. \nPeter Schweizer, in his 1994 study of state-sponsored economic \nespionage, ``Friendly Spies,'' estimated that such espionage costs \nAmerican business upwards of $100 billion annually.\n  This alarming trend in foreign corporate and state-sponsored economic \nespionage will continue in coming years. Intelligence agencies in \nindustrialized nations have found themselves with a lot of time on \ntheir hands since the end of the cold war, and the governments of these \nnations have come to see economic competition as the new central threat \nto their national security. In testimony before the Senate Select \nIntelligence Committee earlier this year, then acting Director of \nCentral Intelligence Adm. William Studeman predicted, ``the threat to \nU.S. economic interests will absolutely increase as foreign governments \nattempt to ensure the success of their companies.''\n  A few examples of actual cases should illustrate how pervasive the \nproblem has become:\n  Pierre Marion, the former head of the French intelligence agency, the \nDGSE, has admitted that up to 15 hotel rooms of foreign business \nexecutives are broken into in Paris every day by DGSE agents. \nProprietary papers are copied, and this information is then passed on \nto French companies to give them an edge in competition and \nnegotiation.\n\n  Japanese, Korean, and German intelligence agents and corporations \nhave \n\n[[Page S378]]\nbeen known to recruit as spies midlevel managers and scientists at \nAmerican high-technology corporations. In exchange for money, these \nAmericans have provided the foreign agents with valuable trade secrets \nand formulas, destroying American companies' market leadership.\n  The foreign offices of American corporations are often subjected to \nwiretaps on their phones and infiltration of their foreign national \nstaff by agents of the host country's intelligence service. American \ncompetitiveness, profits, and jobs are the cost.\n  I refer my colleagues to a statement I made on March 10, 1994--140 S \n2731-38--for further examples of the foreign corporate and state-\nsponsored economic espionage that American firms face.\n  The United States has taken some steps to counter this pervasive \nproblem, but action has been neither strong enough nor smart enough to \nmake a real dent in foreign corporate and state-sponsored economic \nespionage in the United States and against Americans abroad. Admiral \nStudeman testified in January, ``the private sector's concerns about \nincreasing signs of `economic espionage' * * * are well founded. \nDespite the continuing necessity to protect sensitive sources and \nmethods, more can and must be done against state-sponsored economic \nespionage.'' As the President's report delicately puts it: ``efforts \nacross the government to investigate and counter economic and \nindustrial intelligence collection activities were fragmented and \nuncoordinated * * * resulting in many partially informed decisions and \ndiverging collection and analytical efforts.'' U.S. efforts, in plain \nEnglish, are chaotic and largely ineffective, which is why I wrote last \nyear's legislation requiring the President to report not only on the \nthreat but also on how the Federal Government is organized to counter \nthe threat and what changes in Federal organization and law could \nimprove that effort.\n  In the closing days of the Bush administration, the Justice \nDepartment confirmed to me that legislation was required to improve law \nenforcement officials' ability to investigate and prosecute foreign \nindustrial espionage. But it was not until this past year that Federal \nofficials, after consulting with industry representatives, were able to \nidentify for me specific legislative changes to accomplish this \nobjective, and we have spent several months refining bill language.\n  I rise today, Mr. President, to offer the product of these efforts, \nthe Economic Espionage and Protection of Proprietary Economic \nInformation Act of 1995.\n  The act is designed to counter this threat by creating a criminal \noffense for engaging in foreign corporate or state-sponsored economic \nespionage. The bill also clarifies existing provisions of criminal \nstatutes relating to stolen property and racketeering to make clear \nthat they apply to foreign corporate and state-sponsored economic \nespionage. Finally, the bill punishes individuals and/or corporations \nfound guilty of practicing foreign-sponsored economic espionage by \nfining them and banning them from import-export activity in the United \nStates for 5 years following their conviction.\n  This bill has been carefully crafted in coordination with Federal law \nenforcement authorities and industry representatives. In establishing \nthis criminal offense, the bill provides for those officials ordering \nthe espionage to be held liable, as well as those who commit the act. \nIt provides for forfeiture of any proceeds of and assets used in such \nespionage in accordance with the provisions of the Comprehensive Drug \nAbuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. These provisions would apply \nto espionage committed outside the United States if committed by a U.S. \ncitizen or if committed against an American and resulting in an affect \nin the United States. Finally, the bill would allow a court to take \nappropriate measures to ensure that protection of proprietary \ninformation during the prosecution of economic espionage cases.\n  Mr. President, it is imperative that the United States send a clear \nmessage to individuals and foreign governments and corporations--both \nour friends and our foes--that this country does not accept \ninternational corporate and state-sponsored economic espionage as a \nlegitimate business practice. We must demonstrate our resolve to combat \nthis unfair economic practice, regardless of who engages in it.\n  The free market system has been the source of America's prosperity \nand her world economic might. I ask you all to join me in supporting \nthis legislation to fight a practice which is polluting the \ninternational free market and robbing our Nation's firms and workers of \nthe success that their technological innovation and marketing know-how \nhas earned them.\n  In a report entitled ``Economic Espionage: a Threat to U.S. \nIndustry,'' the GAO stated the situation clearly: ``The loss of \nproprietary information and technology through espionage activity will \nhave broadening detrimental consequences to both U.S. economic \nviability and our national security interests.''\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Economic Espionage Act to send a \nmessage to nations around the world that America will not tolerate \nunjust practices in international trade and the subverting of American \nfirms' ability to compete fairly in the world marketplace.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. JOHNSTON:\n  S. 1526. A bill to provide for retail competition among electric \nenergy suppliers, to provide for recovery of standard costs \nattributable to an open access electricity market, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                THE ELECTRICITY COMPETITION ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nElectricity Competition Act of 1996. This bill is intended to establish \na framework for the transition of the electric industry from a \nregulated industry to a competitive, and deregulated, industry. Where \nmarkets are competitive, society should be saved the costs of unneeded \nregulation. America's electric system is the most technologically \nadvanced and operationally safe electric system in the world. There is \nno doubt today that electric service can be supplied to all consumers--\neven retail consumers--in a fully competitive market.\n  Our goal then, should be to ensure that electricity markets will \nbecome competitive so that regulation will be unnecessary. Our goal \nmust be to ensure price competition for electricity, which will create \nsavings, efficiencies, and innovation.\n  This is not pie-in-the-sky economic theory. This bill will mean real \nsavings for real people. For American families in the lowest 20-percent \nincome bracket, a household's total utility bills are about equal to \nthe total of mortgage/rent payments, taxes, and maintenance costs. \nUtility bills take slightly less of a middle-class family's disposable \nincome, but the fact remains--a decrease in the average electric bill \nfor the majority of middle-class Americans could achieve even greater \nbenefits than a middle-class tax cut, without the drain on revenue \nwhich a tax cut would mean. We have the potential to gain these \nbenefits, and we must seize this opportunity to do so.\n  There are six main elements of this legislation:\n  First, retail access. It's essential to clarify that the States are \nnot preempted from ordering retail access. This clarification will \nenable the States to go forward with retail access programs without the \nfear of Federal preemption. Overlooking this clarification will bring \nyears of litigation, impeding American consumers from receiving the \nbenefits of lower electricity prices.\n  Second, stranded costs. When this industry moves from regulation to \ncompetition, there will be created what industry insiders refer to as \n``stranded costs.'' This means the high costs of serving all customers \nunder the old regulatory system, which cannot be recovered in a \ncompetitive market.\n  It is true that similar predicaments faced firms in other once \nregulated markets--railroads, airlines, natural gas, and \ntelecommunications, for instance. But the electric utility industry is \ncompletely unique, and therefore, we must account for this difference.\n  First, the electric industry transition cannot take the same course \nas deregulatory efforts in other industries due to the staggering \ncapital requirements necessary to generate electricity. The electric \nindustry is the most capital intensive industry by far. The Edison \n\n[[Page S379]]\nElectric Institute [EEI] estimates that for every dollar of electricity \nrevenue, on average, $3.03 of capital assets is required. This is \nalmost twice the amount of capital necessary for the next highest \nindustry--mining, $1.74 and, three times higher than the communications \nindustry--$1.09. Moodys Investors Service estimates that 87 of the \nlargest investor owned utilities could lose $135 billion in stranded \ninvestment in the next 10 years. This is more than 80 percent of the \ntotal equity of these companies. Make no mistake about it. If we force \nthe utilities to eat stranded costs, we will have a bankrupt industry.\n  Second, the vast majority of potential stranded costs--nuclear \ngeneration and alternative energy contracts under the Public Utility \nRegulatory Policies Act of 1978 [PURPA]--are the direct result of past \nGovernment energy policies. One analyst estimates that stranded cost \npotential for the nuclear industry is about $70 billion. This is just \nunder two-thirds of the book value of the Nation's 108 nuclear \noperating plants. In addition, EEI estimates that PURPA contracts have \ncommitted utilities to pay at least $38 billion above market prices. \nCambridge Energy Research Associates has estimated that standard costs \nattributable to PURPA in California alone are between $6.6 billion and \n$10.8 billion.\n  The old regulatory compact almost guaranteed recovery of the costs of \nGovernment energy policies. With competition, however, the market--not \nregulators--determines cost recovery. It is simply unfair to leave \nutilities holding the bag for the energy policies of the past.\n\n  It is clear that we need a healthy utility industry. One analyst \nsurveying utility executives found that 50 percent of them believed \nthat utility bankruptcies would increase in the near future. Under \ncompetition there will remain a very important role for utilities to \nserve core customers, including poor and rural customers. Many \ncustomers will want to stay with a traditional company, or will not \nshop for their electricity. Also, the market is best served by having \nmany different players compete, including utilities. Because of the \nimportant role these companies play, the public interest is not served \nif utilities go bankrupt.\n  The final reason for stranded cost recovery is the legitimate \nexpectation of investors. Utility investors stand to lose billions of \ndollars if stranded costs are not recovered. Who are these investors? \nNot Wall Street sharks--they are ordinary citizens who considered \nutility stocks to be a safe investment. According to an EEI survey of \nshareholder demographics, the majority of utility investors are of \nretirement age, or are approaching retirement age. The economic effect \non these investors of stranded cost losses must not be forgotten.\n  We must encourage utilities to embrace competition. To do this, we \nmust ensure that all costs incurred under the old regulatory compact \nare fully recovered in the transition to competition. Competition in \nthis industry must be on a level playing field.\n  Recovery of all stranded costs is imperative. The Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission has taken the lead on wholesale stranded cost \nrecovery, and has done a great job. I believe FERC has the authority to \nalso permit recovery of retail stranded costs, but it is essential that \nwe clarify this authority through legislation. It is important to \nmandate that FERC ensure recovery of legitimate, prudent and verifiable \nretail stranded costs--only to the extent those costs slip through the \ncracks at the retail level. I would note that the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, which is primarily a licensing commission, certainly does \nnot have the authority to require recovery of nuclear investments or \nnuclear decommissioning costs.\n  In short, if we do not enact legislation ensuring stranded cost \nrecovery, most utilities will be reluctant to embrace competition. If \nwe do not enact legislation, the transition to competition and lower \nelectricity prices will be slower. If we do not enact legislation, \ncorporate risk becomes unmanageable, and bankruptcies may occur. This \nis not in the public interest.\n  The third aspect of the bill is shared Federal and State \nresponsibility. This bill respects the historical jurisdictional divide \nover the electric industry. The bill gives States the opportunity to \nstructure their retail markets with programs suited to their local \nsituations. Yet, the bill still holds State programs to one key Federal \nbenchmark: competition. This gives a broad Federal policy ensuring \ncompetition, but leaves implementation to the States.\n  This bill would require States to begin proceedings to examine their \nlocal markets. States have three choices.\n  No. 1: set up a competitive wholesale procurement market.\n  No. 2: establish a program of retail access for all consumers; or\n  No. 3: devise their own program, as long as it ensures no self \ndealing and no unfair subsidies to alternative energy generators.\n  Utilities who aren't regulated by FERC or State PUC's would be \nrequired to make similar decisions. Also, States which are already in \nthe process of moving forward with their own competitive programs would \nnot have to start all over again.\n  The bill establishes a balanced framework. The Federal/State \njurisdiction issue is a fine line to walk. Some will say the States \nshould be given unfettered authority. Others will say that competition \ncannot wait, and that a federally mandated competitive market cannot \ncome soon enough. In my view, a balanced policy which respects \ntraditional federalism is the best policy.\n  Fourth, we have to establish a timetable for the transition to \ncompetition. We need a date certain when retail access will be the law \nof the land, although that may be some years down the road. A definite \ntimetable for restructuring would remove this uncertainty. The \ntimetable in the bill--2010--recognizes the need for the States to \nimplement their own competition programs, and for the industry to get \ncomfortable with retail competition.\n\n  Fifth, we must have a level playing field, and this means PURPA \nreform and repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act.\n  The bill provides for prospective PURPA reform. Utilities relied on \nthe old regulatory system, and their legitimate expectations of \nrecovery should be respected. The same is true for the contractual \nexpectations of non-utility generators. Reform of PURPA is therefore \nappropriate on a prospective basis.\n  I believe PUHCA repeal is also essential even though it is not a part \nof this bill. I am the cosponsor of a bill with Senator D'Amato and \nothers which is currently before the Senate Banking Committee. The goal \nof that legislation is to put all electric utility companies on a level \nplaying field, and to remove regulatory barriers which are no longer \nappropriate. I believe PUHCA repeal, with certain consumer protections, \ncan go forward on a stand alone basis, but must be a part of \ncomprehensive restructuring.\n  Sixth, the bill ensures nuclear decommissioning cost recovery, which \nis essential for the protection of public health and safety. Nuclear \ndecommissioning costs are an extremely large percentage of many \nutilities' embedded costs. Several utilities have estimated their \ndecommissioning liability to be in the billions of dollars. The law of \nthe land should be that all nuclear decommissioning costs are \nrecoverable. Moreover, no nuclear licensee should be able to avoid \ndecommissioning liability.\n  This Nation cannot afford to miss this opportunity. This legislation \nis needed to avoid a patchwork of state policies, to bring competition \nto consumers on a rational timetable, and to standardize stranded cost \nrecovery. It is essential that we make this commitment now, and set \ncompetition in motion. Every year, every month, every day that we lose \ndebating the fine points of this transition means a loss of prosperity \nfor this Nation. We are now fighting tooth and nail in a global economy \nwhere every dollar counts. Accordingly, this legislation is essential.\n  We all know that competition and deregulation have lowered prices in \nthe national economy. What may not be so apparent is the huge ripple \neffect which lower electricity prices will create America. Consider \nthese figures:\n  Some 90 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product is produced by the \nresidential, commercial and industrial sectors. These sectors use 99.9 \npercent of \n\n[[Page S380]]\nthe Nation's electricity, and yet account for only 34 percent of the \nNation's oil consumption The other 10 percent of the Nation's GDP--\ntransportation--uses 66 percent of the Nation's oil. In many ways, \nelectricity is overwhelmingly more important to America's economy than \noil.\n  America recently spent $262 billion on electricity in 1 year. The \ndata suggest that electricity consumption is almost three times the \namount spent on the next highest commodity, natural gas. Also, \nelectricity consumption is almost four times the amount spent on \nunleaded gasoline.\n  In addition, the economy has become increasingly dependent on \nelectricity. Between 1973 and 1993 the U.S. industrial sector grew 70 \npercent. Industrial electricity use increased 45 percent during that \ntime period, while combustible fuel use declined 12 percent.\n  This trend is expected to continue. The Energy Information \nAdministration estimates that by the year 2010, 60 percent of all \nindustrial, commercial, and residential fuel use will be consumed by \nutilities to generate electricity in order to meet electricity demand. \nIn contrast, in 1973, only about 30 percent of all fuel use for these \npurposes went to generate electricity.\n  As these statistics demonstrate, changes in electricity prices have \nprofound economic consequences. Lower electricity prices mean more \njobs, more economic output, and more personal income. States with the \nlowest electricity prices are the most likely to attract new businesses \nand jobs.\n  The benefits of lowering electricity prices are staggering. \nTechnological changes have enabled new generators to produce \nelectricity at a price between 3 and 5 cent/kWh. However, costs in some \nregions of the Nation are anywhere between 9 and 15 cents/kWh. That's \nat least a factor of two, and at the most, a factor of five between \nregional delivered electricity prices. Considering that electricity \nmakes up about 30 percent of production costs for steel manufacturing, \nto give an example, you can see that lower electricity prices will have \na significant impact.\n  From this point forward, competition must be the electric industry \nstandard. This bill will accomplish that goal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1526\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat \nrecycling facilities as solid waste disposal facilities under the tax-\nexempt bond rules, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n        THE ENVIRNONMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I introduce the Environmental \nInfrastructure Financing Act of 1996. The bill will amend the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 to allow recycling facilities to be eligible for \ntax-exempt bond financing.\n  A continuing problem in the development of recycling efforts is the \nneed for markets for the materials that are being collected. Processes \nexist for remanufacturing the recycled materials into new products, but \nthey frequently require extensive capital investment.\n  An approach that is often attempted is the use of the Federal tax-\nexempt bond program, which does have a subcategory for solid waste \nprojects. Solid waste recycling facilities should constitute a \nlegitimate application of these funds; however, certain sections of the \ntax code define solid waste as being ``material without value.'' With \nrecycled materials now being traded as commodities they do, in fact, \nhave value, making the facilities which might process them ineligible \nfor tax-exempt financing. This definitional problem impedes the \nconstruction of recycling facilities and hurts the development of \nrecycling materials markets.\n  My bill will correct this problem in the tax code and allow recycling \nfacilities to obtain tax-exempt financing. The Environmental \nInfrastructure Financing Act of 1996 will foster the further \ndevelopment of the recycling industry and promote increased recycling \non the State and local level.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BRADLEY:\n  S. 1528.

He said, \n``Senator, I worked at this place, in one job, for 22 years, In that 22 \nyears, three different companies owned the place. In not one of the \nthree companies did I vest for a pension, because none of them owned \nthe place long enough. So I am now retiring, after 22 years of working \nhere, without a pension, at all.''\n  A woman came up to me on my annual walk along the Jersey Shore and \nsaid, ``six months ago, my husband lost his job. Two months ago, I lost \nmy job. We have three children and now we have no health insurance. I \nwent to our pediatrician and he said if the kids get sick, he'll take \ncare of them but Senator, this is America, and you shouldn't have to \nhave a friendly pediatrician in order to get health care for your \nkids.''\n  In California, a white-collar worker named Ron Smith who lost his job \nat McDonnell-Douglas 2 years ago told a journalist how his sense that \nhe was ``starting to lose my grip'' feeds into the divisiveness that is \ntearing our country apart: ``I get angry, and a lot of anger is coming \nout,'' he said. ``I'm blaming everyone, minorities, aliens coming \nacross the border. I don't know how much truth there is to it. I mean, \nI don't think there are any planners and engineers coming across the \nborder. [But] it hurts when you go to an interview and you know damn \nwell you can do the job, and you know they are looking at you and \nthinking, `Forget it.' ''.\n  In the last 7 years, 100,000 people lost their jobs with GE, 60,000 \nat IBM, 40,000 at Sears. The merger of Chase Manhattan with Chemical \nBank will mean the loss of 12,000 jobs. And AT just announced that \nthey will eliminate 40,000 more jobs, most of them this year.\n  My colleague Senator Biden recently told me that at the Hercules \nCorp.'s research center outside Wilmington, the downsizing has \naccelerated and become \n\n[[Page S383]]\nbrutal. When employees arrive at their office building on Monday \nmorning, they know that they have been fired when they see a Pinkerton \nsecurity man standing outside their office door. Usually he tells them \nthat he's sorry and he knows they've worked hard for 22 years, but \ncould they please have their desk cleaned out by noon--and if they \ndon't mind, he'll stand at the door, because the company doesn't want \nto take the chance that the computer system will be sabotaged. On \nMondays at the Hercules Center, no one carpools, because it is \nimpossible to predict who will be going home at noon.\n  The heavy footsteps of downsizing, relocation, part-time jobs, temp \njobs, middle age without health care and retirement without a pension \nmay be near or still distant, but they are heard in every home. People \nare working harder for less. In 1973 the average production, \nnonsupervisory wage was $315. In 1994 it was $256. That's about 70 \npercent of workers. During the first 6 months of 1993, the Clinton \nadministration announced that 1.3 million jobs had been created, to \nwhich a TWA machinist replied, ``Yeah, my wife and I have four of \nthem.'' And indeed, over half of the newly created jobs were part time.\n  For all but the fabulously wealthy, the idea that working hard can \nlead to a secure future, a chance to provide a better life for your \nchildren, and an adequate retirement is slipping away. I hear this fear \neverywhere: Among the urban working poor, in suburban living rooms, at \nfactory gates, and among engineers with Ph.D.'s and 30 years of \nexperience with large, still-profitable corporations.\n  The most painful part of it for me as someone who entered politics \nwith a belief that government could make people's lives better and more \nsecure, is that the political process seems deaf, almost willfully \ndeaf, to the economic anxieties of nonwealthy Americans. Instead of \nusing public power to balance the excesses of private power and enhance \nopportunity, too many politicians continue playing the proverbial \nfiddle while the lives of working people become more desperate.\n  Democrats and Republicans both march along the well-worn paths of \nsymbolic politics, waving flags labeled ``welfare,'' ``crime,'' and \n``taxes'' to divide Americans and win elections. Republicans cling to \nthe illusion that government is the problem--even the enemy of \nfreedom--and that less government and free markets will automatically \nrelieve the fears of working Americans. Democrats cling to old \nprograms, like worker retraining, without ever stopping to ask whether \nthose programs are actually working to change lives for the better or \nwhether jobs are available for the workers we're training.\n  The political process is paralyzed. Democracy is at a standstill. The \nbudget stalemate is only the latest headline. The Federal Government \nhas not been able to act decisively and with public consensus behind it \nin years. On health care, on taxes, on creating jobs, on reforming \nwelfare, we have been at continual deadlock.\n  Democracy is paralyzed not just because politicians are needlessly \npartisan. The process is broken at a deeper level, and it won't be \nfixed by replacing one set of elected officials with another, any more \nthan it was fixed in 1992 or 1994. Citizens believe that politicians \nare controlled: by special interests who give them money, by parties \nwhich crush their independence, by ambition for higher office that \nmakes them hedge their position rather than call it like they really \nsee it, and by pollsters who convince them that only the focus group \nphrases can guarantee them victory. Citizens affected by the choices we \nhave to make about spending and regulation simply don't trust that the \nchoice was made fairly or independently, or in some cases even \ndemocratically. They doubt that the facts will determine the result, \nmuch less the honest convictions of the politicians. Voters distrust \ngovernment so deeply and so consistently that they are not willing to \naccept the results of virtually any decision made by this political \nprocess.\n\n  Tell people in my State of New Jersey as I did in 1989-90 that the \nTax Reform Act of 1986 reduced their Federal taxes by $1 billion a year \nand they don't believe you because their State and local tax increases \noffset the reduction. It's gotten to the point that I've had \nconstituents call on the phone to ask how I voted on a particular bill. \nWhen my office tells them that the vote hasn't occurred yet, they don't \nbelieve you because a radio talk show host who hadn't done his homework \nsaid otherwise. For at least 6 years, since the repeal of the \ncatastrophic care legislation in 1989, through the erosion of \nenvironmental laws, to the failure of health care reform and the \nbacklash against the crime bill last year and the budget this year, \nevery major step government has taken has been jeopardized by this \nmistrust, by a deep and widespread conviction that politicians are \nacting is their own individual interests rather than acting as honest \nrepresentatives of the democratic will. There are several reasons for \nthis phenomenon, but one of them is money.\n  Those who think it's just a matter of perception that politics is \ndriven by money should consider the following facts:\n  In House-Senate negotiations over reform of telecommunications laws, \nwhich are still in progress, one large telephone company, Ameritech, \nappears to have won a special provision allowing it to build a monopoly \nin the burglar and fire alarm business, while its competitors are \nprohibited from entering that industry. Ameritech's PAC gave almost \nhalf a million dollars last year in 600 separate contributions to \nhundreds of Members of Congress of both parties, primarily those on \ncommittees with jurisdiction over its industry.\n  Another company, Golden Rule Insurance, Inc., gives over $900,000 in \nPAC money and soft money contributions to Members of Congress, and \nhundreds of thousands more to organizations affiliated with Speaker \nGingrich. In return, the company wins endorsement of medical savings \naccounts, an insurance product that only Golden Rule offers and which \nwould cost the Treasury $4 billion, as a centerpiece of the Republican \nMedicare reform.\n  Lobbyists for big corporate contributors sit in the offices of \ncongressional leaders and write the legislation to repeal a century's \nworth of environmental protections.\n  New Members of the congressional majority, while billing themselves \nas reformers, collect on average more than $60,000 from Washington-\nbased political action committees in just the first 6 months in office, \na year and a half before they seek reelection. Some take more than \n$100,000 in their first days.\n  State legislatures, where most politicians get their start and which \nothers treat as a modest, part-time contribution to citizenship, have \nbeen taken over by the same forces of money that captured Congress. \nState legislative races now routinely cost what congressional races \nused to cost. In New Jersey last year, State Senate candidates spent a \nrecord $8 million on 80 races, most of which were not competitive \ncontests. Illinois Assembly and Senate candidates raised $49 million, \n$2.4 million of it from out-of-State interests, such as gambling \ncompanies that seek licenses and new markets.\n  I have cited more examples involving the new Republican majority than \nDemocrats not because they are uniquely corrupt, but because these \nincidents are more recent, and money apparently flows to the winners \nwhen power shifts. While these abuses are not new, the amounts involved \nand the level of conflict seem to multiply every few years, with this \nyear's congressional freshmen taking twice as much money from PAC's \nright away than the freshmen who came to office in 1993. I saw one \nestimate that said that, in total, at all levels of government in 1996, \nnearly $1 billion would be spent.\n  So the story becomes clear. Economic anxiety eats away at people who \nwork in America. Government fails or refuses to respond. Voters develop \na profound and unyielding mistrust of the legislative process. \nLegislators, including some of those posing as reformers, surrender \ntheir offices and their consciences to corporate lobbyists and big \ncontributors with narrow interests to protect. Or, if they maintain \ntheir integrity, as many do, they still have to swim in dirty water \nwhich makes it even more difficult to stay clean. And amid biennial \npromises of change, nothing ever changes.\n\n[[Page S384]]\n\n  It's a story Americans have heard before. It's the story of the late \n19th century, the era of the spoils system and recurrent scandal, when \npolitics became hostage to the money power of Wall Street financiers, \nrailroads, and industrialists, when each Senator was virtually the \nproperty of whichever magnate had engineered his appointment. It was a \ntime when Washington was dominated by endless debates about the \ntariff--a dispute between wealthy financiers and wealthy \nmanufacturers--quite willfully ignoring the economic plight of the vast \nmajority of Americans who were farmers, miners, and factory workers, or \nwomen and African-Americans prohibited from voting. The theologian \nWalter Rauschenbusch wrote of that time that ``In political life one \ncan constantly see the cause of human life pleading long and vainly for \nredress, like the widow before the unjust judge. Then suddenly comes \nthe voice of property, and all men stand with hat in hand.''\n  Our Nation's history demonstrates that the conduct of democracy is \nnot an abstraction. When politics becomes hostage to money, as it did \nin the late 19th century, and as it increasingly is today, people \nsuffer. Neither economic opportunity nor economic security is given the \nplace it deserves in our national ambitions. There is still a very \ntangible relationship between the level of opportunity and security \navailable to every American family and the extent to which we can keep \nour democracy secure and separate from the force of money.\n  The late 19th century was the last time, until now, that America's \nprosperity failed to translate into higher wages and increased security \nfor American workers. Teddy Roosevelt called the moneymen of politics, \n``the gloomy anticipations of our gold-ridden, capitalist-bestridden, \nuserer-mastered future.'' But the path to a better 20th century rested \non four progressive principles: Universal suffrage; direct election of \nSenators; initiative and referendum to give the people a direct check \non policy; and campaign finance reform. Although Theodore Roosevelt \nproposed that ``Congress provide an appropriation for the proper and \nlegitimate expenses of each of the great national parties [and] no \nparty receiving campaign funds should accept more than a fixed amount \nfrom any individual,'' only modest disclosure requirements were adopted \nat the time.\n  Until we had radically reformed our democracy, to take it away from \nthe Goulds and Vanderbilts and give it back to the people, we could not \nbecome the kind of nation that protected seniors from abject poverty, \nthat protected children from abuse, that respected the heritage of the \nland. But, over time, the failure to complete action on that last \nreform, on the role of money in politics, became a more glaring \nomission. As the television replaced the Grange hall, the saloon, or \nthe town square as the central forum for public debate, money became an \never more important factor in who ran for office and who was elected. \nToday we see people spend $28 million to run for the Senate, a \nPresident raising $44 million for a primary campaign that doesn't \nexist, and individuals contributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to \ncampaigns by funneling them through the various State parties.\n  Many accomplished and capable people are right now considering \nwhether to become candidates for the House and Senate. They should be \nasking themselves, ``Can I work hard enough to do a good job?'' or ``Do \nI have new ideas that would benefit my constituents?'' Instead, they \nare wondering ``Can I find a thousand individuals and PAC's willing to \ngive me almost a million dollars?'' and ``Is there an interest group \nwilling to spend a lot of money to defeat my opponent?''\n  Money not only determines who is elected, it determines who runs for \noffice. Ultimately, it determines what government accomplishes--or \nfails to accomplish. Under the current system, Congress, except in \nunusual moments, will inevitably listen to the 900,000 Americans who \ngive $200 or more to their campaigns ahead of the 259,600,000 who \ndon't.\n  Real reform of democracy, reform as radical as those of the \nprogressive era, and deep enough to get government moving again, must \nbegin by completely breaking the connection between money and politics. \nIt must eliminate all the interested money--that is, money with strings \nattached, from all congressional races.\n  We have to start by understanding what has happened to past efforts \nto free politics from the grip of money. Three profound misconceptions \nhave led to the demise of every recent proposal to reform campaign \nfinance.\n  The first misconception is constitutional. The Supreme Court in 1976, \nin the case of Buckley versus Valeo, held that a rich man's wallet is \nno different than a poor man's soapbox. Restrictions on total campaign \nspending, and on wealthy individuals using their own money to buy an \noffice, were held to be equivalent to restrictions on free speech. Even \nreformers who found this logic absurd have felt it necessary to tiptoe \naround the Supreme Court, building elaborate contraptions of incentives \nand voluntary spending limits rather than risking the Court's wrath by \nsimply declaring it illegal to buy a seat in the House or Senate, with \nyour own money or someone else's. On something as crucial to democracy \nas the role of money in elections, a role that has destructively \nexpanded every year I have been in the Senate, the Constitution is the \nplace to fix the thwarting of the people's will.\n  The second misconception is similar, but runs deeper. It is rooted in \na failure to understand that democracy and capitalism are separate \nparts of the American dream, and that keeping that dream alive depends \non keeping one from corrupting the other. Speaker Gingrich, for \nexample, has accused those who advocate spending limits of \n``nonsensical socialist analysis based on hatred of the free enterprise \nsystem.'' He has compared the $600 million spent on congressional \nelections with the $300 million spent to advertise three new antacids, \nand concluded that politics is underfunded. Gingrich is not the only \nperson who holds this view, but he makes the sharpest accusations. I \nwould respond by saying that I have no hatred for the free enterprise \nsystem, but it is not the same as democracy. Market share is not \npolitical power. Democracy and civil society have a different ethic \nfrom the marketplace. Democracy requires calm and thoughtful \ndeliberation, and a willingness to accept losing in a fair process, and \ncivil society proceeds from a belief that giving without expectation of \nreturn is the highest human gift. Both ethics are much different from \nthe frenetic quest for market share and profit.\n  The third misconception is that different sources of money in \npolitics are more or less corrupting than others. When politicians \nwrite what they call campaign finance laws they try to protect their \nown sources of funding while cutting off those sources that primarily \ngo to their opponents. Thus the endless hairsplitting between political \naction committees, individual contributors, personal wealth of \ncandidates, soft money, and independent expenditures. Some proposals \neven draw distinctions among various types of political action \ncommittees, banning some and protecting others.\n  The result, Mr. President, has been legislative proposals that tiptoe \naround actually limiting spending on campaigns; that claim to reduce \ncorruption but don't challenge the idea that money should decide \nelections; and that draw endless distinctions among different types of \nmoney. If any of these proposals became law, they would make very \nlittle difference. But the biggest problem with these tortured, \nhairsplitting, incremental approaches is that voters can't understand \nthem. They don't see, just as I don't see, how these bills would \nactually fix what's wrong with democracy. As a result, there are no \nconsequences for politicians who block these proposals, so that even \nincremental reforms never pass, even when they appear to have momentum.\n  To free our democracy from the power of money, I believe we have to \nstart with two straightforward principles:\n  First, money is not speech. A rich man's wallet does not merit the \nsame protection as a poor man's soapbox.\n  Second, all interested money in politics is potentially corrupting. \nWhether it comes from an individual, a PAC, or a candidate's own \ninvestments, it sometimes comes with strings attached, and limiting one \nsource will only open up others. Money in politics \n\n[[Page S385]]\nis like ants in the kitchen. You have to close every hole, or they will \nfind a way in.\n  Today I want to present a specific legislative proposal that builds a \nrealistic structure for a new era in American democracy around these \nbasic principles.\n  I would start by amending the Constitution simply to clarify that \npolitical money is not speech. I will put forward an amendment that \nwould give every State and the U.S. Congress explicit authority to \nlimit spending in campaigns and contributions from any sources. Such an \namendment, or a reconsideration by the Court of its decision in \nBuckley, would be an essential underpinning of any real reform.\n  I have supported few constitutional amendments during my time in \npublic life, and I have been especially skeptical of those that sought \nto limit rights. However, I am convinced that this amendment would \nprotect rights by strengthening democracy. It would not limit the first \namendment, but would clarify that the right to buy an election is not a \nform of freedom of expression.\n  We should also consider the possibility that our current system of \ncampaign finance is as deeply unconstitutional as any reform might be. \nYears ago the Court outlawed so-called white primaries, in which the \nwhite voters who controlled Democratic parties in southern States met \nto decide who their candidate would be. Today we have a wealth primary, \nwhere wealthy contributors determine who has the opportunity to run for \noffice and who we have a chance to vote for. This amendment would \neliminate the wealth primary and give every American an opportunity not \nonly to run for office but to vote for who they want to.\n  With the constitutional misconception out of the way, I would start \nfrom scratch. This proposal would focus on Senate elections, but would \nprovide a model for elections to the House, State legislatures, \ngovernorships, or even the handling of referenda. I would give the \ncitizens of each State direct control over how much money would be \nspent in their State's elections. I would say to each taxpayer, in each \nState, you have an opportunity to give from $1 to $5,000 per year, but \nonly to a campaign in your State. You would contribute it by adding it \nto your tax liability and sending the checks with your tax return. But \nyou would be contributing to the election campaign, not to a candidate. \nAll the money would go into a shared fund, and every Senate election \nyear, on Labor Day, the candidates would take the fund and divide it \nequally among all qualified candidates--Republican, Democrat, or \nqualified independent.\n  Outside of the money from the common fund, Senate candidates could \nnot raise or spend any money from PAC's, individual donors, the party, \nor their own pocketbooks to further their candidacy. If the voters and \ntaxpayers concluded that they liked the level of information and \nadvertising they got from a $20 million campaign--if they agreed with \nSpeaker Gingrich, in other words--they could choose that kind of \nelection. If they wanted a cheaper election they could choose that \noption by their votes on the tax return.\n  To ensure that all candidates have an opportunity, an equal \nopportunity, to reach all voters, I would reclaim part of the public \nairwaves as a public forum. Every broadcast licensee, radio or \ntelevision, would be required as a condition of licensing to provide 2 \nhours of free time to every candidate, 1 hour in prime time, in units \nof at least 1 minute. The airwaves are public property. They now offer \nthe closest thing we have to a shared culture and a common forum for \ndiscussion of ideas. That forum should not be available only to the \nhighest bidder. We have not only a right to insist that broadcasters \nprovide that space, but a responsibility to ensure that the public's \nairspace is used in the interest of rebuilding democracy.\n  Who would be a qualified candidate, eligible to receive money from \nthe common fund and broadcast time? Any party that had received 10 \npercent of the vote in the previous two Senate elections would \nautomatically qualify once it selected a candidate. Independent \ncandidates and new parties would be required to obtain signatures of 5 \npercent of all eligible voters in the State, but once they qualified, \nthe candidates and their ideas would be treated equally. A candidate \nwho refused to participate in at least one debate would be completely \nshut out--he could not participate in the shared fund or raise money \nseparately.\n  Candidates seeking the nomination of a major party would not receive \nfunds or broadcast time for the primary, and would be permitted to \nraise private funds. But they would be required to raise 100 percent of \nthose funds in contributions of $100 or less.\n  That's it. For the general election there would be no PAC's. No \nprivate contributions from wealthy individuals. No bundling of \ncontributions from the executives of a company to evade PAC limits. No \nmoney from out of State. No candidates using their own funds. No \nrefusal to debate. All the sources of potential corruption in the \ncurrent system would be cut off. Speech would be protected; money would \nbe restricted.\n  This proposal won't sound like anything we've heard before. It will \ntake people a while to get used to it. Some people will worry that \nthere won't be enough money for good campaigns. But if that is so and \nthe people are less informed, that will be their choice. No longer will \nspecial interests control it. But keep in mind that TV and radio \naccounts for about 50 percent of the cost of campaigns. With free \nbroadcast time, the money which will be cut, if voters choose a low-\nbudget campaign, would be the money that candidates spend on polling, \nconsultants, gifts, and the rest. The process of providing information \nto voters would more than likely be protected, but then again, if it \ndecreases, it will be the citizens' choice.\n\n  Other people will be offended at the idea of contributing to \ndemocracy, rather than to a candidate. Some people said to me, ``I \ndon't want my money to be shared with Senator Helms?'' or ``Why should \nI contribute to Senator Kennedy?'' That's a fair concern. But as things \nnow stand, an incumbent can raise as much as $17 million, $10 million \nmore than even a well-funded opponent. Putting that incumbent and his \nor her opponents on a level playing field is far more important than \nthe $1,000 that any of us, as an individual, can give to either \ncandidate in that race. If you have the strength of your convictions, \nthere is no reason to fear a fair fight.\n  Others will say that the proposal helps incumbents, but incumbents \nhave an even bigger financial advantage in the present system and they \nare defeated regularly. Besides, if doing your job well helps you get \nreelected, who can criticize it?\n  Finally, still others may note that I have supported public financing \nof campaigns in the past and this is not exactly public financing. \nIndeed, it is not public financing. It does not take taxpayer dollars \nand provide them to political campaigns. It is not public financing, \nbut it is public control of elections. As long as voters mistrust \npoliticians as they do, we're not going to get past the skepticism \nabout public financing. We have to rebuild that trust first, and I \nthink that giving voters control of campaigns is the way to do it.\n  I believe there is a deep hunger for this kind of reform. I have been \nvery impressed by the energy of activists at the State level, who are \nusing one breakthrough in democracy--the initiative and referendum--to \nbreak down the barriers to another, campaign finance reform. Never \nbefore have we seen so much grassroots activity on the issue of \ncampaign finance reform. In 1994, ballot initiatives won in Missouri, \nOregon, and Montana, as well as the District of Columbia in 1992. And, \nso far, we can expect in 1996 initiatives in Maine, California, and \nAlaska, Arkansas, and Colorado. Other States where groups are \nconsidering initiative drives include Wisconsin, Nebraska, South \nDakota, and Illinois. The initiatives on the ballot this year are \nradical and serious. Whether they emphasize modest public financing or \nlimiting contributions to $100, they are big, uncompromised reforms \nthat would go a long way toward freeing State legislatures from the \ngrip of moneyed interests. I consider those State activists my partners \nin this reform proposal, and I believe they deserve to have a proposal \non the table in Washington that is as radical, as serious, and as real \nas what people are talking about in the States.\n\n[[Page S386]]\n\n  Many politicians and academics may focus on what they see as the \nworst possible outcome of this proposal: that voters, given control, \nmight choose to sharply cut back the amount of money available in \ncampaigns. Indeed, they seem to be contributing less in the \nPresidential checkoff. But if that happens, the worst consequence would \nbe a resurgence of door-to-door campaigning, of politicians listening \ninstead of polling, and of campaigns led by candidates and their ideas \nrather than consultants and their focus-group-tested messages. In other \nwords, the system would adjust in what could very well be a way that \nreinvigorates citizen participation. To argue against changing the \nstatus quo that everyone knows compromises democracy is a terribly \npessimistic position. Now is the time to be bold.\n\n  At its best, however, I believe that giving voters control over \ncampaigns will be enough to return democracy to the people, freeing it \nfrom the power of money. It could restore confidence and faith in the \nlegitimacy of democratic decisionmaking, freeing both Congress and the \nPresidency from the cycle of gridlock, action, and backlash. \nUltimately, it will free our democracy to do what it can do when it \nworks well: use the power of government to build a structure of \neconomic security and economic opportunity for all American families.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the proposal \nalong with the text of both the constitutional amendment and the Senate \nCampaign Finance Reform Act be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1528\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

It would not force taxpayers to fund \n     politics through public financing, but it would equalize \n     funding among candidates and provide free media time. \n     Candidates would have to compete on their ideas, and once \n     elected, to serve all their constituents without favoring \n     contributors.\n\n\n                      1. constitutional amendment\n\n       Amend the Constitution to clarify that Congress has the \n     power to set limits on contributions and expenditures in \n     support of, or in opposition to, any candidate for Federal \n     office.\n       The spending limits implicit in the legislative proposal \n     directly confront the Supreme Court's 1976 ruling in Buckley \n     v. Valeo equating political money with free speech. If the \n     Court will not reconsider this ruling, this amendment will \n     correct it.\n\n\n                            2. tax check-off\n\n       Add a new Senate General Election Campaign Fund line to \n     each tax return, and allow all filers to designate between $1 \n     and $5,000 as an add-on to taxes. Funds added-on by taxpayers \n     in each state will be designated for Senate elections in that \n     state only.\n\n\n               3. distribution of funds among candidates\n\n       Each Senate election year, all funds received in the \n     preceding two years (plus one-half of any funds remaining \n     from previous years) will be divided among all qualified \n     candidates after the nomination process has been completed in \n     each state. All qualifying party candidates and independents \n     will receive an equal share.\n       To qualify, a party or an independent candidate must obtain \n     signatures of 5% of all registered voters in the state. \n     Parties that have received 10% of the vote in two of the \n     previous four Senate elections automatically qualify.\n       No candidate may accept or spend funds from any source \n     other than the common fund. All candidates must participate \n     in at least two debates with all other candidates.\n\n\n                           4. broadcast time\n\n       Each broadcast licensee must make available to each \n     eligible Senate candidate two hours of free broadcast time, \n     of which at least one hour must be during prime time. Each \n     broadcaster must make time available to candidates in all \n     states in its broadcast area. Free time must be made \n     available during the 90 days preceding the election. \n     Appearances during news or public service programs will not \n     count.\n       Free broadcast time will be allocated in segments of 1-30 \n     minutes, at the candidates' choice.\n       The Federal Election Commission will also be required to \n     develop a program of public \n\n[[Page S389]]\n     service announcements providing basic information about voting \n     requirements, voter registration, and election dates and \n     locations, which broadcasters may carry in fulfillment of \n     their basic public service requirements.\n\n\n                         5. nominating process\n\n       Candidates for any party's Senate nomination may accept \n     only contributions of $100 or less. No candidate for a \n     party's nomination may spend more than 50% of the total \n     amount that will be available in the total fund for \n     candidates in the general election, as estimated by the state \n     30 days before the primary.\n       A candidate for nomination who did not comply with these \n     rules would be ineligible for all funding and free broadcast \n     time in the general election.\n\n\n                       6. party money/soft money\n\n       Contributions to state and national party organizations \n     will be limited to $1,000 from individuals.\n\n\n                      7. independent expenditures\n\n       Broadcast licensees that accept independent expenditures \n     for advertisements that make reference to any Senate \n     candidate must provide equal, free time to allow any \n     candidate mentioned negatively in the original ad to respond. \n     If a candidate is mentioned positively, the licensee must \n     allow all opponents the same amount of time to respond.\n\n\n           sources of corruption eliminated in this proposal\n\n       PACs (eliminated by ban on outside contributions).\n       Wealthy individual contributors (same).\n       ``Bundling'' to evade PAC limits (same).\n       Wealthy candidates (personal wealth cannot be used).\n       Out of state money (all money in common fund comes from in-\n     state taxpayers).\n       Money funneled through party committees without disclosure \n     or limits.\n       Lack of debates (debate participation required).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/25/senate-section/article/S377-4", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                S. 1028\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the name of the Senator from \nMassachusetts [Mr. Kerry] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1028, a bill \nto provide increased access to health care benefits, to provide \nincreased portability of health care benefits, to provide increased \nsecurity of health care benefits, to increase the purchasing power of \nindividuals and small employers, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1473\n\n  At the request of Ms. Snowe, the name of the Senator from Michigan \n[Mr. Abraham] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1473, a bill to authorize \nthe Administrator of General Services to permit the posting in space \nunder the control of the Administrator of notices concerning missing \nchildren, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1520\n\n  At the request of Mr. Helms, the names of the Senator from Alaska \n[Mr. Stevens] and the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 1520, a bill to award a congressional gold medal to \nRuth and Billy Graham.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/25/senate-section/article/S389-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S389-S390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n       DEFENSE AND PRISON SPENDING DURING THE BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS\n\n   Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, in the past few weeks, budget \nnegotiations have ground to a halt. Unfortunately, both Republicans and \nDemocrats have focused their budget-cutting attentions too narrowly on \ncertain parts of the total budget pie, while ignoring other large \nportions of the budget. While both sides have offered to put everything \non the table, two areas of enormous Federal spending have not been on \nthe table: national defense and prisons.\n  I would like to call the attention of my colleagues to a recent \nChicago Sun-Times column, written by William Rentschler, entitled \n``Sacred Cows of Arms, Prisons Are Milking the U.S. Budget.'' The \ncolumn describes the irrationality of giving billions of tax dollars to \nthe military-industrial complex and the prison industry with virtually \nno congressional debate, as we simultaneously scrutinize other programs \nin the difficult quest to balance the budget.\n  As the column suggests, current budget proposals insulate significant \nparts of the budget from any reductions. Instead of making cuts in all \nareas of Federal spending, current budget proposals target programs \nsuch as Medicare, Medicaid, child nutrition, and Head Start, which \nprovide essential services for the elderly, children and the poor, or \neducation and training initiatives that make the American dream \npossible for many ordinary citizens. In fact, the budget reconciliation \nplan passed by the Republicans would establish budget firewalls that \nallow defense spending in the next 7 years to increase by $33 billion \nover the request by the Department of Defense.\n  For 15 years, I have fought for a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. I have done so in the firm belief that persistent budget \ndeficits pose a grave threat to the future prosperity and vitality of \nthe Nation. However, my support for the goal of a balanced budget does \nnot mean that I support cutting deeply into only certain parts of the \nbudget, while leaving other parts of the budget completely untouched.\n  I urge my colleagues to read the column and to work with me toward \nbalancing the budget in a way that is sensible and fair.\n  I ask that the Chicago Sun-Times column be printed in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n            [From the Chicago Sun-Times, December 25, 1995]\n\n        Sacred Cows of Arms, Prisons Are Milking the U.S. Budget\n\n                        (By William Rentschler)\n\n       Ordinary cows are generally placid and quite harmless. But \n     sacred cows can be downright fearsome, even a danger to the \n     well-being of a nation.\n       It is two monstrous sacred cows, snorting and stomping and \n     emitting mushroom clouds of gaseous propaganda, that stand in \n     the way of a rational balanced budget that is fair to both \n     the poor and the powerful.\n       Most politicians on both sides of the aisle--including \n     President Clinton and his Republican adversaries--cringe at \n     the thought of bringing to heel these voracious gobblers of \n     vast feedlots of tax dollars.\n       Sacred Cow No. 1 is the ``military/industrial complex,'' \n     which Dwight D. Eisenhower, career military hero, warned \n     against when he left the presidency in 1960.\n       If Clinton, Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole had the backbones to \n     curb the bloated appetite of the military and its handmaidens \n     in Congress, there would be no budget impasse, no shutdown of \n     government, no need to balance the budget on the backs of the \n     poor and infirm, no need to devastate the environment, \n     education, workplace and food safety, drug prevention/\n     treatment, and a host of other social programs.\n       The most credible critic of outlandish defense spending in \n     the wake of the Cold War is the Washington-based Center for \n     Defense Information, a think tank run not by what Gingrich \n     and Rush Limbaugh would berate as mushy-minded liberals, but \n     by three retired U.S. Navy admirals.\n       CDI's triad of flag officers brands as ``scandalous'' and \n     ``outrageous'' today's defense budget, which represents 47 \n     percent of all discretionary federal spending. That's nearly \n     half of all discretionary tax dollars to feed the ultimate \n     sacred cow in peacetime.\n       The admirals state unequivocally that we could reduce \n     military spending by more than $500 billion over the next \n     seven years ``without jeopardizing America's status as the \n     preeminent military power in the world.'' This, they say, \n     would preclude draconian cuts proposed by Republicans in \n     Congress ``to vital domestic programs.''\n       Sacred Cow No. 2--not yet as fat but equally formidable in \n     its stranglehold on Congress and state legislatures--is the \n     ``prison/industrial complex'' or the ``punishment industry,'' \n     as it is described by sociologists J. Robert Lilly and \n     Mathieu Deflem.\n       The U.S. incarceration rate is the highest in the world. On \n     any day more than 1.5 million people are locked up. The \n     reasons are clear. The prison propagandists, who profit from \n     punishment extremes, have terrified the public, rigged \n     sentencing statutes to assure an ever-increasing demand for \n     more cells, and conned politicians into throwing tax dollars \n     mindlessly into prison building, stuffing and staffing.\n       Both sacred cows are classic examples of free enterprise \n     run amok. We implement unsound policy and practice driven by \n     greed and the almighty buck. Billions are at stake as \n     companies elbow each other to supply the ``punishment \n     industry.'' The prison-builders get ever-fatter as they graze \n     unrestrained in the backyards of taxpayers. The prize, \n     according to Lilly and Deflem, is $22 billion in annual sales \n     divided among about 300 private firms.\n       What politicians--there are a few--will risk having the \n     demagogues, lobbyists and editorial writers call them \n     ``soft'' on national security or crime? Or will turn their \n     backs on the cornucopia of dollars poured into their campaign \n     coffers by these free-spending, yet sacrosanct, bovines?\n       So there is no rational debate on the merits, and we \n     continue to squander billions on unneeded weapons and \n     prisons. CDI reports that the House devoted exactly 32 \n     minutes to its approval of the $240 billion military budget \n     in 1994. That's $7.5 billion per minute!\n       Sad, isn't it, that we the people allow ourselves to be \n     hoodwinked to this extent year after year.\n       Republicans in Congress, especially Gingrich and the hot-\n     eyed freshmen, speak grandly about balancing the budget to \n     protect our \n\n[[Page S390]]\n     children and grandchildren. In truth, the future will be assured for \n     some children and grandchildren--those whose parents and \n     grandparents are members of Congress or otherwise comfortably \n     fixed. Far greater numbers will be cast adrift in the new \n     century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/25/senate-section/article/S389-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   HONORING LINDA D. WILLIAMS FOR 25 YEARS OF SERVICE TO MARYLAND'S \n                                SENATORS\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndedicated Senate employee who, on February 1, 1996, will celebrate her \n25th year of service to Maryland's Senators. Linda D. Williams started \nher career with my distinguished predecessor and friend, Senator \nCharles McC. Mathias in 1971. She served his office with distinction \nand enthusiasm for 15 years. While working for Senator Mathias, she \nhelped bring his office into the high technology era of computers.\n  When I came to the Senate in 1987, I asked Linda to be my systems \nadministrator, and she has not missed a beat. Gone are the days of \ncarbon copies and in are the days of high-speed computers, \nsophisticated software, and the Internet. I have relied on Linda \nWilliams to guide me through this maze of technology, so that I might \nuse it to better serve the people of Maryland. I can say with a great \ndeal of pride and happiness that Linda has helped me make the most of \nthese opportunities. Even more important, she has helped the people of \nMaryland in the process.\n  With her help, I was one of the first Senators to have a world wide \nweb page. Now, my staff and I navigate the NET with abandon, and my \nconstituents navigate their way to my office online. This exciting \ntechnology will help open our democracy to more and more people. I was \nlucky to have Linda Williams here to see the process through.\n  Mr. President, I have a great deal of respect for people who have a \nsense of duty, for people who want to help themselves. I admire people \nwho take on a task, make it their own, and see it through to the end. \nMany of these successful people live and work in Maryland. They are \nteaching in our schools, nursing our veterans, exploring space, and \nfinding the cures for disease. I'm proud that one of these people is in \nmy own office. I salute Linda Williams for her dedication, and I look \nforward to her next 25 years serving Maryland's Senators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/25/senate-section/article/S390-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      ON THE FORTY-EIGHTH ANNIVERSARY OF SRI LANKA'S INDEPENDENCE\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to bring some \nthought and consideration to the 48th anniversary of Sri Lanka's \nindependence from colonial rule.\n  Sri Lanka, which had been dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and, of \ncourse, one and a half centuries of British rule, has emerged in the \nfinal decades of this century as a nation firmly committed to democracy \nand the rule of law.\n  The last few years have brought tremendous gains for democracy and \nfreedom throughout the world, and while we applaud the successes in \nEastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, we should not overlook the \nprogress this island of some 17 million citizens has made on its own.\n  Since 1982, when J.R. Jayewardene was elected the first post-colonial \npresident, Sri Lanka has held regular national elections notable for \ntheir peaceful transitions of power between its two major political \nparties: the United National Party [UNP] and the Sri Lanka Freedom \nParty [SLFP], or coalitions led by them.\n  Sri Lanka's third presidential election was held on November 9, 1994 \nwith former Prime Minister Chandrika Kumaratunga winning with 62 \npercent of the vote. Voter turn-out was an impressive 70.5 percent. The \nmost recent parliamentary elections were held in Sri Lanka on August \n16, 1994, with the UNP and the SLFP winning a roughly equal number of \nseats.\n  President Kumaratunga intends to continue with wide-ranging, \nsignificant economic reforms that are moving Sri Lanka away from state \ncontrols and subsidies to a more decentralized, market-oriented system. \nThis has allowed Sri Lanka to maintain a significant 5 percent average \nannual growth rate throughout the last decade.\n  Sri Lanka has also proven its commitment to providing for the basic \nhuman needs of its people. Since independence, successive Sri Lankan \nGovernments have maintained a policy of free education from the primary \nlevel through the university level. The literacy rate, for both men and \nwomen alike, is an impressive 90 percent. The Sri Lankan Government \nalso provides an extensive program of free health care, which includes \nchild immunization. Sri Lanka boasts an average life expectancy of 70 \nyears and an infant mortality rate of 19/1000 which is highly \nremarkable for this region of the world.\n  The United States has ties with Sri Lanka dating back to the \nnineteenth century, ties that have greatly strengthened since Sri \nLanka's independence. We are now Sri Lanka's biggest trading partner \nwith our annual bilateral trade standing at $1.4 billion. We also \nmaintain ties to Sri Lanka through bilateral educational, information \nand cultural programs. The United States has a continuing, active Peace \nCorps Volunteer Program there, and has operated a Voice of America \nStation in Sri Lanka for more than 40 years.\n  Unfortunately, Sri Lanka continues to experience the tragedies of \npolitical violence, resulting primarily from the Tamil insurgency in \nthe North and, to a lesser extent, from a mainly Sinhalese group in the \nSouth. The news we hear about Sri Lanka here in the United States all \ntoo often focuses only on these ongoing conflicts, which have brought \ndeath and suffering to Sri Lanka for over 10 years.\n  It is my hope that Sri Lanka will one day resolve its internal \ndisputes and that peace will return to this nation which has \ndemonstrated such an impressive commitment to democracy. President \nKumaratunga has expressed her intention to seek a political solution to \nthe ethnic conflicts and has announced a set of proposals aimed at \ndevolving power to the regions. She has also reiterated her pledge to \naddress minority grievances through dialog and negotiation.\n  On the 48th anniversary of Sri Lanka's independence, I would like to \nexpress my support to President Kumaratunga as she works to determine a \nlasting solution to the ethnic conflicts in Sri Lanka. I share her hope \nthat peace, reconciliation, and a system of nonviolent negotiation \nbetween all parties will soon prevail for the people of Sri \nLanka.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/25/senate-section/article/S390-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ADJOURNMENT UNTIL TOMORROW\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
