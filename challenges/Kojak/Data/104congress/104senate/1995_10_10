Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a great U.S. \nSenator, Senator Sam Nunn. After 23 years, it is difficult to envision \na U.S. Senate without our esteemed colleague from Georgia. There is no \ndoubt that had he run again in 1996, he could have won and won easily. \nHad he decided to stay, he would have remained the most influential \nSenator on defense and one of the most effective conservative Democrats \noverall.\n  Senator Sam Nunn's intellectual depth on defense and national \nsecurity matters is unparalleled in this body. He has been a staunch \nand unyielding proponent of a strong national defense and has \ndemonstrated a keen interest in the wide breadth of defense issues.\n  His thoughtfulness and dedication to what he thinks is best gives him \nan extraordinary amount of credibility that the Senate will sorely miss \nwhen he leaves. On many occasions he has been mentioned as a possible \nnominee for Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, or even as \nPresident of the United States.\n  Although Sam Nunn is best known as an authority on defense issues, he \nhas played a prominent role on other major issues as well. He is well \nknown for his indepth knowledge of foreign affairs. His voice on human \nrights and civil rights has always evidenced a progression and \nsensitivity in seeking solutions. He is a prominent member of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee where he held hearings on wrongdoings in \nmany areas and recently pertaining to some in the health insurance \nindustry.\n  Having come from a farming family, he has fought for sound \nagricultural policy and has been a champion of the often misunderstood \ncotton and peanut programs. He has been a major moderating influence on \nour party through his work on the Democratic Leadership Council. He has \nfought long and hard for a balanced budget and believes in the \nconstitutional amendment requiring the same.\n  His great-uncle, Carl Vinson, served for 50 years in the House of \nRepresentatives chairing the Naval Affairs and the Armed Services \nCommittee. Recently in Honolulu, as we were celebrating the 50th \nanniversary of V-J Day, the end of World War II, we had various \nceremonies on the aircraft carrier named for his great-uncle, Carl \nVinson.\n  The seat which he now occupies was held for nearly 40 years by the \nlate Richard Russell, who is a revered Senator and who also served as a \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee. Since he came to the Armed \nServices \n\n[[Page S 14802]]\nCommittee in the 1970's, Senator Nunn has backed a strong national \ndefense. No one in the Senate did more to bring about the breakup of \nthe Communist regimes in the old Soviet Union. He has also attended to \nthe details of defense policy, at one time chairing the Manpower \nSubcommittee in helping to shape the Reserve Force structure and callup \nprocedures that allowed the United States to respond quickly to Saddam \nHussein's aggression in the summer and fall of 1990.\n  He also worked on the Goldwater-Nichols Defense Reorganization Act of \n1986, which simplified the military chain of command and granted \nconsiderable power to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  In my judgment, Sam Nunn will go down as one of the giants of the \nSenate. His leadership and foresight will be missed here, but I am \nconfident that we will enjoy those same qualities through other avenues \nthat Senator Nunn undertakes and other projects that he tackles during \nthe years to come.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my profound \nsorrow upon hearing the announcement by the senior Senator from \nGeorgia, my close and trusted friend, Sam Nunn, that he will not run \nfor another term in 1996. His departure at the end of this Congress \nwill surely mark a point of great loss to this body. I truly believe \nour future collective efforts will be notably diminished by his \nabsence.\n  I recall very clearly when Senator Nunn first joined the Senate in \n1973. It was evident to me from the outset that he was a man of \nintegrity, ability, and dedication, and that he would maintain the \nhighest standards for both his personal conduct and the quality of his \nwork. He was appointed to serve on the Committee on Armed Services when \nCongress convened in 1973, and in 1974 he was named chairman of the ad \nhoc Subcommittee on Manpower and Personnel. In 1975, when the \nSubcommittee Manpower and Personnel was actually formed, he was named \nits chairman and he served in that capacity for 6 years, until 1981. In \n1983, 10 years after he joined the Committee on Armed Services, he \nbecame the ranking minority member until 1987, when he became the \nchairman of the committee. He served with great distinction in that \ncapacity for 8 years, and during that time he earned the respect of \nleaders around the globe for his wisdom, statesmanship, and insight.\n  Among his many accomplishments in the Senate, there are two which \nparticularly stand out. First is the Nunn-Lugar program of reducing the \npossibility of nuclear war by actually removing nuclear weapons. This \ninitiative has been carried out in a manner which promotes mutual trust \nand respect between the United States and Russia, and its consequences \nhave reached far beyond simply dismantling weapons. Second is the \nmanner in which Senator Nunn guided the legislative program during the \nturbulent post-cold-war drawdown of the Armed Forces. His highly \nskillful work, both inside and outside the Congress, ensured our Armed \nForces would remain as strong and viable as possible.\n  I believe history will note what all of us here already know, that \nSenator Nunn led the Committee on Armed Services and guided the \nnational agenda on defense matters through some of our most challenging \nperiods with exceptional skill, courage, and wisdom. His high standards \nof excellence, his ability to view an issue from all relevant angles \nand perspectives and analyze problems across all different levels, \ncombined with his high intelligence and strong leadership skills, have \nresulted in a wisdom of effort which has benefited the entire Nation.\n  We have heard many hours of debate in this Chamber about defense and \nnational security matters. All too often that debate has focused on \nvery narrow aspects of the issues, and the major points of the larger \nissue are easily lost. Senator Nunn has a well-earned reputation for \nreturning our debate to the larger, principal issue and pointing out \nthe implications of various courses of action. He has been able to \nillustrate how defense is only one element of national security, and \nhow national security is only one element of national policy. Senator \nNunn's ability to recognize the primary issue and guide the process to \na meaningful conclusion have served our Nation and this body very well \nthese past 23 years.\n  Throughout his 27-year career in political life, Senator Nunn has \nexemplified strong, selfless devotion to duty to our Nation and its \ncitizens. He represented his constituents well and faithfully, and \nremained mindful of the national interest. He well deserves his \nreputation as a figure of high international stature. We will remember \nhim as a man of dignity and high purpose.\n  Mr. President, our Nation owes Senator Nunn its deepest appreciation \nfor his truly distinguished service. I am pleased that he intends to \nremain engaged in public policy matters, and I wish him and his wife, \nColleen, continued success and happiness in all future endeavors.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/10/senate-section/article/S14801-5", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE RETIREMENT OF SENATOR NUNN\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I was saddened to learn that Senator \nNunn will retire from the Senate at the end of his fourth term, and I \nrise to salute him for his great contributions to the Senate, to the \ncitizens of Georgia, and to the United States.\n  I know that many of my colleagues have already spoken eloquently \nabout Senator Nunn and his accomplishments. But I wanted to express my \ngratitude for what Senator Nunn has meant to me, to our national \nsecurity, and to the creation of an opportunity structure for the young \npeople of this country.\n  For me, Senator Nunn serves as a model for commitment and patriotism. \nSenator Nunn has worked to ensure that while we downsize our military, \nwe do not downgrade our military. He realizes that national security is \ntoo important to become politicized. He believes that a strong defense \nis not a Republican position or a Democratic position--it is a \nnecessity for the world's only superpower.\n  This commitment has yielded tangible results. Both as chairman and as \nranking member of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Nunn has worked \nto improve the quality and morale of our troops, and to ensure that we \ncontinue to have the best trained, best equipped military in the world.\n  And finally Mr. President, while we have all focused on Senator \nNunn's contribution to our national security, he has also made a great \ncontribution to creating an opportunity structure for our Nation's \nyouth. He is one of the early pioneers of national service. Long before \nit became a hot political issue, he understood how national service \ncould create an ethic of service in our country. He fought to enable \nyoung people to make an investment through their own sweat equity in \nthemselves and their communities. I know that he will continue this \nfight after he leaves the Senate.\n  Mr. President, we will miss Senator Nunn in the Senate. But I know \nthat he will continue his contributions to improving the lives of \nAmericans and to improve America's standing in the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/10/senate-section/article/S14802-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14802-S14803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HUGO PRINCZ\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, nearly 2 years ago, it was my privilege \nto meet with Mr. Hugo Princz in my office. He told me how he and his \nfamily had been victimized by Nazi brutality and disregard for \ninternational laws and civilized norms; how his family's American \npassports were ignored in 1942 by German officials and they were sent \nto death camps; how his entire family was exterminated simply because \nthey were Jewish as were so many other Jews during those dark days of \nthe Holocaust; and how fate intervened in the closing days of World War \nII and American soldiers intercepted and liberated the prison train \nwhich was taking him to his death.\n  I was saddened by the horrors he had suffered and endured and by the \nlosses he had sustained. But just as powerful as the sorrow I felt for \nhim was the outrage I felt at the brutality he was still enduring from \nthe legalistic folly being perpetuated by the German Government which \nrefused to resolve his claims for fair reparations. Since Mr. Princz \nwas rescued by American forces \n\n[[Page S 14803]]\nand was not processed through a center for displaced persons, the \nGerman government argued, he was not a stateless person eligible for \nthe reparations which Germany agreed to pay to Holocaust survivors in \nthe 1960's. Despite repeated attempts to get the German Government to \nrecognize the validity of his claim, Hugo Princz was denied the remedy \nhe was entitled to by common decency and conscience if not by the \nletter of German law.\n  But Hugo Princz did not survive the horrors of Maidanek, Auschwitz, \nand Dachau by being a quitter. He persisted in his claims against \nGermany, eventually suing in Federal district court in 1992. Still the \nyears passed with no relief. But Hugo Princz never gave up hope. His \ngoal was not monetary compensation; rather, it was the justice which he \nand his family had been denied since the early days of 1942. Finally, \non September 18, 1995, Hugo Princz was offered and accepted a \nsettlement by the Federal Republic of Germany. Fifty years after the \nend of World War II, 50 years after his family was torn apart with all \nbut Hugo going to their deaths, finally, after 50 more years of being \ndenied justice, this courageous American who has demonstrated the \npatience of Job received what should have been given so long ago. The \nsettlement which Hugo has offered is not adequate compensation for what \nhe has endured; it is a victory of the spirit not the accountant's \nledger. It was too long in coming and too difficult to achieve. But it \nis a victory for Hugo Princz; for his courage, his persistence, his \nfaith, and his memories.\n  Each of us who have been touched by Hugo Princz have been enriched by \nthe contact. I hope that these recent events will bring to him at long \nlast the peace which he has been denied all these years. I wish Hugo, \nhis wife, Delores, and his children, Giselle, Howard, and Cheryl, all \nthe peace and joy they so richly deserve and have waited so long to \nenjoy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/10/senate-section/article/S14802-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the skyrocketing Federal debt, now about \n$25 billion short of $5 trillion, has been fueled for a generation by \nbureaucratic hot air; it is sort of like the weather, everybody has \ntalked about it but almost nobody did much about it. That attitude \nbegan to change immediately after the elections in November 1994.\n  When the new 104th Congress convened this past January, the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives quickly approved a balanced budget amendment \nto the U.S. Constitution. On the Senate side, all but one of the 54 \nRepublican Senators supported the balanced budget amendment.\n  That was the good news. The bad news was that only 13 Democrat \nSenators supported it, and that killed the balanced budget amendment \nfor the time being. Since a two-thirds vote--67 Senators, if all \nSenators are present--is necessary to approve a constitutional \namendment, the proposed Senate amendment failed by one vote. There will \nbe another vote during the 104th Congress.\n  Here is today's bad debt boxscore:\n  As of the close of business Friday, October 6, the Federal debt--down \nto the penny--stood at exactly $4,974,778,210,422.20 or $18,884.34 for \nevery man, woman, and child on a per capita basis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Conforming amendments.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) increasing international competition, technological \n     advances, and structural changes in the United States economy \n     present new challenges to private businesses and public \n     policymakers in creating a skilled workforce with the ability \n     to adapt to change and technological progress;\n       (2) despite more than 60 years of federally funded \n     employment training programs, the Federal Government has no \n     single, coherent policy guiding employment training efforts;\n       (3) according to the General Accounting Office, there are \n     over 100 federally funded employment training programs, which \n     are administered by 15 different Federal agencies and cost \n     more than $20,000,000,000 annually;\n       (4) many of the programs fail to collect enough performance \n     data to determine the relative effectiveness of each of the \n     programs or the effectiveness of the programs as a whole;\n       (5) because of the fragmentation, duplication, and lack of \n     accountability that currently exist within and among Federal \n     employment training programs it is often difficult for \n     workers, jobseekers, and businesses to easily access the \n     services they need;\n       (6) high quality, innovative vocational education programs \n     provide youth with skills and knowledge on which to build \n     successful careers and, in providing the skills and \n     knowledge, vocational education serves as the foundation of a \n     successful workforce development system;\n       (7) in recent years, several States and communities have \n     begun to develop promising new initiatives such as--\n       (A) school-to-work programs to better integrate youth \n     employment and education programs; and\n       (B) one-stop systems to make workforce development \n     activities more accessible to workers, jobseekers, and \n     businesses; and\n       (8) Federal, State, and local governments have failed to \n     adequately allow for private sector leadership in designing \n     workforce development activities that are responsive to local \n     labor market needs.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to make the United States more competitive in the world \n     economy by eliminating the fragmentation in Federal \n     employment training efforts and creating coherent, integrated \n     statewide workforce development systems designed to develop \n     more fully the academic, occupational, and literacy skills of \n     all segments of the workforce;\n       (2) to ensure that all segments of the workforce will \n     obtain the skills necessary to earn wages sufficient to \n     maintain the highest quality of living in the world; and\n       (3) to promote the economic development of each State by \n     developing a skilled workforce that is responsive to the \n     labor market needs of the businesses of each State.\n\n     SEC. 3.

WELFARE REFORM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the current welfare system in the United States is \n     failing both the families who rely on the system and the \n     taxpayers who support the system;\n       (2) the current system encourages dependency and fails to \n     promote self-sufficiency adequately;\n       (3) one-size-fits-all approaches to welfare reform will not \n     work;\n       (4) in order to be most effective, reforms of the welfare \n     system should take into account the individual differences \n     among States and among families;\n       (5) in recent years there has been an alarming increase in \n     the number of births to unmarried teenagers;\n       (6) between 1986 and 1991, births to teenagers increased by \n     23 percent, from 50.2 to 62.1 births per 1,000 teenage \n     females;\n       (7) there is a crisis in the collection of child support \n     that is leaving thousands of families in poverty and is \n     increasing welfare costs to taxpayers; and\n       (8) in 1991, the United States Commission on Interstate \n     Child Support reported that $5,000,000 of the $15,000,000 \n     awarded in child support in 1991 went uncollected.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that any welfare reform legislation enacted by the Senate \n     should be based on the following principles:\n       (1) Individuals on welfare should, from their first day on \n     welfare, accept responsibility for themselves and their \n     families. The receipt of welfare benefits by an individual \n     should be conditioned on a partnership between the individual \n     and the State in which the partners clearly delineate the \n     steps that the family of the individual will take to enable \n     the individual to move off welfare and into the workforce as \n     well as the services, including child care, that will be \n     provided by the State to enable the family to become self-\n     sufficient. If an individual on welfare \n\n[[Page S 14825]]\n     fails to meet the responsibilities of the individual there should be \n     consequences, such as a reduction in welfare benefits.\n       (2) Each State should be given more flexibility to design \n     welfare programs that effectively respond to the needs of \n     welfare recipients in the State.\n       (3) Welfare reform legislation should effectively respond \n     to the alarming increase in births to teenage parents.\n       (4) Both parents have the responsibility for providing \n     financial support for their children, even if the parents are \n     divorced or were never married. Welfare reform should be \n     accompanied by aggressive efforts to improve the collection \n     of child support.\n       (5) Welfare reform legislation should recognize the \n     interaction between the welfare system and the statewide \n     system to alleviate unintended consequences for persons other \n     than welfare recipients who are in need of workforce \n     development activities, as described in this Act.\n       (6) Neither political party contributes all of the best \n     policies for welfare reform, so welfare reform legislation \n     should have widespread bipartisan support.\n TITLE VI--REPEALS OF EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING AND VOCATIONAL AND ADULT \n                           EDUCATION PROGRAMS\n\n     SEC. 601.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate is \nconsidering Senate bill 143, the Work Force Development Act of 1995. \nThis legislation is the product of several years of bipartisan efforts \nto bring about real and comprehensive reform of Federal job training \nprograms.\n  I do not think anyone would argue about the need for bold and far-\nreaching change in our current patchwork of training programs. S. 143 \nprovides that change.\n  The members of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee spent a \nlot of time in a number of hearings considering innovative, creative \nand constructive approaches to reform, and I am pleased that we are now \ngoing to take up consideration of this bill under a time agreement and \ngive it our full attention.\n  Right now, the Federal Government runs well over 100 separate job \ntraining programs, each with its own set of rules and regulations. In \ncombination, they create a maze of confusion to anyone who needs help \ngetting a job. As often as not, they spell disappointment, not results, \nfor those who have sought assistance in building a better life for \nthemselves and their families.\n  Year after year, the General Accounting Office [GAO] has worked \ntirelessly to document how conflicting requirements and program overlap \nhave reduced effectiveness and added unnecessary costs.\n  What is worse, Mr. President, is that right now we have almost no \nidea how well any of these programs are performing. The GAO concluded \nthat most Federal agencies have no idea whether their programs work.\n  As just one example, last year Senator Kennedy, the ranking member of \nthe Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, and I asked Department \nof Labor officials to tell us how many people are placed in permanent \njobs after they receive Federal training. With the exception of one \nprogram, the Department of Labor keeps no records of how many people \nget jobs after the taxpayers fund their training. I was not only \nsurprised by this finding but, frankly, troubled as well.\n  Mr. President, I concluded some time ago that the only way to truly \nreform Federal job training was to wipe the slate clean and begin \nagain, and that is where the Work Force Development Act starts. This \nbill repeals over 80 different job training programs. They are wiped \noff the books, along with the stacks of regulations that go with them.\n  But the repeal of all the major Federal job training programs is just \nthe first step toward real reform. In place of these programs, S. 143 \nwould give States and local communities the flexibility and the means \nto fashion training programs and placement services that meet the local \nneeds of job seekers and employers alike.\n  This is a critical change if we want to be successful in helping \npeople find jobs. S. 143 would combine funds from these 80-odd programs \nand turn them over to the States and, in turn, to local communities, so \nthat training programs will be tailored to actual jobs available in the \ncommunity.\n  Let me emphasize that the Work Force Development Act is more than \njust another block grant proposal. I \n\n[[Page S 14826]]\nwould like to discuss briefly four reasons why I believe this \nlegislation will bring a comprehensive transformation in our approach \nto job-related training and education.\n  First, S. 143 will establish in each State a coordinated work force \ndevelopment system where everyone, regardless of why they are \nunemployed, can find help. Arbitrary eligibility requirements will be \ngone, as will the duplication now being created by having separate, \nindependent programs offering essentially the same services.\n  Savings and greater efficiency are bound to result from \nconsolidation, as each State develops its own coordinated plan to meet \nthe needs of its workers and the private sector.\n  One-stop centers, broadly defined in the bill, form the cornerstone \nof each State's system. These are places that will be easy to find and \neasy to use. They will be available to anyone wanting to gain access to \nbasic services, such as job listings, placement help and counseling.\n  I think, Mr. President, we have done a poor job in our ability to \nserve and assist those who are looking for jobs, and far too often, \nthere are many individuals who get lost in the cracks.\n  At these one-stop centers, individuals will be given the full array \nof available options, from further education to on-the-job training in \nprivate industry. Many States have already adopted the one-stop \napproach, and S. 143 gives each State greater flexibility to adopt a \nmethod that works for that State.\n\n  The second unique feature of this legislation is its emphasis on \naccountability. In exchange for flexibility in the use of the funds, \neach State must set goals and benchmarks laying out how they will \nimprove skills and provide real jobs.\n  This means that, for the first time, we will know exactly how many \npersons getting training actually get a job and for how long. Further, \nif a State fails to live up to its goals and benchmarks, it will face \nmonetary sanctions.\n  Unlike the current system, States will be accountable for real \nresults, and taxpayers will know what they are getting for their \nFederal job training dollars.\n  The third key feature of S. 143 is the significant role it gives to \nthe private sector. It goes without saying that all the job training in \nthe world will not help unless there are jobs available at the end of \nthe road. Ultimately, it is the private sector that will provide these \njobs, and they must be brought into the system in an integral way to \nhelp develop programs that work for each State and local community.\n  That is why the active and meaningful involvement of employers and \nbusinesses is critical to the success of any job training effort. No \nlegislation can ever guarantee such involvement. Nevertheless, we have \nassured that businesses, large and small, will be at the table in the \nplanning and implementation of the new system at every level--local, \nState, and Federal.\n  In addition, the legislation provides an incentive for greater \nbusiness involvement, by permitting a limited portion of job training \nfunds to be used for economic development in States which establish \nformal local boards.\n  Finally, and perhaps most important, this legislation will forge a \nnew link between education and training. Mr. President, there is one \nthing that is fundamental to the success of any work force development \neffort and that is sound, strong education programs. We have often \ntalked about the important link between quality vocational education \nand job training. But we have done very little to really forge that \nlink in a way that will last, both at the Federal level and the State \nand local level. Basic education is often the foundation, and should \nbe, of any successful job training program.\n  While vocational education is clearly aimed toward job preparation, \nwe have paid far too little attention to vocational education over the \nyears. It has been shoved off to the side and not made an integral part \nof the total work force preparation process.\n  In spite of the obvious connections, vocational and adult educators \nand job training providers have lived far too often in different \nworlds. As often as not, they have operated independently, sometimes at \ncross purposes.\n  The Workforce Development Act brings the education and training \ncommunities together in each State through a collaborative planning \nprocess. This process gives all interested parties the opportunity to \nsit down together and work toward common goals.\n  Moreover, they will have every incentive to cooperate because the \nstakes will be high. S. 143 provides that half of each State's funds be \nplaced in a flexible account to be used in whatever mix of education \nand training the State sees fit. This flex account will be the vehicle \nthrough which all parties will come together to develop a unified \ntraining system.\n  This bill also brings down the walls between training and education \nat the Federal level. Two offices--one in the Department of Labor, the \nother in the Department of Education--are both eliminated. They are \nreplaced by a single Federal partnership to oversee State efforts, \nreducing by at least one-third the number of Federal employees now \ninvolved with work force training and education programs.\n  These four features, I believe, are really the heart of this \nlegislation. We will see the creation of a new initiative that I am \nconvinced will provide far better services than we currently do, \nthrough the myriad job training programs that have been added on top of \neach other over the years without thinking of how they should really \nfit together.\n  These four features are one-stop centers, strong accountability, \nprivate sector involvement, and links between education and training. \nTogether, they create a new, bold, and innovative approach to Federal \nsupport of work force development.\n  In addition, the bill contains two provisions that deal specifically \nwith at-risk youth and the disabled. There is a separate subtitle for \nJob Corps and other activities aimed at addressing the specific needs \nof our most vulnerable young people.\n  There will be more discussion on Job Corps in the course of today's \ndebate. But I want to emphasize at the outset that Job Corps is not a \npart of the block grant. Rather, it remains as a separate program that \nis fully funded. However, it does mean an end to Federal administration \nof the Job Corps Program, and allows the States the flexibility to \ndesign a program with their Job Corps center that best meets the needs \nof the population being served there.\n  Title II amends the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to integrate \nvocational rehabilitation programs into the State's training system, \nwhile still recognizing the unique requirements of bringing the \ndisabled into the work force.\n  As I noted at the outset, Mr. President, many years of work have gone \ninto the development of this legislation. Members of the Labor \nCommittee, in particular, have devoted a great deal of time in helping \nto shape this bill. I want to acknowledge all of their efforts as well \nas the contributions made by a number of Members who do not serve on \nthe committee.\n  I also note that it would not have been possible to tackle a project \nof this scope without the benefit of the expertise of that individual \nMembers brought to this issue.\n  Senator Frist was especially helpful in integrating vocational \nrehabilitation programs for the disabled into the statewide system. \nSenator DeWine played a key role in developing a separate provision for \nat-risk youth. Senator Jeffords, as chairman of the Education \nSubcommittee, was particularly helpful in shaping the education \nprovisions.\n  On the other side of the aisle, I want to recognize the support and \ncontributions of Senator Pell, ranking member of the Education \nSubcommittee, whose early and steadfast support has been invaluable. \nLikewise, the Senator from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey, deserves special \nrecognition. He has been a stalwart supporter of job training reform, \nas a cosponsor of this bill in its earlier versions.\n  S. 143 has a broad spectrum of support that includes Governors, \nrepresentatives of the business community, and educators that will play \na key role in the development of this new system.\n  We have received letters of support from the Republican Governors \nAssociation, the National Governors' Association, the State Board of \nVocational Technical Education, the National School Boards Association, \nthe American Vocational Association, the Council of Great City Schools, \nthe National \n\n[[Page S 14827]]\nAssociation of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the \nNational Alliance of Business.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                State of Michigan,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                     Lansing, MI, October 5, 1995.\n     Hon. Nancy Kassebaum,\n     Chairwoman, Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kassebaum: On behalf of the Republican \n     Governors' Association Workforce Development Task Force, we \n     write to indicate our strong support for S. 143, the \n     Workforce Development Act.\n       As you know, earlier this year, the RGA Workforce Task \n     Force developed a comprehensive statement of principles \n     outlining our vision and recommendations for consolidating \n     existing federal employment and job training programs. We \n     believe your approach as demonstrated in S. 143 lays the \n     groundwork for a statewide workforce development system and \n     meets many of the objectives we named.\n       While we strongly support S. 143 and urge the full Senate \n     to approve the bill, we oppose amendments that would \n     dismantle the intended consolidation, create new set-asides, \n     or impair the flexibility states would have in implementing \n     the Workforce Development Act. In particular, we oppose \n     amendments requiring mandatory vouchers and mandatory local \n     workforce boards or which limit the authority of Governors in \n     designing and implementing the statewide workforce \n     development system.\n       Regarding vouchers, while many states are interested in \n     experimenting with vouchers, this remains an untried and \n     unproven delivery system. While we support legislation \n     allowing states to use vouchers as an option, it is \n     inappropriate to impose a mandate at this time when states do \n     not have the administrative capability or resources to \n     immediately implement such a system.\n       This same reasoning applies to mandated local workforce \n     boards. We believe most Governors will choose to develop a \n     local delivery system. However, some states, in particular \n     small states, may not have the resources to efficiently \n     implement mandated local workforce development boards. It is \n     important to structure local partnerships in a manner best \n     suited for states while recognizing individual differences in \n     the states.\n       Concerning FUTA issues, we support your efforts to ensure \n     that FUTA revenues remain dedicated to their intended \n     purposes while integrating them into a statewide workforce \n     development system under a Governor's strategic control. We \n     appreciate your work in this direction.\n       Finally, we believe provisions of the bill providing a 25% \n     set-aside in funding for State Education Agencies should be \n     included in the same block grant that flows to Governors for \n     design of a statewide workforce development system. Education \n     services are a critical component of successful career \n     preparation and training programs. Providing Governors with \n     greater access and linkage to education services will enable \n     us to deliver a uniform, integrated and accountable workforce \n     development delivery structure and eliminate duplication. We \n     appreciate your serious consideration of options to address \n     this issue, and our staff's are prepared to work with you in \n     discussing possible courses of action.\n       Again, we thank you and your staff for your excellent \n     leadership and hard work. We appreciate the positive working \n     relationship we have enjoyed and the many opportunities you \n     have provided us to participate in the drafting process. We \n     look forward to continuing to work with you as you conference \n     S. 143 with the House CAREERS Act.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tommy G. Thompson,\n                                            Governor of Wisconsin.\n     John Engler,\n                                             Governor of Michigan.\n     Terry E. Branstad,\n                                                 Governor of Iowa.\n     Christine Todd Whitman,\n                                           Governor of New Jersey.\n     George V. Voinovich,\n     Governor of Ohio.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 1995.\n     Hon. Nancy Landon Kassebaum,\n     Chair, Committee on Labor and Human Resources, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kassebaum: We are pleased that the Senate will \n     consider S. 143, the Workforce Development Act, next week and \n     want to express our strong support for your efforts to reform \n     and consolidate federal workforce development programs. While \n     we remain concerned about funding setasides within the block \n     grant, we believe that this legislation gives states great \n     flexibility while holding us accountable for achieving \n     results. This flexibility is especially critical given \n     federal funding reductions in these programs.\n       As you put the finishing touches on S. 143 and take up \n     amendments on the floor, our paramount concern is that you \n     give Governors room to design programs that best meet the \n     unique needs of our individual states. States have been \n     moving toward integration of workforce development programs \n     for at least a decade. It is imperative that federal \n     legislation recognize the diversity of these efforts and not \n     override state innovation with overly prescriptive federal \n     rules or mandates. Therefore, we support any modifications \n     that may be made to the bill that would increase the ability \n     of states to develop a fully integrated workforce development \n     system. In addition, we would support the availability of \n     national reserve funds to assist states in the event of \n     natural disasters, mass layoffs or to meet the needs of \n     migrant workers.\n       We strongly oppose, therefore, amendments that move the \n     bill toward federal micromanagement of the program. These \n     include the following amendments:\n       An amendment to be offered by Senator Breaux to mandate the \n     use of vouchers for job training services to dislocated \n     workers. Governors support the bill's option for states to \n     use vouchers and many states plan to test the use of them. We \n     cannot support, however, mandating nationally this new \n     service delivery mechanism.\n       Two amendments to be offered by Senators Jeffords and Pell. \n     The first would place further restrictions on how states may \n     use block grant funds by moving funds out of the ``flex \n     account'' and into the setasides for workforce education and \n     workforce employment activities. If this amendment were \n     adopted, two thirds of the block grant funds would be rigidly \n     assigned to certain activities, giving states flexibility \n     with only one-third of the funds. The second Jeffords/Pell \n     amendment would dictate what proportion of funds may be used \n     for vocational versus adult education. We oppose this \n     amendment as further limiting the ability of states to \n     allocate funds according to their citizens' needs.\n       An amendment that may be offered by Senator Ashcroft to \n     require states to conduct drug tests of clients served by \n     workforce development. Given that federal workforce \n     development aid is already being reduced in the \n     appropriations process, we would view this requirement as an \n     unfunded mandate.\n       An amendment to be offered by Senator Kyl to mandate local \n     workforce boards. While many Governors do intend to create \n     such boards, this decision should be left to states.\n       Finally, we are concerned about some provisions of S. 143 \n     and hope that we may work with you to resolve them before \n     final passage of any federal workforce legislation. First, we \n     understand that you have added to the bill a provision which \n     preempts state law and court rulings in at least six states \n     by requiring that all block grant funds be subject to all \n     procedures and rules applicable to state funds, including \n     appropriation by state legislatures. We strongly object to \n     this attempt to rewrite state laws through federal \n     legislation and ask that this provision be stricken from the \n     bill. The inclusion of this language could result in funds \n     being allocated in a way that overrides the collaborative \n     process involving the Governor, business representatives, the \n     state education agency, and others required by the bill. If \n     this occurs, state accountability will be lost because there \n     will be no link between the state plan, including state goals \n     and benchmarks, and the allocation of funds.\n       Similarly, the bill would overturn existing authority for \n     adult and vocational education in at least 15 states by \n     giving sole authority for these programs to state education \n     agencies. State education agencies do not now have authority \n     over funding or administration of these programs in these \n     states. We ask that you revise the bill to recognize the full \n     range of entities that now fund and administer these \n     programs.\n       We remain opposed to the segregation of block grant funds \n     and administration into workforce employment and workforce \n     education categories. We strongly believe that these \n     activities should be integrated as much as possible, as \n     Congress did under the School-to-Work Opportunities Act. The \n     collaborative group of state education officials, the \n     Governor, workforce officials, and others should be \n     responsible for all of the state plan and all of the funding, \n     not just for the strategic plan and ``flex account'' funds. \n     This is the only way to achieve an integrated system. We look \n     forward to working with you and your staff during the \n     conference process to give states as much opportunity as \n     possible to integrate workforce activities.\n       We strongly oppose the bill's requirement that individuals \n     in need of job training have a high school diploma or GED, or \n     be enrolled in adult education, before entering job training. \n     There is no clear evidence that having a GED increases \n     individuals' employability or earnings, and we believe \n     barring these individuals from training is counterproductive. \n     Indeed, research shows that upgrading basic skills within the \n     context of job training can be much more effective than adult \n     education alone. Furthermore, the adult education system does \n     not have the capacity to serve all of these individuals and \n     therefore this requirement could pose an unfunded mandate on \n     states, especially since Congress is simultaneously reducing \n     federal job training and adult education aid to states. This \n     requirement poses a particular problem for serving welfare \n     recipients because, under the Senate's welfare bill, job \n     training may be counted toward meeting work participation \n     rates but adult education may not be counted.\n       Thank you for considering our views. We look forward to \n     working with you to achieve \n\n[[Page S 14828]]\n     final passage of workforce development reform legislation this year.\n           Sincerely,\n     Gov. Arne H.

Nancy Landon Kassebaum,\n     Chair, Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, Russell \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kassebaum: We are writing in strong support \n     and with special appreciation for your leadership and strong \n     commitment to the American workforce and to the country's \n     Vocational Education system. The National Association of \n     State Directors of Vocational Technical Education (NASDVTEc) \n     strongly supports the passage of S. 143, the Workforce \n     Development Act of 1995.\n       Our organization's support is based on S. 143's clear \n     commitment to high quality vocational technical education. \n     The bill provides the opportunity for flexibility, adaptation \n     and change that is essential to the continuous improvement of \n     the vocational technical education system, while assuring a \n     positive partnership between state and local education \n     agencies to plan, administer, and improve programs. We are \n     pleased that the bill provides agencies to plan, administer, \n     and improve programs. We are pleased that the bill provides a \n     specific allocation for education and for the maintenance of \n     state and local funding. These are critical elements to \n     assuring that high quality vocational technical education is \n     available.\n       NASDVTEc is concerned that the current reduced \n     authorization level (a result of programs being removed from \n     the bill) may jeopardize the ability of the vocational \n     education system to continue to expand and improve to meet \n     the rapidly changing technical needs of employers. We support \n     efforts to return funding for workforce education to its \n     original or increased level.\n       Thank you for your leadership in preparing this important \n     legislation. NASDVTEc also wants to thank and commend your \n     staff, in particular Wendy Cramer, for her dedication and \n     patience throughout this process.

The National School Boards Association \n     represents 95,000 local school board members nationwide who \n     make the key fiscal and education policy decisions for local \n     school districts.\n       NSBA wants to commend Senator Kassebaum for her sponsorship \n     and leadership during the months of debate on this bill. She, \n     along with committee staff from Senate Labor and Human \n     Resources, have been strong advocates for vocational \n     education and local control. Her bill, S. 143, contains the \n     following provisions which NSBA completely support:\n       (1) A guaranteed workforce education allocation of not less \n     than 25% in the block grant funds;\n       (2) A local governance structure in which the local \n     education agencies (LEAs) apply to the state education \n     agencies (SEAs) for funds and the LEAs are represented on \n     local workforce development boards;\n       (3) A uniform substate formula for the funds to be \n     distributed directly from the SEAs to the LEAs; and\n       (4) A supplement, not supplant statement, thereby ensuring \n     that the federal vocational education dollars are used to \n     improve local education programs.\n       Despite the disappointing authorization level for this \n     legislation, NSBA supports the many fine education provisions \n     in S. 143. NSBA urges you to vote for this bill and not to \n     support any floor amendments which would remove any of these \n     education components. If you have any questions or concerns, \n     please contact Kathryn L. McMichael, Director, Federal \n     Relations, 703-838-6782.\n       Thank you for your support.\n           Sincerely,\n     Roberta G. Doering,\n       President.\n     Thomas A. Shannon,\n       Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                              American Vocational Association,\n\n                                  Alexandria, VA, October 4, 1995.\n     Hon. Nancy Kassebaum,\n     Chair, Labor and Human Resources Committee, Russell Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kassebaum: Thank you very much for all of \n     your efforts to develop a consolidation proposal for \n     vocational education and job training which underscores the \n     value of quality workforce education. The American Vocational \n     Association (AVA) actively is urging the passage of the \n     Workforce Development Act (S. 143).\n       Since the earliest drafts of this bill were circulated, AVA \n     has been very supportive of the structure of S. 143. We are \n     pleased that the bill promotes innovative approaches to \n     planning and implementing workforce education activities \n     while retaining the critical expertise and authority of state \n     and local educators in developing and administering education \n     programs. Further, your commitment to a specific allocation \n     of education, as well as a sub-state distribution formula and \n     the maintenance of state and local funding, are critical \n     components in attaining the highest quality workforce \n     education.\n       With the passage of the CAREERS Act in the House, which AVA \n     opposed, it is even more imperative that your bill pass the \n     Senate and that its structure be preserved in conference.\n       While earlier versions of S. 143 contained a higher \n     authorization level due to the incorporation of a few \n     programs which have now been removed, the resulting bill cuts \n     the authorization to a degree that jeopardizes the potential \n     to improve the quality and expand the availability of \n     vocational education programs. Therefore, AVA urges the \n     passage of the Pell-Kennedy amendment to change the \n     allocation of workforce education, workforce employment, and \n     flexible funds to an even one-third allocation for each.\n       Again, thank you for your leadership in preparing this \n     important legislation and for considering our views. I also \n     want to thank and commend your staff, particularly Wendy \n     Cramer and Carla Widener, for their dedication and assistance \n     throughout this process. If you have any questions or need \n     additional information, please feel free to contact me or \n     Nancy O'Brien, AVA's Assistant Executive Director for \n     Government Relations, at 703/683-3111, ext. 311.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bret Lovejoy,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                            Council of the Great City Schools,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 3, 1995.\n     Hon. Nancy Kassebaum,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kassebaum: The Council of the Great City \n     Schools, the coalition of the nation's largest urban school \n     districts, is pleased to support S. 143, the Workforce \n     Development Act, as it moves to consideration by the full \n     Senate. Your efforts to maintain a distinct occupational \n     education program for secondary students, which is designed \n     and delivered by the nation's schools reflects an important \n     commitment to continuing progress toward the educational \n     goals of the country.\n       Your bill not only addresses many of the larger issues \n     surrounding occupational education and training, but also \n     specifically deals with important operational details which \n     can make or break a federal legislative initiative, such as \n     the intrastate distribution of funds, and maintenance of \n     effort.\n       While the Council cannot endorse the lowering of the \n     authorization of appropriations, we still support your bill. \n     One very specific area of concern, however, relates to the \n     loss of the JOBS and other authorizations during the floor \n     action on Welfare Reform. The removal of these authorization \n     levels will lower the overall funds available for the block \n     grant, and thereby also lower funds available for the 25% \n     set-aside for workforce \n\n[[Page S 14829]]\n     education. The Council, therefore, is requesting that you support a \n     potential Pell-Kennedy amendment to adjust each of the set-\n     aside percentages in the block grant to 33%.\n       As you might imagine, the Council of the Great City Schools \n     rarely supports block grant legislation. However, your \n     efforts to craft a pragmatic piece of legislation and to \n     reach out for input from our organization and our colleagues, \n     as well as to the other side of the aisle, require \n     appreciative acknowledgment and our support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Michael Casserly,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n     October 5, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: We write to ask you to vote for S. 143, the \n     Workforce Development Act when it comes before the Senate for \n     consideration on Tuesday, October 10. This legislation \n     maintains the integrity of federal investment in the quality \n     of vocational-technical education and access to adult \n     education, and respects state sovereignty and local authority \n     for education. The separate allocation for workforce \n     education programs and provisions for the active involvement \n     of state and local education agencies and officials in the \n     planning of a comprehensive workforce development system are \n     critical components of America's high-skill, high-wage \n     economy of the 21st Century.\n       We enthusiastically support the following provisions of S. \n     143:\n       A guaranteed allocation of block grant funds for workforce \n     education programs and activities;\n       Planning and administration of the workforce education \n     program by state and local education authorities and \n     postsecondary institutions, together with procedures for \n     their participation in the development and approval of \n     comprehensive workforce development plans;\n       A uniform substate formula for distribution of workforce \n     education funds to local schools and postsecondary \n     institutions; and\n       Assurances that state and local financial effort will be \n     maintained and that federal funds will supplement, not \n     supplant state and local resources for vocational-technical \n     and adult education.\n       Together these provisions will help sustain a national \n     priority on the quality of the vocational-technical education \n     our students need and access to adult education. They will \n     more closely connect programs under this Act to federal, \n     state and local funding streams for improved education and \n     training. We urge your support of these provisions and call \n     your attention to potential floor amendments.\n\n\n               SUPPORT ONE-THIRD ALLOCATION FOR EDUCATION\n\n       First, we have a major concern about the total funding for \n     vocational/technical education under this Act and seek your \n     support to increase it. The specific allocations for \n     education and job training within the Workforce Development \n     Act were initially calculated to approximate current federal \n     investment in the antecedent programs. However, removal of \n     the JOBS and food stamp employment authorities from the block \n     grant subantitally reduces the total funds available for the \n     Act. The potential impact the legislation offers for planning \n     and sustaining necessary workforce development is jeopardized \n     if the minimum allocations for workforce education and \n     workforce employment programs are insufficient. We strongly \n     urge your support of the Pell-Kennedy amendment which will be \n     offered to raise the guaranteed allocation of education and \n     job training funds from 25 percent of each component to 33\\1/\n     3\\ percent of the block grant for each component.\n\n\n                OPPOSE UNDERMING OF WORKFORCE EDUCATION\n\n       Second, we urge also that you oppose any amendment which \n     would undermine or eliminate specific allocations of funds \n     for workforce education activities and oppose any amendment \n     which would supersede state sovereignty and local control in \n     the governance and administration of education.\n       On behalf of the students, parents, teachers, school \n     leaders, postsecondary providers, and state education \n     officials we represent, we urge your support of S. 143 \n     together with the positions on amendments listed above. Thank \n     you for consideration of our views and concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences.\n       American Association of School Administrators.\n       American Vocational Association.\n       California Department of Education.\n       Council for Educational Development and Research.\n       Council of Chief State School Officers.\n       Council of Great City Schools.\n       National Association of Secondary School Principals.\n       National Association of State Boards of Education.\n       National Association of State Directors of Vocational and \n     Technical Education Consortium.\n       National School Boards Association.\n       Texas Education Agency.\n       Vocational Industrial Clubs of America.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                        National Association of Manufacturers,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 4, 1995.\n     Hon. Nancy Kassebaum,\n     Chair, Labor and Human Resources Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kassebaum: For more than two years, we have \n     supported consolidation and reform of the current plethora of \n     federal job-training programs. We congratulate you, as the \n     chairwoman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, \n     on your persistent and creative efforts to design a system \n     that is cost-effective, reduces duplications and targets real \n     jobs with systematic involvement of the business community.\n       You have consistently responded to our concerns. You have \n     been open to the views of the business community as well as \n     other constituencies. You have worked in a bipartisan fashion \n     with Senator Kennedy and your committee to structure a fair \n     approach. S. 143, the Workforce Development Act of 1995, \n     creates a road map for reform and should receive the full \n     endorsement of the Senate when it takes up this measure next \n     week.\n       The status quo is unacceptable. While there may be ways in \n     which S. 143 could be made even better, we believe swift \n     passage is the correct course. Then we can begin to address \n     the need for a job-training system that works effectively \n     today, when fewer dollars must be spent more wisely. We plan \n     to work closely with you and others on these matters.\n       Job-training reform is long overdue. It is essential to \n     move forward with the effort to create effective programs \n     that will help the U.S. workforce be the best in the world. \n     We at the NAM and our affiliates at the state level plan to \n     be vigorously involved in the eventual implementation of this \n     effort.\n           Sincerely,\n     Paul R. Huard.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America,\n                                  Washington, DC, October 5, 1995.\n       Members of the U.S. Senate: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \n     representing 215,000 businesses, 3,000 state and local \n     chambers of commerce, 1,200 trade and professional \n     associations, and 73 American Chambers of Commerce abroad, \n     urges your support for the Workforce Development Act (S. \n     143), which is scheduled for floor consideration on October \n     10.\n       The Workforce Development Act, sponsored by Senator Nancy \n     Kassebaum (R-KS), contains many provisions that the Chamber \n     supports, S. 143 would consolidate and decentralize roughly \n     100 federal education and training programs into a simpler, \n     integrated block grant system for states. The bill also would \n     enable small businesses and local chambers of commerce to \n     compete with the public sector in the delivery of education \n     and training services; recognize the important role of \n     business in the design and implementation of the new system; \n     and promote the effective use of technology and the \n     development of labor-market information to orient education \n     and training services.\n       In addition to these provisions, the Chamber is encouraged \n     that the Workforce Development Act maintains the important \n     goal of preparing students and workers for skills needed in \n     the modern workplace. S. 143 aims to achieve this goal by \n     adopting many new approaches to workforce development. \n     Examples include promoting the use of vouchers rather than \n     funding streams for institutions and programs; establishing \n     user-friendly, one-stop delivery centers where individuals \n     and employers can share and obtain relevant job information; \n     opening the door to new measures of accountability rather \n     than relying on the old measure bureaucratic processes; and \n     encouraging the creation of effective business-education \n     partnerships.\n       Many, if not most, of these provisions are found in the \n     Chamber's policy statement on restructuring the federal \n     training and employment system. A copy of this statement is \n     attached, for your review.\n       For American business, the knowledge and skills of \n     employees are the critical factors for economic success and \n     international competitiveness. The Workforce Development Act \n     embodies language that can help achieve this end of creating \n     a world-class workforce development system that is responsive \n     to today's skill needs. Again, we urge your support for S. \n     143, and your opposition to any weakening amendments. Doing \n     so will dramatically enhance the possibility of enacting \n     meaningful workforce development legislation during the 104th \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n     R. Bruce Josten.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                National Alliance of Business,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 1995.\n     Hon. Nancy Landon Kassebaum,\n        Chairperson, Committee on Labor and Human Resources, U.S. \n                                           Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kassebaum: On behalf of the Alliance, I \n     strongly support Senate passage of S. 143, the Workforce \n     Development Act of 1995. I commend you highly for the \n     consistent bipartisan, consultative approach you have \n     employed, especially with the business community, while \n     developing the text of S. 143 for Senate action on October \n     10. The legislation takes an historic step toward \n     consolidating dozens of education and training programs into \n     an integrated workforce development system for the states.\n       The business community supports the innovations in the bill \n     authorizing governors to use proven methods for business \n     involvement such as establishing state and local workforce \n     development boards to help ensure a close link between the \n     services provided and skills needed in the modern workplace. \n     We support one-stop career centers and the use of vouchers. \n     We applaud the emphasis on \n\n[[Page S 14830]]\n     program results and accountability for performance, especially against \n     high standards, and the integration of academic achievement \n     with work-based learning.\n       Provisions in the bill giving a lead role in the design, \n     management, and evaluation of workforce development systems \n     are particularly good when the governor chooses the option of \n     establishing state and local workforce development boards. We \n     believe that a workforce development system will not work \n     effectively without a lead role of employers. Our view, as \n     you know, prefers to mandate the establishment of local \n     workforce development boards for this purpose.\n       As you go on to perfect this bill throughout the \n     legislative process, I look forward to working with you to \n     strengthen the role of business in the system, so that the \n     bill's primary goal of workforce preparation and development \n     meets the competitive needs of employers.\n       Under the bipartisan leadership you have employed and the \n     continued cooperation between the business community and your \n     committee, I am confident that this legislation can result in \n     the most effective workforce preparation system possible for \n     our country.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William H. Kolberg,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Over the past few years, I believe a bipartisan \nconsensus has developed on the need to overhaul current Federal \ntraining efforts. I want to especially acknowledge the cooperation of \nthe ranking member, Senator Kennedy, in moving this bill forward.\n  Although we may not be in complete agreement about the solution, \nSenator Kennedy and I share the desire to reform the current fragmented \nsystem. Senator Kennedy has been a strong advocate for consolidation at \nthe State level. His input in strengthening this bill has been most \nconstructive. I am appreciative of his efforts and support in seeing \nthis legislation fashioned and brought to the floor.\n  Past job training legislation has reflected a tradition of bipartisan \ncooperation and support. I hope, as we consider this bill today, we \nwill be able to resolve our remaining differences and emerge with \nstrong work force development legislation that all of us can support \nand that will be of benefit to all who will be served in the process.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, later on today, hopefully, we will have \nan opportunity to take action on an area of public policy which is of \ngreat significance and importance to working families in this country \nand of great significance and importance to the United States as a \nnation and its ability to compete--be a competitive society in our own \ncountry and also for the United States to be able to compete in the \nworld.\n  At the outset, I commend the Chair of our Human Resource Committee, \nSenator Kassebaum, for her tireless work in bringing this legislation \nto the U.S. Senate and for her enormously effective manner in reaching \nout to Republicans and Democrats alike in trying to sift through \nvarious recommendations and ideas and suggestions, to galvanize those \ninto an effort which reflects her driving sense that what is necessary \nis that we develop training programs that will be suitable for this \nNation as we move into the next century, but that also understands \nthere is a proliferation of those programs and there has to be a \nconsolidation, a direction, a flexibility that is retained at the local \nlevel in communities, with inputs from the States and local \ncommunities, from the business and private sector as well as workers in \nthose communities.\n  This has been a challenging responsibility. I think all of us in the \nSenate marvel at her energy and her prioritizing this important area of \npublic policy. To many, probably, in this institution as well as across \nthe country, training programs appear to be something that are rather \nmundane, but we recognize that without training, continuing upgrading \nof skills, the inputs of education, the interlocking relationships \nbetween training programs and the private sector, the impact on \nindividuals and families in this country really would be profound.\n  So, this is a very important effort. It was a priority of Senator \nKassebaum since the time she became Chair and a priority of hers long \nbefore, when she was a driving force in our committee to make better \nsense out of our training and education programs. All of us in the \nSenate are really grateful for her continued leadership in this very, \nvery important policy area.\n  For the past 3 years, the members of our committee worked together to \nconsolidate the outdated, overlapping variety of Federal job training \nand job education programs to create a more effective system providing \nthese services and opportunities for youths and adults. The challenge \nfacing the Nation on this issue is extremely serious. It is gratifying \nwe are able to address it in a genuine spirit of bipartisanship.\n  For nearly two decades, the income gap between the rich and the poor \nin the United States has been widening. I will come back to this issue \nin a few moments. A major part of the problem is that the wages of low- \nand middle-income workers have been stagnating or declining throughout \nthis period while upper income groups have received much of the benefit \nof a growing economy. That pattern cannot continue without imposing \nunacceptable costs on our Nation and our security. This legislation is \na key part of our answer to that challenge. It offers a better approach \nto job training and job education that are the heart of our efforts to \nimprove the skills of American workers in the modern economy.\n  We are very much in agreement on the need to consolidate and \nstreamline the current fragmented system of multiple job training \nprograms at the local level. Many of our early ideas came in response \nto the bipartisan ``America's Choice, High Skills or Low Wages?'' \nreport in 1990, of the Commission on the Skills of the American Work \nForce, led by former Secretaries of Labor, Bill Brock and F. Ray \nMarshall. It was a truly bipartisan effort where we had the former \nSecretary of Labor under President Carter and the former Secretary of \nLabor, Bill Brock, who had been a Republican Senator from Tennessee. \nThe members of their committee, which was reflective of business and \nlabor, made a series of recommendations which I will come back to in \njust a few moments.\n  One of the major problems highlighted in the report was that the \nUnited States is not well organized to provide the highly skilled \nworkers needed to support the emerging high performance work \norganizations. Public policy for worker training has been largely \npassive. This legislation is, in large measure, a long overdue response \nto that report. It addresses the maze of training and education \nprograms, created over many years, for youths and adults seeking the \nskills and training needed for successful careers.\n  The job training portions of the Workforce Development Act are a \nmajor improvement over current law. They provide the information \nnecessary to tell us, for the first time, whether job training programs \nare successful in improving the employment skills and earning power of \nAmerican workers, and they provide needed incentives and sanctions to \nhelp us reach our goals.\n  One of the dilemmas we find ourselves in at the present time is, with \nthe proliferation of various training programs, in many instances, too \nmany instances, the individual being trained is uncertain of the skills \nthat he or she is actually obtaining; at the time of the employment, \nthe employer is unsure of those particular skills; and the taxpayers \nare unsure how their tax dollars are actually being invested and how \nvaluable that investment really is. That is too often the current \nsituation.\n  This is an attempt to make sure, No. 1, individuals who are involved \nin training programs are going to receive the good training and the \nskills necessary to compete in the economy; No. 2, that the employer is \ngoing to know the skills that individual actually has; and, No. 3, the \ntaxpayer is going to know the investment in that individual and in that \nprogram is going to mean a stronger economy for us in the future that \nis going to benefit all of the American community. It is that desire to \nachieve, with variety, in a flexible way, those goals that is the \nunderlying factor in terms of the support for this legislation.\n  The bill also lays the foundation for accomplishing two of the \nhighest priorities of a bipartisan majority of the last Congress: \neffective school-to-work programs for non-college-bound youths, and the \none-stop career centers for adults. \n\n[[Page S 14831]]\n\n  When we recognize that three out of four young people who graduate \nfrom high school are not going on to higher education but are going on \ninto the job market, and when we take a look at what is happening in \nthe job market for those individuals who just graduate from high \nschool, the difficulty they have in getting an early entry job that \nprovides any meaningful opportunity of acquiring skills necessary to \nmove forward in the economy, we understand the challenge before the \ncountry, particularly the limited opportunities for many of these young \npeople. It has been as a result, again, of the bipartisan efforts in \nthe school-to-work programs that we have found advantage in addressing \nthis issue. There have been a number of States that have been moving, \nwith the encouragement of the school-to-work program, aggressively in \nthis area with very, very strong support.\n  I can think of examples, both of Governor Thompson, a Republican, and \nhis strong support for those concepts in the State of Wisconsin; also \nthe former Governor of the State of Maine, who had been very active in \nthe development of those programs.\n  This legislation would consolidate funds from a variety of programs \nand provide funds to States in the form of block grants. Major programs \nto be consolidated include the Job Training Partnership Act, the JTPA, \nCarl Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Act, and the Adult \nVocation Act. In addition, nearly 90 other job training and job \neducation programs are included in this consolidation effort.\n  Mr. President, this effort that we have here today follows the \nattempt by Congress to be more effective in terms of the training \nprograms. I think all of us understand the complexity and the \ndifficulty that we have in doing a good job in terms of encouraging the \nacquisition of high grade skills in the individual and in the labor \nmarket area.\n  This represents, I think, the fourth great effort that this country \nhas been involved in various training programs. We had the manpower \ndemonstration administration years ago where we went through the CETA \nprograms. They were discarded in the early 1980's with the leadership \nand the bipartisan effort that was made under the Senator from Indiana, \nDan Quayle, in the development of the JTPA, which was an attempt to try \nto bring leaders within the local communities into the development of \nwhat was called the PIC organizations so that we would address and \ndevelop the skills that were necessary within the local community using \nleaders, business, community leaders, workers as well in those \nparticular areas.\n  There have been a number of different communities where that \nparticular formula worked extraordinarily well. One of them is my own \ncity of Boston where they developed within the private sector what was \ncalled effectively the technology prep schools which involved the \nfinancial institutions in the high schools and a number of the health \nprofessions in high schools. The development of the public and private \npartnership had a very significant success in a number of our \ncommunities. But still, there were too many areas where there were gaps \nand failings. It is with the review of both the advantages and the \ndisadvantages of that program that Senator Kassebaum has developed the \nWorkforce Development Act to take advantage of the lessons that were \ndeveloped through that JTPA in the early 1980's and also the \nrecommendations that have been made upon review of that program and how \nthat program actually could be strengthened.\n  With the funds available under the block grants, the bill requires \neach State to spend at least 25 percent of the totals on work force \neducation and another 25 percent on work force employment activities. \nThe remaining 50 percent will be placed in a flex account by which the \nState will be free to assign to another educator the employment \nactivities. There is always the balance between giving the maximum \nflexibility into a community that can do an extremely effective job.\n  I am very proud of the initiatives which have been developed in my \nown State of Massachusetts that really developed under Governor Dukakis \nand have been continued under Governor Weld. In particular, Lieutenant \nGovernor Cellucci has really done an extraordinary job with maximum \nflexibility.\n  So we want the maximum flexibility to permit these effective programs \nto grow, and then we also do not want to be into a situation where we \nare just effectively providing funding that will not be used \neffectively for those purposes of training and enhancing education. It \nis balanced.\n  Senator Kassebaum has fought and led our committee with great insight \nto make sure that the degrees of flexibility are going to be preserved \nat the local level to the maximum extent possible. This is something \nwhich I think is ensured in this legislation.\n  The dramatic and fundamental change proposed in the legislation will \ntake place under a 3-year State work force development plan. Within \nthis plan the State will include a strategic analysis which will \ndescribe the allocation choices for the funds in the flex account. The \nplan will also include the activities the State will undertake within \nthe work force education and employment functions in order to meet the \nestablished benchmarks and goals. This bill mandates that each State's \nplan must include the establishment of a comprehensive one-stop \ndelivery system which will provide the required course services, labor \nmarket information, and job placement activities. The corps services \nwill include skill assessment, job search, placement assistance, \nemployment screening referral and local labor market information--that \nsort of one-stop area so that individuals will be able to come into \nthis one-stop area where there will be the assessment of that \nindividual's skills where the job market is, which training programs \nhave been effective, and being able to use the latest in terms of \ninformation services so individuals will be able to know which training \nprograms result in individuals actually gaining employment, what their \nwages will be, reviewing of what the effectiveness of that program will \nbe in 2 years or 3 years down the road so people will say, ``Well, when \nwe go into this program, we know that we have the best opportunity \ndeveloping the kind of skills and that we will have employment not just \nfor 6 months, but for 2, 3 years, and our opportunities to make \nadvancement will be considerable.''\n  That kind of consolidation with one-stop shopping is virtually \nnonexistent in some communities where there has been development of \nthose programs. The opportunities now with the new kinds of information \nsharing, computers, and research offers up extraordinary possibilities \nin terms of enhanced training in the evaluation of these programs.\n  I underscore what the Senator has said; that is, this very careful \nevaluation of the various programs that are being developed so that we \nwill have the best information about knowing which programs are working \nand which ones are weaker.\n  Another hallmark of the legislation is the extent of flexibility \nprovided to the States. In those States committed to developing the \npostdelivery system, the benefits will be substantial to those with \nsignificant information and assistance. As an example, the work force \nemployment activities are accompanied by an extensive list of \npermissive services which may be offered to recipients, including the \non-the-job training skill and greater entrepreneurial training.\n  As we know now as compared to where we were 20 or 30 years ago, even \nin the early part of the 1960's, for someone who worked in the Quincy \nshipyard on the south shore of Massachusetts--their father probably \nworked there and their grandfather worked there, and they worked \nthere--they were able to make a very good living. What we have now in \nthe development of the labor market is a recognition that an individual \nwill probably have seven different jobs over the course of their \nlifetime. And those jobs, in many instances, will necessitate different \nkinds of skills.\n  We are dealing with an entirely different kind of labor market \nsituation. This is an attempt to really move us from the past in terms \nof the types of skills into the modern age and doing it in a variety of \ndifferent ways that have been outlined by Senator Kassebaum.\n  There will be amendments that will be offered by our colleagues. I \nwill refer to those in just a moment or two. \n\n[[Page S 14832]]\n\n  With respect to the job education, the funds come primarily from \nvocational education and adult education. The legislation requires a \nvariety of corps activities to be funded with a 25-percent share of the \nblock grant and the flex account allocated to education. These corps \nactivities include vocational education, technology prep, secondary and \npostsecondary linkages, literacy and basic education services for adult \nand out-of-school youth, and the integrated academic curriculums.\n  As Senator Kassebaum also pointed out, this bill authorizes $2.1 \nbillion for education and training activities for at-risk youth. These \nfunds will help to fund the Job Corps activities.\n  I will also come back to that issue in the course of the debate, and \nthere will be an amendment offered to change the Job Corps rather \nsignificantly doing effective kinds of evaluation but basically to \npreserve the basic and fundamental structure on that program. We will \nhave an opportunity to debate that later in the course of the day.\n  We have also included a mandatory requirement for the summer youth \nprograms be funded from these resources. The summer youth program is \nenormously important. Also included in the summer youth programs will \nbe the educational components which have been found to be so important \nand have made a real difference in the significance of the summer youth \nprograms and also tying those to various employment opportunities.\n  We have seen, for example, in Boston how the public and the private \nsectors have moved very effectively together, and how there has been a \nreal effective utilization of summer youth and moving young individuals \nactually into the private sector employment as a result of either 1 or \n2 years participation in summer youth programs.\n  So that the way this is organized I think really emphasizes the most \neffective types of summer youth programs.\n  As Senator Kassebaum pointed out, Senator DeWine was particularly \ninvolved in the shaping of those programs.\n  We have also made substantial progress in a variety of other issues \nsuch as retaining the employment service, placing a cap on the economic \ndevelopment expenditures, and protection for employees who participate \nin the training programs.\n  Also we are pleased to be able to remove the Workforce Development \nAct from the welfare reform bill recently passed by the Senate. This \nact is eminently deserving of independent consideration by Congress.\n  The series of amendments that we will offer today represent the road \nwe still must travel to finish the job. I believe one of the most \nimportant amendments is to honor our commitment to the dislocated \nworkers by retaining the trade adjustment assistance programs. Only a \nyear ago, or 2 years ago, Senators in both parties gave strong support \nto NAFTA and GATT. They decided that the trade adjustment assistance is \nthe answer to the crisis of workers dislocated by expanding world \ntrade. Those promises to working men and women will be broken by the \npending bill.\n  In addition, the bill lacks a clear commitment to other dislocated \nworkers. What are we to say to the factory worker whose plant is closed \nand is moved to Mexico, or to the coal miners who have lost their jobs, \nor to the timber workers who received their pink slips, or to the bank \nemployees who are lost in the latest megamerger? What are we to say to \nthe people who need training, or education, or job placement services? \nUnless this legislation is amended, we will be destroying the hopes and \ndreams of tens of thousands of workers. We have a special \nresponsibility.\n  The trade adjustment concept goes back a number of years to actually \nthe early 1960's. But we have renewed as a key part of the commitment \nof this body--and Presidents alike--a commitment for trade adjustments \nfor those individuals who fall into the categories and lose their \nemployment as a result of NAFTA and the GATT. I believe that commitment \nshould be retained.\n  I know we will have more of an opportunity to get into that \ndiscussion later on in the day.\n  There will also be an amendment offered to preserve the Federal role \nin the Job Corps Program and to ensure the program remains strong and \neffective enough to continue its excellent service to our Nation's \nyouth. Republicans in the House increased the funding for the program. \nThey called it one of the few Federal programs that is successful and \neffective. Instead of addressing legitimate concerns of the current \nprogram, the Senate, I believe, goes in an unwise path on this issue. \nOur Members will make the changes necessary to reform and strengthen \nthis program.\n  The test of the legislation will be how well it prepares the Nation's \nwork force for the changing economy in the years ahead. American \nworkers are the backbone of the economy. If we invest wisely in them, \nthe country will prosper. If we fail to do so, the current problems \nwill fester, and the economy and the Nation will suffer.\n  In closing, I want to recognize a member of my staff whose ability \nand commitment was indispensable in the preparation of this landmark \nlegislation. Steve Spinner, who served on my staff for the past 2 \nyears, helped guide us at every step even as the cancer which finally \ntook his life was ravishing his body. In a sense, this legislation is \nhis monument. To his wife and daughter we extend our heartfelt thoughts \nand prayers as we carry on his work.\n  Mr. President, I want to just mention a number of our colleagues who \nare not on the committee who have been very much committed to the \nshaping of this legislation. First of all, on the committee, Senator \nDodd, for emphasizing the importance of the programs that are related \nto national activities, recognizing that there are particular \nchallenges that can affect either particular States or regions as the \nresult of the downsizing of Federal contracting. We have seen that \nissue here in a number of different communities or with particular \ndisasters--the floods in the Midwest, earthquakes, fires in the far \nWest which in many of these instances pass through various \njurisdictions and there has been a national impact.\n  Decisions are being made in the national interest which adversely \naffect individuals and their families in a very significant way.\n  No. 1, they lose their job, and with little opportunity, perhaps if \nthey are older, to acquire skills. And we want to make a special effort \nto ensure that their concerns will be recognized.\n  That program in the past has been utilized effectively, and I am \nenormously grateful to Senator Kassebaum and our colleagues on the \ncommittee for understanding the importance of this program. She has \nbeen unwilling to accept as broad a program as many of us would like \nbut I do think has been willing to accept the essential aspect of the \nprogram, and we are very grateful for the cooperation we received in \nthat area.\n  And No. 2, in another very important area which will be talked about \nby our friend and colleague, the Senator from Louisiana, Senator \nBreaux, with the development of the vouchers for dislocated workers so \nthat you can maximize flexibility by the individual in their ability to \nseek out good training programs and give them a greater opportunity and \nfreedom to make judgments in terms of their own future. This is \nsomething that has been considered by the committee. I think the way it \nhas been shaped will give us a good opportunity for a very solid \nprogram that can be evaluated carefully and may very well offer great \nopportunity in the future for expansion of training.\n  Again, I am grateful to the Senator for her willingness to accept the \nconcept of the approach. It is not all of what was initially offered \nbut is certainly something that was, I think, a very commendable idea, \naccepted in the House. And I commend Senator Breaux and Senator \nDaschle, who have been our principal advocates of this, not just on \nthis legislation but in previous efforts as well.\n  Later, we will have focus on the trade adjustment by Senator Moynihan \nand Senator Roth with an amendment. We will have an amendment on the \nJob Corps by Senator Specter and Senator Simon, and we will also have \nan adult education earmark by Senator Jeffords and Senator Pell. And I \nunderstand there are a few other amendments as well.\n  Given the magnitude of this legislation, I think it is a real \ntribute, again, to the chair for the fact that we do have some areas we \nwill have to have \n\n[[Page S 14833]]\nvotes on in the Senate, but given the magnitude of this issue and the \nconsolidation of all of these programs and working them through is \nreally a great tribute to her leadership.\n  I will just say finally, because I see other colleagues who are \nprepared to address the Senate, what this legislation for this Senator \nis really about is to try to make sure, as we are moving in the latter \npart of this century and into the next century, we are going to see \nprogress made for all Americans and American families in as great a \nlockstep as possible.\n  From 1950 to 1978, what we saw was that the country was really \neffectively growing together; with the progress that was being made \nduring that period of time it was effectively shared by all the members \nof our society and the greatest amount went to those on the lower \nlevels but everyone in the middle and the quintile, the top 20 percent, \nwere also participating in the expansion and the robust nature of our \neconomy.\n  What we are seeing now from 1980 effectively to 1993 is that those \nare the upper sectors which are benefiting to the greatest degree; \nthose in the middle and in the middle lower are the ones that are \ncontinuing to fall behind. We have no magic wand to be able to bring \nall of these groups here into the general prosperity area. It is going \nto take a combination of different efforts on our part.\n  But one of the very important efforts will be to try to make sure \nthat individuals who are in these areas are going to have both \neducation and skill to the extent that we can provide those. Obviously, \na key aspect of the education is done at the local level and at the \nState level. In higher education, obviously, we have an important \nresponsibility. We have also responsibility in other areas as well.\n  But in the training programs, that is an area where we can try to \nensure that there will be expanded skills for American workers. We can \ntry to make sure, and build successful programs that will ensure, that \nAmerican workers, as they move into the next century, are going to be \nat the cutting edge of all new skills.\n  We know our competitors are doing that. If you read the America's \nChoice Report, which I would suggest to anyone that really wants to \nhave a good insight into where we are or where we have been and also \nwhere our competition is going, you will find out that most of the \nother industrial nations of the world are moving very aggressively in \nupgrading their skills in a continuing process. They are doing it with \ntraining programs, specific training programs. And they are doing \ntraining programs on the job and encouraging the businesses in those \ncountries to participate. And those businesses in those countries do \nparticipate.\n  That is not the typical example here in the United States. It is only \nabout 6 or 8 percent of total corporations that actually move with \naggressive kinds of training programs. And most of those training \nprograms are more to the white-collar workers rather than to the blue-\ncollar workers.\n  We are trying to demonstrate by example that we have maximum \nassurance that there will be different opportunities for the \nacquisition of skills and education for the working families in this \ncountry which will effectively enhance their opportunity to improve \ntheir own economic vitality and the vital strength of our national \neconomy.\n  Mr. President, I see others here who want to address the Senate. I am \ngrateful again for the cooperation that was given by all members of the \ncommittee, as Senator Kassebaum has mentioned. We are very grateful for \nthe participation of Democratic Senators as well as our Republican \ncolleagues.\n  We look forward to addressing these issues during the course of the \nday. We know many of our colleagues have just come back. This is \nlegislation which has been announced. We have been available to talk \nwith our colleagues in the Senate. We are prepared to debate these \nissues and to get a judgment made on these matters so that we can move \nthis very important legislation forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time is there?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas has 4 hours 15 \nminutes, the Senator from Massachusetts 3 hours 30 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time does the Senator want?\n  Mr. KERREY. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. I rise today as an original cosponsor of S. 143, the \nWorkforce Development Act. I should say at the outset I consider this \nto be one of the two or three most important pieces of legislation this \nbody will consider this year.\n  I want to, at the outset, commend the Senator from Kansas, Senator \nKassebaum, for her hard work and willingness to reach out and include \nanyone who has an interest in work force development. I appreciate very \nmuch her openness, her diligence, her pursuit of the objectives. As a \nconsequence of all those things, I believe it is likely this \nlegislation will pass.\n  Indeed, I believe that it is one of the, as I said, two or three most \nimportant measures which will produce something good at the local \nlevel. Whether or not people at the local level will actually see some \nbenefit, with this piece of legislation, Mr. President, I believe \nstrongly that they will.\n  I also want to commend the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nsomewhat carefully here. I introduced him not long ago, and the \naudience began to laugh as I did. So I have to be careful. I praise the \nSenator from Massachusetts. It was his request for a study 5 years \nago--I believe it was from the GAO--that has provided the foundation \nfor this bill, the foundation being that we have well over 100 \ndifferent job training programs at the Federal level and the lack of \ncoordination and the lack of accountability makes it difficult for us \nto be able to say in our States that we are doing all we can to solve \nthe problem of inadequate skills in the work force.\n  So, Mr. President, as to whether or not this particular legislation \nwill solve a problem, will there be an effect from the cause of our \npassing this law, of changing this law that is beneficial in the United \nStates, the answer has to be, in my judgment, enthusiastically and \noverwhelmingly yes.\n  Last week, during our recess, there was a great deal of attention \ngiven to a census in the Department of Labor evaluation of the U.S. \neconomy that indicated that, as a consequence of the economic growth \nthat has occurred in the past few years, there is less poverty in \nAmerica. That is quite good news. And it is an important piece of \ninformation for those of us who still believe it is one of our most \nimportant moral challenges to try to help those Americans who live in \npoverty and that we need to have economic growth in order to accomplish \nthat.\n  That economic growth will help those who are poor, and is an awfully \nimportant and good piece of news for us. But contained in that report \nas well, Mr. President, was an indication that there is not only an \nincreased concentration of wealth and power, but there is a \ncontinuation of a trend toward a widening of incomes between those at \nthe top end of the economic spectrum and those at the bottom end.\n  This piece of legislation addresses one of the most important reasons \nwhy, when we see economic growth, we do not see an increase in \nprosperity in the middle class; we do not see a growing middle class. \nAnd the reason, Mr. President, is that the marketplace for today \nrequires substantially more skills than it has in the past. It places a \npremium on it. Those with skills are secure. Their wages and salaries \nare being bid up, and those without skills are seeing their wages not \nbeing bid up. They are struggling out there.\n  In addition, Mr. President, the way we have organized our job \ntraining programs is inadequate. Not only is there lack of \naccountability, but there are eligibility requirements that make it \ndifficult for people to get into programs and difficult for Governors \nand business people to engage in the task of working with our schools. \nThere are all sorts of institutional and structural barriers that exist \nat the local level that this piece of legislation addresses.\n  So I say to those who, when they go home on recess and are faced with \nquestions from citizens, ``What are you doing that is constructive? Are \nyou passing or changing any laws that will \n\n[[Page S 14834]]\nimprove the quality of life in our community?'' this is a piece of \nlegislation that you can point to and say, ``Yes. This will help.'' If \nyou change the law with S. 143, there is no doubt in my mind 10 years \nfrom now, as we examine the data as it relates to our economy, we will \nsee people with greater skills and greater income as a consequence of \nthis legislation.\n  Importantly, I say parenthetically to my colleagues, there is another \npiece of legislation that would also enable us to say yes to people at \nthe local level if they ask us if a law was going to benefit them. \nInterestingly, this one was also sponsored by Senator Kassebaum and \nSenator Kennedy. It is S. 1028. I hope that this body will take it up \nthis year. It is the Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995.\n  Last year during the debate over health care there was almost \nunanimous agreement, almost unanimous from Republicans and Democrats, \nthat the least we could do would be to change the law to end the \npractice of discriminating against people because of preexisting \nconditions and saying to them that they are not able to port their \ninsurance from one job to another.\n  The GAO has evaluated this piece of legislation. Twenty-five million \nAmericans would benefit. Again, one of the most impressive tests of \nthis piece of legislation, if S. 143, the Work Force Development Act, \npasses, is it presents me with an opportunity to say to citizens in \nNebraska, ``Here is a change in the law that will benefit us at the \nlocal level.''\n  So I praise, at the beginning, the distinguished Senator from Kansas \nand the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts for their work on this \nlegislation and their work, as well, on S. 1028. I hope that both \npieces of legislation will become law in this session.\n  Mr. President, we recently considered welfare reform legislation on \nthe floor of the Senate. I voted against that legislation because I \nbelieve, in fact, it will make things worse, not better. There were \nmany differences of opinion on how to best accomplish the goal of \nrevising a welfare system that has unquestionably grown unresponsive to \nthose on welfare, as well as those who are trying to make welfare work.\n  But the one point of agreement throughout the welfare debate was the \nneed for work, for meaningful employment in the private sector, to take \nthe place of welfare benefits. I believe this bill, the Workforce \nDevelopment Act of 1995, will do more to free dependence upon public \nassistance than any other legislation we have considered this year.\n  Job training and education are the foundations of meaningful \nemployment, and meaningful employment is the foundation of a strong \neconomy. A productive, employed work force translates into less \nreliance on welfare and, more importantly, leads to a strong self-\nreliant and globally competitive work force. This all translates into \neconomic security for each American in the work force and for our \nNation as a whole.\n  If we are to have a well-prepared work force with the training and \nability to enter the 21st century, it is essential that we act now, and \nit is essential that we pass this legislation. We need to continue to \nwork to create high-paying jobs in this country with site-specific \ntraining. We must meet the needs of both the employee and the employer \nin the community in which they work and operate.\n  Taxpayers spend $25 billion a year for job training. It is a price we \npay for a duplicative system which is not measured and not terribly \naccountable. We have paid a price in frustration, as those involved in \njob training on the local and State levels can readily attest, and we \nhave paid the price in underemployment and unemployment, as we have not \nfocused our dollars on the needs of local communities with their \nspecific needs and industries in mind.\n  The current system of 90 separate job training programs, each \nclamoring to achieve the same goal, leaves those looking for training \nto hop from one location or program to another. In addition to being \nduplicative, these 90 programs are run from Washington, DC, rather than \nfrom the communities that understand what skills and training are both \nneeded and effective at the local level.\n  There are times when I believe it is constructive for the Federal \nGovernment to shift the responsibility and the power back to the local \nand the State level, and job training is a clear example. Those of us \nwho have been Governors, both Republicans and Democrats, will say, I \nbelieve, that it is the States that have the best programs for \ndeveloping jobs and for developing the training programs for those \njobs.\n  There are other incidents where I do not believe that is the case. I \nbelieve that the Federal Government ought to be responsible for \nfiguring out how to make health insurance affordable for all Americans. \nIt pleases me today that we have strong bipartisan support for \nMedicare. That was not always the case. There was a time when \nRepublicans were critical of Medicare. This year, they are not only \nsupportive of that Great Society program, but they want to preserve it \nfor our children and grandchildren. The fundamental principle upon \nwhich Medicare rests is that some Americans, regardless of how hard \nthey work and how hard they try, are not going to be able to purchase \nhealth insurance. That, it seems to me, should be a Federal program.\n  I believe it would be a big mistake for this Congress to pass a law \nthat would convert Medicare into a block grant program, but it is a \ngreat move forward for this Congress to change the law of block \ngranting the responsibility of job training programs.\n  The Workforce Development Act has as its goal the meaningful \nemployment of every American capable of working. It takes two very \nimportant steps toward accomplishing the goal.\n  First, the Workforce Development Act consolidates 90 job training \nprograms into a single block grant to States. It does not just block \ngrant to the States, it develops a coordinated work force development \nsystem. Our current job training system is not just duplicative, it is \nalso confusing. Consolidation in the specific language of this bill \ndoes not just consolidate, it develops a system at the State and local \nlevel that will transform our job training system into a unified system \nof job training and training-related education.\n  This bill will end the frustrating process of hopping from one \nlocation to another in search of employment services by providing for \nthe establishment of a one-stop delivery system for job search, \nscreening, referral and placement, as well as skill assessments.\n  The one-stop centers contained in this legislation are unquestionably \nthe foundation for the effort, but there is considerably a lot more \nthat is done in this legislation that gives me confidence we are not \njust block granting and turning over to the States the responsibility; \nwe are making sure that the taxpayers are getting their money's worth \nfor this effort.\n  Mr. President, this legislation does not just block grant to the \nStates, it empowers people at the local level and it empowers people in \nthe private sector. It unquestionably will change the environment for \njob training in America and give citizens who care about job training \nan opportunity of participating and designing programs at the local \nlevel.\n  Second, the responsibility for directing and operating these training \nprograms is turned over to the State governments. This legislation \nencourages communities to work together to craft effective job-training \nprograms. It requires the participation of those who have a stake in \nhaving a skilled labor force and who understand the needs of local \nlabor markets.\n  It provides flexibility to the States and local communities for the \ndesign and implementation of job training efforts. But, Mr. President, \nequally important to me, this legislation has monetary sanctions and, \nfor the first time, establishes benchmarks and makes our job training \nprograms accountable. States are not just given flexibility. In \nexchange for significant and desirable flexibility, they are also, for \nthe first time, going to be held accountable for performance. They must \ndevelop a plan, and that plan is not only presented to the Federal \nGovernment but, more importantly, that plan is presented to the people \nin each of the individual States.\n  This legislation provides for the continuance of our most successful \nvocational and job training efforts with less \n\n[[Page S 14835]]\ninterference from the Federal Government. For example, the block grant \nis divided three ways: 25 percent of the grant must be allocated to \neducation; 25 percent is allocated to training; and 50 percent is \nallocated in a flex fund account, funds which a State can use for any \nemployment or education activity the State deems important and relevant \nto its specific needs.\n  This legislation, in shifting of power and responsibility to the \nState and local level, puts heavy emphasis and focus upon education. It \nstipulates that a portion of the flex accounts should be used for \nschool-to-work activities and that States, such as my State of \nNebraska, that received implementation grants under the School-to-Work \nOpportunities Act, use a portion of their flex funds to continue their \nschool-to-work programs under the terms of that act. This provides for \nthe furtherance of exciting and innovative programs, such as school to \nwork.\n  The Workforce Development Act provides for a strong foundation for \napplied learning by allowing States to link academic knowledge to real \nworld applications in their own communities, and by forging a \ncomprehensive sensible system of job training and education, this bill \nenhances both the ability and opportunity for lifelong learning.\n  But just as importantly, inside this flexibility, again, not only are \nthe State and local governments engaged, but this piece of legislation \nempowers and gives an opportunity to the private sector, particularly \nprivate-sector employers, and most especially small businesses, to \nparticipate in designing the programs.\n  This change in the law will, in fact, empower Americans in a fashion \nthat will enable them to engage in what, in my judgment, is one of the \nmost difficult problems and most tormenting problems that we face, \nwhich is, as I said earlier, this widening gap between the economic \nhaves and the economic have-nots, the threat to the middle class of \nAmerica, and the insecurity that Americans feel at almost all economic \nlevels in the work force today.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. We are in \nthe midst of, as all of us know, reform in many areas, including \neducation and labor. Business leaders are constantly admonishing \neducators to make learning more relevant to the real world. I believe \nthis bill is a giant step forward in that direction. By providing the \nmeans and the flexibility by which States and local communities can \naddress their specific job training and education needs and by \nencouraging educators, industry, labor, and community leaders to forge \nthe alliances necessary to make this happen, we can make the attainment \nof these skills and knowledge more relevant to the real world in which \nwe live, work, and learn.\n  Again, I praise and applaud and thank both the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kansas and the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. They have \nworked long and hard on this legislation. I am pleased to be able to \ncome to the floor today and join them in cosponsoring it, and I urge \nits quick and speedy adoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, my apologies. I was so anxious to jump \nin and express appreciation to the Senator from Nebraska, I did so \nbefore he finished speaking.\n  Senator Kerrey had been a stalwart supporter in the last Congress for \nmajor job training reform and has provided the initiative for much of \nthis effort. I value his support and his advice and his belief that \nthis is a very important piece of legislation.\n  As Senator Kennedy said, it is probably something that not a lot of \npeople have thought about. It will not cause people to be sitting on \nthe edge of their seats. But in many ways it could be the crux of a \nmajor change that could be of great value to a number of people. For \nthat reason, I really very much support and appreciate Senator Kerrey's \nefforts in the early days to continue lending support in efforts to \nreform the system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, briefly, I want to also join in thanking \nSenator Kerrey. As a former Governor, he has seen these programs in the \nState and has awareness about their effectiveness, and he has taken a \nvery special interest in the issues of education and training. We are \ngrateful for his suggestions and involvement in shaping the \nlegislation.\n  I yield such time as the Senator from Louisiana may need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. \nLet me start off by commending both the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Kassebaum from Kansas for \nthe work they have put into this effort. It really has been an \noutstanding effort. It has been a pleasure to work with them \npersonally, and with their staffs, in order to bring to the Senate \ntoday legislation which I think is really incredibly significant. It \nmay not be, perhaps, as interesting or a hot-button issue like some of \nthe issues Congress is now dealing with in terms of tax cuts and what \nwe are doing with Medicare and what we are doing with welfare reform \nand what we are doing to the Medicaid Program. Those programs are \ngetting a lot of attention in all of the media, and all of the interest \ngroups around the country are taking strong positions in favor or in \nopposition to what we are doing. There is a great deal of national \ndebate.\n  I suggest that what we are doing here this morning in the Senate is \nequally, if not more important than some of those other great debates \ngoing on with regard to Medicare, Medicaid, welfare reform, and the \nlike, because I think that this legislation really speaks to the future \nof America. Are we going to be a competitive Nation with skilled \nworkers who are able to compete in the work force and compete \ninternationally and not just in our own back yards?\n  What we are doing today is saying to the American worker, yes, you \nare important and, yes, we as a Government can do better than we have \nin the past by giving you the training and education that you need in \norder to make a difference, in order to get a job in the competitive \nworld that we live in, in order to be able to earn a living to support \nyour family, because that is what this legislation is all about. It is \nabout creating a system under which Americans will be better citizens, \nbetter individuals, better able to compete with the competition today, \nwhich is universal throughout this globe. It is not just competition \nwithin our own borders; it is universal competition throughout the \nworld.\n  I am not sure how many people would know if you asked them, does the \nGovernment do anything for training? A lot of people do not know. We \nhave about 90 different training programs on which we spend probably $7 \nbillion. We try to have a program for every possible need. I think as a \nresult of these good efforts that we have had over the years, in \ncreating these programs, we have something that is sort of a mishmash \nof a whole bunch of different programs. People out there in the real \nworld do not know where to go. Can you imagine a worker who has just \nlost his job trying to figure out which program he fits under? He goes \nto some organization and says, ``I need help, I lost my job, the \ncompany has gone out of business because of foreign competition, and I \nneed to be trained.'' Somebody dumps in his lap 90 different programs \nand descriptions about what they do. He has to try and figure out which \none he fits under.\n  That is the way it works now--rather, that is the way it does not \nwork now. If I had 90 different programs dumped in my lap after I lost \nmy job, I would probably run as fast as I could away from all that \nmaterial, because I am looking for help, not for some intelligence quiz \non which program basically fits my needs.\n  So what I think is so important about this legislation is it takes \nall of those 90 different Federal programs and consolidates them. The \nprograms I am talking about are the JTPA Program, job training for \npeople who were laid off from their jobs and poor adults and students; \nTAA, which was a training and cash benefit program for workers laid off \nbecause of trade problems; NAFTA transitional adjustment assistance; \nJob Corps programs; Carl Perkins vocational education programs; adult \neducation programs; school-to-work \n\n[[Page S 14836]]\nprograms; programs that we have created for responding to natural \ndisasters or base closings, where we try to train the people.\n  In other words, we have about 90 different programs on the Federal \nbooks. What we are attempting to do with this legislation is to try and \nconsolidate them to make them work better, to give a chance to the \npeople who benefit from these programs to understand better which one \nbest serves their needs. It is organized around a one-stop career \ncenter, which means that workers who need help will not have to go out \nand get help just to find out where to get help. We are essentially \nsaying that we want to let the worker who needs the help know where he \nor she has to go, without having to hire more people to help them \nnavigate through a maze of Federal programs.\n  There are some people who say that for every problem, the Government \nhas to find a solution. I think that is what got us into some of these \nproblems in the past, where for every problem we try to create a new \njob training program. Every time there was a disaster, or a base \nclosing, or a trade impact that affected workers, we created a program \nto train people. The intentions were wonderful. But I think what we \nhave produced was a convoluted group of programs that have now grown to \nover 90 Federal programs. And so some have said, well, we ought to do \nthat because that is what Government does, and that is what we as \nDemocrats do--create programs. Others say, look, this is no role for \nGovernment. When somebody loses his job because of unfair trade \npractices, or a natural disaster, or because of downsizing, which is \nthat new word corporations use, or if they lose jobs because of \nGovernment cutting back and closing military bases, well, we have no \nrole. The survival of the fittest should govern. If you can find a job, \ngood, and maybe if you cannot, too bad. Some people take that attitude \nabout what Government should not do to help people.\n  I think the real solution is that both of those perspectives are \nincorrect. Certainly, they do not fit the dynamics of the situation in \nthe end of the 20th century as we move to the 21st century. Things have \nchanged. People who think Government should have a program for every \nproblem, I think, are wrong. On the other hand, I think people who \nbelieve Government has no role at all are also wrong. What we ought to \nbe doing is trying to help people solve their own problems. That, I \nthink, is the proper role of Government--to help create conditions \nwhich allow people to make their own decisions and to help them better \nsolve their own problems.\n  That is what I think this legislation is all about. It helps people \nunderstand how they can benefit from the consolidation of all these \ntraining programs and lets them decide which one best fits their needs. \nWe all know that the American worker today is far different from the \nAmerican worker in the 1930's and 1940's, where people went to work at \na plant or factory and stayed there for their whole lifetime. Today, \nthe average American changes jobs several times in their own lifetime. \nSo they have to be constantly trained and given updated information and \nupdated skills about how to compete, because they do not always work in \nthe same place all of their lives, which was what we used to do in \nsociety. So things have changed.\n  One of the greatest programs that I think we as a Government ever \ninvented was the old GI bill, because it worked and it was simple. \nGovernment said that people who served their country were going to get \nhelp after they finished serving by allowing the Government to help pay \nthem to go to college to get the training they needed to be able to be \ncompetitive in American society. One of the good things is that the \nGovernment did not try and make all of the decisions. The Government, \nunder the GI bill, did not say to a person that they had to go to a \nparticular college. The Government did not say that you had to take a \nparticular course or a particular line of study or to major in anything \nthat the Government decided you should major in. The wonderful thing \nabout the GI bill is that we trusted individual Americans to make those \ndecisions by themselves. We gave them the funds and said, ``Go to \nschool.'' An individual could go to the school you would like to go to \nand major in what you think is best for your abilities, your \nintelligence, your interests; you make that decision. And that is why I \nthink it worked so well. As a result, today, literally, this country \nhas been reshaped by people who have benefited from the GI bill. So, \nwhat we have today in this legislation, which I strongly support, is it \ngives Americans who lose their jobs or find themselves in less \nbeneficial jobs, an opportunity to make some decisions and choices.\n\n  It gives the States that are going to be running this program the \nflexibility to use vouchers, which I happen to think is very, very \nimportant. I really think we, in allowing the States to use vouchers, \nwill improve this program. I think, for States to look at the concepts \nof giving an individual a voucher, giving that person the right to \ndecide where to go to use it to get his training or her training, is a \nmajor step in the right direction.\n  First of all, when you allow an individual to decide where to go to \nschool it creates competition among private institutions and public \ninstitutions for that person's interest. I think it is important for \nthe individuals to decide where they want to go to school to get their \ntraining, rather than for us in Washington or in some State capital to \nmake that decision for them. When government makes decisions for \nindividuals, the decisions are not nearly as good as if the individual \nmakes that decision.\n  The second advantage, I think, is competition. Because it will say to \nall of these schools that provide training that all of a sudden no one \nis going to dictate they are going to get students. They are going to \nhave to get students based on their ability to serve those students. \nThat is what competition is all about. Schools that are good will \nsurvive. Schools that do not meet the needs of the individuals will not \nsurvive. That is competition and I think competition, in that sense, \nwill produce better schools, better able to address the needs of \nindividuals who will benefit from these programs.\n  I think the third advantage of this concept is we will reduce \nbureaucracy. Because of the system now, that tries to fit people into \nvarious programs, we have created a huge bureaucracy of people who just \ndo that. If we allow the individual to make the decision of what is \nbest for him or her, I think we have made a major step in the right \ndirection.\n  I again compliment the ranking member, the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts, and the Chair of the committee, the distinguished \nSenator from Kansas, for the tremendous job they have done. This is \nreally landmark legislation. This, for the first time, says we are \ngoing to try to consolidate all of these programs and make it simpler \nand easier for people to understand which program will benefit their \nparticular needs and to give the States more flexibility in how they \ndeliver those services, to give them the option to use vouchers as a \nmeans of saying to the individual: You go out and go to an accredited \nfacility. You pick, you choose, you decide what you want to do with the \nrest of your life. The Government is not going to make that decision \nfor you.\n  Finally, I think we are saying to American workers that we do care \nabout your future. We do want you to be more competitive. We know a \nworker in this country will be able to compete--if she or he is well \ntrained, well educated--with workers anywhere in the world.\n  The theory and theme of this legislation, I think, is yes, there is a \nrole for Government. It is to help people equip themselves to solve \ntheir own problems. It is not for government to solve everybody's \nproblems all the time. And certainly not for government to walk away \nand say you are on your own, it is survival of the fittest and we are \nnot going to care what you do with your future.\n  I think this approach, in consolidating the programs under the \nWorkforce Development Act, is a major step in the right direction. I \ncommend the Chair and ranking member who will have an amendment to be \noffered later on that has been worked on over the weekend. The staff is \nto be commended for using part of the recess, spending this time doing \nthe work they have \n\n[[Page S 14837]]\ndone to produce an amendment I think makes a great deal of sense and, \nhopefully, will be supported by everyone.\n  This is a good bill. It is landmark legislation. I thank the people \nwho have been so involved in it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana. As I \nthink all Members know, he has been, over the years, a forceful \nadvocate for this concept, developing the voucher system so a displaced \nworker could use a voucher system to search out the most effective \nprogram for that individual, to maximize individual choice. That has \nbeen something he has advocated, not just in this program, but on \nothers as well, that I have had the opportunity to work on with him.\n  He also was a very strong spokesman to make sure we were going to \npreserve the basic integrity of the training programs and they were not \ngoing to be lost into the welfare system. He was an important leader to \ngetting us where we are now, where we are considering these training \nprograms in a broader context for working families.\n  So, for that leadership, we are very grateful to him and we thank \nhim.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Illinois had \nasked for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SIMON. That is correct. I understand the Presiding Officer may \nwish to speak on this. He was here before I was. I will be pleased to \nyield to him.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I think he will be happy to have the Senator proceed \nfor whatever amount of time the Senator wishes to use.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas and thank \nthe Chair for his courtesy. I commend the Senator from Kansas, as well \nas the ranking member, Senator Kennedy, for their work in this field.\n  I confess, I have mixed feelings about this bill. There are good \nthings in it. One-stop shopping makes a great deal of sense. Labor \nmarket information makes a great deal of sense. My staff, who know more \nabout the Adult Vocational Rehabilitation Act than I do, tell me that \nprovision is very, very sound. And I like the idea of consolidation of \nprograms. We have multiplied too many programs. There is just no \nquestion about that.\n  I have to say, I am less than completely enthusiastic about just \nhaving block grants to the States. Some years ago we consolidated some \neducation programs and one of those was the school library program. \nDuring the whole Depression, not a single library in this Nation \nclosed. But, after we consolidated the school library program into the \nblock grants to the States on education, over half of the school \nlibraries in the State of California, for example, have closed.\n  This idea of simply giving block grants to the States is not one that \nI am wildly enthusiastic about. I do believe we have to give States \nflexibility. If I can use an example the Presiding Officer is very \nfamiliar with, when we passed the bill--I was in the House then and \nworked on this--when we passed the bill requiring all States to give \nhelp to young people with disabilities, we did not do that because the \nFederal Government wanted power. We did it because States were not \ndoing the job. We had a lot of schools that said if you are deaf, if \nyou are blind, if you are in a wheelchair, sorry, we are not going to \nserve you. A majority of the mentally retarded were not being given any \nhelp in our public schools. So we put into law a Federal mandate. Would \nI be willing to say let us just give this money back to the States, and \nthe States will decide whether they are going to help these young \npeople or not? No. I am not willing to do it.\n  So, when I look at consolidation and I see school-to-work \nopportunities just getting started, and by all reports really doing \nsome good--but I do not know what is going to happen in Tennessee or \nIllinois.\n  (Mrs. KASSEBAUM assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SIMON. The National Literacy Act--by the most conservative \nestimates, we have 23 million adult Americans who cannot read a \nnewspaper or who cannot fill out a job application form. This is a \nmassive drag on our economy. We have to make our people more \nproductive. Among other things, those adult Americans who have literacy \ndeficiencies are not able to help their kids in school.\n  So, when I see that we are going to consolidate some of these things, \nI get concerned.\n  Then the Job Corps has been--are there problems? You bet. We are \ndealing with marginal young people. Almost 80 percent have dropped out \nof school. To just say to States, ``You go ahead and run Job Corps, if \nyou want to,'' I do not think makes sense.\n  Senator Specter and I will have an amendment this afternoon to keep \nthe Job Corps and to make some improvements in terms of requirements on \nuse of drugs or alcohol and some other things that I think are \nimportant. But 73 percent of the Job Corps alumni--these, again, are \nkids who are marginal--73 percent end up either getting a job or going \non to college or to a vocational school.\n  So I view this legislation, Madam President, with mixed feelings. I \ncommend you and the ranking member for all of the work you have done in \nthis field. You have been a real legislator, Madam President, not only \nin this field, but with the problems we faced in Africa and in other \nareas.\n  I like the idea of consolidation, one-stop shopping, and labor market \ninformation. I am not an enthusiastic supporter of just saying to the \nStates, ``You have this money and you make all the decisions.'' I want \nto give some flexibility to the States, but I also want to make sure \npeople get served who need to be served.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor. I see we are going to get some \nwords of wisdom from my colleague from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 143, the Workforce \nDevelopment Act. It is truly forward-thinking legislation. It is \nresponsible legislation. It makes it easier for States to educate and \ntrain tomorrow's work force. And it is legislation that takes a \nbalanced approach to accountability.\n  Mr. President, every day we are faced with choices--even the choice \nnot to change business as usual. I wish to commend my colleague, the \nchairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, for tackling this \nunwieldy area of Federal policy--job training and employment \nassistance--and shaping it into a coherent and cohesive proposal.\n  Without her leadership and tenacity on this matter, the workers of \nAmerica and their employers, the future of workers of America and their \npotential employers, and the young people of America and their \naspirations would be held off or put off by the current unfocused, \nuntenable, and unjustifiable approach to job training.\n  Mr. President, through her legislation, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kansas has given States flexibility built on common sense and \nbased on State-defined benchmarks. It includes the availability of \nfinancial incentives for focussing on a critical bottom line--helping \npeople prepare for and acquire jobs.\n  Through her legislation, the Senator from Kansas gives individuals \nlooking for training or jobs access to information and assistance that \nwill lead to personal choices founded in facts as well as hopes--\ninformation and assistance that will lead to opportunities which \nrecognize ability and confirm potential, and lead to concrete results.\n  As Americans move into the 21st century, a more advanced and highly \ntechnical job market awaits them. Twenty-five years ago, many \nspeculated the year 2001 would reveal a truly space age society with \nrobots or huge computers performing all of human's work. Those \npredictions will remain fantasy for many years, but one thing cannot be \ndenied--the workplace is changing both rapidly and dramatically, as new \napplications for technology are continually discovered.\n  This increasing use of technology--from FAX machines and lap-top \ncomputers to high resolution video teleconferencing--has placed a \nstrain on our work force, which has not always been able to keep up.\n  It has also created a boom industry, as employers and employees seek \nout \n\n[[Page S 14838]]\nhigher education, job training and retraining programs to remain \nemployable. As a result, the Federal Government spends more than $20 \nbillion each year to fund dozens and dozens of job training and work \nforce education programs across this country. Tennessee alone spends \nmore than $237 million in Federal funds to administer myriad programs \nto prepare and retrain its workers.\n  But despite more than 100 programs and billion-dollar budgets, there \nis no real way of knowing how effective this approach actually is--the \nnumber of programs is unmanageable and too many overlap or duplicate \nservices.\n  This lack of accountability and the waste of duplicative services \nprompted the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, of which I am \na member, to report out the Work Force Development Act of 1995.\n  This legislation creates one system that integrates elements of \neducation and training, and gives States the flexibility they need to \ndesign and implement programs that meets State-identified needs. States \nknow the needs of their own job markets better than a large Federal \nbureaucracy, and can tailor their training and education programs to \nfit the needs of their employers and workers. If we pass S. 143, major \nFederal training programs would be consolidated within 2 years into one \nblock grant to each State.\n  Currently, my own State of Tennessee operates more than 25 different \njob training programs under 9 different departments.\n  In Tennessee, the department of labor, the department of employment \nsecurity, the department of human services, the department of \neducation, the department of mental health and mental retardation, the \ndepartment of economic and community development, the department of \nyouth development, the department of corrections, and the Tennessee \nBoard of Regents all operate separate programs to provide job training \nto Tennessee workers.\n  Each program and each department has its own separate bureaucracy and \na separate budget.\n  The Workforce Development Act of 1995 eliminates unnecessary \nduplication and allows Tennessee and other States to create within \ntheir own borders one program that will serve their individual needs \nmore efficiently and at less expense. Most of all, however, this \nlegislation ensures that the program that will be in place will \nactually help those people who need it.\n  As chairman of the Disability Policy Subcommittee, I am especially \npleased that title II of S. 143 contains amendments to title I of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973, amendments that clearly link State \nvocational rehabilitation programs to the work force development system \nenvisioned by my colleague from Kansas.\n  Title I of the Rehabilitation Act authorizes the vocational \nrehabilitation program which provides Federal funds for counseling, for \ntraining and employment services for individuals with disabilities. The \nFederal Government provides 78 percent of the funding for the \nvocational rehabilitation program.\n  The vocational rehabilitation program began in 1921 initially to help \ndisabled war veterans obtain rehabilitation and employment assistance. \nToday, it is a major source of employment assistance for many \nindividuals with disabilities, including individuals with severe \ndisabilities. Vocational rehabilitation programs, although operated by \nState vocational rehabilitation services, are located throughout a \nparticular State. These programs help about a million individuals with \ndisabilities a year, about 20 percent of whom enter the competitive \nlabor market within 12 months. The average cost per person aided is \nabout $2,500.\n  The Tennessee vocational rehabilitation program provides but one \nexample of what can happen when the focus of an agency is clear--to get \npeople with disabilities jobs. In 1994, this program in my State served \n27,600 individuals with disabilities, of whom 81.2 percent were \nseverely disabled. Of the individuals served, 5,300 were successfully \nemployed, with 90.2 percent of them working in the competitive labor \nmarket.\n  The annualized income of these 5,300 individuals, once they entered \nthe work force, increased from $6.7 million to $54 million. Let me \nrepeat. The annualized income of these individuals, once they entered \nthe work force, increased from $6.7 million to $54 million, truly an \namazing return on a modest Federal investment.\n  Vocational rehabilitation programs have been one-stop centers for \nemployment assistance for individuals with disabilities for many years. \nMaking these programs a part of the work force development systems \nwhich will be authorized by S. 143 is both logical and necessary. By \nincluding vocational rehabilitation programs as an integral part of the \nlarger system, two primary outcomes will be achieved. First, \nindividuals with disabilities will be assisted and have access to \nappropriate supports and services so they can take advantage of what is \navailable through their communities' one-stop centers. Second, \nvocational rehabilitation professionals will be enabled to provide \ntechnical assistance and information about disability related matters \nto other personnel, who, when appropriate, will be able to assist \nindividuals with disabilities directly.\n  If vocational rehabilitation programs, which are currently funded at \nabout $2 billion, had been left out of S. 143, I know we would have \nseen retraction from emerging collaboration between vocational \nrehabilitation programs and other job training programs.\n  Under the comprehensive one-stop centers system in S. 143, any \ncitizen, including one with disability, will have access to core \nservices and more, including assessments, coordination, referrals to \nother entities, and labor market information. An individual with severe \ndisabilities, who may often require specialized, intensive services, \nmay access such services in the same facilities in which core services \nare provided.\n  The key is that individuals receive job training and placement \nassistance and appropriate referrals from and to other parts of the \nwork force development system, not that every service an individual \nreceives be provided in the same location. Throughout the work force \ndevelopment system those individuals involved in coordinating and \narranging services would follow the same procedures and policies when \ninteracting with applicants and clients.\n  I believe these elements in S. 143 send a clear signal to States \nthere will be one system. Vocational rehabilitation services will be a \npart of that system; individuals with disabilities will be served; \nindividuals with disabilities will not fall through the cracks; and \nthey will not become Ping-Pongs at the mercy of uninformed personnel.\n  Simply put, by recognizing the record and potential of the vocational \nrehabilitation program, we have strengthened it and the Workforce \nDevelopment Act as well.\n  Given its special place in the world of job training and the range of \nspecialized and intensive services it supports, the vocational \nrehabilitation program in title I of the Rehabilitation Act becomes a \ncomponent of the Workforce Development Act through amendment to the \nRehabilitation Act, not repeal of title I of the Rehabilitation Act. \nThrough such legislative surgery, we are able to preserve this separate \nauthorization of appropriation for vocational rehabilitation services \nand clear accountability for the use of these funds through State \nvocational rehabilitation agencies.\n  Although during deliberations on the Workforce Development Act in \ncommittee we did have our differences with regard to individuals with \ndisabilities, we built and sustained a bipartisan consensus. This \nconsensus should serve us well as we conference with the other body.\n  In closing, I wish to thank my colleague from Kansas for her \nleadership and her guidance and her patience that got us to this point \ntoday. Acquiring world-class skills for finding a job is neither \nguaranteed nor easy. It takes effort, information, time, resources, and \nopportunity. The chairman's bill levels the playing field so that those \nwho make the effort and have the time can access information, \nresources, and opportunity. Through her legislation, the Senator from \nKansas gives us a balanced equation. Tomorrow, America's work force \nwill be at work better trained and better able to compete against \nglobal markets. The human value of such outcomes may be hard to measure \nin specific terms, but I am convinced that we will see a renewed \nspirit, unleashed pride, and the smiles \n\n[[Page S 14839]]\nthat come with confidence on the faces of America, and that is good.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I said in my opening statement how \nmuch I and the ranking member, Senator Kennedy, have valued the efforts \nof the Senator from Tennessee to significantly improve the legislation, \nand I would like to again express appreciation to Senator Frist, who \nworked on the vocational rehabilitation section and strengthened it in \nways that I believe have added immeasurably to not only the success of \nthe legislation but I think also the assurance to those in the \nrehabilitation community that while they want to work to become \nintegrated into the work force, they also want to retain a statutory \nauthority and a funding stream that gives them some certainty they have \na voice. And it was the effort of Senator Frist and staffs on both \nsides that worked together to develop this section that I think lends \ngreat strength to the bill, and I am very appreciative to the Senator.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that questions and answers \nregarding vocational rehabilitation programs be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   The Effect of the Workforce Development Act of 1995 on Vocational \n                        Rehabilitation Programs\n\n\n                         Questions and Answers\n\n       Q. If the Work Force Development Act of 1995, S. 143, were \n     enacted into law, when would the provisions that affect \n     vocational rehabilitation take effect?\n       A. The effective date of the provisions would vary. S. 143 \n     would allow States up to 2 years to convert to a single work \n     force development system with one-stop career centers. Some \n     States are already engaged in such approaches to job \n     training, information, and placement assistance. In these \n     States, vocational rehabilitation agencies are involved and \n     play a role in helping individuals with disabilities. S. 143, \n     with the State option of a 2-year phase-in, takes into \n     account the fact that States are at differing stages in \n     investing in a single work force development system. In an \n     effort to promote vocational rehabilitation programs \n     continuing their involvement or beginning early involvement \n     in planning and participation in new systems, provisions in \n     S. 143 would allow a State vocational rehabilitation program \n     to transition to the new work force development system, in a \n     manner and by a time table set by its State (within the 2-\n     year limit specified in S. 143).\n       Q. Does S. 143 repeal any part of the Rehabilitation Act of \n     1993?\n       A. No. It amends title I, the State grant program of the \n     Rehabilitation Act. S. 143 would make a State's vocational \n     rehabilitation program an integral component of a State's \n     work force development system.\n       Q. Does S. 143 affect only the State grant program in the \n     Rehabilitation Act?\n       A. Yes. It amends no other programs in the Rehabilitation \n     Act.\n       Q. If the Work Force Development Act of 1995, S. 143, were \n     enacted into law, how would funding for State vocational \n     rehabilitation programs, currently funded through the \n     Rehabilitation Act, be affected?\n       A. The authorization of appropriations and the funding \n     formula in current law would be preserved. The effect would \n     be that designated State vocational rehabilitation agencies \n     would continue to administer and oversee the use of \n     rehabilitation dollars. This would ensure that designated \n     dollars would continue to be spent to provide job training \n     and placement assistance for individuals with disabilities.\n       Q. If S. 143 were enacted into law, what services could an \n     individual with a disability expect?\n       A. Any individual seeking job training and placement \n     assistance, including an individual with a disability, would \n     have access to core services as well as other services a \n     State may elect to offer. The core services would include: \n     Outreach and orientation to services available through one-\n     stop centers, assessment, job search and placement \n     assistance, career counseling where appropriate, screening \n     and referral of qualified applicants to employment or other \n     support services, and accurate and timely information \n     relating to employment opportunities, training, and \n     education.\n       Q. Does S. 143 recognize that many individuals with \n     disabilities may have specialized needs that must be \n     addressed in order for these individuals to take advantage of \n     job training and placement opportunities?\n       A. Yes. Any individual with a disability would have access \n     to auxiliary aids and services necessary to enable him or her \n     to take advantage of core services. In addition, if a center \n     also offered other services, an individual with a disability, \n     seeking these services, would have access to auxiliary aids \n     and services if needed. If an individual with a disability \n     has specialized needs that must be addressed to enable the \n     individual to take advantage of what is offered within a one-\n     stop center system, appropriate assistance would be provided \n     by vocational rehabilitation professionals. If a State \n     vocational rehabilitation agency is operating under an order \n     of selection that limits most services to individuals with \n     the most severe disabilities, then this agency could continue \n     such a policy under S. 143. An individual who has a \n     disability not covered by the order of selection could access \n     services through other one-stop centers personnel. In order \n     for these personnel to assist individuals with disabilities, \n     technical assistance from vocational rehabilitation \n     professionals would be available.\n       Q. If S. 143 were enacted into law, would it be primarily a \n     public system with public employees controlling what services \n     an individual with a disability could access?\n       A. That decision will be a State decision. Currently, State \n     vocational rehabilitation agencies vary in the extent to \n     which services to individuals with disabilities are provided \n     by public or private entities. In Tennessee today, 75 percent \n     of State vocational rehabilitation dollars are spent on \n     private service providers. S. 143 clearly expects employers' \n     interests and needs to influence the design of a State's work \n     force development system. Moreover, a State will be expected \n     to reach all areas of the State with services. These factors \n     may cause States to expand or redirect how job training and \n     placement assistance are addressed. For example, to be better \n     able to address employers' needs in a timely manner with \n     well-trained workers, a State may expand the use and \n     involvement of private providers and elect to make vouchers \n     available to individuals.\n       Q. If S. 143 were enacted into law, how would the \n     preferences and choices of an individual with a disability be \n     affected?\n       A. Amendments to the Rehabilitation Act in 1992 \n     strengthened an individual's role and choices with regard to \n     vocational rehabilitation services. In addition, in these \n     1992 amendments, the U.S. Department of Education's \n     Rehabilitation Services Administration was directed to \n     develop evaluation standards and performance indicators to \n     judge if individuals with disabilities are being given a \n     meaningful role in the design of their service package and \n     are able to make informed choices about rehabilitation \n     services available. S. 143 does nothing to undermine these \n     1992 amendments to the Rehabilitation Act. In fact, these \n     1992 amendments should continue to buttress and strengthen an \n     individual's ability to access services he or she needs and \n     prefers within one-stop centers.\n       Q. If S. 143 were enacted into law, could an individual \n     with a disability have access to vouchers?\n       A. Yes, to the extent and under the conditions a State \n     specifies.\n       Q. What in S. 143 would increase the likelihood that an \n     individual with a disability would receive services? That is, \n     the individual would not be denied services on the basis of \n     disability, not fall through the cracks, or not be treated \n     like a ping pong ball--referred to one agency after another.\n       A. States are expected to set benchmarks and report on \n     individuals assisted through work force development systems. \n     A State must report on is the number of individuals with \n     disabilities who acquired jobs. Under S. 143, individuals \n     with disabilities should have more opportunities to receive \n     information and services targeted to job openings in their \n     communities. Moreover, since there would be one, and only \n     one, job training and placement assistance system in a State, \n     an individual with a disability could not be turned away or \n     denied core services.\n  The percent of persons with earned income of any kind increased from \n21 percent at application to 90 percent at closure. The gain in the \naverage hourly wage rate from application to the achievement of an \nemployment outcome was $4.36 per person. Of the individuals achieving \nemployment in fiscal year 1993, their mean weekly earnings at the time \nof their application to the program was $32.20, compared to $204.10 at \nclosure, an average weekly increase of $164.90.\n  In 1993, the Government Accounting Office [GAO] found that an \nindividual who completed a vocational rehabilitation program was \nsignificantly more likely than an individual who did not complete the \nprogram of working for wages 5 years after exiting the program. In \naddition, the GAO found that individuals who achieved an employment \noutcome demonstrated four times the gain in wages compared to the other \ngroups studied.\n  I am also pleased to share with my colleagues the positive impact \nthat vocational rehabilitation is having in my home State of Iowa. \nDuring fiscal year 1993-94, 5,717 Iowans with disabilities were \nrehabilitated through the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation \nServices. At referral to DVRS, 33 percent has weekly earnings; at \nclosure the rate went to 98 percent. Average weekly earnings rose from \n$49.94 at referral to $229.45 at closure. In addition, the Iowa \nDepartment for the Blind provided 765 blind persons with vocational \nrehabilitation services. At closure the average weekly income was $352. \nSeventy-three percent of those rehabilitated found work in the \ncompetitive \n\n[[Page S 14840]]\nlabor market, including work in occupations such as psychologist, tax \naccountant, teacher, food service, and radio repair.\n  Mr. President, as I explained previously in my remarks, under S. 143, \ntitle I of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended most recently in 1992, is \nnot repealed; rather it is retained, strengthened, and made an integral \ncomponent of the statewide work force development system.\n  For example, the findings and purposes section of title I of the \nRehabilitation Act are amended to make it clear that programs of \nvocational rehabilitation are intended to be an integral component of a \nState's work force development system. Further, the amendments clarify \nthat linkages between the vocational rehabilitation program established \nunder title I of the Rehabilitation Act and other components of the \nstatewide work force development system are critical to ensure \neffective and meaningful participation by individuals with disabilities \nin work force development activities.\n  Section 14 and section 106 of title I of the Rehabilitation Act \npertaining to evaluations of the program are amended to make it clear \nthat, to the maximum extent appropriate, standards for determining \neffectiveness of the program must be consistent with State benchmarks \nestablished under the Workforce Development Act for all employment \nprograms.\n  Provisions in the State plan under title I of the Rehabilitation Act \nof 1973 are also amended to include specific strategies for \nstrengthening the vocational rehabilitation program as an integral \ncomponent of the statewide work force development system established by \nthe State. A cooperative agreement will be required to link the VR \nagency with the consolidated system. The cooperative agreement will \naddress each State's unique system and will assure, for example, \nreciprocal referrals between the VR agency and the other components of \nthe statewide system. The linkages will also assure that the staff at \nboth agencies are adequately and appropriately trained. Most \nimportantly, the linkages must be replicated at the local level so that \nthe local office of the VR agency is working closely with the one-stop \ncenter in the community to make a seamless system of services a \nreality.\n  Many State vocational rehabilitation agencies, including the agency \nin Iowa, are already involved with efforts to link vocational \nrehabilitation with other components of the statewide system of work \nforce development. The States that report the most success are those \nwhere the vocational rehabilitation agencies are involved in the \nconsolidation efforts at the early planning stages. The other aspect \nthat is critical to ensure success is the replication of cooperative \nagreements in local communities so that the VR counselors are working \nclosely with the other job training programs in the statewide system.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I strongly support the provisions S. 143 \npertaining to individuals with disabilities. The bill ensures \nmeaningful and effective access to the generic training and education \nprograms. In addition, the amendments to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \nwill strengthen and support the involvement of vocational \nrehabilitation in a State's seamless system of work force development \nwhile ensuring the continued integrity and viability of the current \nprogram.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nDisability Policy, I would like to take a few minutes to discuss the \napplicability of S. 143, the Workforce Development Act, to individuals \nwith disabilities.\n  I would like to compliment Senator Kassebaum, the sponsor of the \nlegislation and chair of the Committee on Labor and Human Resource, and \nSenator Frist, the chair of the Subcommittee on Disability Policy, for \nincluding specific provisions in S. 143 that will enhance our Nation's \nability to address the employment-related needs of individuals with \ndisabilities, including individuals with significant disabilities. I am \nparticularly pleased that these provisions were developed on a \nbipartisan basis and enjoy the broad-based support of the disability \ncommunity.\n  On January 10, 1995, the Labor Committee heard testimony from Tony \nYoung, on behalf of the Employment and Training Task Force of the \nConsortium for Citizens With Disabilities. CCD urged the Senate to \nrecognize the positive advances made in the 1992 amendments to the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 and to take a two-pronged approach to \naddressing the needs of individuals with disabilities in our jobs \nconsolidation legislation. I am pleased that the Senate bill adopted \nthis two-pronged approach.\n  Under prong one, S. 143 guarantee individuals with disabilities \nmeaningful and effective access to the core services and optional \nservices that are made available to nondisabled individuals in generic \nwork force employment activities and to work force education activities \ndescribed in the legislation, consistent with nondiscrimination \nprovisions set out in section 106(f)(7) of the legislation, section 504 \nof the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and title II of the Americans With \nDisabilities Act.\n  The commitment to ensuring meaningful and effective access to generic \nservices for individuals with disabilities is critical. Advocates for \nindividuals with disabilities have often expressed concern that many \ncurrent generic job training programs such as JTPA have not met the \nneeds of individuals with disabilities. Ensuring access to generic \nservices is critical for many people with disabilities who can benefit \nfrom such services.\n  The promise of access to generic services is also illustrated through \nother provisions in S. 143. The purposes of the bill--section 2(b)--\ninclude creating coherent, integrated statewide work force development \nsystems designed to develop more fully the academic, occupational, and \nliteracy skills of all segments of the population and ensuring that all \nsegments of the work force will obtain the skills necessary to earn \nwages sufficient to maintain the highest quality of living in the \nworld. The content of the State plan set out in section 104(c) of S. \n143 must include information describing how the State will identify the \ncurrent and future work force development needs of all segments of the \npopulation of the State. The term ``all'' is intended to include \nindividuals with disabilities.\n  The accountability provisions in S. 143, section 121(c)(4), specify \nthat States must develop quantifiable benchmarks to measure progress \ntoward meeting State goals for specified populations, including at a \nminimum, individuals with disabilities.\n  Under S. 143, State vocational rehabilitation agencies must be \ninvolved in the planning and implementation of the generic system. For \nexample, under section 104(d) of S. 143, the part of the State plan \nrelated to the strategic plan must describe how the State agency \nofficials responsible for vocational rehabilitation collaborated in the \ndevelopment of the strategic plan. Under section 105(a) of S. 143, the \nwork force development boards must include a representative from the \nState agency responsible for vocational rehabilitation and under \nsection 118 of S. 143, local workforce development boards must include \none or more individuals with disabilities or their representatives.\n  Under prong two the current program of one-stop shopping for persons \nwith disabilities, particularly those with severe disabilities, \nestablished under title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended \nmost recently in 1992, is retained, strengthened, and made an integral \ncomponent of the statewide work force development system.\n  The current vocational rehabilitation system has helped millions of \nindividuals with disabilities over the past 75 years to achieve \nemployment. Since the 1992 amendments, the number of individuals \nassisted in achieving employment each year has increased steadily. In \nfiscal year 1994, 203,035 individuals achieved employment, up 5.8 \npercent from fiscal year 1992, the year just prior to the passage of \nthe amendments. Data for the first three quarters of fiscal year 1995 \nshow a 8.4-percent increase in the number of individuals achieving \nemployment as compared to the first three quarters for fiscal year \n1994.\n  In fiscal year 1993, 85.7 percent of the individuals achieving \nemployment through vocational rehabilitation were either competitively \nemployed or self-employed. Seventy-seven percent of individuals who \nachieved employment as \n\n[[Page S 14841]]\na result of the vocational rehabilitation program report that their own \nincome is the primary source of support rather than depending on \nentitlement or family members.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I would like to speak for just a \nmoment because at 11:30 we go back into morning business for an hour. \nWe will be debating this later to a far greater extent, but because Job \nCorps has been raised this morning by several Members, I would like to \nspeak for a moment to this because it is something on which we held \nseveral days of hearings. It is a subject on which I have had grave \nconcerns. It has been a very important program through the years. But \nlike many other things, it can stand change that I believe will make it \neven stronger.\n  Job Corps, under the legislation that we are considering, remains a \nresidential program for at-risk youth, but it is integrated into the \nstatewide work force development system. Too often today we have Job \nCorps centers that are federally run that operate independently of the \nvocational education efforts that are ongoing in the State. These \ncenters remain separate and apart from job service information when we \ncould include them into initiatives better able to help students find \njobs.\n  I think it is just absolutely essential for us today to recognize \nthat there is a population of at-risk youth that need a stronger \nsupport system. Many times the Job Corps centers have become, or should \nbecome perhaps, detention-center-type efforts, but because there has \nnot been a directive that has focused on the changing needs of the \npopulation being served. I think that on the whole we are now doing a \ndisservice. It is not to say that it is not an important initiative. \nAnd it remains so under this legislation with its own funding stream \nand its own section.\n  But primary responsibility for the operation of the Job Corps centers \nis transferred to the State. And each center must be linked to the one-\nstop center and at other local training and education efforts. I think \nthat linkage is vital today to make it a successful effort.\n  During the 2-year transition period which is called for in this \nlegislation, a national audit of the Job Corps Program will be \nperformed. Based on the results of the audit, and other criteria, the \nSecretary of Labor is directed to close 25 underperforming Job Corps \ncenters. The criteria used to determine which centers will be closed \nare as follows. This is, Mr. President, out of 112 centers which are \noperating with about 8 new ones under consideration.\n  The criteria would be, first, whether a given center has consistently \nreceived low performance measurement ratings under the Department of \nLabor or Inspector General Job Corps rating system; second, whether the \ncenter is among those that have experienced the highest number of \nserious incidents of violence or criminal activity; third, whether or \nnot the center requires the largest funding for rehabilitation and \nrepair; fourth, the relative and absolute cost of the centers compared \nto all other centers; and, fifth, whether the center is among those \nwith the least State and local support.\n  The centers that we found that were working the best were those that \nhad strong local support, that had strong ties to the community and \nworked well in that endeavor.\n  Mr. President, funds saved as a result of these closures as well as \nadditional funds will be allocated to the State for work force \ndevelopment activities directed specifically for at-risk youth. These \nactivities may include, for example, grants to carry out programs to \nassist out-of-school at-risk youth and participating in school-to-work \nactivities. Under this provision, 85 percent of the at-risk youth funds \nwill be distributed at the local level.\n  As I say, we will be debating this at some length later on because it \nis of concern and it has supporters and critics on both sides of the \naisle. But it is something, I believe, that is a good example of a \nprogram that started with the best of intentions, and still has the \nbest of intentions, but must be looked at in the light of the reality \nof what we are dealing with today. And I feel those who are \nparticipants, the young men and women in the Job Corps Program, are not \nbeing served consistently as successfully as I believe they could with \nsome important changes that we could make in this bill. But we will be \ncontinuing this debate later. I wanted to mention those aspects of it \nat this point.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just yield such time--as I \nunderstand it, at 11:30 we will be moving to morning business.\n  I yield myself such time as I might use.\n  Mr. President, I will join in the debate and discussion on the Job \nCorps Program later on in the afternoon and the substance of what I \nthink is an excellently crafted amendment by the Senator from Illinois \nand the Senator from Pennsylvania, which I think addresses the \nresponses to some of the issues and problems that have been raised \nduring the course of hearings on the Job Corps.\n  I think we do not want to lose sight of the fact that we are dealing \nwith the most difficult of the young people in our society who, for one \nreason or another, have in most instances been deprived of a good \neducation. They come from difficult and challenging backgrounds. This \nis in many instances the last step before a life of conflict and \npossibly even crime. And when you look over the profile of these young \nindividuals, we recognize the difficulty and the complexity that is \npresented to a society and to a community in order to try to deal with \nthis.\n  Part of the problem--we will have a chance to debate this later on in \nthe course of the afternoon--is the fact that not all the States have \nthe Job Corps at this particular time. Part of the problem is that many \nof the individuals who come through the Job Corps, the kind of skills \nthat they might be suited for may not be in the Job Corps that is \nclosest to them. They may have a particular aptitude to develop \nparticular skills in the Job Corps that is in the next State or the \nState beyond that will give them the opportunity.\n  Part of the problem is to try to give an opportunity for young people \nto move out of a neighborhood or out of a community in which that \nneighborhood or community and the associates have had a powerful hold \nover that individual. We will have a chance to go into greater detail \nas to the challenges and the demands and also the difficulties of the \nexisting Job Corps issue, but I must say that I have found that the \nprogram particularly is of value.\n  If you take, for example, holding a young person in my own State of \nMassachusetts inside of what is route 128 that has had any kind of \ncontact with the law costs about $70,000 or $75,000 a year; it costs \nabout $35,000 to $40,000 outside of Greater Boston, the route 128 area. \nWe are talking about how we are going to come to grips with a group of \nyoung men and women, 17 years old, 16 to 18, 19 years old, who have had \na very difficult and complex and rough life.\n  And the question is whether this Job Corps Program can open up some \nopportunities for these individuals to be constructive and productive \nand gainful citizens. In many instances it has been an extraordinary \nsuccess. In some instances there needs to be improvement and \nstrengthening of the program. I do think that the Simon-Specter \namendment addresses the particular complexities of the program.\n  Finally, Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, I think when we are \nlooking at this legislation, when we are looking at the consolidation \nof the various programs that Senator Kassebaum has pointed out, we are \nalso trying to include in here the best of the recommendations of the \nAmerica's Choice Program, which I think provided the most comprehensive \nreview of training, apprenticeship programs, what the needs were in our \nown society, what is happening in other countries, very extensive \nprogram and review of countries around the world, identifying those \neffective programs, those programs that were effective in providing \nskills and opportunity for young and old alike.\n  This proposal that is before us, although it does not include many of \nthe different elements of the job training that I would like to see, \nis, I think, a very, very constructive, productive and innovative way \nof this Nation coming to grips with the challenge of ensuring the \nupgrading and continued upgrading of skills for young and old in our \nsociety. \n\n[[Page S 14842]]\n\n  I hope that we will have a chance to dispose of these other \namendments later on in the afternoon and move the whole process \nforward.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for this \nlegislation, which makes dramatic and sweeping changes not only in job \ntraining but also in vocational and adult education.\n  In job training, change is without a doubt necessary. We need to \nconsolidate programs and to build a system that better meets the needs \nof those who need job training services. In vocational and adult \neducation, however, the need for a massive overhaul is much less clear. \nIn some ways, we need simply to refine and not revamp what we already \nhave in law.\n  I am generally pleased with the course that has been set in this \nbill. It will bring coherence and coordination to a system of too many \nprograms that have often operated at odds with each other. It will \nfocus job training services on those who need them most, and in a way \nthat will help them get the advice, assistance, and training they need.\n  In vocational and adult education, I believe we have fashioned an \nagreement that should sustain the strong bipartisan support these \nprograms have traditionally enjoyed. Among the important provisions \nare: No. 1, are within state formula; No. 2, a focus on at-risk \nstudents from low-income families; No. 3, maintenance of effort and \nsupplement not supplant language; No. 4, an emphasis on the integration \nof academic and vocational education; No. 5, the linking of secondary \nand postsecondary education through exciting programs like tech prep; \nNo. 6, the disaggregation of data to let us know better the progress we \nare making; and, No. 7, the continuation of the critically important \nadult education programs.\n  I would emphasize, however, that we can make this bill even better if \nwe adopt a series of important amendments. I am very concerned, for \ninstance, that adult education should have a separate stream of funding \nso that its accomplishments are not diminished. I believe that the \nflexibility account, which constitutes 50 percent of the funding, is \ntoo large, and that a better configuration would be one-third for work \nforce education, one-third for work force training, and one-third for \nthe flex account. Further, I believe we should approve an amendment \nstrengthening the Job Corps provisions now in the bill. And, I do not \nbelieve that we should repeal the Trade Adjustment Act which helps \nindividuals who because of international competition, and through no \nfault of their own, have lost their jobs.\n  Mr. President, I supported this bill in committee largely because of \nthe strong provisions for adult and vocational education. I support it \ntoday for the same reasons. However, I believe we have the opportunity \nto make a good bill an even better one if we approve amendments such as \nthose I have mentioned. I look forward to a lively and productive \ndebate, and remain very hopeful that the end result will be legislation \nthat has broad and deep bipartisan support.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, few issues we consider are as directly \nlinked to the future strength of our Nation as those before us today. \nThe education and training we provide today point like a compass to our \nNation's future path.\n  The needs in education and training are clearly great. Because in the \nlast several decades, our economy has been transformed from an economy \nin which heavy manufacturing was the central element to an economy that \nis knowledge based.\n  Technology has and continues to revolutionize today's workplaces. The \ntypewriters that gained widespread use early this century are now \nbasically gone. Computers, with their incredible power and potential, \nhave taken over. It is hard to imagine how just a few years ago we \noperated without internet, fax machines, or voice mail. In \nmanufacturing, robotics and precision machinery have replaced workers \non many assembly lines.\n  This rapid change makes for an exciting time in today's workplaces. \nBut it also presents us with many challenges. We must assure that \neducation and training provide all with access to the new tools of the \ntrade.\n  The work force development bill before us today makes many positive \nchanges to meet these challenges. Senator Kassebaum has thought \ncreatively about job training and vocational and adult education \nprograms, namely how we can make them more flexible, more customer-\nfriendly, and less redundant while providing critical links between \ntraining and labor markets.\n  This bill includes many promising provisions, including the \ntransition to an accessible ``one-stop'' work force development system. \nWith Federal leadership, one-stops have been broadly improving access \nto job training and information services in States across the country.\n  This bill also integrates vocational education and the Perkins Act as \nfull partners in the larger work force development system. Since we \nlast visited vocational education in 1988, vocational education has \nbeen on the cutting edge of school reform--tech-prep and school-to-work \nhave established promising new models that ensure youth get the \nknowledge and skills they need to pursue successful careers and \ncomplete their education. The Work Force Development Act continues and \nstrengthens these important efforts.\n  We have worked hard on this bill in the Labor Committee and made much \nprogress--progress which has continued as we have approached today's \nfloor consideration.\n  I am particularly pleased that the bill now includes a summer jobs \nprogram for at-risk youth. In committee, I offered an amendment \nrestoring the Federal Summer Jobs Program, which has made a profound \ndifference for youth across the country, and especially in our poor, \nurban centers. While the provision in the bill before use today does \nnot go as far as my amendment, it will ensure that States establish \nvital summer jobs programs.\n  In addition, the bill now also includes important worker protections. \nIt integrates, rather than eliminates, the successful employment and \ntraining administration into the State structure. The Federal \ngovernance structure has also been substantially improved to recognize \nthe primary responsibility of the Secretaries of Education and Labor.\n  I am especially pleased that several other changes I offered in the \npast weeks and months are a part of the bill we consider today, \nincluding increased parental involvement in vocational education and \nimproved conflict of interest language.\n  That said, I remained concerned about some aspects of the bill before \nus.\n  I strongly believe we should make some provision in this bill for \nmass worker dislocations, especially those that affect more than one \nState, that are the result of Federal action or that are caused by \nnatural disasters. Such mass layoffs and dislocations are often too \nmuch for any one State to handle, and we have a tradition of Federal \ninvolvement in this area. I plan to offer an amendment on this point. \nWithout this amendment, the Federal Government would have no way of \naddressing mass worker dislocations, and States would be left to deal \nwith them alone. I hope my colleagues will support my amendment.\n  In addition, I hope that we can restore the Job Corps Program. \nSenator Kassebaum has spoken often of the need to reform Job Corps, and \nI agree we should work together in a bipartisan fashion to build on the \nconsiderable progress the administration has already made in this area. \nBut I do not believe the Job Corps provisions in this bill qualify as \nreal reform. The bill arbitrarily pulls a number out of the air and \nsays that 25 Job Corps centers must be closed.\n  It makes this determination before a national audit is complete--\nthat's evocative of Judge Roy Bean's famous dictum to ``hang 'em first, \ntry 'em later.'' The bill would also ship management of this successful \nnational program to the States--endangering the future of the Job Corps \nas well as multiplying one administrative structure by 50.\n  We can also improve upon the support offered for actual job training \nservices. The work force development system, as proposed, will provide \nworkers with information on local and State labor markets, with skills \nassessment and job search services. But it will \n\n[[Page S 14843]]\nguarantee workers very little in the way of real training.\n  Two amendments to be offered today will go a long way in providing \nworkers with real training. The Breaux amendment will provide support \nfor one of the most innovative training tools--training vouchers. Under \nhis amendment, dislocated workers will be empowered to make key \ndecisions about training.\n  Senator Moynihan will offer an amendment to restore the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Program. Repealing TAA, as this bill does, breaks \na covenant with America's workers, many of whom have felt the dark side \nof free trade. I believe strongly that free trade is, on balance, good \nfor America and our workers. But it is clear there must be assistance \nin helping workers transition to, train for and locate jobs in growing \nindustries.\n  Finally, I remain concerned about maintaining a Federal commitment to \naudit education. Adult education has provided thousands of needy \nAmericans with assistance in gaining literacy skills that make them \nbetter citizens, better parents and better workers. For these \nAmericans, these dollars provide dignity. I think we must assure that \nthese adults continue to receive these critical services through this \nnew system.\n  I want to come back to the big picture for a moment. Education and \ntraining have always been bipartisan issues and I hope they can be on \nthis bill. Through the amendments today, it is clear we can work \nthrough some of the concerns that remain to fashion consensus \nlegislation that will be good for American workers and good for \nAmerican students. I pledge to be a part of that dialog and am hopeful \nthat at the end of the day, this will be legislation that I can \nsupport.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see the hour of 11:30 has approached.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/10/senate-section/article/S14803-4", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Senator Nunn's plane is late, so I am \ngoing to start this dialog. Senator Nunn and I and other Democrats and \nRepublicans have been talking about NATO expansion. We are very \nconcerned that the debate needs to take place, that Americans need to \nunderstand what is important, what the questions should be, and what \nshould be the criteria for the expansion of NATO.\n  After all, all of us understand that NATO is a mutual defense pact. \nAnd if we expand NATO, we must ask for and receive from the entering \nnation defense assurances, and we must also give those same defense \nassurances. Therefore, we are talking about American troops and \nAmerican tax dollars, just as all of our NATO allies will be looking at \nthe obligations they must accept.\n  All of us must realize how very important and crucial this decision \nis going to be. The expansion of NATO is a strategic decision that must \nnot be made in haste and must not be made before we answer the crucial \nquestions.\n  So Senator Nunn and I are taking this hour, along with others of our \ncolleagues, to talk about it. Let us raise some of the questions that \nwe think need to be answered, and let us look at potential \nalternatives, as well as the actual expansion of NATO, and the \ntimetable that we might look at if we decide to make that decision.\n  The political map of Europe has changed dramatically since the \ntoppling of the Berlin Wall. Just as these changes were a direct result \nof half a century of American leadership and NATO resolve, so, too, \ndoes the future of peace and stability in Europe depend on a strong and \nenduring NATO.\n  With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the rise of new \ngovernments, along with old ethnic and border disputes in Eastern \nEurope, a new set of challenges confronts the North Atlantic alliance.\n  A NATO study just released last week takes a decidedly positive \nstance toward the possibility of expanding NATO membership. The NATO \nstudy is specific in that it asserts that new NATO members will have \nthe same benefits and obligations of all the other members of the \nalliance.\n  The study also anticipates no change in NATO nuclear policy or in the \nforward basing of NATO ground forces. These points are important, as \nfar as they go. However, there are a number of very serious issues \nraised by the issue of NATO enlargement, and these questions need to be \nanalyzed thoroughly before the United States and our NATO allies commit \nourselves to this course of action.\n  First, although the NATO study talks about expansion leading to \nincreased stability and security, it is largely silent on the real why \nof NATO enlargement. The real why is the deep concern in Eastern Europe \nand the Baltic countries about a future threat from Russia and the \nWest's stake in responding to this potential threat.\n  Second, the study does not address the Russian reaction to NATO \nexpansion. It notes that Russia has raised concerns which NATO is \nattempting to address, but the fact is that eastward NATO expansion in \nthe near future is almost certain to prompt opponents of democracy and \neconomic reform in Russia to new heights of paranoia and provocative \nnationalism. It could weaken the prodemocracy and proreform elements of \nthe Russian polity that we should be striving to support. Rather than \nstrengthening stability and security in Eastern Europe, repercussions \nin Russia from rapid NATO expansion could undermine our most important \nnational security goal.\n  Third, full NATO membership for the nations of Eastern Europe has the \npotential to draw the United States and our NATO allies into regional \nborder and ethnic disputes in which we have no demonstrable national \nsecurity interest.\n  Many Americans and many of us in Congress have serious reservations \nabout President Clinton's proposal to commit United States troops to a \npeacekeeping force in the former Yugoslavia. This is an issue we will \ndebate here at a later date. But disagreements about the wisdom of this \ncommitment within this body across our Nation and within NATO are \ndirectly relevant to NATO expansion.\n  Is it in America's interest to enter into treaty obligations that \ncould end up committing American military and political power to \ncurrent and future regional border and ethnic disputes in Eastern \nEurope and the Balkans?\n  When President Clinton argues that we must put troops on the ground \nin Bosnia in order to keep faith with our NATO allies and our \nleadership within the alliance, it illustrates perfectly the very real \nrisks of rapid NATO expansion. Before the United States and our NATO \nallies take this step to guarantee mutual defense, we must acknowledge \nthat the potential for civil war and border and ethnic strife in \nEastern Europe is high. After years of vacillation and debate about \nwhat America should do about Bosnia, we must also acknowledge that \nthere has not been a clear policy. To embark on NATO expansion without \nresolving this crucial question could be disastrous.\n  Potential flash points in Eastern Europe and the Balkans are easy to \nidentify. Current and potential NATO members are directly involved in \nevery one of them: Serbian opposition to Kosovo's aspirations to \nindependence; Greek opposition to Macedonian independence; longstanding \nborder disputes between Poland and Ukraine; unresolved problems \nstemming from the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.\n  If we move ahead rapidly with NATO expansion and the full mutual \ndefense and security commitments that such membership implies, would \nthat set the stage for direct American military involvement in such \ndisputes as we have been drawn into in the conflicts in the former \nYugoslavia? That is a very important question that we must answer \nbefore we take such a giant step.\n  Mr. President, there are alternatives to rapid NATO expansion, \nalternatives \n\n[[Page S 14844]]\nwhich would establish a rational progression to eventual NATO \nmembership and which would provide real encouragement and support to \nthe nations we want to help.\n  The economic and political integration of all the nations of Eastern \nEurope is the best way to ensure long-range stability and a rational \nprogression to expanded NATO membership. For instance, any country \neligible for European Union membership should be considered for NATO \nmembership. So you start with European Union membership requirements \nand the economic and trade alliances that would provide stability, and \nthen you take the next step to NATO membership.\n  Expanding trade and strengthening free market capitalism in the newly \nemergent nations of Eastern Europe would establish a strong foundation \nfor peace and stability based on mutual interests.\n  In parallel fashion, resolution of regional and internal disputes \nshould be a precondition for eligibility for NATO membership.\n  The Partnership for Peace and the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe should be used to help bring about permanent \nsolutions to ethnic and other disputes involving European countries and \nthe Eastern European countries anxious to join NATO. It will also \nstrengthen the democracies in those countries. This would maximize \nsecurity and stability within Eastern Europe and underscore that \nexpansion is not aimed at Russia.\n  I believe American and NATO leadership and influence should be \ndirected at setting up a means for arbitrating these disputes to bring \nan end to the existing conflicts and to head off future situations that \ncould be caused by these disputes. No Nation should be considered for \nNATO membership unless it has committed itself for the present and the \nfuture to accept peaceful resolution of local and regional conflicts.\n  One approach would be to create a forum for arbitration, comprised of \npeers acceptable to all parties to the conflict. To be considered for \nNATO membership, all countries would agree to binding arbitration of \nborder and ethnic disputes. This might be part of the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe or the Partnership for Peace. But \nlet us put that idea on the table. If the American labor negotiation \nconcept is binding arbitration, if the parties agree to the peers that \nwould be the judges, would this not be a way to stop the ethnic and \nborder conflict before they erupt into the tragedy that we have seen in \nthe former Yugoslavia?\n\n  Rather than pell-mell rushing into NATO membership, the implications \nof which are fraught with dangers and complications, the United States \nand its Eastern European allies and our Western European allies should \ninitiate a series of coordinated efforts to strengthen new democracies \nand build a stronger economy and bind the nations of Europe to a set of \nrules that would ensure peace and stability for decades to come.\n  The NATO allies should also make their position clear, with respect \nto the overarching goal of NATO membership, the possibility of future \nRussian aggression. Ironically, those countries with the most valid \nconcerns in this regard--the Balkan nations and the Ukraine--are, \nbecause of their proximity to Russia, the least likely to gain NATO \nmembership in the short run. The people of these countries are unlikely \nto feel more secure if NATO expands eastward but stops short of their \nborders, in effect, placing them in a buffer zone between an enlarged \nNATO and a more paranoid Russia. The NATO allies should ensure that all \nparties understand that accelerated and, if necessary, immediate \nenlargement of NATO would depend directly upon Russian behavior. And in \nthis way we would provide a basis for accelerated NATO expansion in \nresponse to a real threat, but we would avoid provoking the very threat \nwe are trying to guard against.\n  The key criterion would remain as outlined in the NATO study recently \nreleased, Enhancement of Europe's Security and Stability. This twofold \nstrategy for the post-cold-war Europe would provide the affected \nnations with what they need most, a foundation to build greater \nprosperity and stability and a NATO security commitment against the \npossibility of future Russian aggression. This straightforward approach \nis also important for our citizens and those in other NATO countries \nwho will have to pay the bills and make the sacrifices required by \nexpanding eastward NATO's security commitments.\n  We, in America, cannot assess public opinion in other countries, of \ncourse. But when NATO expansion and the debate that will follow focuses \non the issues of NATO nuclear policy, NATO troop deployment, NATO \ninfrastructure development, and former NATO commitments, played against \nthe background of repercussions in Russia and priorities for our fewer \ndefense dollars in the United States, we must first understand public \nopinion in our country, and we and our allies must undertake our \nprimary goal, to maintain the underlying strength of NATO.\n  NATO has the total support of the American people. As we move forward \nto an expanding cooperation and mutual defense, we must maintain that \nAmerican support of NATO. All of the issues that I have raised must be \nconsidered before we expand, so that once the commitment is made, we \ncan be assured that we have the absolute will and determination to keep \nour commitment. The American people must fully understand and support \nthe role of the United States for that goal to be achieved.\n  Mr. President, as I said when I started, Senator Nunn and I and many \nof our colleagues have traveled throughout the new Eastern European \ndemocracies. We have gone to Russia, as members of the Armed Services \nCommittee. We have met with members of the Russian Duma. We want to \ntake the steps that are right, and we want to take them at the right \ntime. That is why Senator Nunn and I and others of our colleagues \nwanted to take this time today to start the debate, to start the \nthinking process, to make sure that we have thought of every \neventuality and that the American people understand what is important, \nwhat questions must be asked, and what the criteria are for expanded \nNATO membership.\n  Mr. President, Senator Nunn has arrived. As I said, his plane was \nlate, but he has now arrived. I want to take this opportunity before I \nturn the floor over to the senior Senator from Georgia to say that I, \nlike so many of my colleagues, watched him yesterday announce that he \nwould not seek a fifth term to the U.S. Senate. He said he needs time \nto read, write, and think. Mr. President, all of us understand in this \nbody how very important the time to think and to write is to a good \npublic debate and a solid public policy. I just want to say that I \nthink Senator Nunn has provided that thoughtful public policy \nleadership in his four terms in the Senate, as chairman and now ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee, on which I have been very \nfortunate to sit.\n  I have worked with Senator Nunn and have come to respect him greatly \nfor the thought that he gives to public policy and for the leadership \nthat he has given for our country. He and I agree in almost every \nrespect about the need for a strong national defense, the need for us \nto think to the future, and I feel that by taking this time out, he is \ngoing to continue to provide even greater leadership for what we must \ndo for the future to make sure that our country remains strong \nmilitarily.\n  I will end by just saying that I think the best of all things that \ncan be said about the Senator is that he had the instinct to know when \nit was time for him to go and the judgment to do it while people still \nhoped that he would stay.\n  Mr. President, I thank you and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague and friend from \nTexas on two points. One is her very kind comments about my difficult \ndecision which has now been made. I appreciate very much her \nthoughtfulness and her comments. I appreciate her friendship, and \nserving with her on the Armed Services Committee has been a great \npleasure.\n  I also commend her for her substantive remarks on the question of \nNATO expansion. I will have more to say about that in a few minutes as \nwe proceed to discuss that very important issue. But I know that the \nSenator from Kansas has been on the floor. I \n\n[[Page S 14845]]\nwould much prefer to hear her address the subject. She has another bill \nto manage. I will listen to her attentively, and then I will make some \ncomments on the substantive issue myself.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank my friend from Texas for her kind \nremarks.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I was just here to fill in for the \nSenator from Georgia until he got to the floor. I just have a few very \nbrief remarks to make.\n  First, I want to say that I am very appreciative of Senator Hutchison \nand Senator Nunn for organizing this debate--a beginning debate, \nperhaps--on a very important subject. I think it is essential for us to \nbegin to think about the consequences of the expansion of the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization and what that may mean.\n  I would also like to say that the announcement of the Senator from \nGeorgia yesterday was one which I think all of us felt great \ndisappointment with, but also thoughtful understanding. Senator Nunn \nhas brought to the U.S. Senate, and to the United States, sincerity, \nintegrity, and a depth of knowledge in a debate of the public policy \nissues before us in this country through the four terms he has served \nthat will be remembered far into the future. And his legacy will be one \nthat will be an inspiration to all who wish to follow in public \nservice. So I join with all on both sides of the aisle who will greatly \nmiss his presence in the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, I would like to join for a few minutes in this \ndiscussion on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and its future.\n  This debate has been ongoing for years in Europe among foreign policy \nexperts, and in the administration. But in Congress, which would have \nto approve any changes in the North Atlantic Treaty to accommodate new \nmembers, it is long overdue. I enter this debate as a strong supporter \nof NATO and a firm believer it must remain the foundation of the \nsecurity architecture in Europe, just as the Senator from Texas pointed \nout in her excellent statement. Supporters of the NATO expansion have \nsaid for some time the issue is not, why and how, but rather who and \nwhen? In my mind, we have gotten ahead of ourselves. The issue, I \nbelieve, remains very much why and how. I believe the first order of \nbusiness must be to clearly define in our own minds, and with our \nallies, what we want NATO to do in Europe's new security environment.\n  The Soviet Union is gone and with it the clear threat that held NATO \ntogether. We know we still need a security structure in Europe and that \nAmerica should be a part of that structure. But we have not in my mind \nmade clear the new purpose for that structure. It seems to me difficult \nto construct a security system and to make significant decisions such \nas whom to include, and by implication whom to exclude, without a \nclear, shared purpose to pursue. The dangers of fuzzy purpose have been \nmade clear in Bosnia. For years, NATO hesitated, the allies could not \nagree, we did not act, and, in my view, the alliance has been weakened \nas a result. While NATO now seems to have found its footing in the \nBosnia conflict, I suggest Bosnia has shown our first order of business \nmust be to find anew our shared purpose for America's involvement in \nEurope. Only then can we properly consider what security structure will \nbest serve that purpose.\n  Let me make clear that I am not arguing against changes in NATO. It \nis a cold war institution that must adapt to new realities. But I am \nnot yet prepared to say that change necessarily equates with expansion. \nPerhaps President Clinton put it best in his speech at Freedom House \nlast week when he called for NATO's modernization. It seems to me this \nbroader question about how NATO should be updated to fit our new needs, \nnot a predetermined notion that expansion is both desirable and \ninevitable, should be the debate we now take up. As this debate \ncontinues and reaches the Congress, we will face many questions. Are \nthe American people prepared to pledge, in the words of the North \nAtlantic Treaty, that an armed attack against one or more of these \npotential new members will be considered an attack against all? That, I \nthink, is a question we should keep first and foremost in our minds.\n  It is easy to say how important this expansion will be. It is \nimportant to the future of the organization. But when it comes right \ndown to it, are we prepared to do what is asked for in the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization Charter as it stands? I do not know the \nanswer to that. But I do know that it is the basic issue we are \ndebating. Those who support this expansion have a heavy burden to make \ntheir case.\n  I look forward to the comments of Senator Nunn. I think the debate is \ncalled for by Mrs. Hutchison in her role on the Armed Services \nCommittee and her important role as a Senator from Texas, where there \nare a number of military installations. Kansas has military \ninstallations also. Fort Riley is always very involved in forward \ndeployment to Germany. And certainly the same for the senior Senator \nfrom Georgia [Mr. Nunn]. These are issues of grave importance to all of \nus, and I think, as we can begin to reason together, it will be useful \nin this dialog.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Kansas, Senator \nKassebaum, for her kind remarks about my service in the U.S. Senate. I \nam not here today to precipitate that discussion. We probably had \nenough retirement announcements around this institution for 1 year. \nThat is not my purpose in taking the floor today, but I do thank her \nfor her remarks.\n  I also agree with her words of caution on NATO expansion. We have a \nlot of thinking to do. We have a lot of debating to do. We have a lot \nof discussion to conduct, to make the right kind of decision, both for \nthe alliance itself and for the stability of Europe.\n  I thank my friend from Texas, again, for organizing this discussion \nthis morning. I think it is going to be very fruitful in precipitating \nother people to think and also speak on the subject. I talked to enough \nSenators on both sides of the aisle to know there are a number of \npeople who are concerned, deeply concerned, and who have a lot of \nthoughts and a lot of questions about this matter. I think we will be \nhearing from them in the days and weeks ahead. So I thank both of my \ncolleagues for their remarks.\n  I say to the Senator from Kansas, she has been a very fine leader. We \nhave relied on her for so long in the field of foreign policy as well \nas many other fields, and I have such deep admiration for her and her \nleadership, and I am grateful to her for that.\n  Mr. President, the issue of NATO expansion deserves thorough and \ncareful consideration because it has important ramifications for the \nfuture of NATO, for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, for \nthe future of Russia and the other countries of the former Soviet \nUnion, and for the future security order throughout Europe, East and \nWest.\n  President Clinton has declared, and NATO has concurred, the \norganization's enlargement is not an issue of whether but of when and \nhow. I, like the Senator from Kansas, believe the when and how need to \nbe discussed more thoroughly.\n  On September 28 of this year, NATO released a study on the why and \nhow of enlargement. It reserves for future decisions the question of \nwho and when. On the positive side, the study declares that NATO \nenlargement will be gradual, deliberate, and transparent. It presents \nno fixed set of criteria for membership but specifies that enlargement \nwill be decided on a case-by-case basis, with the key judgments being \nwhether a given country's admission will contribute to Europe's \nstability and security.\n  It states that new members will have the same benefits and \nobligations as all other members and it anticipates no change in NATO \nnuclear policy or in the forward basing of NATO ground forces.\n  On the less positive side, I believe three large gaps exist in the \nstudy and give it an unrealistically optimistic tone. First, the study \nprovides no satisfactory answer to the key question of why, and merely \nexpresses what NATO hopes will be the outcome of expansion: increased \nstability for all in the Euro-Atlantic area. All of us hope for that, \nbut that does not really get down to the essential reasons of how and \nwhy expansion will lead to that result. \n\n[[Page S 14846]]\n\n  Second, it glosses over the increasingly negative Russian reaction to \nNATO expansion.\n  Third, it asserts that enlargement is part of a broad security \narchitecture in Europe that transcends the idea of dividing lines in \nEurope, yet it is silent about the fact that gradual enlargement will \ncreate dividing lines between those countries admitted and those \ncountries that are not admitted.\n  NATO was established primarily to protect the Western democracies \nfrom an expansionist Soviet Union that, after World War II, seemed \ndetermined to spread its influence through subversion, through \npolitical intimidation, and through the threat of the use of military \nforce. With the end of the cold war, we have witnessed a heart \npounding, terrain altering set of earthquakes centered in the former \nSoviet Union and in Eastern Europe. These seismic events have ended an \ninternational era. The European security environment has changed. We \nhave moved from a world of high risk but also high stability, because \nof the danger of escalation and the balance of terror on both sides, to \na world of much lower risk but much lower stability. We are all aware \nof the dramatic change in the threat environment in Europe resulting \nfrom these seismic changes.\n  The immediate danger is posed by violent terrorist groups, by \nisolated rogue states, by ethnic, religious and other types of \nsubnational passions that can flare into vicious armed conflict, as we \nhave seen too well and too thoroughly in the Bosnian conflict.\n  The lethality of any and all of these threats can be greatly \nmagnified by the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological \nweapons, as well as by the spread of destabilizing conventional \nweapons.\n  At the same time, Russia currently possesses at least 20,000 nuclear \nweapons--in fact over 20,000--at least 40,000 tons of chemical weapons, \nadvanced biological warfare capability, hundreds of tons of fissile \nmaterial, huge stores of conventional weapons, plus literally thousands \nof scientists and technicians skilled in manufacturing weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Mr. President, this is the first time in history that an empire has \ndisintegrated while possessing such enormous destructive capabilities. \nEven if these capabilities are greatly reduced, the know-how, the \nproduction capability, and the dangers of proliferation will endure for \nmany years. Even if we do our very best job, this is going to be our \nNo. 1 security threat for America, for NATO, and for the world in terms \nof decades; not simply a few years.\n  As we contemplate NATO enlargement, I believe that we must carefully \nmeasure NATO enlargement's effect on this proliferation security \nproblem, which is our No. 1 security problem.\n  Threats cannot be cleanly delinked, resulting in one section on \nproliferation and another section on NATO enlargement as if there is no \nconnectivity. Those two subjects are intimately related. And in the \nlonger term, we cannot dismiss the possibility of a resurgent and \nthreatening Russia. Russia not only has inherited the still dangerous \nremnants of the Soviet war machine, but in its current weakened \ncondition Russia contains potential resources by virtue of its size and \nstrategic location. Russia exerts considerable weight in Europe, Asia, \nand the Middle East. Meanwhile, Russia has inherited the former Soviet \nUnion's veto power in the U.N. Security Council, and, therefore, has a \nmajor voice in multilateral decisionmaking.\n  Mr. President, Russia will be a major factor, for better or for \nworse, across the entire spectrum of actual and potential threats that \nface us over the next years ahead. Russia can fuel regional conflicts \nwith high-technology conventional weapons along with other political \nand material support, or, on the other hand, Russia can cooperate with \nus in diffusing such conflicts, particularly by preventing the spread \nof Russian weaponry to irresponsible hands. Russia can emerge as a \nmilitarily aggressive power. That is certainly possible. Or Russia can \nassist the United States and the Western World and the free world in \naverting new rivalry among major powers that poison the international \nsecurity environment. Russia can pursue a confrontational course that \nundermines the security and cooperation in Europe, or Russia can work \nwith us to broaden and strengthen the emerging system of multilateral \nsecurity in Europe.\n  Mr. President, no one knows the answer to any of these questions at \nthis juncture. Russia itself does not know the answer because it is in \na period of economic stress, and political challenge and turmoil.\n  Mr. President, out of this background come five fundamental points. \nFirst, preventing or curbing the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction is the most important and the most difficult security \nchallenge we face. And that is particularly true when you have a very \nlarge growth of organized crime, international organized crime, and \nterrorism in our own country and around the world.\n  Second, Russia is a vast reservoir of weaponry, weapons material, and \nweapons know-how. Thousands of people in Russia and throughout the \nformer Soviet Union have the knowledge, the access, and the strong \neconomic incentives to engage in weapons traffic.\n  Mr. President, there are literally thousands of scientists in Russia \nthat know how to make weapons of mass destruction, that know how to \nmake high-technology weapons that can shoot down aircraft in the air \nincluding passenger liners, that know how to make missile technology to \ndeliver these weapons of mass destruction across borders, and even \nacross continents. They have this knowledge. But several thousand of \nthem at least do not know where their next paycheck is coming from. \nThey do not know how they are going to feed their families, and they \nare in great demand around the world from both terrorist organizations \nand from rogue Third World countries.\n  The third conclusion is that increased Russian isolation, paranoia, \nor instability would make our No. 1 security challenge more difficult \nand more dangerous.\n  The fourth conclusion: Although the West cannot control events in \nRussia, and probably can assist political and economic reform there \nonly on the margins, as the medical doctors say, our first principle \nshould be to do no harm.\n  Fifth, we must avoid being so preoccupied with NATO enlargement that \nwe ignore the consequences it may have for even more important security \npriorities.\n  Mr. President, it is against this background that I offer a few \nobservations on the current approach to NATO enlargement.\n  NATO was founded on a fundamental truth: The vital interests of the \ncountries of NATO were put at risk by the military power and political \nintimidation of the Soviet Union. As President Harry Truman said in his \nmemoirs, ``The [NATO] pact was a shield against aggression and against \nthe fear of aggression.'' Because NATO was built on this fundamental \ntruth, and because we discussed it openly and faced it truthfully with \nour people, the NATO alliance endured and prevailed. There was no \nmisunderstanding about why we were forming NATO when we did it. Today, \nwe seem to be saying different things to different people on the \nsubject of NATO enlargement.\n  To the Partnership for Peace countries, we are saying that you are \nall theoretically eligible, and, if you meet NATO's entrance criteria, \nyou will move to the top of the list. To the Russians we are also \nsaying that NATO enlargement is not threat-based, and it is not aimed \nat you. In fact, we say to Russia you, too, can eventually became a \nmember of NATO.\n  This raises a serious question. Are we really going to be able to \nconvince the East Europeans that we are protecting them from their \nhistorical threats--that usually boils down to Russia--while we \nconvince the Russians that NATO enlargement has nothing to do with \nRussia as a potential military threat?\n  Are we really going to be able to convince the Ukraine and the Baltic \ncountries that they are somehow more secure when NATO expands eastward \nbut draws protective lines short of their borders and places them in \nwhat Russians are bound to perceive as the buffer zone? Is that going \nto make them feel more secure?\n  In short, Mr. President, are we trying to bridge the unbridgeable, to \nexplain the unexplainable? Are we deluding others, or are we deluding \nourselves? \n\n[[Page S 14847]]\n\n  The advantages of NATO's current course toward enlargement cannot be \nignored, and I do not ignore that. If NATO expands in the near term to \ntake in the Visegrad countries, these countries would gain in self-\nconfidence and stability. It is possible that border disputes and major \nethnic conflicts would be settled before entry--for instance, the \ndispute involving the Hungarian minority in Romania.\n  What these countries really want and what they really need is the \nability to have trade and economic relations with the European \nCommunity and the rest of the world. They really need markets now--not \nmilitary protection. Their threat is economic at this moment, and \nprobably for the few years to come. No one can conceive of an invasion \nby Russia in the near term. The question is in the long term. That is \nanother matter. But in the near term, economic trade and entry into the \nEuropean Community is what they need most of all to stabilize their \ndemocratic efforts and their economy.\n  Serious disadvantages must also be thought through carefully. If \nNATO's enlargement stays on its current course, reaction in Russia is \nalmost inevitably going to be a sense of isolation by those that are \ncommitted to democracy and democratic reform with varying degrees of \nparanoia, nationalism, and demagoguery emerging from across the current \npolitical spectrum. In next few years Russia will have neither the \nresources nor the wherewithal to respond to any NATO enlargement with a \nconventional military buildup. They simply do not have the resources to \ndo that, even if they choose to.\n  If, however, the more nationalist and more extreme political forces \ngain the upper hand by election or otherwise, we are likely to see \nother responses that are more achievable, and also even more dangerous \nto European stability. For example, while Russia would take years to \nmount a sustained military threat to Eastern Europe, it can within \nweeks or months exert severe external and internal pressures on its \nimmediate neighbors to the west, including the Baltic countries, and \nincluding the Ukraine. This could set in motion a dangerous action-\nreaction cycle.\n\n  Moreover, because a conventional military response from Russia in \nanswer to NATO enlargement is not feasible economically, a nuclear \nresponse in the form of a higher alert status for Russia's remaining \nstrategic nuclear weapons and conceivably renewed deployment of \ntactical nuclear weapons is more likely.\n  I recall very well when the United States and our allies felt we were \noverwhelmed with conventional forces by the former Soviet Union. How \ndid we respond? We responded by building up tactical nuclear forces. We \nresponded by deploying thousands of tactical nuclear forces because we \ndid not have the tanks, we did not have the artillery tubes to meet the \nconventional challenge. Are we confident the Russians would be so \ndifferent from us if they truly have a nationalistic surge and end up \nbelieving the NATO enlargement is a threat to them?\n  I am not confident that would not be their response as it was ours \nyears ago.\n  The security of NATO, Russia's neighbors and the countries of Eastern \nEurope will not be enhanced if the Russian military finger moves closer \nto the nuclear trigger.\n  Where do we go from here? I recognize full well it is much easier to \ncriticize than to construct, so let me make a few suggestions. I am not \nopposed to NATO expansion per se, but I feel that we need to alter the \ncourse of that expansion. I suggest a two-track approach to NATO \nenlargement. The first track would be evolutionary and would depend on \npolitical and economic developments within the European countries that \naspire to full NATO membership. When a country becomes eligible for \nEuropean Union membership, it will also be eligible to join the Western \nEuropean Union, and then it will be prepared for NATO membership, \nsubject, of course, to NATO's formal approval.\n  This is a natural process connecting economic and security interests. \nWe can honestly say to Russia, and particularly the democrats in Russia \nwho are struggling to be able to have a democracy in that country, this \nprocess is economic in nature and is not aimed at you.\n  The second track would also be a clear track. It would be a threat-\nbased track. An accelerated and, if necessary, immediate expansion of \nNATO would depend on Russian behavior. We should be candid with the \nRussian leadership and the Russian people, above all be honest with the \nRussian people by telling them, frankly, if you respect the sovereignty \nof your neighbors, carry out your solemn arms control commitments and \nother international obligations, and if you continue down the path of \ndemocracy and economic reform, your neighbors will not view you as a \nthreat and neither will NATO. We will watch, however, and we will react \nto aggressive moves against other sovereign states, to militarily \nsignificant violations of your arms control and other legally binding \nobligations pertinent to the security of Europe, and to the emergence \nof a nondemocratic Russian Government that impedes fair elections, \nsuppresses domestic freedoms or institutes a foreign policy \nincompatible with the existing European security system. These \ndevelopments would be threatening to the security of Europe and would \nrequire a significant NATO response, including expansion eastward. We \nwould be enlarging NATO based on a real threat. We would not, however, \nbe helping to create the very threat we are trying to guard against. \nAnd the Senator from Texas made this point very well a few minutes ago \nin her remarks.\n  Mr. President, this would change the psychology of the NATO expansion \nbecause the democrats in Russia would be able to say to their own \npeople: Our behavior, what we do with our military forces, what we do \nwith our tactical nuclear posture, what we do regarding human rights \nand freedom of the press, what we do regarding our solemn arms control \nobligations will have a bearing on whether NATO expands. If we do not \ncause a threat, we in turn are not likely to be threatened.\n  That changes the psychology completely from where it is now where the \nnationalists, any time you are in a meeting with Russian \nparliamentarians--and I am sure the Senator from Kansas and the Senator \nfrom Texas have experienced this--what you see is that when the \nnationalists hear about NATO expansion, they start smiling and almost \nclapping because it feeds right into what they want to convince their \npeople of, that is, they have to reconstitute not only the military but \nthe empire. On the other hand, when you talk about NATO expansion, \nthose parliamentarians that truly believe in democracy start wiping \ntheir brow with their handkerchief because they know the kind of \nproblems it is going to cause them politically in their own country.\n  Finally, Mr. President, Partnership for Peace, I believe, is a sound \nframework for this two-track approach. Its role would be to prepare \ncandidate countries and NATO itself for enlargement on either the \nEuropean track or the threat-based track. Programs of joint training \nand exercises, development of a common operational doctrine and \nestablishment of the interoperational weaponry, technology and \ncommunications would continue based on more realistic contingencies. \nTough issues such as nuclear policy and forward stationing of NATO \ntroops would be discussed in a threat-based environment, one which we \nwould hope would remain theoretical.\n  I know there are those in Europe and there are those here who say, \nHow can we handle this expansion of the European community? We have \ncomplex matters like farm products. How do we handle farm products \ncoming in from Eastern Europe, or any other type product?\n  When you expand NATO, you are extending a nuclear umbrella over the \ncountries coming in. Are we to be told it is easier to say that if a \ncountry is attacked, America is going to respond if necessary with \nnuclear weapons, than it is to decide how many farm products come \nacross our border?\n  I do not buy the argument that economic expansion is more difficult \nand more challenging than extending the nuclear umbrella.\n  As the Russian leaders and people make their important choices, they \nshould know that Russian behavior will be a key and relative factor for \nNATO's future. This straightforward approach does not give them a veto. \nI do not favor giving Russia a veto. But I do favor putting them on \nnotice that \n\n[[Page S 14848]]\nwhat they do themselves in creating threats to others may very well \ndetermine what the others do in terms of enlarging NATO and enlarging \nthe security umbrella.\n  This straightforward approach is also important for our own citizens \nhere in this country who will have to pay the bills. They will have to \nmake the sacrifices required by expanded NATO security commitments.\n  Again, I am not against expanding NATO. I think there are countries \nin Eastern Europe and Central Europe that will be eligible for NATO \nmembership, democracies that will qualify and be eventual members. I am \nconcerned about how we do it and how we go about explaining our logic. \nIt makes a big difference.\n  The profound historical contrast between post-World War I Germany and \npost-World War II Germany should tell us that neocontainment of Russia \nis not the answer at this critical historical juncture. If future \ndevelopments require the containment of Russia, it should be real \ncontainment based on real threats.\n  I thank again my colleague from Texas for organizing this. I know \nthere are others who are not back in town who want to speak on this \nsubject, and I hope by her leadership and the discussions we have had \nthis morning we will precipitate debate on this subject. I know there \nwill be debate on both sides. There are other people, whom I respect \ngreatly, who have different views on this subject, but it is time for \nus to start paying attention before we get down to the point of having \nsome agreement presented to the Senate for our ratification that we \nhave not studied, that we have not contemplated, but that has profound \nimplications.\n  I at this point again thank my colleague from Texas and yield the \nfloor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a \nmoment, I should like to say I really appreciate, of course, his very \narticulate view of this issue. He has given speeches on this subject. \nAs I said earlier, he and I have traveled with the Armed Services \nCommittee to Russia.\n  We have met with members of the Duma and we have also been to many of \nthe new emerging Eastern European democracies. And I think that it \nwould be very important for us to keep in mind the conflicts that we \nsee in many of those different countries versus what we hear from \nmembers of the Duma. And I thought it was especially important that \nSenator Nunn mentioned the reformers, and I would like him, if he \nwould, to comment on the upcoming elections and the impact that this \ndiscussion could have on those upcoming elections.\n  Mr. NUNN. I say to my friend from Texas, we have had some very \ninteresting meetings in both Russia and this country with our Russian \nparliamentarian friends. And I believe that it is clear in those \nmeetings that the fear among reformers and democrats is that this \nissue, which most of them do not realistically see as a threat to \nRussia, but that this expansion of NATO will give the nationalists, the \nextremists, the demagogues, those who want to restructure and rebuild \nthe empire and threaten their neighbors, will give them an argument to \nbe made for the Russian population that has been hearing that NATO is \nan enemy for the last 40, 45 years.\n  So, it is the great concern of the reformers in Russia that I believe \nwe have to take into account. We will not be doing anyone in Europe a \nfavor if, by taking certain action regarding NATO expansion, we end up \ngiving an edge in the political process to the most extremist elements \nin Russia.\n  This is not to say that we should give them a veto. They should have \nno veto. NATO should make its own decisions. But Russian behavior and \neconomic reality in Europe also should play a very important role in \nhow we go about taking these important steps.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Along that same line, if the Senator would yield, I \nthink it is also important that we link Russian behavior to any \nexpansions of NATO and how those will come about so that there will be \nan incentive on the part of Russia to make sure that they are \ncooperating in the community of nations and that they understand that \nit is only if we begin to see a buildup or some sort of aggressive \nbehavior that then we would come in in a very swift manner and look at \nthe expansion possibilities.\n  Mr. NUNN. I agree with the Senator from Texas on that. I think that \nis the way we ought to structure it. I believe having the natural \napproach of an economic admission to the European Community be one \npath, one option which is a natural course and would lead inevitably to \nNATO eligibility for those countries. That is one course.\n  But the other course ought to be very clear, the military-threat-\nbased course. But where we are now is between those courses. We are \nsaying that the European Community is not going to be able to expand \nfast enough and saying there is no threat from Russia. And we are \nsaying that Russia can be a member of NATO at some point in time--and \nthat simply does not ring true to people who have observed this process \nover a period of time from the European perspective, it does not ring \nvery true to those in the Ukraine who worry about Russian reaction and \nknow they will not be the first country, one of the first countries, to \nbe admitted, does not ring true to the Baltics where they know that \nthey can be subverted by Russia on a 48-hour basis. It would take years \nfor Russia to be able to muster the military power to invade Poland, \nbut to destabilize politically the Baltics would take a matter of days. \nAnd that may very well be the pattern that could emerge if we are not \nprudent in how we go about this situation.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. One other point that I think is important. The \nSenator from Georgia was very instrumental in negotiating the language \nthat we put in our authorization bill regarding the missile defense \ncapabilities that the United States would have and how that relates to \nthe ABM Treaty that we have with Russia, and it also affects the START \nTreaty, which is being looked at for ratification by the Duma, the \nRussian Duma at this time.\n  I think those are very important issues, along with the nuclear \nwarheads that are still in Russia. All of those are issues that I think \nmust be looked at as we determine how our relationship with Russia and \nthe impact that NATO expansion and the way we do it has. As the Senator \nfrom Georgia mentioned, there will be no Russian veto of NATO \nexpansion. But as we move along, we can certainly make this decision in \nthe right way that keeps our ability to negotiate with Russia on any \nchanges in the ABM Treaty, on ratification of the START Treaty, those \nthings that are very important to our security as well as their \nsecurity and the security of Eastern Europe.\n  So it is not just an easy decision that we make with regard to any \none country in Eastern Europe, as the Senator from Georgia fully \nrealizes, especially having been so involved in the negotiations on \nwhat we will do in the future to protect our borders and our theaters \nfrom potential ballistic missile attack.\n  Mr. NUNN. I say to my friend from Texas, I could not agree more with \nher on what she said. The threat in Europe now is not Russian invasion \nof one of the Visegrad countries. The threat is the huge proliferation \nproblem with nuclear materials being smuggled across the borders to \nthese countries, with Russian scientists under severe economic pressure \nbeing in demand in various parts of the world. But, hopefully, we can \nwork together to prevent that. That is the threat.\n  The threat is terrorism, the threat is ethnic strife, the threat is \nreligious strife. It could change in 10 years. Ten years from now \nRussia could reemerge as a real military threat to some of those \ncountries. We have to be prepared for that. We have to make sure we are \nin a position to react to that. But now we have many mutual interests, \nand not just with Russians, but with the East Europeans and others, in \nproliferation and working together against organized crime, which is \none of the biggest challenges Russia has right now, their organized \ncriminal activity which is devastating to confidence for investment, \neconomic kinds of commitments by business people from all over the \nworld.\n  So we have so many mutual interests with Russia. We are also going to \nhave many differences with Russia. They do not have the same interests \nwe have in many parts of the world. They have historically had \ndifferent interests. But we have got to build the common bridges. And \neven when we have a disagreement, we have to continue to \n\n[[Page S 14849]]\nwork at this proliferation problem because we do not want to wake up in \n3 years or 5 years and find that the kind of people who just derailed \nAmtrak, if that was a terrorist group, the kind of people that blew up \nthe Federal building in Oklahoma, or the kind of people who carried out \na chemical attack in Tokyo, we do not want to wake up and find those \npeople possess awesome weapons of mass destruction. Only by working \nwith the elements in Russia who are willing to work on this are we \ngoing to be able to prevent this from happening. It will be difficult \nat best.\n  So I think this factor has to be very much considered in our overall \ndeliberations about how we go about expanding a security alliance \nwhich, after all, is supposed to be about security. And this is the \nheart of our security threat. It is also the heart of Russia's security \nthreat. I, like the Senator from Texas, believe they have a threat of \nmissiles on their borders at some point.\n  I believe that at some point we will find it conducive to them and to \nus to work together in this overall area of preventing the spread of \nmissile technology and also defending against it where required and \nwhere necessary. So I agree with the Senator from Texas and again \ncommend her for her leadership and her thoughts on this subject.\n\n\n            The Future of NATO--Enlarging for a New Century\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senators Nunn and \nHutchison and others in this important discussion on the future of NATO \nand NATO's role in maintaining U.S. national security in the next \ncentury. My colleague from Georgia has been a powerful driving force in \nthe debate on the relevance of NATO. He takes second place to no one in \nhis intellectual honesty and in his ability to examine this issue with \ndepth and intelligence. I appreciate his seeking this time to engage \nthe Senate in thoughtful discussion of this important issue and I thank \nhim for asking me to take part.\n  Like the Senator from Georgia and many others in this Chamber, I am \ndeeply concerned about the role the United States will play in \ninternational affairs in the years ahead of us. Our involvement with \nNATO--more precisely, our leadership of NATO--has been a critical part \nof American involvement in global affairs since our victory in the cold \nwar. There is an important role for NATO to continue to play for the \nstability and security of Europe and the United States and we must \ncontinue to be an active leader in this highly successful alliance of \nsovereign, democratic states.\n  As all of us know too well, during this century the United States \nfought two world wars in Europe. We recognized that a free and stable \nEurope is vital to America's own national security. Our victory in \nthose wars was attributable to the courage and ability of our Armed \nForces, the support of the American people, and the willingness of the \nUnited States to form alliances with other nations when it was mutually \nbeneficial.\n  At the end of the Second World War, we developed a strong alliance of \nfree nations to ensure that America and Western Europe would remain \nsafe and free. That alliance, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization--\nNATO--successfully deterred Soviet Communist expansionism which \nthreatened the security of the United States and our European allies \nfor four decades. NATO has been the most successful defensive alliance \nthe world has ever seen. By maintaining the military and economic \nstrength, and political will of its members, NATO deterred war and, in \nfact, never had to fire a shot against any of the states it had been \nformed to defend against.\n  Now the cold war is history. People in most of central and Eastern \nEurope have made bold and significant steps toward democracy. They have \nelected governments which share our beliefs in freedom, human rights, \nand the power of free markets.\n  There are some in America and abroad who argue that NATO is no longer \nnecessary because the cold war has been won. But in my view those who \nadvocate the abandonment of NATO are wrong. NATO is not an anachronism. \nThe fundamental purpose of NATO--uniting like-minded, free, democratic \nnations in common self-defense to deter attacks and prevent war--\nremains as valid and worthy a purpose today as it was in 1949. It is \nimportant to do all that is necessary to ensure that NATO can continue \nto fulfill this role. That does not mean, however, that the NATO of \n2001 should be or even can be identical to the NATO of 1949 or 1995.\n  NATO must adapt to new political geography and continue to contribute \nto the development of an integrated, free Europe.\n  Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, NATO and defense thinkers have \nconducted a number of studies on the future of NATO. In 1994 the Center \nfor Strategic and International Studies [CSIS] published a report by \nits Senior NATO Policy Group, upon which I was privileged to serve \nalong with Senators Nunn, Cohen, and McCain. Earlier this year, the \nCouncil on Foreign Relations published the report of an independent \ntask force chaired by former Secretary of Defense Harold Brown entitled \n``Should NATO Expand?'' This year Secretary of Defense Perry provided \nhis views on NATO expansion in a March 10 report to Congress. Each of \nthese studies has moved forward the debate on NATO enlargement and new \nroles for NATO.\n  Now the alliance itself has issued a major report on the question in \nits September 1995 ``Study on NATO Enlargement.'' This most recent \nstudy by the 16 member states of NATO sets out the purposes and \nprinciples of enlargement and establishes a process under which NATO \nwill consider admitting new members on a case-by-case basis. It does \nnot establish a specific timetable for the admission of new members, \nprioritize candidates for membership, or develop precise criteria which \nmust be met in order to gain membership. It does, however, convey a \nnumber of important messages.\n  First, new members of NATO will need to accede to the Washington \nTreaty. No state may enjoy the rights and benefits of NATO membership \nwithout also assuming the obligations of membership.\n  Second, negotiations on admission of new members will consider both \nthe candidate state's potential contributions to collective defense as \nwell as broader political and security criteria.\n  Third, expansion of NATO, if it occurs, is intended to strengthen \nrelations with Russia through increased European stability and \nsecurity. While Russian sensitivities and security requirements must \nand will be considered, no country outside the alliance will have a \nveto over NATO enlargement.\n  Needless to say, a document such as this study which reflects \nconsensus of 16 nations is unlikely to fully satisfy everyone. Because \nI have spoken often on the need for NATO to expand its membership \nsooner rather than later, I would have preferred to see in this study a \nstatement of clear criteria for inviting new members to join the \nalliance. Unfortunately, in my view, many of these central issues have \nbeen left to the negotiations between NATO and each prospective new \nmember.\n  I have read with great interest and attention the analysis of my \nfriend from Georgia, Senator Nunn, on the question of NATO expansion. \nThe questions he poses are good ones which need to be considered as we \nand NATO decide how to proceed. Senator Nunn continues to make \ninvaluable contributions to the debate on these critical issues which \naffect our national security and I hope that he will continue to speak \nout and to help focus our attention on them.\n  Last week, the Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] and I had the \nopportunity to meet with NATO Secretary General Willy Claes and the \nU.S. Ambassador to NATO Robert Hunter. In the course of a wide-ranging \ndiscussion, we spoke of the importance of American leadership in NATO \nand the question of NATO enlargement.\n  In that regard, I would like to make a few observations.\n  First, NATO always has been and must continue to be an alliance which \nis both military and political. It will not just be the number of \ntroops which NATO nations can mass which will keep Europe and the \nUnited States secure in the decades ahead as it was not just numbers \nwhich kept Europe secure during the cold war. Rather, it is the degree \nof political solidarity and agreement on fundamental principles of \ndemocracy, human rights, and the necessity for free markets which will \nkeep \n\n[[Page S 14850]]\nthe alliance viable and provide security for its members. Candidates \nfor membership must demonstrate the same commitment to these democratic \nprinciples as current members. There can be no exceptions granted with \nregard to belief in and enforcement of human rights, the exercise of \nfreedoms by citizens, the transparency of defense budgets, real \ncivilian control of the military and intelligence arms of the \ngovernment, and adherence to the principles of peaceful resolution of \ndisputes within and beyond a state's borders.\n  Second, membership in the alliance carries with it obligations and \nbenefits. No candidate can be accepted just because it wants the fruits \nof membership; each state must be able to contribute something to the \nalliance. This will be a difficult issue to resolve for the new \ndemocracies are constrained by their defense budgets and economic \ndifficulties. NATO must be realistic, but at the same time creative, in \ndetermining what capabilities NATO requires and how new members can \ncontribute to them.\n  Third, membership in NATO is not a zero-sum game. The new democracies \nof central and Eastern Europe are not competing with each for some \npredefined number of spaces being allocated for expansion. No one knows \ntoday whether the right number for the composition of NATO is 16, as it \nis today, or 18 or 20 or more. Candidates must be evaluated on the \nbasis of the political and military norms which members must \ndemonstrate on an absolute--not comparative--basis. It should not \nmatter if one candidate country is less able to contribute than another \ncandidate country. If the required standards are met, both should be \nadmitted.\n  Fourth, participation in the Partnership for Peace is an important \ntransitional step for candidate countries though it need not be a \nmandatory one if a candidate can demonstrate it meets the requirements \nof membership without it. I personally find it hard to believe that a \ncountry which chooses not to take part in the Partnership for Peace \nwould or should be an early candidate for membership. If new members \nare to be full participants in all aspects of the alliance upon \nratification of their membership, they should want to start exercising \nwith NATO, determining what they need to achieve full integration, and \nexposing their own leaders--both military and civilian--to NATO \nprocedures and thinking.\n  Fifth, contrary to the assertions of nationalist forces within \nRussia, NATO expansion is not and should not be construed as a threat \nto Russia. I fully agree with the conclusions of the recent NATO study \nthat no state outside of NATO should have a veto over the accession of \nnew members to the alliance. These are decisions which the independent \nmembers of the alliance themselves must make. Nor do I believe that \ndecisions on membership should be based solely on threat \nconsiderations. NATO should expand to meet the requirements for \nsecurity and stability in Europe well into the next century. Russian \nconduct today cannot be used as a criterion by itself to determine \nwhether there is a need to expand the alliance's membership. To do so, \nin fact gives Russia a de facto veto over what the alliance does in the \nnear-term and long-term. We must all do everything we can to assure the \nleaders and people of Russia that NATO expansion is not just a shifting \nof cold war confrontation lines to the east. At the same time we need \nto make decisions which are right for our security and that of our \nEuropean allies today and into the next century.\n  Finally, we must not lose sight of the fact that we are a founding \nmember of NATO not just because we wanted to help our friends in \nWestern Europe, but because it was in our national interest. I believe \nthat this is as true today as it was in 1949. NATO expansion is \nsomething we should do because it is in our interest and the interest \nof security and stability in Europe. It is not a gift which we offer up \nto former Communist States or a reward for beginning the movement to \nfull democracy.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that it is in our interest to find ways \nto encourage and support the transitions to democracy which are taking \nplace today in Europe. Expanding NATO membership is one way to do this. \nIt should not, however, be done in isolation. Nor should it be done \nsolely because of what is or is not going on within Russia. We have no \ndesire to confront Russia along a new wall of tension and \nconfrontation. All of us--Americans, Russians, current members of NATO, \nand prospective members--must continue to work together to find ways to \ncooperate and make the world a safer and more prosperous place for us \nall.\n  I hope that this discussion, which Senators Nunn and Hutchison have \norganized, will help set a positive tone for the policy debates which \nlie ahead on this important issue.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, could I inquire from the Senator from \nLouisiana if he wishes to speak on this subject or did he want to \nchange subjects?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I did want to speak on this subject.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will be happy to yield.\n  Let me say, before the Senator from Georgia leaves, that I think that \nhis last point was a very important one. That is, in the future as we \nlook at the ABM Treaty and the missile defense technologies, I think \nthat the strategic interests of the United States will probably be \nparallel with the interests of Russia because both of us will want to \nlook for other ways to defend our own shores from potential ballistic \nmissile attack. That is something that I think the Russians will be in \nagreement with the United States on, and I certainly hope that we can \npursue our mutual defenses as we keep the ABM Treaty able to change \nwith the times. It is no longer a bipolar world but, in fact, a \nmultipolar world. So we will want to make sure that the ABM Treaty can \nlast by letting it change with the times.\n  Well, I want to certainly yield some time to the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  I also do want to mention that Senator Cohen from Maine was going to \nbe with us today to add to this discussion. And a very sad thing \nhappened. He lost his father just over the weekend, so he was not able \nto come. And our thoughts and prayers are certainly with Senator Cohen \nat this time. And we look forward to having a debate with him included \nbecause he is a thoughtful person who has traveled through these \ncountries as well and I think will add greatly to the debate.\n\n  I yield now to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I notice that the time is due to expire \nmomentarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to extend the \ntime for morning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    POLICY OF CONTAINMENT IS MADNESS\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank the occupant of the chair.\n  Mr. President, over the Memorial Day recess, I had the opportunity, \nalong with the Senator from Georgia and other Members of the Senate and \nof the House, to go to a conference sponsored by the Carnegie Institute \nfor Peace in Madrid. It was a joint conference between us and Members \nof the Russian Duma. Those Members had been selected on a broad \nphilosophical spectrum properly and as fully representative of the Duma \nas we could get. There were those who were the nationalists, there were \nthose who were the Democrats, there were those representing every \nspectrum of the Duma.\n  We thought we were going to discuss a whole range of issues, but the \ntheme that came back over and over and over again was the threat that \nall of these Members of the Duma feel from making the bordering \ncountries around them of Eastern Europe members of NATO subject to the \nnuclear shield of the United States.\n  It is an obsession with those Members of the Duma, and as we \ndiscussed it with them, it struck me, first of all, that what possible \ninterest is there of the United States to so threaten Russia that all \nof the ongoing things we have with respect to nuclear proliferation, \nwith respect to the dismantlement of the Soviet nuclear weapons to \nthreaten that ongoing process?\n  I think it is one of those policies, I do not know how conceived, but \nwe really ought to rethink that and rethink it immediately.\n  A number of things occurred to me as we were at that conference in \nMadrid. \n\n[[Page S 14851]]\nAs I say, first was the overwhelming universal feeling of all parts, \nall of the philosophical spectrum in Russia opposing this, not only \nopposing it but emotionally opposing it, feeling threatened by it.\n  Second, Mr. President, I was struck by what you might call the \npolitical immaturity, the fact that the political personality of Russia \nhas not yet matured. Their national psyche is still in the formative \nprocess. Their emotional involvement in this new democratic \nexperiment--it was just overwhelming to see the emotion of these \nMembers of the Duma. At this critical time, at this time in a formative \nprocess for Russia, for us to come along, rather than portray ourselves \nas their friend, their ally, their helper, someone who is interested in \nseeing the country move forward, to come along, in effect, with a new \npolicy of containment to me, Mr. President, is absolute madness.\n  It seems to me that we ought to find some way to have cooperation \nwith these new Eastern European democracies to make them feel part of \nour political family without having them be part of our nuclear \numbrella, particularly when that umbrella is surrounding the former \nSoviet Union, containing the former Soviet Union, and threatening the \nformer Soviet Union.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/10/senate-section/article/S14843-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR SAM NUNN\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, just for one moment, I want to \ncongratulate, of course, the Senator from Texas for her leadership, but \nthe Senator from Georgia for his leadership on this issue, which is \njust another one of those issues in which, through the years, he has \nled this Senate, has led this country in its political thinking.\n  Most Senators of this body are content to properly represent their \npeople, to reflect their political views, to be popular in the polls, \nto vote right, to vote in the national good. Other Senators like to \nthink of themselves as being effective enough to be able to take the \nideas of others which they agree with, to take the speeches, to take \nthe bills, to take the thoughts of others and effectively represent \nthose thoughts and feelings and bills out here on the floor of the \nSenate so as to move the country in the right direction.\n  There are occasional Senators, Mr. President, by virtue of their \nwisdom, their training, their background, their effort, their industry, \ntheir dedication, their devotion, but mainly by virtue of their God-\ngiven gifts, who are able to lead, to conceive the ideas by which the \ncountry ought to move, to determine what those policies are and, in the \nprocess, to serve as the beacon, the guidepost by which the rest of us \nSenators may guide our thoughts and our policies and our votes.\n  The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn] is one of those rare individuals. \nAs Senator Byrd said here on the floor not too many months ago, Senator \nNunn will stand out in the history of this country through the 200 \nyears of this Senate as one of the outstanding leaders, not just for \nthe 1990's or the 1970's when he came, but throughout the history of \nthe country.\n  He really gives lie to that old aphorism that no one is essential \nbecause, Mr. President, when Senator Nunn leaves this body, there will \nbe left a tremendous hole. Of course, in his experience, and know-how \nand technique, but really in that kind of wisdom that guides the \ncountry, that forms policy, that gives Americans, and especially gives \nSenators, the confidence that the country is moving in the right \ndirection. As long as Senator Nunn was here, we always knew there was a \nvoice on foreign policy matters upon which we could rely, and defense \nmatters.\n  He will be greatly missed and, I suspect, if he is ever replaced, it \nwill be many, many decades before we ever develop a man of his ability \nand wisdom and judgment.\n  Mr. President, he will be greatly missed and, from a personal \nstandpoint, I can say that many of us will miss him and certainly his \nwife, Colleen, who is one of the most beloved Senate wives in this body \nand certainly one greatly beloved by me and my family.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana for his \nkind remarks, for his friendship and leadership. As he well knows, I \nhave the greatest esteem for him. We have been colleagues from day one. \nHe tried to claim seniority when he first came here and had to be \nawakened to the fact that he did not have it. I was the senior Member \nof the new class of 1972, now ancient.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If the Senator will yield, I have only said I was \nsecond to ``Nunn'' in seniority.\n  Mr. NUNN. The Senator is corrected on that. I appreciate his kind \nwords and leadership. I appreciate him coming to the floor. He has \nbasically been a keen observer of the national security scene and the \nNATO scene for a long, long time. All of us who have had dealings in \nthis area realize that this is a subject that needs some really careful \nconsideration. So I thank the Senator from Louisiana for his comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/10/senate-section/article/S14851-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       USE OF THE CAPITOL ROTUNDA FOR A RAOUL WALLENBERG CEREMONY\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

I yield to the Senator from Rhode Island whatever \ntime is necessary for the offering of his amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2886\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the State distribution of funds for secondary \n    school vocational education, postsecondary and adult vocational \n                    education, and adult education)\n\n  Mr. PELL. I thank the Senator from Kansas, and I send an amendment to \nthe desk on behalf of the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] and \nmyself and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Pell], for Mr. Jeffords, \n     for himself and Mr. Pell, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2886.\n\n  Mr. PELL. Madam President, I ask that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 77, strike lines 7 through 18, and insert the \n     following:\n       (4) State determinations.--From the amount available to a \n     State educational agency under paragraph (2)(B) for a program \n     year, such agency shall distribute such funds for workforce \n     education activities in such State as follows:\n       (A) 75 percent of such amount shall be distributed for \n     secondary school vocational education in accordance with \n     section 112, or for postsecondary and adult vocational \n     education in accordance with section 113, or for both; and\n       (B) 25 percent of such amount shall be distributed for \n     adult education in accordance with section 114.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island should be aware \nthere are 45 minutes allocated, equally divided, for this amendment.\n  Mr. PELL. Right. That will be done by the managers of the bill.\n  I want to express my strong support for the amendment offered by \nSenator Jeffords.\n  The bill provides that 25 percent of the funds go to the work force \neducation. This amendment would stipulate that 25 percent of those \neducation funds would go to adult education and 75 percent to \nvocational education.\n  To my mind, it is very important the adult education be assured of \nfunding. In State after State this is a program that is run by \nvolunteers and groups that do not have substantial political clout. \nConsequently, I fear that adult education will be at a considerable \ndisadvantage in the give and take that will lead to dividing the pie \nwith vocational education.\n  Today, adult education serves only half of all those who seek its \nservices. This says nothing about outreach to those who need such \nservices, but do not seek them. If the one-stop career centers operate \nas they are envisioned, it is reasonable to expect that we will \nidentify many more adults who need adult education services. That, in \nturn, could well overwhelm an adult education system that is already \noverburdened.\n  Approval of the Jeffords amendment would mean simply that adult \neducation would be ensured a flow of funds that would enable it to \ncontinue the very excellent and much-needed services it now provides. I \nwould urge my colleagues to support its passage and that I strongly \nsupport it myself.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this \namendment. I think this is a critical time in our history when we \nexamine as we go forward how we are going to take care of the difficult \nproblems facing our society. We are dealing in this bill with people \nwho have difficulty obtaining employment, and at the same time in a \nrelated bill we are dealing with individuals who are on welfare.\n  Let me take a look at the overall needs of the Nation in order to \nemphasize how important it is that we allocate our scarce resources \nappropriately.\n  There are approximately 90 million people in this Nation who are \nfunctionally illiterate. There are also large numbers, millions, who \nare unemployed. What would be the cost of helping all 90 million \nachieve literacy? If we dedicated merely $10 per person, it would cost \n$900 million; or $100 per person, the figure would be $9 billion. \nHowever, to be truly effective, a more realistic figure would be $1,000 \nper person or $90 billion to help those 90 million people achieve \nliteracy.\n  As far as unemployment is concerned, the figures are less specific, \nbut we do know that for every space we have for employment training \nnow, there are 10 people who are unemployed or underemployed who desire \nthat slot. That leaves nine people who desire this training unserved \nfor every one who receives training.\n  The amendment we have before us today will help ensure that we \nadequately provide literacy services for those who must, at least, \novercome this obstacle before entering the work force; this is the \nessence of adult basic education. The amount of money that we are \ndealing with in this particular bill is approximately $5 billion.\n  When you remember those figures I gave you on what it would cost to \nhelp those 90 million people achieve literacy or the fact that it would \nprobably cost 10 times as much to provide adequate job training for \nthose who require it, you realize how desperate the need is for these \nfunds to be adequately appropriated.\n  With respect to our amendment, my own experience causes me to be \nconcerned that the pressures that are placed on these bills and the \nkinds of incentives that are placed in these bills will tend to focus \nresources on employment training at the expense of adult basic \neducation.\n  I say that from my experience, because I have been in either the \nHouse or Senate for 21 years now, and I have been involved in all the \nemployment training legislation that has gone on during that period of \ntime. I have watched how these scarce resources were moved in one \ndirection or another.\n  Before I go through that, let us look at what this bill and the \nwelfare bill encourage States and individuals to do. One, we have the \nsocial welfare bill. The primary emphasis in this bill is to move \npeople off welfare; that is, the States are rewarded for moving people \noff welfare.\n  On the other hand, and keep this in mind because it kind of shows \nwhat can happen here if we are not careful, there is a provision that \ncould terminate benefits after 2 years. That is an incentive to the \nindividual that says, ``I must get educated, I must get a job or else I \nlose my benefits.''\n  My experience tells me that the incentive created to get people off \nwelfare, combined with the incentives we have now in employment \ntraining to try and move people off the unemployment rolls and on to \nthe employment rolls will inadvertently result in what is referred to \nas creaming. That is the emphasis will be to focus the funds on those \nfor whom it is easiest to get off welfare and to get employment. That \nmeans, however, those who need the funding and education the most, \nthose who are on welfare now and have been on welfare for many years, \nwill probably have no opportunity to get the education they need \nbecause States have responded to incentives to focus resources in other \ndirections.\n  Let me now turn to some charts, first of all, to emphasize what I \nhave been saying. I point to the first chart. I told all of you to \nremember the article from the business section of the Washington Post \nthat came to the attention of all of us, ``Battling Against Workplace \nIlliteracy.'' This article emphasized how critical and how important \nthe failure of our country to have provided an adequate education to \nour people has been to this Nation. I will just read the subtitle: \n``Companies Take Action as Awareness Increases of $225 Billion Drag on \nU.S. Productivity.'' At the same time, as we remind ourselves that we \nare here to figure out how it is that this Nation can reduce the \ndeficit, it seems very clear, when I look at the next chart, and other \ncharts thereafter, that it is education that is a key to balancing the \nbudget. If we do not improve the education of this Nation, not only \nwill our deficit not get better, but it will get worse.\n  Let us take a look at the total drag on the economy now caused by the \nfailure of our educational system. I tell you, when I see the \nstatistics--I do not know how we got into this. In our schools, 50 \npercent of the kids who graduate, the ``forgotten half'' as we \n\n[[Page S 14853]]\nare prone to refer to them now, graduate from high school functionally \nilliterate. That is a big part of how we got to where we are.\n  Let us take a look at this next chart, which indicates over half a \ntrillion dollars in gross domestic product is lost each year because we \nhave failed to educate our people properly. The $225 billion I \nmentioned earlier is in this piece of the pie, which is green, $225 \nbillion for the cost of illiteracy to the marketplace. That is the \ninability of people to handle a job they ought to be able to handle has \ncreated a drag on our business to such a degree that we lose about $225 \nbillion of productivity annually.\n  Now let us get to the relevance of the two bills I have referred to \ntoday. First of all, take a look at $208 billion for welfare \nexpenditures. That means that the individuals that are on welfare, as \nagainst not being on welfare and in the employment sector, costs us \n$208 billion. You see there is some double counting in here, obviously, \nbecause we are already up to $433 billion, and we still have another \nfactor to go.\n  The other factor is for training of employees. The businesses in this \nNation are required to spend $200 billion a year on either skill \ntraining or literacy programs. In fact, if you put literacy in there, \nit goes even higher. That is another burden on our businesses. If you \nadd those up, we are over $600 billion, with some double counting.\n  In addition to that, if you consider what it would save this Nation \nby having higher revenues because businesses and individuals would be \nearning more, we lose another $125 billion.\n  My point, and a critical point, is that education is the key to our \nproblems; education is the key to our future.\n  Now let me take a look at the next chart which I think will put \nthings in perspective also.\n  We all say, ``Hey, it's not our State. We are all doing fine. Our \nkids are getting educated. We don't have a problem.''\n  Take a look at this chart. Those in green are the best States, and \nthat means about 25 percent of their adults are functionally \nilliterate. Most of the States are even worse. Most of them are in the \norange and red. Thirty to fifty percent of the adults in these States \nare functionally illiterate. The final category contains a large \nportion of the population and a lot of States. These States are shown \nin blue and have populations in which 50 percent or more of the adults \nare functionally illiterate. What a staggering indication that our \ncountry is in trouble.\n  The final chart will show you the relevance of illiteracy to the \nwelfare problem. This one is very critical, and I think everyone should \nbe aware of what we are talking about. The percentage of welfare \nrecipients who have less than a high school diploma: Of those on \nwelfare more than 5 years, almost 70 percent have less than a high \nschool diploma. Of those on welfare 2 to 5 years, over 40 percent did \nnot get a high school diploma. And of those who have less than 2 years \non welfare, 30 percent.\n  What does that mean? It means that if we do not provide basic adult \neducation, then there is no hope that those who have been on welfare \nmore than 5 years are going to have an opportunity to get off welfare \nand to be able to be taxpaying citizens of this country.\n  I point out that what this means is that the way the incentives are \nbuilt into this bill--and that is to try and enable people to move from \nunemployment to employment and to reduce the welfare rolls--all the \nemphasis will be placed upon this group right here, those that are on \nwelfare less than 2 years. They are the ones more likely to be able to \nbe employed, more likely to get off the unemployment and welfare rolls. \nAnd yet, there is little incentive to help those who have been on \nwelfare more than 5 years. Without adult basic education these long-\nterm welfare recipients, more than 60 percent of whom do not have a \nhigh school diploma, will not have the opportunity to become \nemployable. In fact, I would guess that the incentives for States in \nthis bill are such that very few long-term welfare recipients will be \nable to get the kind of education needed to give them any hope of \ngetting off of welfare if we do not have adequate funding for adult \neducation.\n\n  All this amendment does is to make sure that a minimum of 25 percent \nof the work force education funds here will be used for adult basic \neducation--education for those on welfare who really need it.\n  I am sure, in my own mind, from my own experience, that if we do not \npass this amendment, you are going to see the percentage of funds spent \non adult education go down steadily. We will see more and more people \nsuffering and losing their benefits, and we will have to restructure \nour work force development programs. It has happened before. It \nhappened when we went from CETA to the Job Training Partnership Act. \nSince then, we have seen that we still did not effectively serve all of \nthe target population. Now, without this amendment, this bill may very \nwell have the exact same result.\n  So I urge you to support this amendment which would ensure the very \nminimum necessary to help long-term welfare recipients who need the \nmost help get off of welfare and not just help those who need the \nminimum assistance to get off of welfare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). There are 22 minutes 30 \nseconds, and the Senator from Rhode Island has 12 minutes 25 seconds.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. If I may comment for a moment, many of us put \neducation as a top priority of interest and concern. But there are no \ntwo people, I think, in the U.S. Senate who have spoken with greater \ndedication to the importance of education than Senator Pell, who has \nlent his name to one of the most important student aid programs that \nthere is, the Pell grant program, and Senator Jeffords. So it is with \nregret that I must oppose this amendment. I opposed it in committee \nwhere it was defeated on a tie vote, and I oppose it today for one \nmajor reason.\n  To me, it is an important one, because it goes to the heart of what \nwe have tried to do with the work force development legislation. It \nwould reduce the State flexibility, which is really at the heart of S. \n143. Many have said that S. 143 is still too bureaucratic. Mr. \nPresident, we ended 80-some programs. We have really revolutionized the \nway we handle job training, and we have tried very hard to keep a \nflexibility in place so that the States can determine how best to \ndesign a program that fits the need of that State.\n  Major goals of the legislation are to create a single work force \ndevelopment system, to allow States flexibility in deciding what is \nneeded. Throughout the development of this legislation, we have made \nevery effort to minimize the number of mandates and funding set-asides. \nSome guidance to the States is necessary to assure that the Federal \ndollars are appropriately and effectively spent. That is why the bill \nsets minimum amounts--25 percent--which must be spent both on work \nforce training and work force education activities respectively. Beyond \nthat point, however, I do not believe we should be dictating the mix of \neducation or training activities the State feels is most important. If \nwe start down this path, I suggest that we will soon arrive at the same \nplace we started, which was 90-odd separate, narrowly defined programs.\n  That is why, as I say, with all of the good intent of the authors of \nthis amendment, I must oppose this. I do not believe that adult basic \neducation services will be forgotten without this set-aside. The bill \nalready requires that funds be provided for these services within the \n25 percent that is reserved for education activities.\n  So I just suggest, Mr. President, that I think we have addressed that \nconcern without, again, going back to a set-aside that would be very \nrestrictive to the flexibility that is necessary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Rhode Island yield time, \nor is the Senator using time on the bill?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 5 minutes on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment. I think \nthe Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator from Vermont have made a \nvery strong case for adult education. We are perhaps the only advanced \nindustrial nation in the world in which \n\n[[Page S 14854]]\nilliteracy is increasing. The fact is that the States themselves have \nnot been responsive to this problem in developing adult education \nprograms. It was the hope of all of us, when we developed the initial \nadult education programs at the Federal level, that the value of these \nprograms would be clearly seen and the States themselves would develop \nsuch programs. But that has not been the case.\n  With the existing adult education program, it is oversubscribed by \ntwice the number of individuals than actually receive services. There \nare 100 percent more individuals who want to participate in the adult \neducation programs than are able to do so. So there is a great demand \nand desire for adult education.\n  Finally, Mr. President, what we have seen is that adult education \nprograms have enormous benefits for both the individuals participating \nin the programs and for the economy. These programs are also enormously \nimportant in terms of the education of the children of adults who \nparticipate. One of the most powerful reasons for increasing support \nfor adult education is because, for the most part, parents that are \ninvolved in these programs and have small children are able to \nparticipate more effectively in the development and the education of \ntheir children. So this has a dramatic impact in terms of bringing \nchildren along and enhancing their ability to achieve academic \nexcellence.\n  So, Mr. President, I know that the Senator from Kansas has included \nin her legislation a provision reserving 25 percent of the funds in the \nblock grant for education, and that her bill also requires that there \nbe funds spent on adult education, but there are no figures specified. \nLooking at what has happened so far in the States, there is very little \nreason to believe that the States are going to embrace adult education \nprograms in a robust kind of way. Adult education, it seems to me, has \na very special standing, an importance in terms of our citizenry. \nTherefore, I think it deserves the kind of targeting in the legislation \nwhich the amendment would provide.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Minnesota here. I ask how much \ntime we have. We want to try to follow the agreement, which is to work \nthrough on the agreed time on the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island has 6 minutes 21 \nseconds, the Senator from Kansas has 19 minutes.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I am happy to yield some time to the \nSenator from Minnesota. It is my understanding that Senator Moynihan is \nprepared to offer the next amendment. Senator Grams has an amendment he \nwill offer, and then we will stack those three votes. So we will \ncomplete the debate on this amendment, and that is with the agreement \nof Senator Jeffords and Senator Pell, just to give some indication for \nthose who might be wondering what the timing is. I would be happy to \nyield 5 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas. Five \nminutes would certainly suffice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to support the Pell-Jeffords \namendment. I am proud to be an original cosponsor.\n  Mr. President, the Minnesota Literacy Council issued a study earlier \nthis year, and I quote:\n\n       Minnesota adult basic education has had a profound and \n     multidimensional impact on individual learners and on the \n     quality of life in Minnesota.\n\n  I was a teacher for 20 years, and I have spoken on the floor before \nand I have made the argument, and I think the evidence is irrefutable \nand irreducible--not because I make the argument, but nevertheless I \nthink the evidence is very strong--that there is a very strong \ncorrelation between the education of a mother or a father, or both, and \ncertainly whether or not a mother or father are literate, and what they \ncan do by way of encouraging their children to learn in school. So, \nthis is really, if you will, an important family issue.\n  Also, there is a tremendous multiplier effect that comes with adult \nbasic education, which is why I thank my colleagues for their effort. \nTo the extent a man or woman is literate, he or she not only can do \nbetter with their children, not only can do better at work, but also \ncan more fully participate in the economic and the social and the \npolitical life of our Nation. In other words, this is critical to a \nfunctioning democracy.\n  Adult basic education programs work. I have seen that in Minnesota, \nover and over and over again, traveling around the State and working \nwith people who are in adult education. In 1993, more than 36,000 \npeople received adult basic education services free of charge at over \n600 sites statewide. Of these, 63 percent obtained a high school \ndiploma, GED, gained citizenship, secured employment or job \nadvancement, or got off public assistance. So it is enormously \nimportant in my State.\n  Nationally, there was a recent article, and I think I heard the \nSenator from Vermont refer to this, in the Washington Post, which \nreported that about 90 percent of the Fortune 1,000 executives say \nilliteracy is hurting productivity and profitability, and it costs the \nUnited States, roughly speaking, $225 billion a year in lost \nproductivity. So it seems to me this is really very much, if you will, \na national security issue. It is a national commitment, and that is why \nI support this important focus on adult education.\n  As the Senator from Vermont pointed out, my State is ranked as one of \nthe best States in terms of literacy rates. According to the Minnesota \nLiteracy Council, about 20 percent, however, of Minnesotans, are \nfunctionally illiterate. According to the 1990 census, in Minnesota \napproximately 18 percent, or 445,000, aged 25 and over, do not have a \nhigh school diploma. If you add to that those between 18 and 25, the \nnumber of people without a high school diploma or GED would go up to \nabout 560,000. So, again, it seems to me, this amendment is extremely \nimportant. It puts the focus on the education that is vitally important \nto adults, vitally important to their children, vitally important to \nfamilies, vitally important to democracy, vitally important to job \nproductivity, and I would argue in a State that has been the leader in \nthe Nation, as my State so often is--if I can say that on the floor of \nthe Senate--vitally important to Minnesota.\n  I yield the floor and I thank my colleague from Kansas for her \ngraciousness.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise as a strong supporter and cosponsor \nof this amendment, which will guarantee that adult education--including \nadult literacy--programs receive adequate funding under the Workforce \nDevelopment Act. Unfortunately, over 50 percent of adults in the United \nStates are functionally illiterate, roughly 44 million Americans. \nIlliteracy costs the U.S. economy about $225 billion a year in lost \nproductivity. As we improve our worker training programs, we must \nprovide adequate funding to combat adult illiteracy.\n  In my home State, many dedicated Vermonters are working hard to help \nadults overcome illiteracy and enjoy a more productive and enjoyable \nlife. For instance, my sister, Mary Leahy, has devoted herself to \nhelping adults with reading and writing problems at Central Vermont \nAdult Basic Education in Barre, VT. Mary, along with many other \nVermonters, know the deep satisfaction of helping another adult unlock \nhis or her potential.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is one of the best \nways to help our work force and improve the quality of life of millions \nof adults.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I do not know if anyone else wishes to \nbe heard. Does the Senator from Vermont wish to speak at this time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to clarify where we are \nhere, so people understand a little bit better.\n  First of all, when we talk about education in this bill, we are not \njust talking about what I was referring to as adult basic education. \nThis is where all your money comes from for the so-called Perkins \nprograms, the vocational education, the other employment money. That 25 \npercent amounts to a little over $1 billion.\n  What we are saying is, when you take a look, again, at this chart, \nthe bulk of \n\n[[Page S 14855]]\npeople on welfare are in the category where they have been on it 2 to 5 \nyears. These are the ones who are supposed to lose their benefits if \nthey do not get adequate education. There is $340 million that would be \navailable for them, plus anyone else in that area, to get the basic \nadult education. That would be fine, but the demand is about $1.6 \nbillion. All we are saying is, for God's sake, at least make sure they \nget the $340 million that is indicated when they need $1.6 billion to \nbe able to comply with the purpose of the bill, and welfare, and that \nis get to work. How can you get work if you do not have an education, \nif you have no skill training? So we have $1.6 billion that should be \nout there to get the people off but only $340 million as provided in \nthis bill. All this amendment does is say: At least, at least make sure \nthey have the $340 million.\n  I urge everyone to vote for this amendment just to protect, as best \nthey can, really the small amount of money that is available relative \nto the great need in this area.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  I hope this amendment will be adopted. Effectively, what this \namendment is doing is saying that adult education should be a priority \nand a national priority. For all the reasons the Senators from Rhode \nIsland and Vermont have expressed here, plus the particular importance \nthat this does not just benefit the adult, but also the child, which \nhas been verified time in and time out by every single study, I hope \nthe amendment will be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Jeffords-\nPell amendment be set aside for the consideration of the Moynihan \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that any \nremaining time on that amendment would be yielded back.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield it back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2887 To Amendment No. 2885\n\n (Purpose: To strike the provisions repealing training and employment \n   services for trade adjustment assistance, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2887 to amendment No. 2885.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 217, beginning on line 14, strike all through line \n     17.\n       On page 217, line 18, strike ``(2)'' and insert ``(1)''.\n       On page 217, line 20, strike ``(3)'' and insert ``(2)''.\n       On page 217, line 22, strike ``(4)'' and insert ``(3)''.\n       On page 217, line 24, strike ``(5)'' and insert ``(4)''.\n       On page 218, line 1, strike ``(6)'' and insert ``(5)''.\n       On page 220, beginning on line 1, strike all through page \n     225, line 6.\n       On page 225, line 7, strike ``(2)'' and insert ``(1)''.\n       On page 227, line 8, strike ``(3)'' and insert ``(2)''.\n       On page 232, line 10, strike ``(4)'' and insert ``(3)''.\n       On page 232, line 15, strike ``(3)'' and insert ``(2)''.\n       On page 233, line 1, strike ``(3)'' and insert ``(2)''.\n       On page 233, line 6, strike ``(3)'' and insert ``(2)''.\n       On page 233, line 17, strike ``(3)'' and insert ``(2)''.\n       On page 234, line 6, strike ``(5)'' and insert ``(4)''.\n       On page 242, lines 11 and 12, strike ``(as amended in \n     paragraph (1)(G)(i) is further amended'' and insert ``is \n     amended''.\n       On page 245, line 15, strike ``(2)'' and insert ``(1)''.\n       On page 260, line 9, strike ``(6)'' and insert ``(5)''.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to make a simple proposal, which \nI deeply wish the Senate will accept and see the reasons for. This \namendment would simply preserve the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nProgram, which has been in place for a third of a century now, having \nbeen one of the great social inventions, one of those that come along \nfrom time to time to help a nation, in this case ours, resolve a \nlegitimate dispute in which there are legitimate interests on either \nside, in the very best tradition of a democratic society.\n  The conflict is elemental. When our Government enters a trade \nagreement with another nation or group of nations, as is increasingly \nthe case, it undertakes to lower tariffs on goods coming into our \ncountry in return for lowered tariffs in other countries--lowered \nrestrictions, access to markets, all the different arrangements that go \ninto a multilateral world trading system which has emerged so \nexceptionally in the world, and of which we are the preeminent member, \nthe largest trading nation in the world.\n  Getting to this point was not easy. It took courage, it took \ninvention, and it happened here in the U.S. Congress. We have to go \nback to 1930 and the Smoot-Hawley tariff of that year, in which tariffs \nwere raised to the highest levels in our history. The understanding was \nthat this would protect American jobs.\n  Indeed, in the course of the next 2 years from the time it was signed \nby President Hoover, imports dropped by one-third in our Nation. More. \nAlas, so did exports. And the world spun into the disaster of the \n1930's. The British left free trade and went to imperial preferences. \nIn Japan, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere was put in place. \nManchuria was invaded--China, in fact. But we somehow called it \nManchuria. Unemployment soared.\n  In 1933, Mr. President, in Germany, Adolf Hitler came to power in a \nfree election. Our Nation tumbled into a depression unlike anything we \nhad known. And we had been warned. Mr. President, 1,000 economists--at \na time when the Nation perhaps was more fortunate then than now and had \nonly about 1,000 economists--wrote to President Hoover and said, ``Do \nnot do this.'' He did it even so.\n  Then in 1934, Cordell Hull, who was Secretary of State, began the \nreciprocal trade agreements program in which we would try to make our \nway by mutual accommodation with other countries. It was a great \ninvention. A great man, Harry Hopkins, worked on it. It was to have \nbeen given an institution as part of the great postwar settlement--the \nWorld Bank, the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the \nInternational Trade Organization which was to have been located in \nHavana. But the ITO died in the Senate Finance Committee out of \nlingering fear of opening trade to the rest of the world. But I am \nhappy to say in the last Congress it came back alive as the World Trade \nOrganization now in place in Geneva as part of that enormous \nachievement, the Uruguay Round.\n  How did we get to the point where there was this consensus that we \nhad the Kennedy round, the Tokyo round, the Uruguay round, and then the \nfree trade agreement with Canada, the North American Free-Trade \nAgreement with Canada and Mexico, and more in prospect? Well, sir, one \nwas the manifest benefits that trade had brought this Nation and the \nworld.\n  But there was also a social invention. It began in 1954, when David \nMacDonald, then President of the United Steelworkers of America, \nproposed that as part of a next trade agreement, if workers were put \nout, if workers lost their jobs because of imports that the Federal \nGovernment had agreed to in a trade agreement, there would be some \ntrade adjustment assistance. There would be training for them. The \nproposition was that, as a matter of public policy, the U.S. Government \nhad entered into an agreement in which certain workers were displaced, \ncertain workers lost their jobs, and other workers would gain jobs. The \ntotal would be much to the advantage of all. But there were individuals \nleft out, and \n\n[[Page S 14856]]\nit had been the result of a Government policy. Well, then it ought to \nbe the practice and policy of the Government to help with a \nreadjustment.\n  In 1962, as the Trade Expansion Act of that year was under \nconsideration, Luther Hodges, then President Kennedy's Secretary of \nCommerce, came before the Senate Finance Committee. He said this.\n\n       Both workers and firms may encounter special difficulties \n     when they feel the adverse effects of import competition. \n     This is import competition caused directly by the Federal \n     Government when it lowers tariffs as part of a trade \n     agreement undertaken for the long-term economic good of the \n     country as a whole. . . . The Federal Government has a \n     special responsibility in this case. When the Government has \n     contributed to economic injuries, it should also contribute \n     to the economic adjustment required to repair them.\n\n  Sir, at that time I had the honor to be an Assistant Secretary of \nLabor. I was Assistant Secretary of Labor for Policy Planning and \nResearch. We had done our work on this, sir. We knew what we were \nproposing. I thereupon became one of the three persons who negotiated \nthe Long-term Cotton Textile Agreement--still in place in its successor \nform--that helped firms, and saw to it that firms which were losing out \nto international competitors because of a trade agreement--textile \nmills in the Carolinas, garment industries in New York, Chicago, and \nCalifornia--were protected, in this case by quotas.\n  Also, there was trade adjustment assistance for workers. We put that \ninto that legislation, sir. And the American labor movement was solidly \nbehind the Trade Expansion Act and the Kennedy round.\n  There was social learning going on here; how to protect certain \nvulnerable firms, workers whose jobs had been negotiated away in the \nlarger general interest. And so we went from there to the Tokyo round. \nLabor supported the round because it had a commitment to trade \nadjustment. And then we had the free trade agreement with Canada and \nthe North American Free-Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. And \nlast year the Uruguay round. And before that, the commitment to trade \nadjustment assistance was crucial in obtaining the necessary support \nfor fast track--in which the President brings a trade agreement back \nand sends it up here to the Congress for an up-or-down vote--and for \nNAFTA itself. The Uruguay round came to the Finance Committee in the \n103d Congress when I had the honor to be chairman. And trade adjustment \nassistance was an essential commitment. Labor did not support the North \nAmerican Free-Trade Agreement. I did not in fact support it. But we did \nnot stop it, and we could have done so, and would have done so if there \nhad been no trade adjustment assistance.\n  Mr. President, in the years just since 1975, to give you a sense of \nthe dimension we are talking about here, 2 million workers have \nreceived trade adjustment assistance benefits as their right, as the \npublic interest demands. The assistance is part of the trade expansion \nactivity of the Federal Government. Tariffs and trade agreements, \nthose, sir, have always been located in the Committee on Finance. The \nCommittee on Finance has very carefully--not always successfully but I \nthink with an ever assiduous effort--tried to see that trade adjustment \nassistance is maintained. You get trade adjustment assistance when it \ncan be shown that tariff agreements have closed down an industry at the \ncost of the workers and management--2 million workers since 1975.\n\n  It would be such a great loss--turning our backs on generations of \nexperience and learning the hard way--to give this up now. I do not \nthink we want to do this to American workers. We made a commitment. \nPacta sunt servanda, agreements must be kept. These are agreements at \nthe highest level of Government. And they have been so enormously \neffective.\n  But, sir, I say to the Senate, I say to anyone listening outside the \nSenate, strip trade adjustment assistance from the trade laws and you \nwill never see a trade agreement again in this time. For the men and \nwomen, the working people who will have seen a pledge to them broken, a \ncommitment negotiated by their own leaders broken, the trust will not \nbe there again. It is sufficiently eroded as is.\n  We know very well how difficult the last 10 years have been in this \narea, and we see troubles coming ahead of us. We do not need them. We \nworked out an arrangement which got by as--which I think is a fair \nstatement--a social invention of very considerable measure.\n  And so, Mr. President, it fell to the distinguished chairman of our \ncommittee, Senator Roth, and I to write to our very good friends, in \nwhom we have the deepest respect, the chairman of the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources and the ranking member, who are here today. \nOn October 5, Senator Roth and I wrote to say that the Committee on \nFinance has not had an opportunity to consider this matter, the folding \nin and thereby elimination of trade adjustment assistance, and the \nNAFTA transitional adjustment assistance program. These are programs \nunder the jurisdiction of the Committee on Finance, and we respectfully \nasked they be removed from the Workforce Development Act, a remarkable \nbipartisan achievement, with the changes we would like to make, as, for \nexample, those suggested by Mr. Pell and Mr. Jeffords.\n  Now I offer this amendment, and I would hope it might be accepted. It \nwill ensure great harmony in this measure if it is accepted and \ndisharmony if it is not. It will break with 33 years of legislation, \nbreak with three generations of learning and working together in the \narea of trade which has proved of such enormous benefit to the United \nStates, and it would put in jeopardy, put a cloud over our prospects of \ncontinuing in that tradition.\n  Mr. President, I do not speak longer than necessary if there are \nother Senators who wish to speak.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I see my friend from Minnesota present.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Five minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts for his graciousness.\n  Mr. President, while I agree with the underlying premise of this job \ntraining bill to consolidate and streamline--and I simply say to the \nSenator from Kansas and the Senator from Massachusetts, I deeply \nappreciate this bipartisan effort--I believe that repealing key \nelements of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program in the process, as \nthis bill does, is a serious mistake.\n  Mr. President, from January 1, 1993, to August 31 of this year, more \nthan 2,300 Minnesota workers have received TAA. That assistance has \ntaken the form of about $4.5 million in training funds--job search and \neducational assistance--and about $6.8 million in income support.\n  Let me just be very direct about it. I did not support NAFTA even \nwith the TAA as a part of it. I opposed NAFTA and GATT, and the view I \ntook then and the view I take now is it is far better to raise wages \nand living standards and environmental protection through international \nagreements than depress those standards.\n  I argued that GATT and NAFTA failed to meet these tests, and many of \nmy predictions about NAFTA's adverse impact on American workers have \ncome to pass. American jobs have been shipped to Mexico and workers \nhave been left to fend for themselves.\n  This bill in present form without this amendment--and, Mr. President, \nI ask unanimous consent to be an original cosponsor of this amendment--\n--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Would exacerbate the problem. It is sometimes \nnecessary to remind ourselves of promises made. Proponents of NAFTA, \nfor example, promised it would boost exports to Mexico and create \nhundreds of thousands of new American jobs almost immediately.\n  Instead, 21 months after implementation of NAFTA, our trade balance \nwith Mexico has dramatically worsened. Our trade deficit with Mexico \nfor the first 6 months of this year was $8.5 billion. Furthermore, \naccording to the Department of Labor, 42,000 Americans are certified to \nhave lost their jobs as a result of NAFTA. And as an article in \nyesterday's New York Times observed, \n\n[[Page S 14857]]\nthis number is undoubtedly lower than the actual numbers of jobs lost \nto NAFTA--that is, for a variety of reasons, not all workers eligible \ndid apply.\n  What about the American companies that assured us during the NAFTA \ndebate that many new American jobs would be created by the agreement? \nPublic Citizen conducted a useful survey of a number of these firms. \nPublic Citizen's report found that of 66 firms which had made explicit \njob-creating promises or projections and which replied to Public \nCitizen's inquiries, 89 percent reported making no significant progress \ntoward meeting these projections.\n  Twenty months after NAFTA, Public Citizen also was able to contact \nfive companies from my State of Minnesota. Officials from each one of \nthese companies had made explicit projections or promises of economic \nbenefits to Minnesotans from NAFTA. Unfortunately, after 20 months of \nNAFTA, none could report creating new jobs in Minnesota or even \nincreased exports from Minnesota as a result of the agreement.\n  It seems to me a promise is a promise, and we must live up to our \ncommitment. I think NAFTA was a profound mistake. I think GATT was a \nprofound mistake. But the TAA as a part of NAFTA was supposed to help \nthose workers gain new skills and obtain new jobs in the local \neconomies because these workers are the ones who are rocked by some of \nthese agreements and some of what has happened in the global economy.\n  The increasing globalization of our economy makes a lot of U.S. \nworkers feel that the forces that directly affect our standard of \nliving and the quality of our lives are moving further and further from \nour control and from accountability to us. It seems that local, State \nand national governments are increasingly powerless to solve our most \npressing problems. And I am afraid that this trend only makes citizens \nmore alienated from and distrustful of their governments.\n   Without this amendment, this bill would heighten this sense of \nalienation from their government that American workers feel. Repealing \nTAA would betray the commitments we made here in Congress to provide \neven modest job retraining and other benefits to sustain dislocated \nworkers through a difficult transition period to another job. Even the \nHouse version of the job training bill which recently passed did not \nrepeal TAA.\n\n\n             The Importance of Trade Adjustment Assistance\n\n  Let me describe why I think this job retraining funding commitment is \nso important, and how it works in practical terms.\n  Under the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program [TAA] and the special \nNAFTA/TAA program enacted when NAFTA was passed 2 years ago, workers \nwho meet certain eligibility requirements and are certified as having \nlost their jobs because of competition from imported goods are eligible \nfor special assistance. This assistance includes:\n  First, income support consisting of up to 52 weeks of extended \nunemployment benefits beyond the 26 weeks a worker would normally be \nentitled to under most State unemployment laws; and second, employment \nand retraining services;\n   The income support portion of these programs is an entitlement. A \nworker who meets the eligibility requirements is entitled to the \nextended unemployment benefits, provided that the worker is enrolled in \ntraining.\n  Employment and training services are provided through a capped \nentitlement--that is, funds are appropriated for these services, and \neligible workers are entitled to receive them as long as funds are \navailable.\n  This bill repeals the sections of TAA and the NAFTA/TAA program that \ngive eligible workers a capped entitlement to employment and training \nservices. Eliminating the entitlement to these services means that \nthese workers will have to compete with all other job seekers for \nwhatever employment and training services may be available in their \nState.\n  At the same time, the bill substantially cuts Federal job training \nprograms overall, thereby prompting an intense competition for \ndiminishing funding among the various groups of workers who need to be \nretrained--whatever the reason for their displacement.\n  Repealing these provisions fundamentally breaks faith with a \ncommitment first made by President Kennedy in the Trade Expansion Act \n1962--and renewed again when Congress passed the NAFTA/TAA program--\nthat workers adversely affected by our trade policies would receive \nspecial assistance from the Government to find new employment.\n  Mr. President, since the TAA program was established, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike have recognized our special responsibility to workers \nwho lose the jobs as a direct result of Government trade policies. The \nSenate reaffirmed its commitment to honor that responsibility when it \nenacted the NAFTA/TAA program for workers displaced because of \nincreased imports or shifts in production to Mexico and Canada. We must \nnot renege on that commitment now.\n  Even under the current JTPA Dislocated Worker Program, there is not \nenough money to serve more than about 25 percent of eligible workers. \nUnder the Kassebaum bill, there is no requirement that a State spend \nany particular portion of the Federal funds it receives to serve \ndislocated workers.\n  Moreover, while States are required to offer job search and job \nplacement services through their one-stop centers, there is no \nrequirement in the bill that States actually provide job training to \nanyone. If trade-impacted workers are no longer entitled to employment \nand training services, there is a good chance that in some States many \nwill not get them. They will be out of luck.\n  This amendment preserves the employment and training portions of the \nTAA and NAFTA/TAA programs as a capped entitlement. This is part of a \nsocial contract that we made with working men and women when we asked \nthem to support our efforts to open world markets and eliminate trade \nbarriers. I believe we have an obligation to honor that contract.\n  At the Labor and Human Resources Committee markup on this bill, \nSenator Kennedy offered an amendment similar to this one which \npreserved the right of trade-impacted workers to obtain retraining \nservices, but required that all such services be provided through the \nsame systems established by the State to serve other dislocated \nworkers. Unfortunately, this amendment was defeated on a tie 8-to-8 \nvote. I hope that we will get a different result on this vote. American \nworkers deserve better.\n  So I thank the Senator from New York for his amendment. I thank the \nSenator from Delaware. I thank him for their leadership. I am proud to \nbe an original cosponsor, if that is appropriate, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, in general, I believe that our \ncountry must improve our Federal job training programs to reduce \nfragmentation and increase efficiency. I also firmly believe that we \nshould maintain our longstanding commitments to workers who are \ndislocated by Federal trade policy.\n  Two programs under the Finance Committee provide assurances that \nworkers who are dislocated because of Federal trade policies will get \nretraining and support--the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act [TAA] and \nNAFTA-TAA.\n  In my view, these programs are fundamental commitments made to \nworkers during trade negotiations. Many West Virginia workers have \nrelied on TAA benefits in the past. In fact, since 1990, 1,673 West \nVirginians qualified for TAA benefits and got retraining and income \nsupport needed to rebuild their lives and find new jobs or careers \nafter being dislocated. For these families, TAA offered hope and a \nsecond chance.\n  TAA means a great deal to workers in small towns that are hit with \nmajor plant closings. For example, when Hanover Shoes in Marlinton, WV, \nclosed because of shoe imports, 231 West Virginia workers needed and \ngot assistance thanks to TAA. Similar dislocations have occurred in \nFranklin, Bartow, Parsons, Martinsburg, and other communities because \nof the decline in shoe manufacturing and textiles in this country. Many \nof these workers have spent 10 years or more working in one factory, so \nit takes time and support to learn new skills. Similar disruptions \noccur in the oil, natural gas, and coal industry. West \n\n[[Page S 14858]]\nVirginia workers want to get new jobs and new careers, but retraining \nis often essential to help make a shift from an industry like textiles \ninto another field.\n  Because of my concerns for dislocated workers in West Virginia and my \nlongstanding support for TAA, I am strongly supporting Senator \nMoynihan's amendment to strike the language repealing the TAA and \nNAFTA-TAA programs. We should not renege on this basic commitment to \nworkers, especially at a time when we are just beginning to see plant \nclosings and dislocations from NAFTA.\n  Personally, I believe that we do have a special obligation to workers \nwho are dislocated by general trade policy or trade treaties like the \nNorth American Free-Trade Agreement--Federal decisions that we make \nknowing they may jeopardize jobs in particular industries or regions.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that more West Virginians will need \nretraining and benefits to cope with the dislocations created by trade \npolicy, by NAFTA, and also because of the implementation of the Clean \nAir Act.\n  I believe passing the Moynihan amendment to strike language repealing \nTAA and NAFTA-TAA is essential, and I want to ensure that the new \nstreamlined approach suggested by the Workforce Development Act will \nprovide the help and training that West Virginia workers need, and \ndeserve.\n  I strongly hope that the Moynihan amendment and other amendments will \nbe adopted today to improve this legislation, and I expect that I will \nbe supporting many of them.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment by \nthe distinguished Senator from New York. This amendment preserves trade \nadjustment assistance--job training and job placement help for workers \nwho have lost their jobs as a direct consequence of U.S. trade \npolicies.\n  We here in Congress pass the laws that put out Nation's trade \npolicies into effect--the policies that are negotiated by Presidents \nwith our trading partners. We have the responsibility to assure that \nthose trade policies benefit all Americans.\n  Now, Mr. President, at times I have supported expanded trade as one \nof the ways to promote our Nation's economic interests. I am convinced \nthat we must open the markets for American products and services around \nthe world. Those new markets are our best hope for a growing economy \nwith growing incomes and expanded job opportunities.\n  I believe that without expanding world markets we will end up \nfighting over a stagnant or shrinking economy. But at the same time, \nthere is no automatic guarantee that growth will benefit all \nAmericans--in fact, economists will tell us that there will be losses \nas well as gains as jobs shift from low-growth to high-growth \nindustries.\n  That is why we must have the ability to help those who will pay part \nof the price for progress--those whose job loss can be traced to \nchanges in our trade policies. That is why we must preserve the trade \nadjustment assistance training programs.\n  These are men and women who have played by the rules--who have worked \nby the rules, Mr. President--and who, through no fault of their own, \nfind their work is no longer needed. They have raised their families, \nbuilt our neighborhoods and cities--they have done all a country can \nask of them, and more.\n  But today, these men and women can find that their job security is \ndependent on trade policy made here in Washington. Our decisions to \nparticipate in trade agreements can expose their industries to \nincreased international competition. How can we turn our backs on their \nplight?\n  Trade adjustment assistance not only helps these people deal with the \ntransitions that are increasingly part of our rapidly changing \ninternational economy. This assistance makes good economic sense \nbecause it lowers the costs of economic adjustments--costs in wasted \nhours of unemployment and underemployment, in depressed communities, \ntowns, and regions. By helping to move workers displaced by trade into \nnew jobs faster, into jobs that best fit their skills and work \nexperience, we reduce the costs of economic adjustment and increase the \nbenefits for everyone.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting this amendment. It \nis the fair thing for us to do, it is the responsible thing for us to \ndo, and it makes good economic sense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains on the Moynihan amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 4 minutes, \nand the Senator from Kansas has the other 22 minutes 32 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself my time remaining on the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I welcome the opportunity to be a cosponsor with the \nSenator from New York, Senator Moynihan, on this amendment. He has made \nthe case for this amendment very powerfully. Effectively, what we are \nsaying is that for the past 30 years it has been a matter of national \npolicy for Republicans and Democrats alike that, if we were going to \nenter into various trade agreements as a direct result of which \nindividual workers were going to lose their jobs, those workers would \nbe entitled to retraining and income support in the form of extended \nunemployment benefits so that they can continue to support their \nfamilies while they are being retrained. The income support amounts to \nup to a year, rather than 6 months, of extended unemployment benefits. \nThat is what is basically the outline of the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Program.\n  And the concept behind that, Mr. President, was that as a result of \nexpanded trade, the economy as a whole was going to benefit, Americans \nwere going to benefit in all parts of the country. But some workers in \nsome industries were also going to lose their jobs, and we recognize a \nspecial responsibility to those workers--in many instances workers who \nhad worked a lifetime at a particular job--and ensure that those \nworkers would be able to get training and financial support during that \nperiod of the training for up to 1 year.\n  Now, what have the results been, Mr. President? The fact is, that \nindividuals have lost their jobs as a result of increased imports and \nplant relocations stemming from trade agreements like GATT and NAFTA. \nThese are men and women who want to work, who can work, and the only \nreason they are not working is because a decision has been made that is \nin the national interest, passed by the Congress and the Senate, which \nresults in their dislocation. These individuals' lives are disrupted. \nBut under the TAA and NAFTA-TAA programs, they are able to get into \ntraining programs and are able to get some supplemental assistance. And \nthen they are able to try and generally are able to get back into \nemployment. \n\n[[Page S 14859]]\n\n  Now, what does the pending legislation say? It says that in spite of \nthe assurances that were given by Members of Congress, Republicans and \nDemocrats alike at the time we approved NAFTA and the GATT, that these \nprograms would be available for them, that we had a broad bipartisan \nagreement to support--in spite of those assurances, this bill now says \nthat if an individual is dislocated, there is no guarantee that there \nwill be a training program there. And if there is no training program \nthere, then there are no extended unemployment benefits. These \nindividuals will no longer get any priority for assistance.\n  Now, Mr. President, I think this is basically going back on the \nsolemn commitments that were made during the debate on NAFTA and on \nGATT. The Senator from New York mentioned a number of those.\n  Let's look at what was said about TAA by Members of Congress and the \nadministration when we were debating whether to enter into the NAFTA.\n  On May 1, 1991, in a letter to congressional leaders requesting an \nextension of fast-track authority to negotiate the NAFTA, President \nBush wrote as follows:\n\n       [W]hile economic studies show that a free trade agreement \n     would create jobs and promote growth in the United States, I \n     know there is concern about adjustment in some sectors. these \n     concerns will be addressed through provisions in the NAFTA \n     designed to ease the transition for import-sensitive \n     industries. In addition, my Administration is committed to \n     working with the Congress to ensure that there is adequate \n     assistance and effective retraining for dislocated workers.\n\n  At a question-and-answer session with business editors and writers on \nthat same day, May 1, 1991, President Bush said again:\n\n       I know that there's a concern--not just on Capitol Hill but \n     in many of the labor halls around this country--about job \n     loss. And our negotiators will address these concerns in \n     provisions of the North American Free-Trade Agreement. We \n     will work with Congress to see that dislocated workers \n     receive proper assistance and retraining. We believe we have \n     the answers to the questions that are being raised by the \n     labor unions and by some on Capitol Hill.\n\n  On May 7, 1991, at a Finance Committee hearing on United States-\nMexico trade, Secretary of Labor Lynn Martin repeated that commitment. \nShe testified that:\n\n       The President and I are both committed to working with the \n     Congress to be sure there will be adequate assistance for \n     effective retraining of any dislocated American workers. . . \n     . The President is determined to assure the timely \n     availability of comprehensive services to United States \n     workers who might conceivably be displaced over a period of \n     time as a result of such a trade agreement.\n\n  Carla Hills, then the U.S. Trade Representative, acknowledged at that \nsame hearing that:\n\n       Studies also show, and experience would indicate, that some \n     sectors might face increased competitive pressure. In a broad \n     sense, society benefits when we focus our jobs and our \n     capital in sectors where we are most productive. But we \n     should not and will not forget that the transition to a new \n     job can be difficult for individual workers and communities. \n     Not every worker will keep his or her job once a NAFTA is \n     negotiated. . . . [W]e cannot ignore the impact that the loss \n     of a job has on the individual affected. . . . [W]e have a \n     responsibility to be ready to assist any dislocated workers \n     affected by the NAFTA who face adjustment difficulties. \n     Effective retraining and adjustment programs can facilitate \n     adaptation to ongoing shifts in our economy.\n       [T]he Administration is firmly committed to working with \n     the Congress to ensure an effective, adequately funded worker \n     adjustment program. . . . Any needed changes in U.S. law \n     should be in place by the time the NAFTA enters into force \n     and could appropriately be addressed in legislation \n     implementing the NAFTA.\n\n  The importance of that commitment in persuading Members on both sides \nof the aisle to support the NAFTA agreement cannot be overstated.\n  During the Finance Committee hearings, Senator Bentsen, then the \nchairman of the committee, stressed the origins of trade adjustment \nassistance, noting that:\n\n       It was President Kennedy who first proposed trade \n     adjustment assistance when he launched a new round of global \n     talks back in 1962. President Kennedy favored free trade \n     because he knew it would benefit the United States as a \n     whole; that, as competitive as we are, we would come out a \n     net winner.\n       But he also understood that a country had to do something \n     for those who suffer in the move to open competition, and he \n     saw trade adjustment assistance as an essential part of that \n     trade policy. Adjustment assistance is just as much an \n     essential part of our trade policy today as it was 30 years \n     ago.\n       That is why, when I was working to extend the fast track, I \n     stressed to [President Bush] that we needed a firm commitment \n     from the administration to work with the committee and the \n     Congress on an effective program to work with the committee \n     and the Congress on an effective program to meet the \n     challenge of a Mexican agreement.\n       We got a promise and an action plan from the President in \n     May of 1991. That commitment was important to winning \n     congressional approval of the fast track.\n\n  Senator Packwood, then the ranking Republican on the Finance \nCommittee, agreed with Senator Bentsen that a commitment to trade \nadjustment assistance for workers who lost their jobs was an integral \nreason why Congress agreed to the fast-track authorization. He stated:\n\n       I agree with the chairman that NAFTA will rise or fall on \n     whether or not there is a good retraining act. Without it, I \n     do not see any possibility that NAFTA will pass.\n\n  Senator Roth, who is now the chairman of the Finance Committee and \nwho has long been a champion of the TAA Program, also stressed how \nimportant worker adjustment assistance was to approval of the NAFTA. He \nstated:\n\n       While many of us have made a final decision on whether to \n     support NAFTA . . . there is one thing on which we can all \n     agree, and that is the need to help dislocated workers make \n     the difficult but necessary transition to new jobs. . . . An \n     effective worker adjustment program must go hand in hand with \n     NAFTA.\n\n  Senator Baucus, also a member of the Finance Committee, stated:\n\n       I think I speak for many Senators when I say that I will \n     not vote for the NAFTA until a fully-funded worker retraining \n     program is in place.\n\n  Mr. President, all we are saying is that we all support the \nconsolidation of training programs. And the Senator from Kansas has \ndone an extraordinary job in being able to do that. But we have a \nsolemn responsibility to those workers who have lost or will lose their \njobs because of NAFTA or GATT. I will not take the time to spell out a \nprofile of who these workers are. But they are men and women who are \nproud Americans, and who have suffered as a result of the action of \nCongress. I think we can do no less than meet our responsibilities to \nthem as has been outlined by the Presidents and the leaders of the \nCongress when we passed those particular treaties.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, if I may put a little different \nperspective on this issue, recognizing, as has been eloquently stated \nby the Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, and the ranking member \nof the Labor Committee, that there has been, through both Republican \nand Democratic administrations, a commitment regarding trade adjustment \nassistance.\n  But let me make clear how the TAA is handled in the work force \ndevelopment bill. While the training part of the trade adjustment \nassistance is consolidated into the bill, the entitlement to income \nsupport for dislocated workers under TAA is not repealed. This, of \ncourse, is something that remains under the Finance Committee. This \nmeans our commitment to workers who lose their jobs because of a trade \nagreement is maintained, it is not eliminated. That is why I believe S. \n143 is important in the context of helping all workers. Workers who may \nhave been affected by any trade agreement will still receive the \nassistance for job training but, I suggest, in a far more effective \nway.\n  It makes no sense to keep separate and distinct programs for workers \nwho are laid off for one reason or another. All workers who lose their \njobs should have access to job training. All workers who need \nassistance should be able to enter the system with the kind of quality \nassistance that is their due. Dislocated workers who need good training \nlinked to real jobs have been ill-served by existing programs, \nincluding TAA. We must reform these programs and establish a \ncomprehensive system that is based on accountability for putting people \ninto real jobs. I think the Senator from New York would be certainly \none who would agree with that goal as I know the Senator from \nMassachusetts does as well.\n  Secretary of Labor Reich has pointed out that under the current \nprogram when a plant closes, one group of workers may be eligible for \ntraining while others on a different assembly line are \n\n[[Page S 14860]]\nnot. This makes no sense. How do you know whether somebody has lost \nwork at Cessna Aircraft because of NAFTA or because of structural \nrelated cutbacks? We need to move to a single integrated job training \nsystem and not single out a particular group for special training \nprograms. That is, as I suggested before, how we end up with the maze \nof programs that we have here today.\n  I believe that Governors and local elected officials will be \nresponsive to the training needs of all their citizens and in \nparticular to those who are laid off and have lost their jobs.\n  Anyone who is mindful of the concerns in their State will be putting \nthose people first and foremost in wanting to offer the very best \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, I would like for a moment to comment on the General \nAccounting Office's report on the Trade Adjustment Assistance Job \nTraining Program. It stated that it believes the TAA Program is \nseriously flawed. The GAO has testified that its study, as well as \nthose of the Department of Labor Inspector General and a study \ncommissioned by the Department of Labor, concluded that the TAA Program \nfalls short in assisting dislocated workers to enter the work force.\n  I would like to list a few of the findings: TAA benefits are not \nequally available to all available workers as a result of the flawed \ncertification process; and the TAA Program is often slow in reaching \nworkers as a result of this complex certification process. I think \nthere is a recognition that some of this does need to be improved. The \nTAA recipients do not receive services tailored to their needs because \nonly a limited mix of services are provided. TAA lacks the ongoing \ncounseling and support necessary to ensure completion of training. The \nliberal use of waivers has resulted in as many as half of TAA \nrecipients not even participating in training. It rarely works with \nparticipants after they finish training to help them find jobs, and TAA \ndoes not have an effective accountability system in place.\n  The GAO has also pointed out that the existence of ``several other \ntargeted dislocated worker programs,'' in addition to the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Program, suggesting that the United States \noverall approach to dislocated worker assistance needs reform.\n  The GAO followup study of the NAFTA-TAA Program last year indicated \nthat many of the shortcomings of the existing TAA Program had not been \naddressed.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. I \nbelieve that the protection in the entitlement that exists still with \nthe Finance Committee for financial support is protected and continues. \nAt the same time the job training portion would be included in, I \nthink, a much superior system so that everybody can be helped and \nassisted in a comprehensive way.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  Just in response to the Senator from Kansas, the concerns described \nin the GAO study which have been outlined in terms of criticisms of the \nway the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program was administered under \nprevious administrations are in the process of being remedied under the \npresent administration.\n  What we have seen under Secretary Reich is a vigorous effort to try \nand deal with some of the points that have been raised in the General \nAccounting Office report. We stand ready to make sure that any other \nproblems which are brought to our attention are addressed.\n  Let me just say this, Mr. President. We are not saying that you have \nto have a separate training program for trade-impacted workers. We \nsupport the consolidation of training programs. We are not saying \nmaintain a separate training program for those who fall under this \nparticular category. We offered an amendment in committee to require \nthat States provide training and employment services to workers \neligible for TAA and NAFTA-TAA through the same programs established by \nthe State to serve other dislocated workers. What we wanted to \npreserve, we said, was the guarantee that trade-impacted workers who \nneeded retraining would actually receive training, which is something \nwe have under the TAA and NAFTA-TAA programs which we do not provide to \nother dislocated workers. But my amendment was rejected in committee.\n  We are saying, all we want to do is make sure that these workers' \nrights to retraining are going to be protected as they were guaranteed \nby previous administrations, Republicans and Democrats alike. And we \nsupport providing that training through consolidated training programs. \nAll we are saying is that these workers should be included in the same \nprograms, but their rights to participate should be preserved. They, in \neffect, get a right to retraining if they qualify, and if they are in \ntraining, they can receive extended unemployment benefits so that they \ncan continue to pay their bills and support their families while they \nare in training. Under the law, if they are not in training they are \nnot able to receive the income support benefits.\n  At the present time, these workers have certain rights that were \nguaranteed by Presidents and Congress when we approved GATT and NAFTA, \nand we are saying continue those rights under the consolidated training \nprograms. That is basically what we are asking for.\n  Mr. President, I yield back whatever time we have.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I do not know if the Senator from New \nYork wishes to make any further comment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would simply like to thank the \nchairperson for her courtesy and clarity. I do make the point, however, \nthat the future of trade agreements in this country would be diminished \nif this authority does not remain in the committee that is required to \napprove the trade agreements themselves.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I now call on the Senator from \nMinnesota. I ask unanimous consent, first, to set aside the Moynihan \namendment for a brief presentation of an amendment that has been agreed \nto by both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I yield to Senator Grams.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2888 to Amendment No. 2885\n\n        (Purpose: To enable States to develop integrated plans)\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment and send it to \nthe desk for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2888 to amendment No. 2885.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 30, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n       (5) State option for integrated plan.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of this subsection, with the express written \n     agreement of the Governor, the State educational agency, the \n     State postsecondary education agency, and representatives of \n     vocational education and community colleges, of a State, the \n     Governor may develop all parts of the State plan, using \n     procedures that are consistent with the procedures described \n     in subsection (d). Nothing in this section shall be construed \n     to require a Governor who develops an integrated State plan \n     under this paragraph to duplicate any information contained \n     in 1 part of the plan in another part of the plan.\n       Beginning on page 114, strike line 15 and all that follows \n     through page 115, line 13, and insert the following:\n       (1) Failure to demonstrate sufficient progress.--\n       (A) Finding.--If the Federal Partnership determines, after \n     notice and an opportunity for a hearing, that a State has \n     failed to demonstrate sufficient progress toward reaching the \n     State benchmarks established under section 121(c) for the 3 \n     years covered by a State plan described in section 104, the \n     Federal Partnership shall--\n\n[[Page S 14861]]\n\n       (i) make a finding regarding whether the failure is \n     attributable to the workforce employment activities, or \n     workforce education activities, of the State; and\n       (ii) provide advice to the Secretary of Labor and the \n     Secretary of Education.\n       (B) Reductions.--\n       (i) Failure attributable to both categories.--Except as \n     provided in subparagraph (C), if the Federal Partnership \n     finds that the failure referred to in subparagraph (A) is \n     attributable to both categories referred to in subparagraph \n     (A)(i), the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of \n     Education, acting jointly on the advice of the Federal \n     Partnership, may reduce the allotment of the State under \n     section 102 by not more than 10 percent per program year for \n     not more than 3 years.\n       (ii) Failure attributable to one category.--Unless the \n     Governor of the State has developed an integrated State plan \n     under section 104(b)(5), if the Federal Partnership finds \n     that the failure referred to in subparagraph (A) is \n     attributable to 1 category of activities referred to in \n     subparagraph (A)(i) but not to the remaining category, the \n     Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Education, acting \n     jointly on the advice of the Federal Partnership, may decide \n     to reduce only the portion of the allotment for the category \n     of activities to which the failure is attributable.\n       (C) Combination and reduction.--Notwithstanding sections \n     103 and 111, if the Federal Partnership finds that the \n     Governor of the State has developed an integrated State plan \n     under section 104(b)(5), and the failure referred to in \n     subparagraph (A) is attributable to 1 category of activities \n     referred to in subparagraph (A)(i) but not to the remaining \n     category, the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of \n     Education, acting jointly on the advice of the Federal \n     Partnership, in lieu of making a reduction under subparagraph \n     (B), shall--\n       (i) reduce the portion of the allotment for the category of \n     activities to which the failure is attributable by a \n     percentage determined by the Secretaries, but not to exceed 5 \n     percent of such portion, for a period determined by the \n     Secretaries;\n       (ii) require the State to combine, for such period--\n       (I) an additional percentage, equal to the percentage \n     determined under clause (i), of the funds made available \n     through such portion; and\n       (II) the funds made available to the State under this \n     subtitle for the remaining category; and\n       (iii) require the State to expend the combined funds in \n     accordance with the strategic plan of the State referred to \n     in section 104(b)(2) to carry out the remaining category of \n     activities.\n       (D) Construction.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this title, funds referred to in subparagraph (C)(ii)(I) that \n     are combined under subparagraph (C) shall be considered--\n       (i) to be made available under section 103(a)(1) if the \n     combined funds are required to be expended for workforce \n     employment activities; and\n       (ii) to be made available under section 103(a)(2) if the \n     combined funds are required to be expended for workforce \n     education activities.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, the Federal job training system, as we \nknow, is broken. The current patchwork of 163 programs is failing to \ngive us the results we need as a Nation to compete in a worldwide \neconomy. Furthermore, we can no longer afford the $25 billion it costs \nAmerican taxpayers each year.\n  To improve results, the legislation before us will send one block \ngrant to the States allowing each State to invest this money in the \nmost efficient and effective employment programs. But with those \ndollars comes responsibilities. States would be accountable for how \nthat money is spent. The State must be able to show how it meets or \nexceeds several specific performance standards. Such standards include \nincreasing the number of job placements, increasing the length of time \nparticipants stay employed and increasing participant earnings.\n  While these are noble goals, as it currently stands, S. 143 requires \nthe plan to be developed into three distinct parts: The strategic plan, \nthe work force education plan, and the work force employment plan.\n  It also requires the block grant to be set aside into three separate \npots of money: 25 percent for the Governor; 25 percent for the State \neducation agency; and 50 percent for a flex account which is jointly \nadministered by a broad-based group of State officials and private \nsector individuals.\n  After consulting with officials in my home State of Minnesota, it is \nclear that Minnesotans strongly support this bill, and they are anxious \nto assume the duty of training and placing of Minnesota workers.\n  However, Minnesota wants to go one step further and coordinate its \nefforts for education and training. Under the current bill, Minnesota \nand every other State would be required to create three separate plans \ncovering education and training. My amendment would provide States with \na choice.\n  I understand there are occasions when separate efforts may be \ndesired. However, the Federal Government should not stand in the way of \nStates wishing to coordinate those efforts. A State should be allowed \nto implement a work force State development strategy without divided \nState plans. If the Governor and State education agency can both agree \nto work through a collaborative State partnership, they should be \nallowed to. My amendment would give States that option.\n  By allowing States to form a collaborative effort in planning both \nsides of the block grant, States like Minnesota will be able to save \ntime and resources, as well as to maximize the benefits to its workers.\n  My amendment requires the consent of the Governor, the State \neducation agency, the State postsecondary agency, and representatives \nof vocational education and community colleges before the option to \nintegrate into one State plan can be implemented.\n  My amendment also ensures that work force education and work force \nemployment activities are integrated to the greatest extent possible \nwithin the constraints of State laws regarding educational authority.\n  It gives the State the option, again, only if the Governor and the \nState election officials agree, to integrate State planning for the \nblock grant by using the collaborative effort.\n  The State will be allowed to develop one strategic plan tailored to \nthe needs of the State to develop all areas that are required under the \nbill.\n  Most important, my amendment unifies State accountability for program \nperformance by placing the responsibility for setting State performance \nindicators by all parts of the block grant with the same collaborative \nprocess that develops the State goals and benchmarks.\n  Lastly, State accountability is strengthened under this amendment.\n  If a Federal partnership finds that a State which has exercised its \noption to integrate has failed to make progress toward work force \nemployment or educational goals, it may recommend a sanction of up to \n10 percent from the State's block grant.\n  However, for States that do not exercise the integrated option, the \nFederal partnership can sanction the part of the plan that does not \nmeet the benchmarks, up to 10 percent.\n  Under this scenario, only one-half of the sanction will return to the \nFederal partnership; the other half will remain in the State but will \nbe transferred to the administrator of the programs that are meeting \nthose goals.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, this amendment will ensure that States \nhave the option to put forth the most efficient strategy for \nimplementing its block grant.\n  My amendment protects State education agency authority by expressly \nrequiring agreement between all of the parties before exercising the \noption. It also maintains strict sanctions for States that do not meet \nthose benchmarks.\n  Furthermore, my amendment has the strong support of Minnesota Gov. \nArne Carlson, the National Governors' Association, and the Republican \nGovernors' Association Workforce Development Task Force.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nNational Governors' Association outlining that support be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              National Governors' Association,\n\n                                                 October 10, 1995.\n     Hon. Rod Grams,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Dirksen 261, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grams: It is our understanding that during \n     consideration of the Workforce Development Act, you plan to \n     offer an amendment that would provide states with additional \n     flexibility to submit a unified state workforce development \n     plan. NGA is strongly supportive of these efforts.\n       As I understand it, your amendment does two things. First \n     of all, it would provide states with the option, if the \n     Governor and the State Education Agency agree, of unifying \n     policymaking authority for all of the block grant funds by \n     using the state's collaborative process for the strategic \n     plan to develop all parts of the state plan. This state \n     option would address in part NGA's concerns \n\n[[Page S 14862]]\n     that the bill would prohibit states from developing a fully integrated \n     workforce development system because it fragments planning \n     and implementation authority for the block grant. Your \n     amendment would provide states with this important \n     flexibility while also protecting the legal authority of the \n     state education agency (SEA) by requiring the explicit \n     consent of the SEA before the state can exercise this option. \n     The NGA applauds your efforts to remove barriers that stand \n     in the way of states creating a single unified workforce \n     development system.\n       We thank you for your efforts to provide states with \n     greater flexibility and look forward to preserving this \n     provision during the conference process.\n           Sincerely,\n     Gov. Arne H. Carlson,\n       Chair, Human Resources Committee.\n     Gov. Tom Carper,\n       Vice Chair, Human Resources Committee.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, the task force includes Governor Thompson \nof Wisconsin, Governor Engler of Michigan, Governor Branstad of Iowa, \nGovernor Voinovich of Ohio, and Governor Whitman of New Jersey.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I would like to say that I am very \nappreciative of the Senator from Minnesota and the initiative he has \nundertaken on his amendment. I believe it strengthens our bill. I \nappreciate his willingness to work with us to craft a provision that \nstreamlines the planning process for some States while maintaining \nimportant jurisdictional protections.\n  I think this is a very worthy addition.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that votes now \noccur, first, on the Pell-Jeffords amendment, second, on the Moynihan \namendment and, third, on the Grams amendment. I further ask unanimous \nconsent that the second and third votes be limited to 10 minutes each \nand that 4 minutes of debate time be available between each vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome the Senator's amendment and \nurge its adoption as well.\n  I am prepared to yield back my time. Mr. President, as I understand, \nwe are prepared to move ahead with votes. The first vote would be the \nJeffords-Pell amendment followed by the Moynihan-Kennedy-Wellstone \namendment, followed by the Grams amendment. I urge an aye vote on all \nof them.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2886\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2886 offered by the Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Pell]. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyle] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Maine [Mr. Cohen] is absent due \nto a death in the family.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Nevada [Mr. Bryan] and the \nSenator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon] are necessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 46, nays 49, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 481 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--49\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Bryan\n     Cohen\n     Exon\n     Kyl\n  So the amendment (No. 2886) was rejected.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we might bring the membership up to speed \nabout where we are on the various amendments and what we would like to \ntry and do for the remainder of the afternoon.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I \nask unanimous consent that the next two stacked votes be postponed to \noccur not before 5:20 this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We have made some good progress, and as I understand it, \nwe have an Ashcroft amendment on drug testing; we have the Glenn \namendment on displaced homemakers; and a Pell amendment on the \nreallocation of the distribution of the formula; and a Phil Gramm \namendment with regard to the reduction of FTE's.\n  There may be one or two other items, but I think those are the \nprincipal measures which we want to address. We have made good \nprogress. We have two votes now which we will stack, hopefully have \nthat vote shortly after 5:20. One is a very important measure dealing \nwith the trade adjustment provisions. We are very hopeful after those \nwe will come to the Job Corps amendment on which there is a great deal \nof interest. But we would like to invite those Members certainly on our \nside, my side and others who do have amendments to be prepared to move \nahead because we are prepared to move ahead.\n  I see the Senator from Ohio in the Chamber at this time; also, the \nSenator from Louisiana who had an amendment which we have been able to \nwork out. It is a very important amendment. So we would welcome the \nopportunity to deal with either or both of those in the next immediate \nperiod. Then the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, has an \namendment which has been worked out. And then perhaps we could be close \nenough to the period of 5:30 where we could vote on the other two \namendments, if that is agreeable to the Members.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2889 to Amendment No. 2885\n\n(Purpose: To ensure that training for displaced homemakers is included \n    among work force employment activities and work force education \n         activities for which funds may be used under this act)\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment. I send an \namendment to the desk and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Glenn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2889 to amendment No. 2885.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 11, strike lines 4 through 10 and insert the \n     following:\n       (9) Displaced homemaker.--The term ``displaced homemaker'' \n     means an individual who--\n       (A) has been dependent--\n       (i) on assistance under part A of title IV of the Social \n     Security Act and whose youngest child is not younger than 16; \n     or\n       (ii) on the income of another family member, but is no \n     longer supported by such income; and\n       (B) is unemployed or underemployed, and is experiencing \n     difficulty in obtaining or upgrading employment. \n\n[[Page S 14863]]\n\n       On page 50, line 9, strike ``and''.\n       On page 50, line 12, strike the period and insert ``; \n     and''.\n       On page 50, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n       (P) preemployment training for displaced homemakers.\n       On page 54, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n       (6) providing programs for single parents, displaced \n     homemakers, and single pregnant women;\n       On page 54, line 11, strike ``(6)'' and insert ``(7)''.\n       On page 54, line 13, strike ``(7)'' and insert ``(8)''.\n       On page 108, line 15, strike ``and''.\n       On page 108. line 16, strike the period and insert ``; \n     and''.\n       On page 108, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n       (F) displaced homemakers.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  There are 45 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer this amendment \nbecause I am extremely concerned that the current provisions in this \nbill will neglect and ignore a very important segment of our \npopulation, and that is displaced homemakers. Nationwide there are 17 \nmillion displaced homemakers. We have close to 700,000 in Ohio.\n  How do you define displaced homemaker? It can be people who are \ndivorced; it can be widows. It does not have to be women. As a matter \nof fact, it can be widowers, those who have lost their wives and are \nresponsible for taking care of the children in the family.\n  In other words, they are at-risk people which this bill has said it \nwants to take care of, which is defined in the bill, but I think this \nparticular group has been pretty much left out. And I think that is a \nshame. I realize that the managers of the bill do not want amendments \nin the bill and are trying to hold those down, but I do not want to see \nus hold down amendments and see some 17 million displaced homemakers \nnot be dealt with properly in this legislation, and that is what we are \ntalking about here.\n  The current Perkins vocational programs for displaced homemakers and \nsingle parents has been extremely effective. Approximately 80 percent \nof women served in these programs are placed in employment and/or \npostsecondary education.\n  Mr. President, I repeat that. Approximately 80 percent of women \nserved in these programs are placed in employment and/or postsecondary \neducation. That is an amazing success story, 80 percent. If that is not \nconsidered a success story, I certainly do not know what is.\n  It is a good example in which something that we created many years \nago works and works well. Recent statistics show that 85 percent of \nformer program participants across the Nation rated the displaced \nhomemakers programs ``excellent'' or ``very good.'' And over 75 percent \nsaid that these programs were better than other Government-funded \nprograms they had participated in. In other words, it gets accolades \nall over.\n  Mr. President, not long ago a lot of us voted for a welfare reform \nbill that was heavy on promises but light on the mechanics of how you \nget people off the welfare rolls. Well, what we are talking about right \nnow is a vital component of moving people from welfare to work. And we \ncan pass all the laws in the world requiring people to get off of \nwelfare and get a job, but it is not going to do the least bit of good \nif we do not provide them with the job skills. That is where the rubber \nmeets the road. That is what is going to move single parents from \nwelfare to work.\n  Amber McDonald back in Ohio recently sent me a letter about her \nexperiences about such training. I would like to quote this.\n\n       I'd like to state that I am on public assistance at this \n     time in my life and have one child. I don't take pride in the \n     fact I receive welfare. I am grateful to the State of Ohio \n     for their help. It has allowed me to survive and keep my \n     child. It's a long hard road to getting off assistance. One I \n     believe I'm on now. I am attending Displaced Homemaker \n     classes and these classes have helped me make decisions--good \n     solid decisions. Not the pleases-the-system decisions I've \n     made in the past. The Displaced Homemaker classes educated me \n     about where I could go, what I would need to succeed and how \n     to go about it. We need this program and others like it. A \n     lot of us want off welfare. We are as tired of being on the \n     system as the system is of having us.\n\n  I think, Mr. President, that really summarizes this whole program. \nAnd this is why the success ratio of displaced homemaker programs is so \nhigh. It is because of people like Amber. They take their training very \nseriously. They are not deadbeats. They are taking this very seriously, \nand they have a lot riding on it. And they have been working very hard \nwith this program. Before 1984 when States were not required to fund \ndisplaced homemakers training activities, States, unfortunately, spent \nless than 1 percent of their funding on specialized services for \ndisplaced homemakers.\n  This is unfortunate because programs for single parents and displaced \nhomemakers have been effective in not only helping families move in the \nwelfare system, but also in preventing families from entering the \nwelfare system. And displaced homemakers remain an at-risk population, \nsomething this legislation purports to deal with. According to the 1990 \ncensus, more than half of the displaced homemakers live in or near \npoverty. I want to repeat that. According to the 1990 census, more than \nhalf of the displaced homemakers live in or near poverty. Some recent \nstatistics show that 47 percent of displaced homemakers lack a high \nschool diploma, and the median annual personal income for displaced \nhomemakers is $6,766. Try living on that with a child in this modern \nday and age.\n  And I know that my distinguished colleague from Kansas will argue \nthat this amendment, by separately defining and listing displaced \nhomemakers, is somehow giving preferential treatment to one category of \npeople and therefore goes against the philosophy of job training \nconsolidation.\n  Unfortunately, displaced homemakers seem to be singled out for \nexclusion under this bill. For some unknown reason, the displaced \nhomemakers are the only major program from Perkins not included in this \nbill. While ignoring displaced homemakers, the bill singles out \nveterans, out-of-school youth, youth in correctional facilities, adults \nin correctional facilities, older workers, at-risk youth, and \nindividuals with disabilities, just to name a few.\n  But this was the only major program from Perkins not included in this \nbill. In fact, language in the House bill, H.R. 1617, the careers bill, \nincludes a requirement for States to provide plans on addressing \ndisplaced homemakers. And that bill passed with an overwhelming \nbipartisan support of 345 to 79 in the House of Representatives.\n  My amendment will not--and I repeat will not--result in a set-aside. \nThis amendment will only make it permissible for States--does not \nrequire it--it makes it permissible for States to fund specialized \nvocational employment and educational activities. It just makes it \npermissible for States to fund specialized vocational employment and \neducational activities. States will still have the flexibility in \ndetermining the funding amount and the types of programs to institute. \nThere is nothing in this amendment that will require the States to fund \nemployment or educational activities for displaced homemakers. I just \nwant to make sure that States are encouraged and reminded to continue \nthese programs that are working so well.\n  Now, there may be some who will argue that displaced homemakers are \nincluded under the dislocated workers definition, but the reality is \nthat this will not--I repeat will not--result in programs or services \nfor these women. Displaced homemakers were included in the definition \nof a dislocated worker when Congress passed the Economic Dislocation \nand Worker Adjustment Act in 1988. And in 1994, a survey of 35 States \nfound that virtually no services were provided to displaced homemakers \nunder EDWAA.\n  Another argument that I have heard is theoretically everyone is \neligible for services under this act under the discretion of the \nStates. Well, given that we are already reducing the funding by 15 \npercent under this block grant, it is clear that funding will be \ninadequate to serve even the populations that are specifically \nreferenced. I have been hearing from many people in Ohio who have \nbenefited from these services. I read one such account a moment ago. \nAnd these women are now gainfully employed, and they are providing for \ntheir families. Recent data from just my home State of Ohio shows that \ndisplaced homemakers in Ohio who have gone through training programs \nare \n\n[[Page S 14864]]\n\nnow working an average of 32 hours per week.\n  For example, Rebecca Richards, from Fairfield, OH, wrote how she and \nher child's life changed since she participated in a displaced \nhomemaker program.\n  She said:\n\n       As a result of the programs available, I was able to become \n     a productive person in society.\n\n  And she concluded by saying:\n\n       With the program, I found a friend who counseled me, \n     listened to complaints and successes, gave me useful \n     information and training, and helped me meet with other \n     single parents to form a network of friends.\n\n  Let us face it. The traditional vocational training programs will not \nprovide this type of training.\n  Another Ohioan, Diane Cook, wrote me saying that:\n\n       Everyone makes mistakes but they all should be allowed a \n     second chance. Give us that second chance.\n\n  The bottom line is to employ single parents so they can support their \nfamilies. And what better way to accomplish this objective than \nencouraging the States to conduct tailored training programs which will \naffect over 17 million displaced homemakers all over this country?\n  Mr. President, I would say let us give them a second chance. I would \nonly repeat two major facts. This is the one area that was not picked \nup out of Perkins and used as examples in this bill. It is included by \nan overwhelming vote that the House had on it, included in the House \nvote.\n  I urge adoption of this amendment. At the appropriate time I will \nmove for a record rollcall vote. And I reserve the remainder of our \ntime on this side.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I would like to ask the Senator from Ohio a couple \nquestions because, as I understand it, in his proposed amendment he \nredefines the term ``displaced homemaker'' to include anyone who has \nbeen on welfare and has a child under the age of 16; is that correct?\n  Mr. GLENN. Would you repeat the question, please?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. As it is defined in the Senator's amendment, \n``displaced homemaker'' would be anyone who has been on welfare and has \na child under the age of 16?\n  Mr. GLENN. If they had been on welfare, yes.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. If they had been on welfare.\n  Mr. GLENN. If they had been previously.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Then the Senator also adds employment training for \ndisplaced homemakers to the list of permissible job training \nactivities?\n  Mr. GLENN. Permissible job training activity, correct. Permissible, \nnot required. That is an important point.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Programs for single parents and displaced homemakers \nand single pregnant women--the list required educational activities?\n  Mr. GLENN. Was the question whether they are required to participate \nin educational activity?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Yes. Are they required to do that?\n  Mr. GLENN. No, they are not required to; they would be permitted to.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Well, I guess I thought that under the language, as I \nread it, the State would be required to offer that.\n  Mr. GLENN. We have no amount required to be set aside in this. It \npermits the States a lot of flexibility to do what they think is best \nin each individual case, but we do not set aside a specific amount of \nmoney for this program.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Well, I am very sympathetic to what the Senator from \nOhio is saying. I have been a strong supporter of the displaced \nhomemaker programs. But I think that under the language of his \namendment, as I read it, it significantly expands the concept of \n``displaced homemaker.''\n  Under ``Education Activities'' it says that the State educational \nagency shall use the funds made available to the State under this \nsubtitle for work force education activities. To carry it out, there \nare certain State activities that are included. It then lists these \nactivities in this section.\n  Mr. GLENN. The States could permit the program. It does not require \nthat the States actually set aside a certain amount of money for this \nprogram. In other words, it includes them in the same category as the \nrest of the ones I read into the Record.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I suggest that if it is only something the Senator is \nwanting to list as a permissible activity, we already do that under the \nWorkforce Development Act. It is listed as a definition. It is included \nin the dislocated workers as one of the benchmarks in the bill. \nAlthough displaced homemakers are not counted separately, I will argue \nthis is still a population that is very much a part of the training, \nboth education and jobs, under the work force development bill.\n  Mr. GLENN. The difficulty, I believe, is that displaced homemakers \nhave not automatically been considered displaced workers in the past, \nso they get left out of these programs.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Can I ask the Senator a question? As I understand it, \nthere are a number of programs that are available now for this \npopulation as defined by the Glenn amendment. There are about a half a \ndozen programs which are utilized in order to reach that population. \nThis is a program that has proven to be an impressive success and \nprovides a great sense of meaning for individuals who qualify. The fact \nthat their lives are changed has a direct impact on the communities in \nwhich they reside.\n  I understand that what the Senator wants to do with his amendment is \nto make sure that the definition, which is used in other programs, will \nbe used in this program and that the States will have at least a \nrequirement to develop a program. The Senator is not saying how much.\n  Mr. GLENN. That is right.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The clear expectation is that the respective States are \ngoing to provide some form of assistance to displaced homemakers. The \nSenator from Ohio is hopeful, and I agree, that States will recognize \nthe importance of these services and they will find an area with which \nthey will provide further support. But the Senator from Ohio is not \nprescribing a percent or amount.\n  What my colleague is basically doing, as I understand the amendment, \nis making sure that the need is going to be highlighted so that some \nattention is going to be focused on the program. If the States want a \nrobust program, they can do it. If the States want a very modest \nprogram, they can do it. But nonetheless, this function, which is of \nsuch importance to many women in our society, will not be lost. That is \nthe way I read the Senator's amendment, and it is a reason why I think \nit is commendable. I think that it is an extraordinarily vulnerable \npopulation and one which justifies this kind of support and attention.\n  Mr. GLENN. The Senator stated it very, very well. I agree with his \nstatement.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I will only say, the definition as we \ntraditionally thought of is one which is defined as a full-time \nhomemaker for a substantial number of years and who no longer receives \nfinancial support previously provided by a spouse or public assistance. \nThat is what we traditionally thought of as a displaced homemaker.\n  I will suggest that this expanded definition includes anyone who has \nbeen on welfare and has a child under the age of 16 will be, obviously, \nsomeone who is receiving some duplicative assistance as well.\n  I just suggest while it is a very vulnerable population, the \namendment does make a dramatic change, and I suggest, at least of my \nreading of it, under the education requirements that it is a required \neducation activity. While it is permissible under job training, as I \nread it, it is required under education activities.\n  I just think, Mr. President, that it runs contrary to the thrust of \nthis bill which is attempting to get away, again, from our practice of \nnarrowly defining programs and eligible recipients. Not that we do not \nall have some real sympathy; I believe it is important to be able to \nreach that population. But this practice is the reason we have, again, \nso many separate programs and I think have not served any of them as \nwell as they could be and why we worked hard to try and do a totality \nof the system that could provide better quality assistance.\n  So I have to oppose this. I think that it really goes in a different \ndirection to \n\n[[Page S 14865]]\n\na larger degree than we had intended by creating the programs that we \nhad under this legislation.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nrequire.\n  The displaced homemakers are not mentioned in the bill itself, yet at \nthe same time, the bill singles out, as I understand, the veterans, \nsingles out out-of-school youth, youth in correctional facilities, \nadults in correctional facilities, older workers, at-risk youth and \nindividuals with disabilities. So it is not that the bill does not \nspecify some of these specific difficulties that people have and try to \naddress them.\n  As the Senator from Massachusetts said a moment ago, we estimate \nthere are some 17 million displaced homemakers across this country. \nThese can be men as well as women. The wife has died, a person is \nhaving a problem trying to raise the kids and that qualifies as a \ndisplaced homemaker as well as the usual definition of the wife who may \nbe divorced or may have lost her husband for whatever reason or \nanother. The figures are outstanding with regard to this program.\n  Approximately 80 percent of women served in the programs are placed \nin employment and postsecondary education; 80 percent. That is an \namazing success story. It is very successful, and that is the reason I \nbrought it up. It does not require the States to put money aside. It \ndoes not require that they set up programs. It says that they will be \npermitted to. On programs that have been successful and are continuing \nto be successful, they will be permitted to and, obviously, encouraged \nto because there is a need, and that need can be addressed if we adopt \nthis amendment.\n  I do not want to cut off debate. I will be happy to yield back time \nand move to a vote at the appropriate time, if no one else wishes to \nspeak.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, just to clarify, displaced homemakers \nis listed in the bill. It is a category under ``dislocated workers,'' \nand that is true with the definition that I gave earlier. But it is a \nbenchmark under the dislocated worker section as something that should \nbe addressed without setting aside any special allocation.\n  So just to clarify, we were conscious of it being an important \npopulation. It was not addressed as the Senator from Ohio would like to \nsee it by his amendment. I do not want people to think we did not \ndebate this and were not cognizant of that group.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think both Senators are correct. It is \nnot defined as the Senator from Ohio wanted. It is defined as the \nSenator from Kansas has referred. It does seem, as I mentioned earlier \nand for the reasons the Senator from Ohio has spelled out, that we want \nto make sure this population is highlighted. As the Senator has pointed \nout as well, it will be up to the State to decide whether they are \ngoing to have an enhanced and robust program or not. But the Senator is \ntrying to make sure that it is a population that is not overlooked.\n  Mr. President, if this completes the debate on this issue and it is \nagreeable with the Senator from Ohio, I would hope we could move onto \nthe Senator from Connecticut's amendment which is yet to be considered. \nHas the Senator concluded?\n  Mr. GLENN. I have concluded. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Glenn \namendment to the Workforce Development Act. Although, the Senator from \nOhio and I may be at odds this week over baseball's American League \nChampionship, I could not agree more with his amendment that includes \ndisplaced homemakers and single parents in workforce education \nprograms.\n  It is difficult to understand why these individuals, displaced \nhomemakers, and single parents, are not currently included in this act. \nCongress has long mandated that these women had access to the job \ntraining and vocational education services needed to become and remain \neconomically self-sufficient. Without including these single parents, \nwe are severely penalizing women who choose to raise families and are \nthen forced to cope without income due to the loss of their husbands or \ndivorce.\n  I must emphasize that this amendment is not a set-aside, with no \nmandated funding and it adds no cost to the bill.\n  Further, the amendment preserves State flexibility and only clarifies \nthat these services are permissible and not required by the State. The \ndecision about how to serve displaced homemakers and single parents and \nat what level remains with the State.\n  The amendment's definition of ``displaced homemaker'' is the same as \nunder Federal legislation under JTPA, Perkins, the Displaced Homemakers \nSelf-Sufficiency Act, and the Higher Education Act. When displaced \nhomemakers are defined as dislocated workers, they are simply not \nserved through workforce training programs.\n  We cannot ignore this important segment of our population. These \nsingle parents are as deserving of career training as any other segment \nof our dislocated worker population.\n  Further, this amendment continues the theme of the recently-passed \nwelfare reform legislation that moves citizens from public assistance \nto payrolls through education.\n  Let us come together on this amendment that truly supports family \nvalues. If we are to prioritize the working family in our society, we \ncannot forget those parents that have sacrificed economic gain for the \ngrowth of their children. When those single parents are left without a \nmonthly paycheck, we must at least be willing to provide educational \nassistance that puts their family back on the road to self-sufficiency.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Glenn \namendment be set aside and that the vote occur after the previously \nscheduled votes on the Moynihan amendment and the Grams amendment, \nwhich will occur after 5:20, with 4 minutes of debate in between those \namendments.\n  I believe the Senator from Michigan wants to speak for a few moments \non Senator Moynihan's amendment before Senator Dodd offers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. First, is there objection to the unanimous-\nconsent request? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2887\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator \nfrom Kansas for letting me go in at this point and yielding me time off \nof the bill so that I can speak for a moment on the bill and also on \nthe Moynihan amendment.\n  Mr. President, from World War II until the 1980's, American families \nsaw a steady rise in their standard of living. The poorest 20 percent \nsaw their incomes increase by over 130 percent, and the middle 40 \npercent of American families doubled their income. Paraphrasing the \nwords of John Kennedy, ``a rising tide raised all boats.''\n  A bedrock truth of American life virtually since our creation as a \nNation has been the assurance that, with initiative and hard work, men \nand women can pull themselves up, and even more importantly, \ngenerations of Americans confidently expected that their children would \nhave better lives than they had.\n  Unfortunately, most Americans no longer feel that for a variety of \nreasons, including Government policies in the 1980's, the increasing \nFederal deficit, our toleration of discrimination against American \nproducts in foreign markets, and a wider labor base in the United \nStates. People are working harder to advance more slowly and, in some \ncases, only to slide back down.\n  Individuals who enter the labor market today expect to change jobs at \nleast seven times within their lifetimes. This requires an \nextraordinary and unprecedented flexibility on their part. Workers are \nrequired to adapt to new situations and master new skills quickly if \nthey are to succeed. But this cannot be done alone.\n  The Federal Government has a critical role in providing a system of \ntraining and retraining programs to help people through these \ntransitions. In today's world marketplace, these programs are more \nimportant now than ever. However, as new programs to meet new needs \nhave been designed and \n\n[[Page S 14866]]\nimplemented, the system has become needlessly complicated. Many people \nwho require job training services become lost within the maze of \nprograms. A recent GAO report cited over 100 Federal programs that \noffer job training services. So, clearly, some consolidation and \nrestructuring is necessary.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from New York, however, has offered an \namendment to this bill which I think is critically important. It would \nmaintain the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act as a separate program. \nThis is a critically needed program which was set up to help workers \nwho lose their jobs because of trade agreements into which we enter. \nAnd given the growing role of exports in our Nation's economy, a \nprogram of that type is required.\n  But even more important, a commitment was made during the debate in \nthe presentation of both NAFTA and GATT. A commitment was made that \ntrade adjustment assistance would be there if those two agreements were \nentered into and were implemented by the Congress. We knew when those \nagreements were passed that there would be a loss of jobs in some \nsectors and, knowing that, those agreements were entered into. And we \ndecided, as part of that approach, to compensate for what are the harsh \nconsequences to many in some sectors of our economy.\n  NAFTA-specific trade adjustment assistance provisions were added to \nNAFTA. They were added in order to gain more support for NAFTA in \nCongress. It was a commitment that was made and should be kept. And now \nthat NAFTA has passed and American jobs are indeed being lost in some \nsectors, the least we can do is carry out our commitment that was made \nat that time and which helped to get approval of those two agreements. \nAnd the least we can do is provide a safety net for those Americans who \nhave lost their jobs because of those agreements, either because the \njobs have relocated to Mexico, or because they were displaced by \nimports from Mexico as a result of NAFTA.\n  Mr. President, the workers that frequently lose those jobs because of \ntrade agreements are people who have worked their whole lives at one \nplace. Their skills have been developed to suit the workplaces. Often \nthey require extensive retraining. Trade adjustment assistance provides \nthat training and it does so successfully. Over 85 percent of the \nworkers assisted by the TAA have found permanent employment.\n  Mr. President, workers from my State of Michigan have benefited from \nTAA. From January 1993 to August 1995, over 4,000 workers in the State \nof Michigan received trade adjustment assistance. As I said, it has \nbeen 85-percent successful. We have had $4 million in training money, \nover $7 million for job location assistance and supplementary income. \nThose funds were used to help support families until they could get on \ntheir feet again and obtain permanent employment.\n  So while I generally support the goals of this legislation, Mr. \nPresident, some consolidation and reorganization of the system, I \nbelieve, is indicated. Surely, we ought to keep the commitments we made \njust a few years ago to the people who we knew were going to be \ndisplaced by trade agreements and keep our commitment to have a trade \nadjustment-specific program kept in place for them.\n  Mr. President, we should strive to pass a bill which recognizes the \nFederal job training network and provides more flexibility for States, \nbut does so in a way which empowers individuals and provides maximum \naccess to needed services.\n  The bill before us, S. 143, accomplishes these goals to a \nconsiderable extent. It would provide States with a substantial amount \nflexibility, institute benchmarks for service that States must meet, \nestablish a reporting system to track recipients of services, and \ncoordinate the program more closely with the private sector. All of \nthese are important changes which I support.\n  Under S. 143, States will be required to formulate a State plan which \nexplains how they will provide services with particular attention paid \nto how they will meet the needs of special population groups, like \nolder workers. This will allow States to better tailor services to the \nlocal market demands.\n  In Michigan, in recent years, this has unfortunately often meant \nresponding to large, sometimes permanent layoffs of factory workers. \nSeveral towns in my State are undergoing this process as we speak.\n  Compounding the problem within Michigan is the fact that many of our \nlarger urban centers have entirely different employment problems. This \nbill would better enable us to respond to this type of variety by \ntailoring the program to address such situations.\n  I am very concerned, however, about changes to the Job Corps Program \nin the bill. Administration of the program would be turned over to the \nStates and 25 Job Corps centers would be closed.\n  I support the approach to be offered by Senators Specter and Simon \nthat would maintain Federal standards and administration while \nincreasing State and local involvement. Governors would have an \nopportunity to review a community's application before it was submitted \nto the Department of Labor. Community organizations and local work \nforce development boards would actively participate.\n  The State of Michigan currently operates two Job Corps centers, one \nin Detroit, one in Grand Rapids, and a third is slated to open in Flint \nin 1996. As an indication of the Flint community's commitment to this \nprogram, over 30 local organizations have raised $2 million in \nresources to help support the program. Michigan, like many other \nindustrial States, has a number of economically depressed communities \nstruggling to train workers and generate jobs. Job Corps is one of the \nprograms that many of these communities rely upon to help meet that \nchallenge.\n  I am concerned that the block grant approach will not adequately \nretain the commitment to special population groups like older workers \nor at-risk youth which require different services than the rest of the \npopulation. Although the bill does contain benchmarks which the States \nwould establish for themselves, I would like to see a clearer \ncommitment to serving these groups.\n  Also, while the bill also allows for the establishment of local work \nforce development boards to help integrate local officials into the \nprocess, they are not mandated. One of the important and productive \nparts of the current system is the private industry councils, or PIC's \nwhich work with local and county officials to design training programs \nthat meet the needs of local businesses. It is fundamental to the \nsuccess of job training programs that we prepare people for jobs which \nexist in their communities. Local work force development boards can be \nan important part of assuring that that happens. Therefore, I would \nlike to see an expanded role for local participation.\n  Finally, I would like to highlight two organizations within my state \nwhich demonstrate the great potential of job training. Focus:HOPE, a \nretraining center in Detroit, was established in 1968 to meet the needs \nof the city's low-income residents. This program has been a shining \nsuccess story. For example, a recent study found that 85 percent of the \ngraduates of Focus:HOPE's Machinist Training Institute are employed in \nmachinist trades. This is a tremendous step forward for people who come \nto the center with little educational background and very low skill \nlevels. They leave with advanced training in computer-assisted \nmachining. The average salary for this group is $25,000 to $35,000 per \nyear. And, their skills are closely matched to the area's labor market. \nSome students are even recruited by local manufacturers before they \nfinish their program. Focus:HOPE works. It provides an enormously \nvaluable service to both the students and the Detroit community.\n  Similarly, OperationAble, founded in 1989, has become one of the most \nsuccessful job training centers of its kind in the country. It serves \nolder workers, in an innovative way. Job counselors carefully examine \neach individual's background, future needs and aspirations before \nhelping them to plan a training program. Over 83 percent of \nOperationAble's students are placed in permanent jobs. OperationAble is \nmobilizing a vital part of our community, our older workers, one which \nshould not be left out in a proposed consolidation.\n  Mr. President, the legislation before us has some pluses and minuses. \nI am hopeful that we will strengthen it. If \n\n[[Page S 14867]]\nwe focus on the needs of working families caught in a changing \nmarketplace, and eliminate unnecessary duplication and waste; if we \nlearn from experience and build on what has worked best, we will have \ntaken an important step forward.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I was going to inquire of the managers of \nthe bill, through the Chair, if it is appropriate that I send an \namendment to the desk at this time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. We hope that the Senator will send his amendment to \nthe desk.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2890 to Amendment No. 2885\n\n              (Purpose: To improve the voucher provisions)\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Breaux], for himself, Mr. \n     Daschle, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Pell, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2890 to amendment No. 2885.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 51, line 6, strike ``deliver'' and insert \n     ``deliver, to persons age 18 or older who are unable to \n     obtain Pell Grants under title IV of the Higher Education Act \n     of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.),''.\n       On page 53, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n       (D) Information.--A State that determines that a need \n     exists to train persons age 18 or older through activities \n     authorized under paragraph (6) shall indicate in the State \n     plan described in section 104 for the State, or the annual \n     report described in section 121(a) for the State, the extent, \n     if any, to which the State will use the authority of this \n     paragraph to deliver some or all such activities through a \n     system of vouchers, including indicating the information and \n     timeframes required under subparagraph (C).\n       On page 104, line 2, strike ``or''.\n       On page 104, line 7, strike the period and insert: ``; \n     or''.\n       On page 104, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n       (3) beginning with program year 2000, in the case of a \n     State that elects to offer activities for persons age 18 or \n     older under section 106(a)(6), the State uses the authority \n     of section 106(a)(9) to deliver some or all of such \n     activities through a system of vouchers.\n       On page 114, line 3, strike, ``or''.\n       On page 114, line 9, strike the period and insert ``; or''.\n       On page 114, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n       (C) in the case of a State that elects to offer activities \n     for persons age 18 or older under section 106(a)(6); uses the \n     authority of section 106(a)(9) to deliver some or all of such \n     activities through a system of vouchers.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I want to first start off by thanking the \ndistinguished managers of the bill, the Senator from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy, and the Senator from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum, for \nall of the work they have been able to put into helping us draft this \namendment. I think it is an amendment that should be enthusiastically \nsupported by all of our colleagues.\n  Mr. President, just as a concept of the background of the entire \nbill, what we are doing is consolidating about 90 Federal programs that \ncurrently serve people who are in need of job training, to meet the \nneeds and the skills, or demand, as we move into the 21st century.\n  I think the essence of the legislation is really monumental. It is \nhistorical that the U.S. Senate and, hopefully, the other body, at the \nappropriate time, can realize that all of these programs we have \nwritten over the years--90 different programs--aimed at encouraging \npeople to become better trained so they could meet the demands and \nchallenges of the work force in the 21st century need to be \nconsolidated. If I found myself unemployed and I wanted to get help \nfrom my Government, I do not know if I would know where to go. There \nare 90 programs, and if somebody dumped them in front of me and said, \n``pick one,'' I would say, look, I have to be a rocket scientist to \nfigure out which program fits my need.\n  The reason for that is basically that I think in the last several \ndecades, we as a Congress have tried to create a solution or program \nfor every problem. As a result of trying to address every problem with \na program, we ended up with all of these programs and tried to address \nevery conceivable need of every citizen in the country. Some would \nsuggest that the proper role of Government is to help solve everybody's \nproblems all the time. I suggest that that is really not the proper \nrole. The proper role is to help people to solve their own problems, \nhelp equip the citizens of this country to be in a position to solve \ntheir own problems. On the other extreme, some in Government think \nthere is no role for Government at all, and that if somebody loses his \njob, so be it, let him survive if he can. That is the survival of the \nfittest theory, that suggests there is no role for Government that is \nproper or appropriate in helping the citizens of our country meet the \nneeds that are facing them. If a plant is closed because of downsizing, \ntough luck. If a military base is closed in your area and all the jobs \nassociated with that base are lost, tough luck. If, in fact, we have a \ndisaster, or because of some trade policy, foreign imports are \nincreased and you lose your job in the domestic industry here in this \ncountry, tough luck. There is no role for Government to help at all.\n\n  That, I think, should be rejected categorically by all Members of \nthis body as an improper response from Government. But we cannot, at \nthe same time, create a program for every problem. What this \nlegislation does is consolidate these 90 programs, make them more \nefficient, make them function better, make it easier for people to get \nhelp from the Government so they can help themselves. Because each of \nus has a duty in life to be responsible, to utilize the gifts we have, \nto help develop those gifts and be a better citizen. I think, by \nconsolidating these programs, we move a long way toward accomplishing \nthat.\n  My amendment is, really, patterned after the great success we have \nhad in this country with the GI bill. The GI bill's great success was \nnot that it created a whole bunch of programs, because it did not. It \ncreated one program. It told the people of this country if they served \nin the military that when they got back, the Government was going to \nhelp them go to college. Under the GI bill we did not tell them which \ncollege they had to go to, and we did not tell them which program or \nwhich studies they had to take when they got there. We did not tell \nthem what they had to major in, and we to not tell them what they had \nto minor in. But we said, here is some financial help. Go to the school \nyou think can serve your needs the best and take the courses you enjoy, \nthat you are best adapted for. The great success of the program was \nreally its flexibility, calling on people to be challenged in what they \nwant to do and figure out where they can best go to meet those \nrequirements.\n  The amendment I am offering with the managers of the bill provides \nincentives in this bill to encourage States to use vouchers, to give \nStates the right to issue vouchers to the people in their State and let \nthose individuals make the decisions as to how they best can get the \nproper training to meet the needs they have. Instead of what is usual \nin Washington or in some State capital, saying, ``You have to go here \nto get your training and it has to be this type of training,'' the \nvoucher system will say to the individual, ``We trust you to make the \nright decision. We trust you to pick the best school, the best program, \nthe best course that is going to meet your needs. No one in Washington \nis going to tell you where you can best be served. No one in your State \ncapital is going to tell you what you have to do.''\n  We, in this Government, trust the individual's instincts to do what \nis right when the proper choices are in front of him or her. So what we \ndo in this amendment is fairly simple. It gives States two incentives, \ntwo incentives to adopt the voucher system.\n  First, it authorizes the Secretary to provide incentive awards to \nStates that have begun providing services through these vouchers of up \nto $15 million extra money that a State would be able to receive if it \nsets up a voucher program within the States to give vouchers to \nindividuals to allow them to go to the particular program they think \nbest fits their particular needs.\n  The second incentive is that my amendment will allow Governors to use \nflexible funds on economic development activities if they have \nestablished a workforce development board \n\n[[Page S 14868]]\n\nor a voucher system. This is in the third year of the program. We are \nsaying to the States, you are going to be able to use your flexible \nfunds on economic development if you put together this workforce \ndevelopment board or if you have established the voucher program. And, \nin the third year, under my amendment, if a State decides to set up a \nvoucher program, then it would be able to use the flex funds for \neconomic development activity.\n  So this amendment essentially puts two additional incentives in the \nlegislation to encourage the States--not demand the States to do it, \nbut to encourage the States--to set up vouchers for the people who need \nthe benefit of the programs. Then let that individual take those \nvouchers and go to where he or she thinks the needs they have can best \nbe met within the program.\n  That would increase competition because all of these programs would \nstart competing for the vouchers of the individuals. People in this \nsociety know if they provide a better service, people are going to use \nthat service. They are going to go to the school that meets their \nneeds. They are going to go to the best school, not a worse school; not \na second-class school, but the best school. So schools, I think, \nbecause of competition, because of this amendment, will do a better job \nbecause they know people will be going to them based on their ability \nto deliver the training that individuals who are unemployed actually \nneed.\n  I think it also teaches individuals responsibility, because they are \ngoing to have to make that decision. They are not going to just sit \nback and say, ``Tell me where I have to go, tell me what I have to do, \nand tell me how I have to do it.'' They are going to say, ``I have to \nmake a decision.'' Maybe for the first time in the lives of some \nindividuals, they are going to start taking responsibility for their \nfuture by saying, ``I want to make sure I pick the best school, that I \npick the best program. And after I finish with it, I know I am going to \nbe a much better citizen.'' That individual will become a person who \ncan market his or her abilities after receiving the training for the \nprogram they pick as opposed to the program that someone has picked for \nthem.\n  In addition, I point out that in return for accepting the vouchers, \nschool and training providers will be required to provide performance \ninformation. That means the completion rates of the people who go to \ntheir schools, the licensing rates, placement retention, wage rates, \nwhich voucher recipients and others could use to make good decisions \nabout where to go to get the training they need.\n  In other words, schools that provide training to unemployed workers \nare going to have to provide information to the workers, the unemployed \nworkers who are looking for the training, on how their schools perform \nso those unemployed workers will then have information they can use to \ndetermine which school is the best for their needs.\n  If I had a list of performance results based on schools, and at one \nschool 95 percent of the people who went to that school and got the \ntraining became employed, and there was another school that only got \njobs for about 15 percent of their people, is there any question about \nwhich school I would want to go to or anybody would want to go to? Of \ncourse, the answer is simple: They would want to go to the school that \nfinds jobs for people that complete their programs.\n  That is competition and that is what this amendment does. It allows \nindividuals to become more responsible. It allows them to make the \ndecision based on what is best for them while at the same time it \nrequires responsibility on the part of the institutions that they would \nbe going to, to make sure that fly-by-night groups and organizations \nthat have been created overnight just to take advantage of these \nprograms are not going to be successful. With the information they are \nrequired to present, everybody will have a chance to make the right \ndecision.\n  Mr. President, I think this amendment adds to the bill. I think it is \nan important step. It makes the bill an even stronger piece of \nlegislation, one that we can all be proud of supporting.\n  I thank the managers of the bill, Senator Kennedy and Senator \nKassebaum, for their involvement and their assistance and their \nencouragement in this effort. I encourage all our colleagues to support \nthe amendment, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  I thank the Senator from Louisiana for his cooperation on this \ninnovative and creative concept, and thank as well Senator Daschle and \nothers who have favored this improvement in the legislation. The way \nthis has been crafted, those who will be eligible will be over 18 years \nof age, who are unable to obtain a Pell grant.\n  We can imagine a situation where there has been a significant closing \nof a plant or phasing out of a defense industry, or perhaps as a result \nof a merger, as we saw with the Chase Manhattan Bank and the Chemical \nBank, affecting some 12,000 workers in different communities out there. \nWe can see local community colleges or other educational facilities in \ncommunities responding to those particular needs. They will be \ndeveloping programs which are designed to place individuals and upgrade \ntheir skills so they can be successfully employed.\n  We are maximizing the flexibility with this amendment and giving an \nindividual the opportunity to take advantage of that situation, or \nmaybe they will decide that they want to go to a different part of the \ncountry and will be able to go into a different program. We are \npermitting the States to make the judgment about what that voucher will \nbe worth. It may be worth a couple of thousand dollars in \nMassachusetts, and it may be valued less in a different part of the \ncountry. So there is maximum flexibility within the State and maximum \nversatility for the displaced worker.\n  For the reasons that the Senator has spelled out, I think it is a \nvery, very creative and imaginative way of trying to make us do better \nwith training programs. I want to thank him for his cooperation. He has \nhad legislation on this over a period of years and has worked very \nclosely with all of the members of the committee.\n  We have tried to capture the essence of his proposal. I think we \nhave, and we look forward to its success and, hopefully, building on it \nover the period of the future.\n  I thank the Senator from Louisiana. At an appropriate time, I hope \nthe amendment will be accepted unanimously.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I, too, am pleased that we have been \nable to work out an agreement on the language with the Senator from \nLouisiana. He spent a lot of time on this. He has given a lot of \nthought to it. And I have supported the limited use of vouchers for job \ntraining services but only as an option for the States. I think there \nis a recognition that there is a place, but we need to be careful on \nhow we move in that direction. I have been very concerned about \nmandating vouchers because it is a new and untested concept. Therefore, \nI think the direction that this amendment would take us is an important \none.\n  I very much value the effort of Senator Breaux to speak to this. He \ncares a lot about it. And the amendment will not mandate that States \nprovide vouchers but, rather, will provide additional means to assist \nand encourage States to implement a voucher system. I am pleased to be \na supporter of this amendment.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, if I can just add one short note, I thank \nmy colleagues for their most generous comments. Lt. Gov. Buddy McKay, \nof Florida, who served in the House with some of us when we were in the \nother body, in behalf of Governor Chiles, has a statement which is a \ncouple of sentences that I want to read because I think it really makes \nthe point very well. He said:\n\n       In this country we trust citizens to choose their elected \n     officials, but we don't trust them to choose training \n     programs. Currently, leaders of Government employees in \n     Washington, in Federal regional offices, in State capitals \n     and State regional offices, and in service sites dictate \n     those decisions for their own citizens. That is bunk. \n     Informed citizens can make the best decisions for themselves. \n     It is a simple enough premise in this country, but it is a \n     revolutionary idea for government.\n\n  I think the point is well made that we trust citizens to make \ndecisions on who their elected officials are but we \n\n[[Page S 14869]]\ndo not trust them to decide which programs are best for them. I think, \nas the Lieutenant Governor said, that is ``bunk.'' And this amendment \nwould, I think, help us overcome that current situation and allow, \nthrough the voucher program, people to make the best decisions for \nthemselves and trust the American citizen to do what is right instead \nof requiring the government to make that decision for them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are prepared to yield back time and \nask for the consideration of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The amendment (No. 2890) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2891 to Amendment No. 2885\n\n (Purpose: To provide for a migrant or seasonal farmworker program and \n                   for national discretionary grants)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and I ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself \nand the Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Pell.\n  Mr. President, this is an amendment which we worked on for some time. \nI believe it will be accepted by both the floor manager and the ranking \nminority member.\n  Very briefly, this amendment is designed to establish a rapid \nresponse service where you have national disasters or national needs \nthat would go beyond the capacity of States to respond to them. Our \ndistinguished colleague from Louisiana talked about some of those when \nhe mentioned base closures. Often, States cannot anticipate those \nresults. All of a sudden States find themselves in the situation where \na significant number of people lose their jobs--in the case of base \nclosures because the Federal Government has made a decision affecting \nthe economy of the local area. There are also, of course, other \nsituations where you have natural disasters.\n  I think all of us at one time or another have certainly seen our \nStates afflicted by unanticipated events with weather or climatic \nconditions. Again, we can find people who, through no fault of their \nown and no fault of the business, are displaced. This amendment allows \nfor some additional funds to respond to people who find themselves out \nof work under those circumstances.\n  As the Presiding Officer will no doubt recall, I offered this \namendment in the committee. There was a good discussion at the time, \nand we lost the amendment on a tie vote 8 to 8. But there was a strong \nenough feeling there that I brought this up to see if we could work out \nsome of the language, which we are able to do.\n  As a result of that, today I offer this amendment which will allow us \nto respond in those kind of situations. I think it is in the national \ninterest for the Federal Government to provide assistance to our States \nunder those circumstances and, just as importantly if not more \nimportantly, the very people who find themselves without work and \nunable to provide for their families.\n  I just want to underscore the point that has been made by others. We \nall know how well the economy is doing in certain areas. Profitability \nis up and productivity is at its highest level in many ways. The stock \nmarket has been doing very, very well. But, as the Senator from \nMassachusetts pointed out a few moments ago, look at 12,000 to 20,000 \npeople losing their jobs as a result of a merger between Chemical and \nChase Bank. And in another act of downsizing, DuPont laid off some \n5,000 or 6,000 people recently. All of this downsizing contributes, I \nsuppose, we are told, to the strength of the economic well-being of the \ncountry. Yet, the people who lose their jobs are oftentimes forgotten \nin the discussion. We need to focus on what happens to these people and \nwhat happens to their families.\n  This amendment does not address that situation specifically, but much \nof what is included in this bill does.\n  For those reasons, I commend the distinguished Senator from Kansas, \nthe chairman of the committee, for the work in this area. I think we \nneed to be thinking creatively when we end up with a tax proposal, a \ntax bill coming up--which we are apt to--as to how we might pay more \nattention to what happens to those people who lose their jobs not from \na natural disaster, not from some accident or something undertaken by \nGovernment, but when you have great mergers and acquisitions which may \nresult in a real need--the merger itself may be worthwhile--but when \nresults of that activity cause thousands of people to lose their jobs, \nI think we have a responsibility to respond to them, and we need to be \nthinking about how we can do that.\n  I appreciate the efforts of Senator Kassebaum and staff to work the \nspecifics out so this is now acceptable.\n  This amendment offers real protection to States and workers affected \nby mass layoffs due to economic downsizing, plant and base closings, \nand natural disasters.\n  It preserves the ability of the Federal Government to respond quickly \nand in a meaningful way to concentrated economic employment \ndifficulties--the kind no one State can predict or pay for. Without \nthis amendment, this assistance, which gets communities and workers \nthrough the worst of times, would no longer be available.\n  We keep hearing about an economic recovery, a rising stock market. \nBut we have to remember that one result of the improving economy is \ndownsizing in many industries all across the country. All of a sudden \npeople are being thrown out of work through no fault of their own.\n  We may not be able to prevent these Americans from losing their jobs, \nbut we should try to give them some aid in the form of training and \nother support to help them get back in to the work force.\n  The need for such assistance will not diminish in the coming years. \nDefense-related layoffs in the private sector alone are continuing, \nwith up to an additional 25- to 30-percent reduction expected within \nthe next 2 to 3 years. Mergers in the banking and other industries are \nresulting in thousands of layoffs. And the downsizing trend is expected \nto continue. Natural disasters, like the flooding in the Midwest, \ncannot be predicted. We cannot just turn our backs on Americans in \nneed.\n  This amendment ensures that the resources will be available to \nprovide emergency funds in order to get people back on their feet. \nSpecific examples of how we have helped out recently are:\n  In addition to the grants that will go to Connecticut, which I \nmentioned earlier, Washington State received $14.6 million to assist \nworkers laid off by Boeing. More than $4 million in retraining dollars \nhave been made available for 9,500 GTE employees expected to be severed \nfrom their jobs in 22 States, including Missouri, Washington, and \nIllinois. More than $100 million has been spent in the last 4 years in \nresponse to natural disasters. For example, for the 1993 Midwest \nfloods, funding went to Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, and \nKansas.\n  This kind of vital assistance will continue under my amendment. The \nSecretary of Labor, with the Federal partnership, will be able to \nprovide States, communities, and workers with critical assistance when \nthere is a mass layoff, base closing, or natural disaster.\n  The need for this assistance is broadly recognized. Just last week, \nthe National Governors' Association strongly endorsed this concept.\n  This amendment also ensures that migrant farmworkers continue to \nreceive training services. There could not be a needier population, \nyet, because they move so much, they are difficult to serve. This \namendment provides the Secretary with funds to assist these workers, as \nhe currently does.\n  Mr. President, this amendment represents the kind of good compromise \nwe can reach when we share the same goal--to assist workers in times of \ncrisis.\n  I appreciate the efforts of Senator Kassebaum and am pleased the \namendment will be accepted.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might use. \nI will be very brief.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Connecticut for bringing \nthis up, both in the committee and on the floor, and thank him for all \nof his work on this extremely important program, which I am pleased to \nsay will be accepted.\n  I am grateful to the Senator from Kansas for her support of the \nprogram as well.\n  This amendment is particularly timely as we consider the events of \nthe last few days with Hurricane Opal and the devastating economic \nimpact it has left in its wake. It has been estimated to have caused \nover $2 billion in damage in that particular region of the country. \nWhat Member of this body would want the kind of devastation that has \naffected the Southern States? Not many years ago New England was \nsimilarly affected and we saw similar damage in the Midwest by the \nfloods.\n  I see my friend and colleague from California, which has been \ndevastated by a wide variety of natural disasters, by extraordinary \nfires, earthquakes, and other natural disasters. I think we are also \nvery mindful of these dramatic changes that have been taking place in \nterms of mergers, downsizing, and the changes in the defense \nprocurement where we find men and women that have devoted their lives \nworking for \n\n[[Page S 14871]]\nthis country. They have been in the defense production industry for 20 \nor 30 years during the cold war, and now with these dramatic shifts in \nchanges in the procurement policies in defense, we see them virtually \npink-slipped from these companies. They are older workers. We have some \nimportant responsibilities certainly to them. I think if you look at \nthe record of this program particularly in the recent years under the \nSecretary of Labor it is really a commendable example about how these \nlimited resources can be leveraged to give new hope and opportunity to \ntens of thousands of workers here in this country.\n\n  I think it is an extremely important measure and we are enormously \ngrateful for the willingness of our Chair to consider this. Because I \nknow, for the reasons she has outlined in the committee and expressed \notherwise, of her concern about the general shape of this whole \nlegislation, this has been modified, it has been adjusted to try to \nrespond to some of her particular concerns and we are hopeful it will \nbe accepted and included.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I, too, am pleased that we have been \nable to come together in agreement on the amendment put forward by the \nSenator from Connecticut and the Senator from Rhode Island. Senator \nDodd has been an eloquent advocate for wanting to make sure that these \nworkers who may be laid off due to some sort of natural disaster would \nbe taken care of, and we had some lengthy debates in the committee. \nThis is an issue on which Members on both sides of the aisle have \nworked hard to address.\n  The national interest in addressing major economic dislocations from \nnatural disasters is something that affects all of our States and goes \noften across State lines. It is difficult for States to adequately \nprepare to handle themselves when there is a disaster that may happen \nwithout any advanced notice.\n  While I have been reluctant to set aside a large amount at the \nFederal level which would further diminish moneys going to the States, \nthis amendment will allow those funds already set aside at the national \nlevel for incentive grants to also be used for rapid response grants. \nThis will assist workers affected by plant closures or mass layoffs or \nnatural disasters.\n  In addition, a small amount of funds are being made available for \nmigrant and seasonal farm workers, and this I believe is also something \nthat the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Rhode Island \nhave been particularly concerned about as well.\n  So I am pleased that this amendment does not substantially reduce the \namount of funding that is going directly to the States under this bill, \nwhich was my primary concern when it was offered in committee.\n  I appreciate the willingness of my colleagues on the committee, \nSenator Dodd and Senator Pell, to try to work out some language that we \ncould all come together and support and I believe this is it.\n  So for all these reasons, Mr. President, I think it is a good \namendment. I am very appreciative of the efforts of the Senator from \nConnecticut and the Senator from Rhode Island to help work out the \nlanguage.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair. Just very briefly, I meant to point out \nthat while this is not directly a result of the amendment that \nhopefully will be adopted shortly, it is an indication of the kind of \ndifference this amendment will make. Just today, the Department of \nLabor announced it would provide $1,500,000 in retraining assistance to \nsome 600 employees of the Southern Connecticut Telephone Co., who just \nlost their jobs. Also, recently, Allied Signal, a defense contractor, \nclosed a facility in Connecticut. The Federal Government is able to \nprovide an additional $4,300,000 to assist those 1,500 employees who \nwill have lost their work.\n  This is an example of a national policy affecting a major local \nemployer in that area, and so this the kind of thing in which we think \nthe Federal Government can play a proper role in assisting in these \nkinds of emergencies.\n  That first grant was announced today, and we are very pleased they \nare going to be offering some assistance to the people of Connecticut \nwith that kind of support.\n  Mr. President, I again thank my colleagues for their support.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to again join with Senator Dodd \nin sponsoring this amendment. Unfortunately, when a similar version was \noffered at the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee markup, it \nwas defeated on an 8 to 8 tie.\n  Senator Dodd and I know all too well how a State is affected by \nsudden, unexpected, large-scale worker dislocations. It is our strong \nbelief that under S. 143 States would not be able to react go the large \ndislocations my home State has become familiar with recently. By their \nnature, these massive dislocations are abrupt events. In designing its \ngeneral work force plan called for under this new legislation, no State \nwould, or should, reserve a portion of its limited job training money \nto prepare for an event that might or might not take place at an \nundetermined time in the future.\n  This is why we have introduced this amendment that reserves a small \npool of money at the Federal level to be dispersed to States when and \nif they are in need. This program works well now and I believe it \nshould be allowed to continue.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in support of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, if there is no one else who wishes to \nspeak on this amendment, I would urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield back the remainder of the time.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2891) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if I understand it correctly, I see my \nfriend and colleague, the Senator from California who wanted to speak, \nand the Senator from New York also wanted to speak briefly. After these \nspeakers it was the hope that we might move towards the votes which had \nbeen ordered. Is that the understanding of the Chair?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Yes. Did I understand the Senator from Washington \n[Mrs. Murray] wanted to speak?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If we can hold that in abeyance. She had talked to me, \nand then I received other instructions. But if we could work out \nperhaps for the benefit of the Members who have been inquiring about \nhow we might be proceeding, how long did the Senator from California \ndesire?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I have about 12 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The only question is--how long did the Senator from New \nYork wish to speak?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Five minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am just trying to think about how we might proceed. \nDoes the Senator then want to speak after the three votes? Is that \nagreeable?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would be happy to do that. That will be helpful.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I think it would perhaps serve us best \nto have the Senator from California and the Senator from New York make \ntheir comments and then go to the three votes that have already been \nordered, the one on trade adjustment assistance, the amendment of \nSenator Gramm, and the amendment of Senator Glenn. And then at that \ntime the majority leader I think is to make a decision about whether we \nwill continue this evening or put the rest of the amendments off until \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is fine. I yield the time, 12 minutes, to the \nSenator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Let me begin by saying that I very much appreciate the job that has \nbeen done by the chairman of the committee and the ranking member, and \nI know it has not been easy to put together this kind of consensus. I \nam led to believe \n\n[[Page S 14872]]\nthis bill will pass the Senate. However, I have to make my own point of \nview on it clear because what is sauce for the goose is not necessarily \nsauce for the gander, when you begin to change the formula on which \nsome of these programs are based.\n  I have come to the conclusion that I must oppose this bill. I must \noppose it for basically two reasons. The first is that the bill cuts \ndramatically into the ability of California to provide job training.\n  Let me point this out. While the United States added 3 million jobs \nfrom May 1991 to December 1993, California lost nearly 450,000 jobs \nduring that time. As a matter of fact, in the last 5 years, our \nunemployment rate has never dropped below 7 percent, with a high of 10 \npercent in 1994.\n  So we have more people unemployed in the State of California than 13 \nother States have people today. So job training becomes a very \nimportant factor. Compared to current funding, this bill shifts funds \nfrom California to other States. Under the revised formula in the \nmanagers' amendment, almost one-half of all funds of the losing States \ncome from California.\n  This is a proportion that is very high. I think the No. 1 determinant \nof a job training program should be existing unemployment needs and \ndata. Instead, this block grant consolidation bases 10 percent only on \nunemployment. This is a major departure from the way these programs \nwere determined in the past.\n  My major concern about this bill is that it gives greater weight to \nthings other than unemployment, and the bill does not give adequate \nweight to unemployment. So with a 7.2-percent unemployment rate in \nSeptember, while the national rate was 5.6 percent, California will \nlose about $7 million in this bill despite the fact that that is just a \n4-percent reduction. It translates into $7 million based on the change \nin formula application.\n  The new managers' amendment drops the 20 percent for AFDC to 10 \npercent and increases from 10 percent to 20 percent the weight given to \npoverty. My State, has high rates of AFDC recipients and unemployed \npeople. For example, California is home to 18 percent of all AFDC \nrecipients. That translates into 909,000 AFDC cases. That translates \ninto 2.6 million people on AFDC.\n  By deemphasizing AFDC recipients and unemployment with the low-\nweighting factor, the bill essentially gives California short shrift. \nUnder current law, we receive 14.8 percent of job training funds. Under \nthis approach, we will only get 14.2 percent. That is the $7 million \ndifference. And it is a big difference.\n  Let me mention what has happened in California by way of Federal \npolicy. California has struggled through the closing or realignment of \n9 military bases in this round alone following 22 in previous rounds. \nIn total, these have eliminated more than 200,000 direct and indirect \njobs. The closings and realignments have drained about $7 billion out \nof the California economy.\n  Corporate defense downsizing has claimed 250,000 layoffs in the past \n5 years, and that is expected to double. So from defense downsizing \nalone, before it is through, in the corporate sector and from base \nclosures, California will lose over 1 million jobs. Now, that is \nsomething this formula does not take into consideration.\n  I mentioned California has 18 percent of the country's welfare \ncaseload but 12.2 percent of the Nation's population. Now, what does \nthis show? It shows that our need is actually higher than the \npopulation-driven formula number. So this formula and the redesignation \nof formula clearly does not work for California. This is not a case in \nthis bill where as a product of consolidating 80 programs, States are \ngoing to be held harmless. That is not true. The money taken from \nCalifornia by this new formula is essentially given to other States \nthat have less poverty and less unemployment.\n  So it is very hard for me, representing California, to turn around \nand vote for this bill. I am willing to say, sure, we should do our \nfair share, and I voted for the welfare reform bill despite the fact \nthat I lost on major amendments that addressed the fact that we have a \nhuge immigrant population. That bill will cost California billions of \ndollars.\n  Republican Medicare and Medicaid plans will cost California billions \nof dollars. Our own Governor has up to this point indicated he will not \naccept $42 million in Goals 2000 education funds. I cannot understand \nthat--$42 million for schools when we have schools that are crumbling, \nelementary schools that have 5,000 youngsters in them, the highest \nclass size in the Nation, and he plans to turn down these funds. I am \nhopeful he will reconsider. This is one more diminution of revenues to \naddress the needs of 32 million people.\n  In summary, I very much recognize the good work done by both Senators \nhere and by the committee, and I am appreciative of it. It is just when \nthe State takes hit after hit after hit, when other States benefit and \nCalifornia with its needs, as has been referenced earlier--base \nclosures, earthquakes, fires, riots, you name it--all the things that \nhave happened, and when we know that job training is as important as it \nis, to take a loss of over $7 million in this bill, through the \nconsolidation of programs and see the money essentially go to other \nStates--under a different formula albeit--is very hard for me to do.\n  I appreciate the forbearance of the chairman and the ranking member, \nand I appreciate the opportunity to explain my vote.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I am very sensitive to the concerns of \nthe Senator from California. She is a very effective advocate for her \nState in wanting to protect, of course, what should come to her State.\n  I would just point out that California gets twice what any other \nState gets. The closest States to California are New York and Texas. So \nwhile California has a large population, a population that has many \nneeds, it also is a population that is getting a significant amount in \nthis formula. No one knows better than the Senator from California how \ndifficult these formula debates are.\n  We all want to get as much as we can. I think that when we are taking \nformulas from some 80 programs and combining them into one formula, \nthat will be the fairest to most States, it obviously is not an easy \ntask.\n  But we made 60 percent of the formula focus on population, which I \nthink is the fairest way to distribute funds among the States. And the \nSenator from California has already pointed out 20 percent is based on \npoverty, 10 percent is based on the number of welfare recipients and 10 \npercent is based on employment.\n  I would also suggest that we are going to be continuing to reduce \nappropriations to each of the various programs. I think combining the \nprograms as we do provides a greater sense of certainty to the States \nabout what they will be receiving. It is also bound to do better under \na single appropriation than trying to split it up among all of the \nother efforts that really do not provide the continuum of planning and \ncertainty that I think is in the work force development legislation.\n  We did decrease the emphasis on welfare recipients because the JOBS \nprogram, which is the job training program for welfare recipients, was \ntaken out of the bill during the welfare debate.\n  Finally, and most importantly, we put a cap on the maximum amount a \nState can gain or lose. It cannot gain more than 5 percent. It cannot \nlose more than 5 percent.\n  California, under this formula, does lose about 4.2 percent. This \nmeans, I think, that we have tried to again provide a balance over the \nprevious year's allocation through the 5-percent provision. That is not \nsuch a dramatic shift that it cannot be accommodated. I certainly \nrealize that some States can be adversely affected. But I believe, all \nin all, that this is the fairest approach that we could devise.\n  It is, as I say, very difficult when we try to get into allocations. \nThe Senator from California represents a State with a large population, \nand many parts of that population really need some significant \nassistance. It would be my hope that with the moneys that presently are \ngoing to California, that this one appropriation will be a far more \neffective means of delivering those funds to the State and provide a \nmore effective job training system.\n\n[[Page S 14873]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I do not know if the Senator from \nCalifornia wishes to respond in any other way to those comments. I will \nbe happy to yield any other time that she might need.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in strong general support for the \nWorkforce Development Act of 1995. I commend the chairman of the Senate \nLabor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Kassebaum, for her \ntireless efforts over the last several years to restructure our \nvocational education and job training systems. Both the chairman and \nthe ranking Democrat of the committee, Senator Kennedy, have made this \nsubject a focal point of the committee's deliberations. I supported \nthis measure in the Labor Committee, and I continue to support the bill \nhere.\n  Of course, I do not agree with everything contained in the bill. It \nis a large undertaking and I do have my disagreements with portions of \nit. Later today I will offer an amendment with Senator Pell to adjust \nthe funding allocation for adult education activities. I may also \nsupport one or more of the other amendments that will be offered to the \nbill. However, I consider myself a strong supporter of this effort, and \nI heartily commend Senator Kassebaum for her unwavering efforts to make \nthis much needed change a reality.\n  Mr. President, I believe this legislation is very badly needed. Let \nme briefly explain why I have reached that conclusion. Since the late \n1960's, the Federal Government has invested huge sums helping people \nfind employment through participation in a myriad of employment and \ntraining programs. From a few limited programs, this effort has now \nballooned today into a confusing maze of over 160 separate programs. \nThe administration of these is scattered across 15 separate Federal \nagencies, with a total cost to the taxpayer of more than $20 billion \nper year. Not surprisingly, Mr. President, these programs are hamstrung \nby duplication, waste and conflicting requirements that too often leave \nprogram trainees no better off than when they started.\n  I am a great believer in job training, and I count the Job Training \nPartnership Act among the legislative achievements of my years in \nCongress. However, the facts that illustrate the problems with our job \ntraining system, and which demonstrate the need for wide ranging \nreform, are not really in dispute. For example, Mr. President, there \nare more than 60 separate programs targeted at the economically \ndisadvantaged. There are 34 literacy programs designed to help that \nsame group. The system has six different standards for defining income \neligibility levels, five for defining family and household income, and \nfive for defining what is included in income.\n  For me, one of the most distressing aspects of this problem is that \nthe system has no effective means of determining whether programs \nreally work. The General Accounting Office has released several reports \non this issue, and its findings have not been encouraging. One GAO \nreport studied 62 programs. Of these, fully half had no means of \nchecking whether participants obtained jobs after training. During the \npast decade, only seven of those programs were ever evaluated to find \nout whether trainees would have achieved the same outcomes without \nFederal assistance.\n  At this point, I need to digress for just a moment to speak about one \nnew effort at self-evaluation undertaken this year. The Department of \nLabor has initiated a longitudinal study aimed at answering the \nquestion whether the Job Corps Program improves the employment \nopportunities and earnings of its participants. I support longitudinal \nstudies and have encouraged their use in connection with job training \nprogram evaluation. However, this particular study, which is being \ndirected by Mathematica Policy Research, has a very ugly underbelly \nthat I want to explore a bit today.\n  This study employs a control group methodology. John A. Burghardt, \ndirector of the Mathematica project, offered this explanation to me in \na September 29 letter responding to my inquiry:\n\n       The National Job Corps Study is based on a random selection \n     process in which approximately 11 out of 12 eligible \n     applicants are selected to enter Job Corps, and 1 out of 12 \n     eligible applicants is selected for a control group. The \n     control group members are not eligible to enroll in Job Corps \n     for a period of three years (but may do so after three years \n     if they are eligible at that time).\n\n  What this means is that a kid can go through the Job Corps \napplication process, qualify, be selected for training, and then be \ntold that he or she cannot enroll for 3 years because we want to see \nhim or her sink or swim as compared to the other applicants who were \nadmitted. This ``twist-in-the-wind'' aspect of the study is \nunconscionable. It may make sense from a social science point of view, \nbut it is inhumane in the extreme.\n  In my State of Vermont, a young man by the name of Donovan De Leon \nhas been caught in the Job Corps study control group. He is \nheartbroken, and his family is in disbelief that he would be asked to \nmake this sacrifice. In essence, they feel that the authorities are \nallowing him to fail in order to demonstrate the success that Job Corps \ncan bring about. They have asked me if there is not another way to \nconduct this study that does not punish the innocent few in this \nfashion. I have to agree with their view, there must be another way.\n  This has just come to my attention and, with the current \nparliamentary situation, I may not be able to do anything to address \nthe issue in the context of this bill. However, I will look for a way \nto take on this study either here or in other legislation. Further, I \nsuspect that many other Senators, who have youngsters like Donovan De \nLeon in their States, will be of like mind.\n  Another problem proving the need for this legislation, Mr. President, \nis the confusion that the patchwork of conflicting programs causes. \nThere are no clear entry points and no clear path from one job training \nprogram to another. The programs targeted for consolidation have \nconflicting eligibility criteria. They apply program incentives that \nare not always compatible with helping individuals find jobs. These \nprogram requirements may encourage staff to assist individuals who are \nthe easiest to serve, rather than the most difficult. There is limited \ncoordination across programs. There is no systematic link between \neducational services and job training services.\n  Providers of employment and training services range from public \ninstitutions of higher education to local education agencies; from \nnonprofit community based organizations to private for-profit \ncorporations. Further, different programs very often target the same \nclient populations. Youth, at-risk youth, veterans, native Americans, \nthe poor and dislocated workers all have many programs designed for \ntheir benefit. Not surprisingly, people have difficulty knowing where \nto begin looking for assistance. As a result, they may go to the wrong \nagency, or worse, give up altogether.\n  Employers also experience problems with the multitude of employment \nprograms. Employers want a system that is easy to access and that \nprovides qualified job candidates. Instead, they must cope with \nsolicitations from over 50 programs that provide job referral and \nplacement assistance to individuals. Often, employers are not even \ninvolved in designing programs that should be responsive to their labor \nmarket needs. There is no clear linkage between economic development \nactivities and employment and training programs to help employers meet \ntheir labor needs. Training programs are a waste of Federal dollars if \nemployers cannot hire newly trained workers because their skills do not \nmatch employer needs.\n  Our principal international competitors do a much better job than we \nhave matching worker training and skills to the needs of their \nindustries and potential employers. The changes initiated in this bill \nare needed to enable us to compete effectively in the international \narena. If employment and training programs are to succeed, a simple, \nintegrated work force development system must be established that gives \nStates, local communities, and employers both the assistance and the \nincentives to train real workers for real jobs. The Workforce \nDevelopment Act takes on the challenge of structuring such a system. It \nwill enable all segments of the work force to obtain the skills \nnecessary to earn wages sufficient to maintain a high quality of \nliving. Further, it will insure a skilled \n\n[[Page S 14874]]\nwork force that can meet the labor market needs of the businesses of \neach State.\n  We are at a defining moment in our Nation's history. The United \nStates is still the most productive country in the world. But we are \nlosing our edge to other industrialized nations such as Japan and \nGermany as well as other rapidly developing countries such as Taiwan, \nKorea, and China. Our enormous Federal trade deficit is testimony to \nour deficiencies. Over the past 25 years, the standard of living for \nthose Americans without at least a 4-year postsecondary degree has \nplunged. This, too, serves as an example of our Nation's declining \nproductivity. In the next decade, we will be surpassed as the world's \nforemost economic power if we do not begin to redefine our priorities \non national, State, and local levels.\n  In response to this problem, education must be a top priority and we \nmust connect education with the workplace.\n  Our international competitors have been leaders in making the \nimportant link between education and work. Germany, for example, has \nlong been a model for vocational education. As early as the sixth \ngrade, students opt for a college-prep or vocational education program. \nIn Germany's vocational education system, students receive extensive \ntraining in industry through collaborations with business along with \npursuit of an academic curriculum.\n  Unfortunately, in the United States, misconceptions about vocational \neducation abound. Some think of voc. ed as a second rate education for \nstudents who could not otherwise succeed on a so-called traditional \nacademic path. Nothing, could be further from the truth. Vocational \neducation courses hold appeal for all students. In my home State of \nVermont, over 4,500 students participate in vocational education \ncourses, of which 12 percent are adults.\n  Another misconception is that there are few similarities among \nFederal vocational education and job training programs. In fact, a \nstrong voc. ed program is the best kind of job training and should be \nviewed as a major step in the lifelong learning process.\n  The Workforce Development Act is a major effort that strongly links \neducation with job training. In addition, it also establishes a very \nstrong linkage between the three levels of government: local, State, \nand Federal. The bill also calls on the private sector to be a major \nparticipant in work force development activities.\n  S. 143, the Workforce Development Act creates a unified system for \nvocational education and job training programs. The Governor and the \nState education agency work together with State and local panels to \ndevise a comprehensive vocational education and job training system \nthat will respond to the needs of all those who seek its services. This \nis already being done in my home state of Vermont through the \nestablishment of work force investment boards. S. 143 will support a \nstrong school-based infrastructure for vocational education of students \nfrom all age groups, and the foundation for a strong and competitive \nwork force.\n  The Workforce Development Act emphasizes the important role business \nmust play in devising vocational education and job training strategies. \nThis past spring, the first detailed American business survey was \nreleased by the U.S. Department of Education. The study found that ``a \n10 percent increase in the educational attainment of a company's work \nforce resulted in an 8.6 percent increase in productivity. Whereas a 10 \npercent increase in the value of capital stock such as tools, \nbuildings, and machinery only resulted in a 3.4 percent increase in \nproductivity.''\n  In the book ``Reinventing Education,'' Louis Gerstner, the chairman \nand CEO of IBM, writes:\n\n       Business . . . [i]s not only a major stakeholder in the \n     issue of education quality, it is the only potential source \n     of major institutional pressure on the system. Without \n     business pressure to improve the schools there will be no one \n     else to act. And if no one acts, the schools will ultimately \n     fail to change and fail to prepare our students and citizens \n     adequately for the next century.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to act today and support S. 143, the Workforce \nDevelopment Act.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Kassebaum and the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources for their work on S. 143, the \nWorkforce Development Act. I support this bill, and commend and thank \nthe distinguished chairwoman for responding to my concerns regarding \nemployment and training programs for veterans and for the disabled.\n  Currently, there are 160 Federal job training programs administered \nby 15 different Federal agencies. This bill will consolidate and \nrestructure these programs into a single block grant that will go \ndirectly to the States with a minimum of Federal requirements. By \neliminating the additional administrative costs of overlapping \nemployment training programs at the Federal, State, and local level, \nthis bill will drastically reduce the $20 billion spent each year to \nfund these programs. The purpose of S. 143 is not to eliminate the \nopportunities provided by these programs, but to maximize their \neffectiveness through reorganization and consolidation.\n  In particular, I am pleased that S. 143 addresses the special needs \nof unemployed individuals with physical or mental disabilities. Under \ntitle I of the Rehabilitation Act, the Vocational Rehabilitation \nProgram has provided special job training to persons with disabilities. \nOf the 160 Federal job training programs, this is the only one that \ntargets the special needs of the disabled. This bill recognizes the \nimportance of training individuals with disabilities by preserving the \nintegrity of the current Vocational Rehabilitation Program. Title I of \nthe Rehabilitation Act will be amended so that vocational \nrehabilitation will be coordinated with the comprehensive workforce \ndevelopment system. A vocational rehabilitation representative will \nparticipate in the overall employment and training efforts for each \nState, providing technical assistance on training individuals with \ndisabilities. By ensuring that the special needs of the disabled are \nmet, S. 143 will strengthen an important service to a valuable element \nof our work force.\n  Another significant feature of this bill relates to veterans \nemployment. This Nation has a long history of providing assistance to \nour veterans, dating back to colonial days. Since World War I, several \nlaws have been enacted to reaffirm and strengthen the Federal \nGovernment's role in promoting wider employment and training \nopportunities for veterans.\n  Currently, the primary programs to assist veterans are those \nadministered by the Department of Labor, through the Veterans' \nEmployment and Training Service [VETS]. These include the Disabled \nVeterans' Outreach Program [DVOP], the Local Veterans' Employment \nRepresentative [LVER], and Veterans Employment Program, which are grant \nprograms to the States.\n  Because of the national interest in veterans' programs, these grant \nprograms will continue in their present form. In addition, the \ncommittee included language in the bill which first, added a veteran \nrepresentative to the State workforce development board; second, added \na veteran representative to the local workforce development boards; \nthird, included veterans in the collaborative process developing a \nState plan; and fourth, designated veterans as a population group for \nbenchmark measurement.\n  These provisions of the bill will ensure that veterans employment and \ntraining programs get the priority and visibility they need at a \nnational level to address the unique concerns of veterans. At the same \ntime, the bill provides that veterans employment and training programs \nwill be integrated into the overall strategy, at the state and local \nlevel, for improving employment and training opportunities.\n  Again, I thank Senator Kassebaum for her excellent work on this bill \nand urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, just to put everyone on notice, there \nwill soon be a vote, as we had suggested earlier. Just so everyone will \nhave a chance to get here in fashion, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n[[Page S 14875]]\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I believe, if I am correct, the \npending vote would be on the Moynihan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I believe we are prepared to vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, would it be agreeable, since we have \nthree votes, that the second and third vote be 10-minute votes?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Yes.

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2889\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, could we have order in the Senate so \nthat the Senator from Ohio could be heard? There is a brief time limit, \nas I understand it, of 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May we have order in the Senate so we can hear the \nSenator from Ohio?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. May we have order in the Chamber?\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I offer this amendment because I think it \nis important we do not overlook displaced homemakers in this bill. What \nthe amendment does is simply incorporate the definition of displaced \nhomemaker in currently found law--the Perkins Act, the Higher Education \nAct, and the Displaced Homemaker Self-Sufficiency Act.\n  In the bill itself, the current language includes displaced \nhomemakers only as a subcategory of dislocated workers. I do not think \nthat is good enough.\n  My amendment, second, clarifies that employment services for \ndisplaced workers are permissible--not required by the States, they are \npermissible. Governors and States have the flexibility to decide \nwhether displaced homemakers will receive employment services at all.\n  Third, my amendment gives States flexibility in providing work force \neducation programs for displaced homemakers and single parents. I think \nthere was some confusion about that earlier in the debate. The Senator \nfrom Kansas pointed out in my amendment there is a requirement that \nStates give some attention to work force education programs for \ndisplaced homemakers. However, States do retain total flexibility.\n  Also, the amendment adds displaced homemakers to the list of \npopulations in the bill for which States need to set or need to require \nperformance benchmarks. I think it is very reasonable. Some 17 million \nAmericans are displaced homemakers.\n  I urge support of this amendment, and I yield the remainder of my \ntime to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support this proposal. If there is any \ngroup of Americans who are left behind it has been the homemakers, and \nthey have to be able to develop the high-level skills needed in order \nto compete in the economy. This does not require an allocation of funds \nby the States, but it does require that the States are going to at \nleast have to give some consideration to this program. I think it is \nwell justified. I hope it is accepted.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, I am also a strong supporter of the \ndisplaced homemaker program, but the amendment of Senator Glenn will \nstart an entirely new program. It will create another set-aside effort \nfor a particular special category. It is an expanded category because \nit substantially distorts the concept of what was thought of as a \ndisplaced homemaker by including anyone with a child aged 16 or younger \nwho has received AFDC assistance.\n  Madam President, I feel strongly that the way we have addressed it in \n\n\n[[Page S 14876]]\nthe bill, by listing it as one of the considerations under dislocated \nworkers, which provides a benchmark but does not require it being set \naside as a special program, is a very important rationale. Otherwise, \nwe get right back into trying to serve a special population. If we do \nserve this one, then why should we not serve that one? This would put \nus right back where we started.\n  I think expanding the definition is a mistake. I think the \nrequirement that it be so defined is a mistake, and I urge opposition \nto the amendment of the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on agreeing to the \namendment offered by the Senator from Ohio. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  Mr. LOTT.

First, we will \nconsider the amendment of Senator Craig, from Idaho, that I believe has \nbeen worked out on both sides.\n  Then we will move to debate the amendment of the Senator from \nMissouri [Mr. Ashcroft] followed by, I believe, an amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm]. Rollcall votes on those two \namendments will occur tomorrow, as well as the disposition of the \namendment of the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] and then there \nwill be final passage.\n  It is my understanding the Senator from Ohio would like to offer a \nfew minutes of comments as in morning business.\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 5 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will not object. How much time does the Senator desire?\n  Mr. GLENN. Not more than 5 minutes for a short eulogy.\n  Mr. CRAIG. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SCHLESINGER\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, the United States lost a wonderful woman \nand we lost a good friend today. Rachel Schlesinger died today in \nArlington, VA, after a long-time struggle against cancer. She was the \nwife, the partner, indeed a wonderful supporter of James Schlesinger, \nwho served in Cabinet positions in three separate administrations for \nthis country. In all the agencies in which her husband served, she was \nuniversally loved.\n  I do not think I ever heard a hint of criticism about Rachel \nSchlesinger in all the years in Washington. She was born in \nSpringfield, OH, in 1930 and grew up on the family farm, which she \nstill owned with her sisters up to the time of her passing. Her \nfather's family had come to southwestern Ohio from Pennsylvania Dutch \ncountry. Her mother's family had migrated from the German Palatinate \nand settled in rural Missouri. Her father was a livestock raiser and so \ncalled himself a dirt farmer who managed to survive the Depression, \nwhich was tough back in those days, of course. Rachel was an \noutstanding student at Springfield High School. She won a scholarship \nto Radcliffe College, which was then a woman's college at Harvard \nUniversity, in 1948. She won honors in American history and literature. \nShe graduated with honors in American history and literature.\n  After college, Rachel moved to New York and became a college editor \nat Mademoiselle magazine, and in 1954, she married Jim Schlesinger, \nwhom she had known since her college years. She became a freelance \nwriter but devoted her time mainly to family life.\n  Over time, they lived in Arlington, MA, Charlottesville, VA, Newport, \nRI, Santa Monica, CA, and Arlington, VA. Jim and Rachel had eight \nchildren: Cora, Charles, Ann, William, Emily, Thomas, Clara, and Jim, \nJr. They all reside in Arlington, save for Charles, who is an engineer \nin Texas, and Ann, who lives with her husband and children in Prague.\n  Rachel had mixed feelings about her husband's Government service, but \nonly rarely did she involve herself in public issues. One such occasion \ndid occur in 1971 when her husband was Chairman of the Atomic Energy \nCommission. The Commission was about to test the warhead for the \nSpartan missile in the Aleutian Islands. There were widespread protests \ndeveloped in this country and overseas primarily associated with the \npeace movement and the environmental movement. It was said that the \nunderground detonation would probably initiate an earthquake and maybe \neven a Sunami wave that would inflict widespread damages throughout the \nPacific.\n  Well, Rachel simply packed up two of her daughters and headed with \nher husband to Amchitka Island, where the test was to take place. The \naction of the family in going to the island quieted much of the alarm \nthat the prospective test had generated.\n  In 1975, she accompanied her husband on an extended trip to Asia. It \nwas the first trip to Japan by a United States Secretary of Defense \nsince World War II. Needless to say, the trip, again, generated very \nwidespread protests, but also an outpouring of support along with it. \nThe trip occurred after the fall of Saigon. Kim Il-Song was uttering \nthreats to overrun South Korea, just as South Vietnam had been overrun. \nAnd in Korea, there was great concern regarding the strength of the \nAmerican commitment. The visit of Mrs. Schlesinger and her husband did \nmuch to reassure the Korean Government and public that American support \nwas steadfast and that North Korea would be given no latitude for \naggressive action.\n  In the 1980's, with her children departing from home, Mrs. \nSchlesinger again became active in local and charitable affairs. She \nwas a very dedicated and accomplished musician. She served as a \nviolinist with the Arlington Symphony Orchestra since 1983 and served \non the board of directors with the symphony since 1987 and on the \nexecutive committee since 1990. She was founder and first chairman of \nthe Ballston Pops, which she originally organized and continued to \norganize each May, and which will soon celebrate its 10th anniversary.\n  Mrs. Schlesinger served on the overseas committee to visit the \nMemorial Church at Harvard. She was deacon of \n\n[[Page S 14877]]\nGeorgetown Presbyterian Church. She also taught and began to raise \nChristmas trees as a business, and even delivered most of these trees \nherself.\n  Despite the glamour of much official life in Washington, Rachel \nalways referred to herself as a country girl. In her later years, she \nbecame more involved in the preservation of historic sites and \nincreasingly the preservation of rural land. So, in addition to her \ncivic and charitable work and her small business, she was very devoted \nto music, to gardening and, of course, her biggest devotion of all was \nto her family.\n  She is survived by Jim, who is a good friend of ours, of course, and \nmany people here, as she was also. She is survived by her eight \nchildren, six grandchildren, and three sisters, Mrs. Ann Kirkwood of \nPrescott, AZ; Janice Lynn of Croton-on-the-Hudson, NY; and Rebecca \nMellinger (Mrs. Jane Engelthanier) of Chicago, IL. She had one sister \nwho preceded her in death, Mrs. Judith Peterson of Upper Arlington, OH.\n  Madam President, I just wanted to get that in today on the same day \non which we lost this very good friend and dedicated American and \nwonderful supporter. I know her family is missing her, and our thoughts \nand prayers go out to them this evening.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/10/senate-section/article/S14876-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14877-S14882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I want to thank the chairman, the Senator \nfrom Kansas, for her help and support in arriving at a final form of \nthe performance measurement amendment that I am offering today. I \nunderstand and I think we heard the chairman just mention that both \nsides have cleared this, and I do appreciate the work of both the chair \nand the ranking member on agreeing to this amendment and working with \nus to get it to the form necessary for that agreement.\n  This amendment embodies a simple, commonsense principle but one that \nis often lacking in many of our Federal programs. I refer to the idea \nthat when we have a program, we should study what we are doing to \ndetermine whether it works and, most importantly, how well it works.\n  This amendment simply would require that each State receiving an \nallotment under section 102 report on how it is performing on State \nbenchmarks and on status and results of evaluations measuring the \nimpact of job training programs on the wages of the individuals \nreceiving the job training services. The need for and the benefits of \nsuch an evaluation process were brought home to me by the outstanding \nwork already being done in this area by the Southwest Idaho Private \nIndustry Council.\n  The folks at the Southwest Idaho PIC have visited with my staff and \nme frequently and have prepared an impressive array of information \nmeasuring the effectiveness of the PIC's programs. Specifically, the \nSouthwest Idaho PIC regularly computes, among other figures, a return \non investment.\n  Now, that is a very unique concept when we think of Federal programs. \nBut this shows various ways that the clients of the PIC are repaying \ntheir entire investment made in their training program. Currently, the \naverage graduate each earns enough, after just 13 months in the work \nforce, to repay in Federal taxes the entire Federal share investment of \nhis or her training.\n  Mr. President, if every federally funded job training provider across \nthe country had to compute a return on investment, or similar measure \nof its performance, based on objective, empirical research data, we \nwould see the best of both worlds. And in Idaho, with the training \nprogram of the Private Industry Council, we are beginning to realize \nthat. More importantly, they are able to fine-tune their program to get \nthe highest yield; and, in this instance, the highest yield very simply \nmeans a better-trained person, who comes to the job market more \nprepared and, as a result, is able to perform not only to their own \nsatisfaction, but in a business sense, it returns to the taxpayer the \nkind of investment all of us strive for in job training programs.\n  We need to build a body of evidence on the true effectiveness of job \ntraining programs. Very few programs have ever been subjected to \nrigorous and scientific evaluation. We have the opportunity, with this \namendment, to debate results, rather than mere hopes.\n  As a Department of Labor report already has pointed out, ``there are \nmany areas where little thorough and reliable evaluation evidence is \navailable.''\n  It is our intent with this amendment to compare the results for \nserved clients with data from control groups--that is, unserved \npersons. Evaluations would be valid and reliable, and conducted through \ncontrolled experiments.\n  I stress the importance of comparing applies with apples--the control \ngroup should be identical to the served group in every way except for \nthe provision of the job training services. This is the essence of \nscientific studies of this sort. Therefore, it is my understanding and \nintent that this amendment require that the demographic characteristics \nin each group be proportional to the characteristics in the other.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their consideration. \nI urge adoption of this very simple and practical amendment.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, I would like to say that we are \nprepared to accept the Craig amendment. I believe it would add an \nadditional measure of accountability to the bill.\n  I am very appreciative of the Senator from Idaho bringing this to the \nattention of the committee. Under the Craig amendment, I think States \nwill conduct ongoing evaluations of their training activities. I think \nthat is enormously beneficial. It was something that was recommended in \nthe Heritage Foundation bulletin as a weakness in the bill that we did \nnot have that evaluation. I think being able to strengthen \naccountability is very important, and I am most appreciative. I think \nit has been agreed to on both sides.\n  Mr. SIMON. Madam President, it is a good amendment. We are pleased to \naccept it on this side.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, I urge adoption of the Craig \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \n\n[[Page S 14878]]\n\n  The amendment (No. 2892) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SIMON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2893 to Amendment No. 2885\n\n (Purpose: To establish a requirement that individuals submit to drug \n  tests, to ensure that applicants and participants make full use of \n      benefits extended through work force employment activities)\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2893 to amendment No. 2885.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 65, between lines 23 and 24, add the following \n     subsection:\n       (i) Limitations on Participants.--\n       (1) Finding.--Congress finds that--\n       (A) the possession, distribution, and use of drugs by \n     participants in workforce employment activities should not be \n     tolerated, and that such use prevents participants from \n     making full use of the benefits extended through such \n     activities at the expense of taxpayers; and\n       (B) applicants and participants should be tested for \n     illegal drug use, in order to maximize the training and \n     assistance provided under this Act.\n       (2) Drug tests.--Each local entity carrying out workforce \n     employment activities described in subparagraph (A), (B), \n     (C), (D), (E), (G), (H), (J), or (K) of subsection (a)(6) \n     shall administer a drug test--\n       (A) on a random basis, to individuals who apply to \n     participate in such activities; and\n       (B) to a participant in such activities, on reasonable \n     suspicion of drug use by the participant.\n       (3) Eligibility of applicants.--In order for such an \n     applicant to be eligible to participate in workforce \n     employment activities, the applicant shall agree to submit to \n     a drug test administered as described in paragraph (2) and, \n     if the test is administered to the applicant, shall pass the \n     test.\n       (4) Eligibility of participants.--In order for such a \n     participant to be eligible to participate in workforce \n     employment activities described in subparagraph (A), (B), \n     (C), (D), (E), (G), (H), (J), or (K) of subsection (a) (6), \n     the individual shall agree to submit to a drug test \n     administered as described in paragraph (2) and, if the test \n     is administered to the participant, shall pass the test. If a \n     participant refuses to submit to the drug test, or fails the \n     drug test, the local entity shall dismiss the participant \n     from participation in the activities.\n       (5) Reapplication.--\n       (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (B), an \n     individual who is an applicant and is disqualified from \n     eligibility under paragraph (3), or who is a participant and \n     is dismissed under paragraph (4), may reapply, not earlier \n     than 6 months after the date of the disqualification or \n     dismissal, to participate in the workforce employment \n     activities described in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), \n     (G), (H), (J), or (K) of subsection (a)(6). If the individual \n     demonstrates that the individual has completed a drug \n     treatment program and passed a drug test within the past 30 \n     days, the individual may participate in such activities, \n     under the same terms and conditions as apply to other \n     applicants and participants, including submission to drug \n     tests administered as described in paragraph (2).\n       (B) Second disqualification or dismissal.--If the \n     individual reapplies to participate in the activities and \n     fails a drug test administered under paragraph (2) by the \n     local entity, while the individual is an applicant or a \n     participant, the local entity shall disqualify the individual \n     from eligibility for, or dismiss the individual from \n     participation in, the workforce employment activities. The \n     individual shall not be eligible to reapply for participation \n     in the activities for 2 years after such disqualification or \n     dismissal.\n       (6) Appeal.--A decision by a local entity to disqualify an \n     individual from eligibility for participation in workforce \n     employment activities under paragraph (3) or (5), or to \n     dismiss a participant as described in paragraph (4) or (5), \n     shall be subject to expeditious appeal in accordance with \n     procedures established by the State in which the local entity \n     is located.\n       (7) Definitions.--As used in this section:\n       (A) Drug.--The term ``drug'' means a controlled substance, \n     as defined in section 102(6) of the Controlled Substance Act \n     (21 U.S.C. 802(6)).\n       (B) Drug test.--The term ``drug test'' means a biochemical \n     drug test carried out by a facility that is approved by the \n     local entity administering the test.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, the training of an appropriate and \nproductive work force is essential to the future of America. We are not \nspeaking this evening about some marginal enterprise. The success and \nsurvival of this society in the next century depends on our ability to \nbe productive and our ability to be competitive in a global marketplace \nwhich, more frequently than not, now requires us to match the \nproductivity of people around the globe. It is important for us, then, \nto do those things which we can to help our work force be the most \ncompetitive and productive work force on the face of the Earth.\n  There are a variety of challenges to productivity and worker success \nin America. One of the challenges which our workers face is the \nchallenge of narcotics and drugs. The National Institute on Drug Abuse \nhas found that illicit drug use costs about $140 billion annually in \nlost productivity, thefts, absenteeism and accidents. It is as if a \n$140 billion tariff were to be placed upon American goods in the world \nmarketplace. It is a cost which must be undertaken, a cost which must \nbe covered. It hurts our ability to compete. It substantially impairs \nour ability to deliver to consumers goods at an appropriate price. And \nit challenges the sense in which this society can be successful, not \nonly in this decade but in the next century.\n  Just to give you an idea, we are debating a bill of $7.8 billion in \nterms of job training, and yet we are talking about $140 billion a year \nthat we find is basically levied against our system because we have the \nproblem of drug abuse in the workplace.\n  The amendment which I have sent to the desk and which I called to the \nattention of the U.S. Senate, for which I urge Senator's serious \nconsideration, is an amendment which would seek to signal very clearly \nthat this Government does not endorse drug use in the marketplace. As a \nmatter of fact, we could not endorse it and make it work. Seventy-seven \npercent of all the companies that hire employees in the United States \ndo drug testing because they know that, as a matter of fact, \nindividuals who are on drugs are not productive, are not capable, do \nnot turn out to be good employees.\n  The Utah Power and Light Co. ran a survey, and they found that \nindividuals who had tested positive on drugs were 77 percent more \nlikely to be fired during their first 3 years of employment.\n  So this challenge to America, the challenge to our productivity, the \nchallenge to our ability to appropriately deploy a resource which is \nscarce--training dollars--is an important challenge, and it is the drug \nchallenge.\n  There are a few facts about drugs in America which are not inspiring, \nbut they are instructive. We began to make progress in the war on \ndrugs. From 1989 to 1992, we were driving down the number of \nindividuals who had used an illicit drug during the last 12 months. \nUnfortunately, since 1992, we have seen that on the uptake and on the \nincrease.\n  We will not be competitive or successful if drug use continues to go \nin this direction. We need, as a Government, as a society, and as a \nculture, to send a signal, to make it a signal which is unmistakably \nclear that individuals cannot contemporaneously be involved in illicit \nnarcotics in the work force and in the achievement of other goals and \ndreams that are common to America.\n  Certainly true in the private sector--77 percent of the firms in the \nprivate sector test for drug use. Even small firms, from 1 to 499 in \nnumber, 62.3 percent of those firms test. Of course, in the large \nfirms, 88 percent test; 88.6 percent of those firms having between \n2,500 jobs and 10,000 jobs test; 88 percent of the firms with over \n10,000 test. It is important to note the categories in which firms do \ndrug testing. Manufacturers--these are the places where people who are \ntrained to work, who go through training programs need to find jobs.\n  Eighty-nine percent of the manufacturers involve themselves in drug \ntesting; 88 percent in transportation; and sales, 71 percent; financial \nservice, only 47 percent.\n  I venture to say that our job training program is not going to be \ntraining mutual fund managers. We are talking about folks who will have \nto find themselves employed in these categories. I think in fairness to \nindividuals who will be looking for jobs in these industries where they \nwill be drug tested, we should say to them, you need to be drug free to \nbe part of the job training program. \n\n[[Page S 14879]]\n\n  We should not allow them to continue along a pathway of mythology \nwhich says you can go ahead and be involved in illicit drugs and still \nbe involved productively in society. You can still get a good job. The \ntruth of the matter is, you cannot.\n  We need to ask ourselves whether we are really being compassionate if \nwe have a program of job training that ignores drug use and suggests \nthat the mythology that you can just waltz along in drug use and get a \njob is reality, or whether we ought to introduce people to the reality \nof the fact if you want a job, you want to be on the payroll, you have \nto be off the drug role. It is that simple.\n  I think these are compelling facts that we do an injustice to a \npopulation of individuals that wants to aspire to and wants to prepare \nfor the work force if we fail to tell them very clearly and \nunmistakably, you cannot have both of these tracks going. It does not \nwork. It is bad national policy.\n  It costs the country $140 billion a year. It will not work for you \npersonally, because 90 percent virtually of the kinds of businesses \nwhere you get jobs will not allow you to come to work without first \ntaking a drug test. I believe it is time for us to say we ought to have \ndrug testing for those who are involved in job training.\n  We need to prepare them at the earliest time possible to understand \nthe reality of the work force. The reality of the work force is you \ncannot be on the payroll if you are on drugs.\n  These numbers, these conditions, I think compel us to a conclusion \nthat we need to have drug testing. I think there are other reasons to \nhave drug testing.\n  We have talked over and over again, we hear people remark how scarce \njob training funds are, how we need more job training funds, how there \nis a population that needs job training but we do not have all of the \nresources to meet the needs.\n  When you have a universe of scarcity, when you have more people \nneeding training than you have funds to train them, you have to decide \nwho you will train. It seems to me you ought to decide to train the \npeople who are most likely to get jobs and most likely to be able to \nkeep those jobs.\n  Now, the amendment which I have sent to the desk and for which I ask \nconsideration and approval is an amendment that says we will train \npeople who are drug free. It is really a way of saying we want to use \nour training funds efficiently. We want to use them effectively. We do \nnot want to spend a lot of money training someone, then sending them to \none of the manufacturers and having them wash them out of the system.\n  I think that is eminently reasonable. I think it is important for us, \nit is fair to the worker to say we need for you to confront reality \nnow. It is fair to America to say we ought to deploy our resource for \ntraining where it is most productive and where it will have a positive \neffect and where it is likely to help someone get a job, instead of \nperpetuating a myth for them until they run into their application \nwhich requires them to be involved in drug testing.\n  Millions of taxpayers' dollars have been wasted on individuals \nexpecting to receive or receiving training but not capable of being \ntrained as they ought to. Can you imagine how difficult it would be to \ntry and train someone who was on drugs? It seems to me that it is \neminently reasonable we ought to say to individuals, if you want a job, \nyou need to get off drugs.\n  Our program ought to make a clear and unmistakable statement. I think \na vote for this amendment is a vote that says we as a country ought to \nsay to individuals honestly and early, you cannot follow both tracks. \nYou cannot follow the drug culture and also the culture of industry.\n  I think we ought to make that clear. It is unfair to them. If you \nvote against drug testing, you vote in favor of saying continue the \ncurrent policy of ignoring drug use. I think ignoring drug use is like \nignoring a cancer on the body of this great Nation. We may be able to \nignore it today but its presence will be felt and it will erode and \nundermine and the canker of it all will make it impossible for us to \nsucceed.\n  I come to say stop suggesting that you can be involved in the drug \nculture and the culture of industry and the work ethic. That is the \nwrong set of values. It is wrong. It is morally wrong to suggest that \nyou can come along, go ahead and get training, you will get a job, send \nthem out to hit this 89, 90 percent of the companies, and then have \nthem rejected, told that the money the taxpayers have spent for their \ntraining is wasted. I think that is morally wrong.\n  I think it is also a bad allocation of public resources. If the \nresources are scarce, train the people for jobs who can benefit from \nthe training. Make a statement to the people who pay their taxes, who \nsend us here to Washington, that we will honor and respect those who \ncare enough about themselves, their families and their futures to be \ndrug free and to seriously deal with job training, and we will prefer \nthem over people who do not care enough about themselves or their \nfamilies to stay off drugs long enough to get job training.\n  I cannot imagine that this body would want to reject this amendment \nand thereby say that we preferred to tell people that we do not have a \npreference between drug use and nondrug use.\n  This bill is not an unreasonable bill. It provides for random drug \ntests. It provides for drug tests on reasonable suspicion. It allows \nindividuals who have failed the drug test to clean up their lives and \nto come back. It allows firms to have greater confidence in graduates \nof drug training programs.\n  It makes the right statement. It says to America we need to be \nproductive. We need to be competitive. We need to be successful. Yes, \nwe need to be compassionate, so compassionate that we will not allow \npeople to sail along in the middle of a myth but we will ask people to \nrespect reality. Early in the program if you want to be involved in \ntraining, you should be drug free.\n  Let me just say this is not novel or new. There are Job Corps \nprograms. Of course, they cost $23,000 a year for full-time people. \nThere are requirements that there be drug training there. I think it is \na good program. I think it is a good requirement. I think it is a \nrequirement that should be extended to other individuals.\n  I believe that this amendment which would provide for this random \ndrug testing would provide for opportunities for individuals to be \npreferred if they were drug free, because it would say to individuals \nif you are not drug free, we will not waste the public's resource on \ntrying to train you for a job you cannot get because of your drug \nhabit.\n  I think this is an amendment which ought to have the approval of the \nU.S. Senate because I believe it carries a strong endorsement of the \npeople of this country. I urge the Members of the Senate to respond \nconstructively and vote in favor of this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMON. Madam President, I respect the sincerity of our new \ncolleague from Missouri. He is dealing with a problem that is \nunquestionably a major problem in our society.\n  I believe his approach is wrong. I want to tell him why I believe his \napproach is wrong.\n  First of all, if you take the logic of what he has to say, then why \ndo we not take all of the citizens of this Nation and just randomly \ntest them for drugs? We do not do that because there is an invasion of \nprivacy that takes place if we do that.\n  We do that for people who are in public safety positions--pilots, \npeople on the railroads, in positions like that.\n  I can recall some years ago when one of our colleagues who is no \nlonger here announced he was going to have everyone in his Senate \noffice tested for drugs. I guess I was around here and happened to be \npresent and I was the next person the reporters could grab hold of and \nthey asked me what I thought.\n  I said I was not going to do that. I related that we did have at one \npoint one employee whose conduct was a little erratic and I had told my \nchief of staff that I wanted to talk to him and insist that he take a \ndrug test or we were going to discharge him, and he quit before we got \nto that point.\n  I would not favor an amendment like this for Senate employees even \nthough this is a hugely important role here. There is a basic privacy.\n  When you talk about people who are unemployed, you are talking about \npeople who face disaster. What about other disaster programs? What \nabout farmers in Missouri and Illinois or \n\n[[Page S 14880]]\nMaine or Kansas who are getting disaster relief?\n  Are we going to test farmers before they get disaster relief? Or, \nwhat about people who, in Missouri and Illinois, receive flood relief? \nWe had a major problem in our two States. That is disaster assistance. \nAre we going to send a signal to the Nation: Sorry, if you cannot pass \na drug test, we are not going to give you flood relief? I do not think \nwe want to go down that road.\n  I am sure any study will show that people who have house mortgages \nunder FHA and have a drug problem are much greater risks. Should we \ntest everyone who wants to get a house mortgage in this country? Again, \nI think we should not go down that road. And I have a few other points, \nand then I am going to have to leave before my colleague even has a \nchance to rebut my arguments here.\n  I have heard a lot of speeches about unfunded mandates on this floor. \nI made a few myself and my guess is maybe the new Senator from Missouri \nhas made a few speeches on unfunded mandates. This is an unfunded \nmandate. It costs about $35 apiece for these tests. And, incidentally--\nmaybe not so incidentally--about 4 percent of the tests are inaccurate. \nSo if we test 500,000 people, 20,000 of those tests--no small number--\nare inaccurate.\n  Do we have a problem? Should we deal with it? You bet. But the House \nof Representatives has just cut 23 percent from drug treatment and \nprevention. That is what we ought to be working on.\n  I visited Cook County jail--9,000 prisoners. I visited with a group \nof prisoners in the minimum security area, about 40 of them, in what is \nlike an old army barracks that I remember. I was going around talking \nto them, and I said to one fellow, ``What can we do to be of help to \nyou?'' He said, ``I want to get into drug treatment.''\n  I turned to the warden and I said, ``How come he cannot get into drug \ntreatment?'' The warden said, ``We have 9,000 prisoners and places for \n200 in drug treatment.''\n  I turned to this room with 40 people and said, ``How many of you \nwould like to get into drug treatment?'' Probably three-quarters of \nthem raised their hands.\n  If the Senator from Missouri wants to increase funding for drug \ntreatment in our country, I will cosponsor the amendment. That is what \nwe ought to do. We ought to do much more along that line.\n  Then, finally, let me just add one other point. Why do people go on \ndrugs? I think there is a variety of reasons, but one factor for a \ngreat many is a lack of hope. What job training does is to give that \nspark of hope to a lot of people who have just given up in our society. \nI do not question for a moment the motivation of the junior Senator \nfrom Missouri. He is dealing with a problem that is very real, and he \nwants to do something to solve it. I want to do something to solve it. \nI do not think this does anything to solve it, and it creates some real \nproblems. So I will, tomorrow when we vote on this, vote against it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I thank my friend from Illinois. I \nreally regret the fact he is leaving, because I would like to have a \nchance to respond. But I understand people leave this Senate very \nfrequently. I would like to address, and I hope he will not be offended \nif I address very specifically, the arguments which he has raised, in \nhis absence. I do not do that because he is leaving in anticipation he \nwill not refute me, but I do it because, though he is leaving, I cannot \ndo it at any other time.\n  Mr. SIMON. I understand.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator raised a number of questions. If we are \ngoing to drug test individuals who are in the job training program, why \nnot drug test farmers in Missouri who get crop subsidies in some way? \nHere are the reasons to drug test individuals. They are going to be \ndrug tested anyway, and the benefit we give them is going to be lost. \nThey are not going to get the jobs. Madam President, 89 percent of the \nmanufacturers are going to say, ``No dice. You are on drugs. You cannot \nwork here.'' We are going to have spent $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, up to \n$20,000, $21,000, $22,000, $23,000 on these individuals and what are \nthey going to do? They are going to run into a brick wall.\n  The idea that somehow it is compassionate to say, ``That is quite all \nright. Just stay with your drugs. Don't worry, we aren't going to test \nyou. Because we are not going to test everybody, we cannot test you.'' \nThese are the folks who are going to run into the wall of tests as soon \nas they try to get jobs. These tests I am recommending are related to \nthe fact we are trying to give them a benefit for purpose of \nemployment. And one of the things that will stop them from enjoying the \nbenefit is the fact they will have to take a drug test.\n  It seems to me it is eminently reasonable that, instead of saying we \nwill spend the $5,000, $10,000, $15,000, $20,000 on your training and \nthen you take the drug test, why do you not take the drug test first? \nWhy do you not make a part of your preparation for the rest of your \nlife, part of the development for the workplace--why do you not make it \nso you move yourself into a drug-free category?\n  No. 2, he said, ``Why do we not do the farmers and the flood relief \npeople,'' as if we pick and choose between farmers and individuals who \nget flood relief. Not so, we do not do it that way. But we do pick and \nchoose. How often has it been said in this debate alone, ``I wish we \nhad more money. I wish we had more training. We need more training.'' \nSo we are picking and choosing, except we are not picking and choosing \nwisely. We have decided we will just ignore the fact that some of the \nindividuals who are in the program have a far lower opportunity to \nsucceed than others. They are people on drugs.\n  Why do we not--since this resource is scarce, since we do not have a \nlot of money, since we have limited resources--why do we not focus it \non people who are likely to succeed? It seems to me that is a question \nthat hardly demands an answer.\n  Then, that is an unfunded mandate; somehow, that this is costly to \nthe States, when you could spend $35 to find out you are not going to \nwaste $5,000, $10,000, $15,000 or $20,000 on people because people will \nlater run into a wall or not have the kind of training for the job for \nwhich they were seeking training. It seems to me this is a classic case \nof the ounce of prevention is better than the pound of cure.\n  They get a pound of cure. They get pounded when they go to ask for a \njob. They ought to have this clear statement made earlier. The Senator \nkindly says, if I would just agree to build drug treatment centers all \nover the country and fund drug treatment, he would be a cosponsor. I \nreally think we ought to be involved in something other than treatment. \nThis is a way for us to say let us prevent this. Let us not try to slam \nthis gate after the horses are gone. Do you know what the success rate \nis for drug treatment centers that are sponsored by the Government? It \nis so low, it is less than 5 percent. It is less than 5 percent. And we \nwant to do that instead of telling people up front they should not be \ninvolved in drugs? It is no wonder what is happening to us is that we \nare seeing this escalation.\n  We need to stop this escalation. We need to say it is time for us to \nwake up to reality. Let us not focus our resources on those who will \nnot be able to benefit from them. Let us not perpetuate the myth that \nthey can be a part of the drug culture and the work culture at the same \ntime, and send them out to have these doors slammed in their faces. \nThat is not compassion. That is not kindness.\n  We are sticking our heads in the sand while they are sticking needles \ninto their arms. We need to be real, and we need to ask them to \nconfront reality.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, I, too, share the comments made by \nthe Senator from Illinois in admiration for the sincerity and \ndedication of the Senator from Missouri in his efforts on this \namendment. We all worry about the problem of drug abuse. Certainly, I \nthink he makes a case, that if we are getting into job training, why \nshould we not make sure during that process that those men and women \nwho are engaged in programs will come out of it stronger and more able \nto be participants in a positive way in the work force?\n  I share the concerns raised about unfunded mandates. I know the \nSenator \n\n[[Page S 14881]]\nfrom Missouri has said we talk about unfunded mandates and we talk \nabout prevention programs. But this mandate becomes part of the \nequation on this that I think we must address. Because I believe it \nrequires mandatory testing, I simply have to oppose the amendment as it \nis offered at this point.\n  Under the legislation, as I understand it, the Governor of each State \nis responsible for administering the job training program. In some \ncases the Governor can contract with the private sector for necessary \nservices. In other cases county officials or community colleges will \nrun the program.\n  Is that correct?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. My understanding is that the local entity, whether it \nis the Governor or whether another institution, would be responsible.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. So the cost of the drug testing for job training \napplicants and participants would be paid for by the State or local \ngovernment, or by the private sector, potentially?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes. If the Senator is inquiring of me under my \namendment, there is no intention on our part to have additional funding \nfrom the Federal Government outside the block grant.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I am assuming that States could take funds to pay for \nthis out of the job training moneys that are in the block grant going \nback to the State?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. That is correct.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Or even vocational education dollars?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. They could match this with resources of their own. The \nbill does not require that any particular funding, of course, be used \nto conduct the drug testing.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, I tend to believe the costs will be \nsubstantial. Local drug testing labs charge between $22 and $50 per \ntest, with an additional $5 to $8 for a doctor to review the test to \neliminate any false positives. If we have one-half million to 1 million \nindividuals in job training programs, the total cost of drug testing \ncould run into millions of dollars. We could also say this will be well \nworth the effort because we will be able, hopefully, to provide some \nassistance to those who are in job training.\n  Perhaps I did not understand the Senator from Missouri correctly. Did \nhe say he did not think they should then be in a prevention program?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. No. We do not specify what can happen. We just say that \nthey are eligible to apply again for participation, and, if they can \napply and demonstrate that they are drug free, then they are eligible \nfor participation. So there is no continuing prejudice as a result of a \nsingle negative drug test. The multiple drug test amendment provides \nthat after several drug tests, all of which are positive, the person \nhas to wait for about a 2-year period before coming in to ask again for \nan application in the program.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I think that anybody who would be in testing would \nhave to be a participant in some type of treatment program. It seems to \nme that this becomes a part of the process that would be necessary. I \nreally feel that we are adding a significant burden.\n  I know it is of concern to the Governors. I received a letter from \nGovernor Engler of Michigan and Governor Branstad of Iowa, \nrespectively. They say that they write to share their concerns \nregarding the mandate of drug testing of job training participants. If \nI may quote the letter:\n\n       In keeping with the principles adopted by the Republican \n     Governors Association, we believe it is imperative for the \n     States to have the maximum flexibility and freedom from \n     mandates. If States want to use drug testing as a screening \n     mechanism, then States should have the ability to do so. \n     However, to make this a national policy is overprescriptive \n     and holds serious cost implications in this time of budget \n     cutback. We appreciate the concerns for our views and \n     encourage you to oppose efforts that would mandate this \n     effort.\n\n  The Senator from Missouri mentioned the Job Corps program. This is \nthe one program where they have had a zero tolerance policy. There have \nbeen major drug problems in some of the Job Corps centers. I think it \nis a real tragedy. Again, this is the place where they should be making \nsure that any drug trafficking and any use of drugs be closely \nmonitored and not be tolerated. They are beginning to make some inroads \ntoward this goal.\n  But I can appreciate very much what the Senator is trying to say, \nthat if they have this problem, what good will job training do if they \ncannot come to recognize that the problem needs to be corrected?\n  I would suggest to the Senator from Missouri that he consider \nmodifying his amendment to make it voluntary and limit it to voluntary, \nreasonable-cause testing. It seems to me that we state then that it is \nsomething that is very important to us, encourage it be voluntary, and \nhope that the States and employers would join forces in making that a \nmajor effort. But I myself could not support the amendment as long as \nit is not mandatory for the various reasons that the Senator from \nIllinois outlined as well.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, let me just address these issues. And \nI thank the Senator from Kansas. I particularly thank her for providing \nme the opportunity to offer this amendment.\n  First of all, as it relates to whether or not this is a mandate, we \nare sending Federal money--$7.8 billion--in block grants. That money \ncan be used to conduct the test. That is not an unfunded mandate. It is \nan opportunity to deploy the money that the Federal Government invests \nwisely. To take a $35 test and decide we are not going to spend $2,000 \nor $5,000 or $10,000 on someone who is going to fail a drug test when \nthey go out to get a job--you can call it a Federal mandate, if you \nwant, but any condition at all in the law, I guess, is called a Federal \nmandate. But the funding is in this bill.\n  I am delighted that the Republican Governors have written about \nmandates. But there are lots of other conditions in this bill. I would \nbe most pleased to agree with the chairman that we would take all of \nthe mandates out of this bill, but I would withdraw all of the \nconditions, and I would withdraw these conditions.\n  I hope she will submit the letters of the Republican Governors for \nthe Record so that they can be clear about the fact that all of the \nother things in the bill that they objected to are not really less \nonerous. Many of them are far more onerous than this particular idea. \nThe Job Corps obviously is the tough area. It is a residential program. \nIt costs a lot of money. It takes the toughest cases, and in those \ntoughest cases that is where they have problems with drugs more \nfrequently than others. But they have recognized that it is \ninappropriate to spend this kind of resource and expect, having spent \nthe kind of resource, to get good results unless we get people to be \ndrug free. Because they have some failures does not mean that they \nshould not do it. As a matter of fact, if they did not do drug testing, \nwe would never know about the problem. People would just whistle \nthrough the program taking their drugs, and then hitting the wall when \nthey go to apply for work. That is what we are really setting up as the \nway of handling this.\n  Two last points: First, this is a very generous amendment which \nsuggests to the States that they do not have to have a specific program \nof testing. It says they have to develop a program, and it can be a \nrandom testing program.\n  It leaves it up to the States as to how to shape it, how often to \nhave it, what numbers involved in the program. It does not say they \nhave to do 10 per 1,000. It does not say they have to do 50 per 1,000. \nIt says use your good judgment. It says to the States use your good \njudgment, but in spending this Federal resource find a way not to spend \nit so as to waste it, and do not lead people to believe they are on a \ntrack for a job when they are going to hit a wall of employers who say \nthey are going to have to be tested.\n  The last point. The bill does provide that in addition to the random \napproach that Governors are allowed to select, there is a reasonable \nsuspicion test that can be used in the program. So we are very close to \nwhat the chairman has suggested as a compromise. We do require that a \nState would set up a random testing program to be determined by the \nState. We also allow the States to participate in a reasonable \nsuspicion imposition of a test.\n  I believe we should stop suggesting it is unimportant whether or not \npeople who seek training are on drugs. We must make a statement to \nthem. We must allocate our resource effectively, \n\n[[Page S 14882]]\nand that means we should stop devoting resource to those who are on \ndrugs and begin to focus the resource on those who care enough to be \nready to go on the payroll by being off drugs.\n  I thank the Senator, and I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, if I may just make one further \ncomment. Of the $7.2 billion in the block grant, 25 percent is \nvocational education, potentially even more, 25 percent, as the Senator \nfrom Missouri knows, is job training, and 50 percent is the flex \naccount which the Governors can use for either vocational education or \nthe job services section.\n  We tried hard to keep mandates as limited as possible. We do plan \nthat the States have one-stop service centers rather than several \nduplicative job service outlets because we have found from experience \nthat it is far better to have all that information in one place than a \nnumber of places.\n  Mandates do creep into the legislation. It is not just turning the \nmoney over to the States but it includes, hopefully, enough flexibility \nthat the Governors and the business community and the participants in \neither education or job training can design the programs to best fit \ntheir communities.\n  I am very supportive of the efforts behind the amendment proposed by \nSenator Ashcroft. I only wish that I did not feel it was going to be \noverly prescriptive to the extent that it could potentially reduce the \nmoneys which have become limited for both education and training.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, if the Senator from Missouri is \nfinished, I would suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the call of the quorum be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/10/senate-section/article/S14877-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM.

The Second Supplementary Agreement, signed at Bonn on \nMarch 6, 1995, is intended to modify certain provisions of the original \nUnited States-Germany Social Security Agreement, signed January 7, \n1976, which was amended once before by the Supplementary Agreement of \nOctober 2, 1986.\n  The United States-Germany Social Security Agreement is similar in \nobjective to the social security agreements with Austria, Belgium, \nCanada, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The \nNetherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the \nUnited Kingdom. Such bilateral agreements provide for limited \ncoordination between the United States and foreign social security \nsystems to eliminate dual social security coverage and taxation, and to \nhelp prevent the loss of benefit protection that can occur when workers \ndivide their careers between two countries.\n  The present Second Supplementary Agreement, which would further amend \nthe 1976 Agreement to update and clarify several of its provisions, is \nnecessitated by changes that have occurred in U.S. and German law in \nrecent years. Among other things, it would extend to U.S. residents the \nadvantages of recent German Social Security legislation that allows \ncertain ethnic German Jews from Eastern Europe to receive German \nbenefits based on their Social Security coverage in their former \nhomelands.\n  The United States-Germany Social Security Agreement, as amended, \nwould continue to contain all provisions mandated by section 233 and \nother provisions that I deem appropriate to carry out the provisions of \nsection 233, pursuant to section 233 (c)(4) of the Act.\n  I also transmit for the information of the Congress a report prepared \nby the Social Security Administration explaining the key points of the \nSecond Supplementary Agreement, along with a paragraph-by-paragraph \nexplanation of the effect of the amendments on the principal agreement \nand the related administrative arrangement. Annexed to this report is \nthe report required by section 233(e)(1) of the Act on the effect of \nthe agreement on income and expenditures of the U.S. Social Security \nprogram and the number of individuals affected by the agreement. The \nDepartment of State and the Social Security Administration have \nrecommended the Second Supplementary Agreement and related documents to \nme.\n  I commend the United States-Germany Second Supplementary Social \nSecurity Agreement and related documents.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to bring \nopportunity to small business and taxpayers; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n    THE BRINGING OPPORTUNITY TO OUR SMALL BUSINESS AND TAXPAYERS ACT\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, on December 27, 1994, while in Arkansas \nover the last Christmas holiday, I announced one of the most important \nlegislative initiatives for the 104th Congress. I call it, Bringing \nOpportunity to Our Small Businesses and Taxpayers--or BOOST.\n  BOOST is a five-point initiative that addresses problems faced by \neveryday individual taxpayers, small businesses, and family farms.\n  Madam President, BOOST delivers a much-needed dose of fairness to \nsmall taxpayers, and it provides a clear path toward capitalizing on \ntwo of our country's greatest assets--small business and the family \nfarm.\n  Over these past 9 months, I have worked with my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to introduce the five bills which make up the BOOST \npackage. Today, I am introducing these five important bills as a \ncombined package. I believe this is important because it represents a \ncollective vision for helping small business and the average individual \ntaxpayer--one which we can do quickly with bipartisan support while \ncausing very little drain, if any, or the Federal budget.\n  We can act quickly because the Finance Committee will meet this week \nto consider tax legislation as part of the budget reconciliation \npackage which will soon come to the Senate floor. Madam President, the \nissues raised by the BOOST package are not politically charged, in \nfact, they are all issues that can pull us together.\n  The five bills I am referring to are as follows:\n  First, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights II, S. 258, introduced by Senator \nGrassley and myself;\n  Second, a bill to make the 100 percent health care deduction for the \nself-employed, S. 262, introduced by Senator Grassley, Senator Roth, \nand myself;\n  Third, the S Corporation Reform Act of 1995, S. 758, introduced by \nSenator Hatch and myself;\n  Fourth, the Pension Simplification Act of 1995, S. 1006, introduced \nby Senator Hatch and myself; and\n\n[[Page S 14884]]\n\n  Fifth, the American Family-Owned Business Act of 1995, S. 1086, \nintroduced by Senator Dole and myself.\n  Madam President, each of these bills enjoys a broad base of support \nfrom small business and agriculture organizations; each has a balanced \ncosponsor list of both Republican and Democratic Senators; and each has \nbeen introduced in the House of Representatives with similar strong \nbipartisan support.\n  The bills have three primary goals.\n  The first is to create capital formation opportunities for American \nsmall business owners and their employees. The resulting payoff will be \nmore jobs created in a sector that already creates over one-half of all \nnew jobs in our country.\n  The second is to simplify the rules that small businesses must comply \nwith in dealing with the Internal Revenue Service, resulting in reduced \ncost to small business whose resources may be better spent on business \nexpansion and their employees' retirement savings.\n  And third, a very important goal of the BOOST package is to safeguard \nthe rights of smaller taxpayers in their dealings with the IRS. The \ngoal: to inspire greater taxpayer confidence in our tax system by \nmaking it more fair and more accountable.\n  Of course, these are all goals that every one of us can support in \nprinciple. But it is important to point out that BOOST is more than \njust a set of worthy goals. It is an actual nuts and bolts proposal \nwhich has attracted strong and broad bipartisan support. And even more \nthan that, it carries only a modest revenue cost in times when it is \nvery difficult to act in light of our Federal budget deficit.\n  Madam President, the enactment of BOOST will send a message that \nCongress can work together to achieve practical solutions to the very \nreal problems faced by American small business and the individual \nAmerican taxpayer. I hope we can enact this legislation very soon and \nsend this message.\n  Madam President, I do want to comment on each of the five-points of \nthe BOOST package.\n\n\n                       taxpayer bill of rights ii\n\n  On January 23 of this year, Senator Grassley and I came to the Senate \nfloor and introduced the Taxpayer Bill of Rights II, along with 20 \ncosponsors--12 Democrats and 8 Republicans. The Taxpayer Bill of Rights \nII builds on the foundation laid by the original Taxpayer Bill of \nRights passed in 1988 and is the next natural step in requiring the IRS \nachieve higher standards of accuracy, timeliness and fair play in \nproviding taxpayer service.\n  The Taxpayer Bill of Rights II achieves these new standards through \n27 provisions, including:\n  First, expanding the authority of the Taxpayer Advocate to prevent \nhardships on taxpayers.\n  Second, requiring the IRS to abate interest when it has made an \nunreasonable error or delay, and enable the courts the power to review \nthe interest abatement determination.\n  Third, strengthen the code so a taxpayer can recover out-of-pocket \ncosts incurred in a case in which the IRS position was not \nsubstantially justified.\n  Finally, prohibit the IRS from issuing retroactive proposed \nregulations.\n  Madam President, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights II contains many more \ncommonsense provisions designed to safeguard the rights of taxpayers \nand instill some confidence into our system of taxation.\n  Madam President, I would like to point out that the Taxpayer Bill of \nRights II was passed twice in 1992 but was vetoed because it was \nincluded as part of two large tax bills with which President Bush did \nnot agree. I believe the time is now to enact this legislation, and I \nam committed to work along with my friend Senator Grassley to push the \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights II into law.\n\n\n                100 Percent Deduction for Self-Employed\n\n  The next important piece of the BOOST package is a bill, introduced \nby Senator Grassley, Senator Roth, and myself to make the health \ninsurance premiums for the self-employed 100 percent deductible.\n  Earlier this year, the Congress passed, and the President signed into \nlaw, H.R. 831 which restored the 25 percent care deduction in 1994, \nincreased the deduction to 30 percent for 1995, and permanently \nextended the 30 percent deduction for all years in the future. This was \nan important and positive step. The fact that the Senate could move \nsuch a tax bill without amendment underscored the widespread bipartisan \nsupport and importance of this effort.\n  It is now important to take the next step of making health insurance \npremiums 100 percent deductible for the self-employed.\n  Madam President, large corporations now enjoy a 100 percent \ndeduction, and on top of this, they typically pay smaller insurance \npremiums because they have a larger number of employees.\n  So, the self-employed pay higher insurance premiums, and to compound \nit, they can only take a 30 percent tax deduction for premiums paid--a \ndouble penalty. These over 9 million self-employed small businessmen \nand women are innovators and job creators--people we should encourage, \nnot penalize. That is why BOOST contains this important provision to \nmake the deduction 100 percent.\n\n\n                  the s corporation reform act of 1995\n\n  On May 4, 1995, my friend and colleague, Senator Hatch, and I \nintroduced the S Corporation Reform Act of 1995, S. 758.\n  The bill is endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National \nFederation of Independent Business, the American Institute of Certified \nPublic Accountants, and the members of the S Corporation Subcommittee \nof the American Bar Association. Today, we have 32 Senate cosponsors--\n12 Democrats and 20 Republicans.\n  As you can tell, this legislation is the culmination of the efforts \nof many, and certainly represents a step Congress can and should take \nin order to capitalize on one of our country's most valuable \nresources--small business.\n  Today, close to 2 million U.S. businesses are S Corporations, and \nthese businesses are still subject to many of the oppressive restraints \nwhich date back to its original enactment in 1958.\n  Madam President, it goes without saying that times have changed since \n1958. The financial environment is far more complex, and the 1950's Sub \nS limitations restrict growth opportunities. Frankly, Sub S needs an \noverhaul.\n  This legislation is the overhaul we need. It is an overhaul that is \ndoable. And it is an overhaul that can give a boost to our economic \nrecovery by creating more opportunities for capital growth and jobs in \nour country.\n\n\n               Pension Simplification for Small business\n\n  On June 30, 1995, Senator Hatch and I introduced the Pension \nSimplification Act of 1995. This legislation contains provisions that \ntarget complex and costly rules effecting pension plans offered by \nsmall businesses--and there is a very good reason for this action.\n  In 1993, 83 percent of companies with 100 or more employees offered \nsome type of retirement plan. In contrast, in businesses with less than \n25 employees, only 19.6 percent of these employees had an employer-\nprovided pension plan available to them, and only 15 percent of these \nemployees participated in the plan.\n  A major factor contributing to this dismal statistic is the sky-high \nper-participant cost of establishing and maintaining a pension plan for \nsmall business. This legislation alleviates the high cost barriers for \nsmall business by creating a tax credit which can be applied toward the \nstart-up costs of providing a new plan for employers with 50 or fewer \nemployees.\n  Next, the bill slashes extensive annual nondiscrimination testing \nrequirements for firms where no employee is highly compensated. These \ntwo provisions alone will significantly reduce the cost of starting up \nand maintaining a retirement plan for employers of small business. With \nthese barriers lowered, we will be encouraging retirement savings for \nour Nation's small business worker.\n\n\n                   american family-owned business act\n\n  The fifth point of BOOST was introduced on July 28, 1995, by Senator \nDole and myself--we call it the American Family-Owned Business Act.\n  Madam President, the impact of the estate tax on a family-owned \nbusiness is devastating because of one simple fact--the rates are too \nhigh. The rates reach 55 percent of the value of an estate very \nquickly, and the tax bill comes due abruptly on the death of a loved \none who also happens to be an invaluable asset to the family business.\n\n[[Page S 14885]]\n\n  For families whose major asset is its business, many times these \nenterprises are literally forced out of business because of the \nimposition of the estate tax. The effect is a disruption in not only \nthe family's life but the lives of the employees of the business and \nthe community that depends on or enjoys the goods or services provided \nby the business.\n  Contrast this scenario with the little to no impact the estate tax \nhas on widely held businesses and you discover a disturbing reality in \nour current tax code--we place closely-held, family-owned businesses at \na significant disadvantage when compared to widely held businesses.\n  Senator Dole and I introduced the American Family-Owned Business Act \nwith 44 cosponsors. Virtually every small business and agriculture \norganization in America has endorsed this bill. It carefully targets \nestate tax relief to family businesses whose major asset is its \nbusiness and whose family members will materially participate in the \nbusiness for years to come.\n  The message of the American Family-Owned Business Act is that we will \ntreat family businesses more fairly, and in doing so, we will foster an \nenvironment which encourages family entrepreneurship. I am proud to \nwork with the Majority Leader on this effort and I look forward to its \npassage.\n\n\n                                pay-for\n\n  Madam President, although BOOST package has only a moderate cost to \nthe Federal Treasury, I do believe we must pay for these tax code \nreforms through cuts in spending.\n  I propose to pay for these important reforms from the provisions from \nmy bill, S. 573, the Spending Reductions Act of 1996, which would save \n$5.374 billion in fiscal year 1996.\n  In order to achieve these savings, I first proposed a modest \nreduction in the Government's spending on Federal contractors. This is \na broad topic I have focused on for over 14 years. But today, I am not \nproposing to address all of the problems involved with the Federal \nGovernment's extensive reliance on contractors and consultants. I \nsimply want to address the concern expressed by the voters in the 1992 \nand 1994 elections to shrink the size of Government.\n  The Congress only acted half-way in responding to this message when \nit voted to cut the number of Federal employees by 12 percent, because \nCongress has yet to order a corresponding reduction in the contractor \nwork force. This contractor work force has been growing at a rapid rate \nover the past 10 years, while at the same time, the number of Federal \nworkers has actually declined. In the early 1980's, the Federal \nGovernment spent roughly $40 billion on service contracts. Last year, \nin fiscal year 1994, the Federal Government spent $110 billion on \nservice contracts. My proposal is to reduce this amount for 1996, a \nmodest 4.5 percent.\n  Madam President, this reduction will still permit agencies to get \ntheir work done, but it will also reduce some of the waste that comes \nfrom too much money being spent without adequate oversight. For \nexample, at my request, the inspector general at the Pentagon has been \nlooking at some contracts awarded by the star wars program. Listen to \nsome of the problems they found with the three contracts they audited:\n  First, cost overruns on the contracts totalled $3.1 million.\n  Second, the contractor awarded prohibited subcontracts worth several \nmillion dollars.\n  Third, one contractor charged the Government for 588 hours of work \nthat it did not actually perform.\n  I believe a reduction in spending, as I have proposed, will force \nagencies to spend money more wisely and eliminate such waste.\n  My next spending cut proposal will reduce spending on Federally \nFunded Research and Development Centers [FFRDC's] at the Department of \nDefense. FFRDC's, like Mitre, Rand, and the Center for Naval Analysis \nare contractors who work solely for the Federal Government. While these \ncontractors perform some valuable service, I believe it is appropriate \nto cut back a modest amount on these in-house consulting companies, as \nwe have on the Federal work force and as I am proposing on service \ncontracts.\n  Madam President, our taxpayers should not continue being billed for \nthe very high salaries and overhead being charged by these Government-\nrun consulting firms. For example, the head of Aerospace made $230,000 \nin 1991 and $265,000 in 1992. I have no idea what they made in 1993 and \n1994, but I imagine the increase has been alarming. This in-house \nGovernment contractor was making more than the President of the United \nStates. My proposal would reduce spending on FFRDC's by $162.7 million \nfrom the amount authorized by the Department of Defense authorization \nbill. This would still leave over $1 billion for these companies.\n  Madam President, my final proposal to reduce spending involves an \nissue that I have worked on for a number of years--the export of arms \nto countries around the world. I am not proud of the fact that the \nUnited States is the leading arms exporter. We sell 53 percent of all \nthe arms in international trade. However, my proposal is not targeted \nat totally reforming this arms trade, that is a battle for the future. \nI simply propose that we reduce the spending in our foreign military \nfinancing program by $271.5 million from the total budget of $3.7 \nbillion.\n  Taken together, these spending reductions amount to over $5 billion \nin 1996. It is more than enough to cover the costs of the BOOST package \nfor this year and to give the small family owned business and the \nfamily farmers a real break that they justly deserve.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  In conclusion, I would just like to say that--while some in \nWashington are consumed with passing or blocking the huge tax cuts \nreported on the front page of every newspaper, we, in Congress, should \nall be concerned with the practical, commonsense, and relatively \ninexpensive changes that will help the American taxpayer believe that \nGovernment can work for, not against, them. Also, to allow and to \nencourage those entrepreneurs to create jobs for people who will be \npaying taxes and who will be boosting our local communities.\n  Our program, the BOOST program, is such a change. It offers an \nopportunity. It gives people a chance, it should give people hope where \nhope has not been present. It reaffirms a commitment to fairness for \nsmall taxpayers and capitalizes on one of our country's greatest \nassets--small business and the family farm.\n  I am urging, Madam President, my colleagues to join me in supporting \nBOOST to be included in any tax legislation sent from this Senate. \nMadam President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and a \nbrief summary be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1299\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2 (T2). Laws ensuring the IRS \n     treats taxpayers with respect are the key to making our tax \n     system work. The original Taxpayer Bill of Rights, enacted in \n     1988, took the first step in the battle to achieve this goal. \n     T2 is the next natural step toward requiring the IRS to meet \n     new standards of timeliness, accuracy, and accountability.\n       2. 100% Health Care Deduction for Self-Employed. Today, \n     large corporations may deduct 100% of the cost of their \n     employees' health care premiums while the self-employed may \n     deduct only 30% of their health insurance costs. There is no \n     reason for treating self-employed workers differently than \n     large corporations. BOOST provides a 75% deduction in 1996 \n     and a permanent 100% deduction for 1997 and thereafter for \n     the self-employed.\n       3. S Corporation Reform Act. In 1958, S Corporations were \n     first created in the tax law to help small U.S. companies. \n     The S corp rules have been extremely helpful to small \n     businesses. Today, close to $2 million U.S. companies are S \n     Corps. However, as written in 1958, S corps are very limited \n     and operating as an S corp contains many pitfalls. The S \n     Corporation Reform Act overhauls these outdated rules so \n     small business can better compete in today's financial \n     environment.\n       4. Small Businesses Pensions. In businesses with less than \n     25 employees, only 19.6% of the employees have any employer \n     provided pension available, and only 15% of these employees \n     participated in the plan. A major contributing factor to this \n     dismal statistic is the sky-high cost of establishing and \n     maintaining a pension plan for a small business. BOOST \n     provides a maximum $1000 tax credit for the start-up costs of \n     providing a new plan for employers with 50 or fewer \n     employees, and it slashes annual nondiscrimination testing \n     requirements for firms where no employee is highly \n     compensated. Thus, BOOST alleviates high cost barriers for \n     small businesses wishing to provide employees a pension.\n       5. American Family-Owned Business Act. The impact of the \n     estate tax on a family-owned business is devastating because \n     of one simple fact--the rates are too high. On top of this, \n     the tax bill oftentimes comes due abruptly and at a time when \n     the business has lost one of its key assets. The tremendous \n     financial strain causes many family-owned businesses to \n     close. The effect is that jobs are lost, and the community \n     loses the goods and/or services provided by the business. The \n     American Family-Owned Business Act carefully targets estate \n     tax relief to estates whose major asset is its business and \n     whose family members will materially participate in the \n     business in the coming years.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BREAUX:\n  S. 1300. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nsimplify the method of payment of taxes on distilled spirits; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n      the distilled spirits tax payment simplification act of 1995\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I introduce the Distilled Spirits \nTax Payment Simplification Act of 1995, a bill more readily known as \nall-in-bond. The bill would streamline the way in which the Government \ncollects the Federal excise tax on distilled spirits by extending the \ncurrent system of collection now applicable only to imported products \nto domestic products as well.\n  Today wholesalers purchase foreign bottled distilled spirits in \nbond--tax-free--paying the Federal excise tax directly after sale to a \nretailer. In contrast, when the wholesaler buys domestically bottled \nspirits--nearly 86 percent of total inventory--the price includes the \nFederal excise tax, prepaid by the distiller. This means that hundreds \nof U.S. family owned wholesale businesses increase their inventory \ncarrying costs by 40 percent when buying U.S. products, which must be \nfinanced through borrowing.\n  Under my bill, wholesalers would be allowed to purchase domestically \nbottled distilled spirits in-bond from distillers just as they are now \npermitted to purchase foreign produced spirits. Products would become \nsubject to tax on removal from the wholesale premises. Additionally, \nthe Federal tax collection process would be simplified by providing \nthat only one Federal agency collect the tax.\n  All-in-bond is an equitable and sound way in which to remove the \nburden of prepayment of the Federal excise tax on domestically bottled \nspirits while streamlining our tax collection system. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in cosponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 1301. A bill to amend the Goals 2000: Educate America Act to \neliminate the National Education Standards and Improvement Council and \nrequirements concerning opportunity-to-learn standards, to limit the \nauthority of the Secretary of Education to review and approve State \nplans, to permit certain local educational agencies to receive funding \ndirectly from the Secretary of Education, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                         goals 2000 legislation\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, back in 1983, when President Reagan's \nEducation Secretary, Terrell Bell, issued that now-famous report on the \nproblems of education in this country he called that report ``A Nation \nat Risk.'' Not a school district at risk. Not a State at risk. But a \nnation at risk.\n  Recognizing the need to improve educational achievement of this \nNation's children, Governors of both parties launched a program to \nraise the achievement standards in American schools and a national \neducation goals effort was embraced at the 1989 education summit in \nCharlottesville.\n  That effort culminated early last year, when a bipartisan majority in \nCongress voted to approve Goals 2000 legislation. That legislation \nsupports development of model national academic standards in 13 \nsubjects, standards that any school district may use as guides.\n  The Goals 2000 legislation also authorizes grants to States to help \nreform their schools so they can achieve their education goals. \nParticipating States must develop challenging State content and \nperformance standards and assessments aligned with those standards.\n  Since the passage of Goals 2000, 48 States have applied for and \nreceived funding. Two States, Virginia and New Hampshire, have refused \nthe funds and have taken issue with the intent of Goals 2000, citing \nfears of Federal intrusion. A third State, Montana, has declined to \nreceive 2d year funding; and a fourth State, Alabama, announced last \nweek that it was ending its participation. In addition, a number of \norganizations have leveled a wide assortment of charges against Goals \n2000.\n  Some say the legislation usurps State and local control over \neducation. Others say it does no such thing and represents \nunprecedented flexibility in Federal legislation.\n  All of the concerns expressed, however, ultimately focus on what is \nthe most appropriate and effective Federal role in elementary and \nsecondary education.\n  By way of background and to help put this in context, let me review a \nfew facts.\n  States now contribute about 36 percent of the cost of running our \nschools; local agencies contribute 26 percent, and private institutions \naccount for 30 percent. The Federal Government's financial stake \namounts to less than 10 percent.\n  If one agrees with the old adage that money is power, then it appears \nthat the principal responsibility for running our schools continues to \nrest with the States and with local communities.\n\n[[Page S 14899]]\n\n\n  Where the Federal Government has traditionally played an important \nrole is in helping to build partnerships among States, communities, and \nprivate institutions; and in helping to disseminate information on what \nworks in one part of the country to others which may be struggling with \nthe same problem. In that regard, I have always believed that the \nFederal Government can play an important part in helping to ensure a \ndegree of fairness and equity for all our children.\n  The Labor, Health, and Human Services and Education Subcommittee \nwhich I chair recently held a hearing on the Goals 2000 issue. To help \nus better understand the controversy surrounding goals, the \nsubcommittee heard from two witnesses.\n  Our first witness was Education Secretary Richard Riley, who \ntestified in support of the Goals 2000 legislation and the \nadministration's request of $750 million for fiscal year 1996.\n  Our second witness was Mr. Ovide Lamontagne, who chairs the New \nHampshire State Board of Education. Specifically, Mr. Lamontagne raised \nconcerns about the Secretary of Education's ability to review and \napprove a State's plan for its entire educational system, which he \nconsidered unprecedented. After much discussion with Mr. Lamontagne and \nSecretary Riley, the Secretary seemed to think he could live without \nthat provision. Mr. Lamontagne also stated that eliminating secretarial \nreview and approval would go a long way toward improving the \nlegislation.\n  We also addressed the issue of school districts receiving funds \ndirectly from the Secretary, if their States chose not to participate \nin Goals 2000. In addition, discussions were held concerning the \nNational Education Standards and Improvement Council [NESIC] and both \nthe Secretary and Mr. Lamontagne agreed that eliminating the Council \nwould be desirable.\n  The legislation which I am introducing today addresses the concerns \nof States that have chosen not to participate in Goals 2000. \nSpecifically, the legislation:\n  Permits school districts, in States that elect not to participate in \nthe Goals 2000 Program, to apply directly to the Secretary of Education \nfor Goals 2000 funding.\n  Eliminates the requirement that States submit their plans to the \nSecretary of Education.\n  Removes the authority of the Secretary of Education to review and \napprove State plans.\n  Deletes the requirements for the composition of State and local \npanels that develop State and local improvement plans.\n  Eliminates the National Education Standards and Improvement Council \n[NESIC], which was to certify national and State standards, and which \nsome viewed as a national school board.\n  Removes the requirement for States to develop opportunity-to-learn \nstandards. These standards would specify the educational resources--\nsuch as funding, facilities, and materials--deemed necessary for local \nschools to achieve State or national content and performance standards.\n  It is my hope that this legislation will improve Goals 2000 so that \nall States will feel they are able to participate in this important \nprogram because it strikes the proper balance between State and local \nresponsibility for education and Federal leadership.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Ms. MIKULSKI:\n  S. 1302. A bill to restore competitiveness to the sugar industry by \nreforming the Federal Sugar Program and thereby ensuring that consumers \nhave an uninterrupted supply of sugar at reasonable prices, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n                 the sugar competitiveness act of 1995\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I may introducing \nlegislation to dramatically reform the sugar program run by the \nDepartment of Agriculture. My bill, the Sugar Competitiveness Act, is \ndesigned to restore competitiveness to the sugar industry by reducing \nGovernment intervention in the marketplace.\n  Since the present sugar policy was enacted in 1981 we have seen 10 of \nthe sugar refining industry's 22 refineries close. Another refinery is \nscheduled to close permanently in the near future. The industry has \nlost over 40 percent of its capacity, not to mention the thousands of \nblue-collar jobs that go with it.\n  My own hometown of Baltimore is home to a sugar refining plant. \nGenerations of workers have walked through the gates of Domino sugar \nevery morning to give an honest day's work for an honest day's pay. My \nbill is designed to save those jobs and preserve the future of the \nsugar refining industry.\n  Today, refiners are being forced to operate under an absurd situation \nin which the Department of Agriculture is forcing up the price of their \nraw material--raw cane sugar--to a level higher than the price of \nrefined beet sugar. The USDA creates this artificial shortage by \ntightly restricting imports.\n  As a result of this Government-inflicted shortage of raw sugar, it \nhas become impossible for refiners to compete. All refiners have been \nlosing money for months.\n  Recently, refiners have been forced to pay 24 to 25 cents per pound \nfor raw sugar, while their competitors, the beet sugar processors, have \nbeen selling refined sugar at those levels. It is impossible for \nrefiners to cover these increased raw sugar costs in the refined sugar \nmarket.\n  But, there is more at stake here than the survival of the refining \nindustry and its labor. Refiners provide over 50 percent of the sugar \nmarketed in the United States. They play an important and unique role \nin ensuring that food processors and consumers have an uninterrupted \nsupply of sugar under all circumstances.\n\n  When there is a domestic crop shortage, caused by a freeze or \ndrought, as there often is, food processors depend upon the refiners to \nfill the void by importing more sugar. Any further loss of refining \ncapacity will seriously endanger the Nation's sugar supply, to the \ndetriment of consumers and food processors throughout the country.\n  The first thing my bill would do is eliminate USDA marketing \nallotments. These allotments limit the amount of sugar that domestic \nsurgarcane and sugar beet processors can sell.\n  The second thing the bill does is to reduce the raw sugar cane loan \nrate from 18 cents to 12 cents per pound in stages, 2 cents per year \nfor 3 years. Currently the USDA offers loans at a floor of 18 cents per \npound for raw cane sugar, which is nearly double the world price of \nsugar. These loans set minimum prices that sugar processors must pay to \nproducers, which drive up the cost of sugar for consumers.\n  Third, my bill regulates sugar imports to ensure that the market for \nraw cane sugar does not exceed the loan rate or the world market price, \nwhichever is higher. Because the sugar program is designed as a no-net-\ncost subsidy, and the loans are non-recourse, the USDA keeps the market \nprice for sugar processors much higher than necessary.\n  The fourth effect this legislation would have is to provide for 3-\nmonth CCC loans, and convert those loans from a non-recourse to a \nrecourse basis. Under the current loan structure, sugar processors must \nput up sugar as collateral for loans. At the end of the present 9-month \nloan, the processor must decide to do one of two things, pay back the \nloan with interest or forfeit the sugar they put up as collateral. \nProcessors can choose to simply hold on to the Government's money and \nforfeit the sugar collateral if it is more profitable.\n  If the processor forfeits, the disposition of the collateral sugar \nwould fall to USDA. In order to avoid that possibility USDA maintains \nthe market price much higher than the loan rate. Why should the \ntaxpayer subsidize non-recourse loans to corporations? My bill would \ncorrect the situation to the benefit of consumers by changing the loan \nstructure to a recourse loan, which requires that processors repay the \nloan instead of simply forfeiting the sugar to USDA.\n  Finally, the proposed legislation increases the sugar marketing \nassessment, and extends it to imported sugar. The sugar marketing \nassessment is a fee paid by domestic processors to the CCC. Currently \nforeign processors who are allowed to sell limited amounts of sugar in \nthe United States do not have to pay this. This bill levels the playing \nfield between foreign and domestic processors.\n  Mr. President, America is at the crossroads. Over the past decade we \n\n[[Page S 14900]]\n  have seen manufacturing jobs disappear in city after city. We have seen \ngood paying jobs move out of our urban areas if not out of the country. \nCities are being decimated by the flight of the middle class. Plants \nare closing and the jobs that honest, hard-working Americans rely on to \nfeed their kids and put food on the table are disappearing.\n  I've decided that I'm not just going to stand by and watch. This \nCongress owes it to working men and women to do all we can to preserve \nthose jobs, to level the playing field and to allow those that have \nmade America a world economic leader to continue that job. When we talk \nabout the current sugar program we're talking about a bad Federal \npolicy that tears at the backbone of American manufacturing.\n  I think this bill moves the sugar program toward a more competitive \nbase and will have dramatic impacts on lowering the price of sugar to \nconsumers by letting market conditions dictate sugar prices instead of \nthe U.S. Government.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Campbell, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Stevens, and Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 1303.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exempt \nfrom income taxation income derived by a member of an Indian tribe \ndirectly or through a qualified Indian entity derived from natural \nresource activities; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            indian tribal reservation tax relief legislation\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I introduce a series of tax relief \nbills designed to encourage investment and economic development and \ngrowth on Indian Reservations and other native American communities \nthroughout the United States.\n  Let me put it in plain and simple terms, native Americans as a group \nhave experienced a grinding poverty of epidemic proportions since the \ndays when they were first uprooted from their homelands or overrun by \nsettlers. The treaties that the United States made with tribes in \nexchange for their land and peace have been honored, for most part, \nonly in the breach.\n  The economic conditions on Indian reservations have not been improved \nby the occasional periods of economic growth that have swept much of \nthe rest of our Nation. Instead, Indians have long suffered the \nindignity of promises broken, treaties discarded, and a hopelessness \nthat reaches tragic, personal dimensions. Many Indian reservations are, \nrelatively speaking, islands of poverty in the ocean of wealth that is \nthe rest of America.\n  On repeated occasions in the last several sessions of the Congress, I \nhave offered amendments to the Federal Tax Code that would create \nincentives for private sector investment on Indian reservations and \nthat would remove inequities in the Federal Tax Code so that tribal \ngovernments can enjoy the same tax benefits accorded other non-taxable \ngovernment entities. I have offered these provisions, not to authorize \nany particular advantage to Indians, but merely to give them the same \nkind of tax incentives and benefits the Congress has given other \neconomically depressed areas and other units of government. Given the \nextremely under-developed nature of the economies in native American \ncommunities, I believe the tax relief we have promised the American \npeople must include reasonable measures to stimulate economic growth \nand productivity for Indians.\n  Today I am introducing a series of measures that are designed to \namend the Tax Code to give Indian tribes some tools with which to join \nwith the private sector in improving their economies.\n\n\n                   reservation investment tax credit\n\n  I rise today on behalf of myself, Senator Baucus, Senator Bingaman, \nSenator Campbell, Senator Inouye, Senator Kyl, Senator Stevens, and \nSenator Thomas, to introduce the Indian Reservation Jobs and Investment \nAct of 1995. This bill is identical to provisions that passed the \nCongress in 1992 and were sent to the White House where they were \nvetoed because they were part of a larger bill containing other \nprovisions opposed by the Bush administration. The measure I am \nreintroducing today would provide tax credits to otherwise taxable \nbusiness enterprises if they locate certain kinds of income-producing \nproperty on Indian reservations. Credits would be extended to \nbusinesses placing new personal property, new construction property, \nand infrastructure investment property on Indian reservations.\n  The bill does not provide any tax credit for reservation property \nused in connection with gaming activities. The credits are available \nfor expenditures related to personal property used in a business or \ntrade on an Indian reservation, related to new construction of property \nto be used in a business or trade on an Indian reservation, or related \nto investment in reservation infrastructure that is available for use \nby the general public and is placed in serve in connection with a \nreservation business or trade.\n  The bill limits these credits to those reservations where there is \neconomic need. The full credit is available to those reservations whose \nIndian unemployment rate exceeds the Nation's average unemployment by \n300 percent. One-half of the credit is available on reservations where \nthe unemployment rate is 150 to 300 percent of the national average. No \ninvestment tax credit is provided taxpayers on reservations where the \nIndian unemployment rate is less than 150 percent of the national \naverage.\n  Mr. President, I am very concerned by how little private enterprise \nis present on Indian reservations. Typically the only economic activity \nis the generated by Federal or tribal government employment. I \nunderstand why this is the case, but I don't like the fact that it is \nthe main way jobs and wealth are created in Indian country. By their \nvery nature, governments, including tribal governments, simply are not \ngood at running businesses. I know this is acknowledged by many tribes, \nwho, consistent with their cultural traditions, have created tribal \ncorporations or cooperative ventures that mix private sector business \nwith tribal principles. But we must begin to see private investment \nbeing attracted to Indian reservations if we are to see any significant \nimprovement in the economies of Indian tribes. The reservation tax \ncredit provisions I am introducing today are designed to act as an \nincentive to encourage the private business sector to plow through many \nof the known obstacles to reservation economic development.\n\n\n                     section 403(b) pension relief\n\n  On a second measure, I rise today on behalf of myself, Senator \nBaucus, Senator Bingaman, Senator Domenici, Senator Feingold, Senator \nInouye, Senator Kohl, Senator Kyl, Senator Stevens, and Senator Thomas, \nto introduce the Indian Tribal Government Pension Tax Relief Amendments \nof 1995. This bill would help address some very serious ambiguities \ncurrently found in the Tax Code relating to the \n\n[[Page S 14901]]\navailability of pension plans for Indian tribal governments and their \nemployees. Under current law, there are no salary deferred pension \nplans expressly made available to Indian tribal governments and their \nemployees.\n  Employees of Indian tribal governments are perhaps the only group of \nworkers in America for whom current Federal tax law does not provide \nexpress authority for a tax-deferred pension plan. Commercial for-\nprofit corporations and partnerships can offer section 401(k) \nretirement benefits to their employees. Public school systems and tax-\nexempt charitable and educational organizations can offer section \n403(b) pension plans to their employees. State government employees \nhave access to similar pension benefits under section 457. But people \nwho work for tribal governments are not expressly authorized to have \nfavorable Federal income tax treatment on their pension plans.\n  The bill also addresses an additional problem that has arisen from \nthe fact that several tribes have participated in plans provided for \nunder Section 403(b) of the Code and promoted by insurance \nunderwriters, only later to find that such plans were not expressly \nintended for their use as governmental employees involved in activities \nother than education. Those retirement funds, affecting several tribes \nand the retirement savings of thousands of tribal employees, are now in \njeopardy.\n\n  The pension relief measure I am introducing would enable tribal \ngovernments to compete, on the same terms, with other private and \npublic sectors employers in attracting qualified employees. Let me be \nclear--this measure would give tribal workers no more tax relief than \nis already offered every other group of workers in our country. Mr. \nPresident, as we all know, many individuals choose who they will work \nfor based on what employment benefits are offered, including retirement \nand pension plans. Many tribes have been trying to raise their salary \nand health benefits to competitive levels. But the Federal Tax Code has \nbeen increasingly interpreted by the Internal Revenue Service to \nprohibit tribes from offering their employees any form of the typical \nsalary reduction pension plans, one of the most sought after benefits \noffered to prospective employees. Other units of government and tax \nexempt organizations are permitted to offer such plans. The fact that \ntribal governments are precluded from doing so is simply unfair. This \ninjustice would be corrected by enactment of the Indian Tribal \nGovernment Pension Tax Relief Amendments of 1995.\n  The bill would expressly qualify, as tax-sheltered annuities under \nsection 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, those annuity contracts \npurchased by employees of tribal governments. The Joint Committee on \nTax has estimated that proposals largely identical to this one would \nhave a negligible revenue effect on Federal fiscal year budget \nreceipts. I am pleased to introduce this measure and urge my colleagues \nto support it and include it in the pending tax relief legislation \nunder consideration.\n\n\n               tribal unemployment tax equity and relief\n\n  Mr. President, on a third measure, I rise today on behalf of myself, \nSenator Baucus, Senator Campbell, Senator Domenici, Senator Inouye, \nSenator Kyl, Senator Stevens, and Senator Thomas, to introduce the \nIndian Tribal Government Unemployment Compensation Act Tax Relief \nAmendments of 1995. This bill would correct a serious oversight in the \nway the Internal Revenue Code treats Indian tribal governments for \nunemployment tax purposes under the unique, State-Federal unemployment \nprogram authorized by the Federal Unemployment Tax Act [FUTA]. It would \nclarify existing tax statutes so that tribal governments are treated \njust as State and local units of governments are treated for \nunemployment tax purposes.\n  It is well-settled that tribal governments are not taxable entities \nunder the Federal Tax Code because of their governmental status. But in \nrecent years, the Internal Revenue Service has begun to advance an \ninterpretation of FUTA that is particularly burdensome to Indian tribal \ngovernments. While FUTA expressly exempts all tax-exempt charitable \norganizations and all State and local units of government from paying \nthe Federal portion of the FUTA tax, it does not expressly mention \ntribal governments.\n  FUTA involves a joint Federal-State taxation system that levies two \ntaxes on most employers: An 0.8 percent unemployment tax and a State \nunemployment tax ranging up to more than 9 percent of a portion of an \nemployer's payroll. Since its enactment in the 1930s, FUTA has treated \nforeign, Federal, State, and local government employers differently \nfrom private commercial business employers. It exempts all foreign, \nFederal, State, and local government employers from the 0.8 percent \nFederal FUTA tax. It exempts foreign and Federal Government employers \nfrom State unemployment programs and allows State and local government \nemployers to pay lower State unemployment taxes. FUTA also treats \nincome tax-exempt charitable organizations the same as State and local \ngovernments. All other private sector employers pay both the Federal \nand State FUTA tax rates. The FUTA statute does not expressly include \ntribal government employers within the definition of government \nemployers.\n  The IRS has chosen in recent years to pursue some tribal governments \nfor unpaid FUTA taxes who has proceeded on the good faith assumption \nthat they, as units of government, were immune from the Federal portion \nof the tax. Some tribal governments also chose not to participate in \nthe State unemployment programs. In such cases, former employees of the \ntribal governments, who were otherwise eligible for unemployment \nbenefits, were denied benefits by many State unemployment programs \nbecause they had worked for what the States deemed an exempt employer--\na tribal government. While this caused hardship on the former employees \nof tribal governments, it meant that the State unemployment funds were \nheld harmless.\n\n  The IRS interpretation has caused another problem in recent years, as \ntribal governments have been subject to differing interpretations over \nwhether and how they are covered under FUTA. The interpretations of \nFUTA made by State governments, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, and \nthe U.S. Department of Labor have varied from region to region and \nState to State, resulting in differing treatment of Indian tribal \ngovernments in different periods of time. This has led to considerable \nconfusion among tribal governments about the amount they are supposed \nto pay. Some tribes have paid the Federal FUTA tax and then \nsuccessfully obtained tax refunds because they were deemed exempt. Some \ntribes have not paid, assuming they were exempt, and then have been \ninvestigated by the IRS for nonpayment of hundreds of thousands of \ndollars in unemployment taxes, plus penalties and interest. Some tribes \nhave paid taxes; other tribes have not had to pay. In each case, the \ntribes are identically situated but are treated differently simply \nbecause they are located within differing IRS regions or have been \nscrutinized by different IRS agents. This inconsistency of \ninterpretation has also resulted in many former tribal government \nemployees being denied eligibility to receive unemployment benefits.\n  Now the IRS has begun to pursue these tribes to collect unpaid \nassessments in the form of a penal tax under FUTA's unique enforcement \nmechanisms. Under FUTA, none of the funds assessed and collected would \nbe paid as unemployment benefits to former employees of a tribal \ngovernment that had not participated under FUTA. Nor would these \ndollars return to the State funds in which the tribes did not \nparticipate. Instead, the Federal IRS would collect the highest \npossible State and Federal unemployment taxes and place all of these \nfunds directly into the U.S. Treasury without credit or benefit to any \nworkers, Indian or otherwise. No one can reasonably argue that it is \nfair to impose this kind of taxation without benefit on the meager \nfunds of an Indian tribal government simply because it has followed an \ninterpretation of FUTA that some regional offices of the IRS and the \nStates previously followed but now have abandoned.\n  The bill would also expressly authorize tribal governments, like \nState and local units of government, and like charitable organizations, \nto contribute to a State fund on a reimbursable basis for unemployment \nbenefits actually paid out. Private sector employers \n\n[[Page S 14902]]\ntypically must pay an unemployment tax in advance. The rationale for \nreimburser status is that governmental employers, like tribes and \nStates, have a far more stable employment environment than that of the \nprivate sector, and that governmental revenue should not be committed \nto such purposes in advance of when the obligation to pay arises. Let \nme be clear, this bill would ensure that tribes participate in the \nunemployment compensation system. Many now do not do so. Their \nparticipation would be on the same terms that other governments \nparticipate.\n  The bill I am introducing today would permanently resolve this matter \nacross the Nation for every Indian tribal government. For unemployment \ntax purposes, it would require that federally recognized Indian tribal \ngovernment employers be treated the same way Federal, State, local \ngovernment, and other tax-exempt organizations are treated. It would \nalso remove an unemployment tax liability of tribal governments who did \nnot pay unemployment compensation taxes in the past in the belief that \nthey were exempt, provided that no benefits were paid to their former \nemployer. I have requested a revenue estimate from the Joint Committee \non Taxation. I believe, however, that the bill would have only a \nnegligible effect on revenues.\n  Unless this problem is resolved, many former tribal government \nemployees will continue to be denied benefits by State unemployment \nfunds. I believe Indian and non-Indian workers who are separated from \ntribal governmental employment should be included within our Nation's \ncomprehensive unemployment benefit system, and this bill will go a long \nway toward ensuring mandatory participation by tribal governments on a \nfair and equitable basis in the Federal-State unemployment fund system. \nI can think of nothing more fair than the approach clarified in this \nbill. I urge my colleagues to support it and include it in the pending \ntax relief legislation under consideration.\n\n\n                    Tribal Tax-Exempt Bond Authority\n\n  Mr. President, on a fourth measure, I rise today on behalf of myself, \nSenator Baucus, Senator Campbell, Senator Domenici, Senator Inouye, and \nSenator Kyl, to introduce the Tribal Government Tax-Exempt Bond \nAuthority Amendments Act of 1995. This bill would bring new investment \ndollars to Indian reservations where capital formation is so \ndesperately needed. The bill would replace the current restrictions on \nthe issuance of tax-exempt bonds by tribes and tribal subdivisions with \na provision that such bonds are to be issued under slightly more \nrestrictive conditions than those that now apply to States and their \npolitical subdivisions. In 1982, the Congress adopted the Indian Tribal \nGovernmental Tax Status Act of 1982--Public Law 97-473--which, among \nother things, authorized tribes and tribal subdivisions to issue tax-\nexempt bonds for certain purposes. In 1987, the Congress amended that \nact in Public Law 100-203, limiting the purposes for which tribes and \ntribal subdivisions could issue tax-exempt bonds to two: First, \nessential governmental functions, defined as functions customarily \nperformed by State and local governments with general taxing powers, \nand second, certain tribally owned manufacturing facilities. The 1987 \namendments were adopted to address perceived abuses in the issuance of \ntax-exempt bonds by tribes for purposes not related to their \nreservations and for the earning of arbitrage by issuing tax-exempt \nbonds at low rates for the purpose of investing the proceeds in higher-\nyielding, taxable obligations. The fact of the matter is that these \nabuses were effectively curtailed by the amendment to section 103 of \nthe Internal Revenue Code enacted in 1986 and subsequently implemented \nand enforced. Tribes have informed the Committee on Indian Affairs that \nthe 1987 restrictions on tribal government bonds are unfairly \nrestrictive, in that the interpretation of what is an ``essential \ngovernmental function'' has been unduly limiting, given the type of \nactivities that are customarily carried out by tribal governments for \nthe benefit of their members and their reservations. Mr. President, \nthere are serious deficiencies in the basic infrastructure on Indian \nreservations, primarily because increasingly tight fiscal restraints \nhave limited the ability of the United States, through direct annual \nappropriations, to fund construction and other activities. Reservations \nlag far behind the rest of the United States in terms of sanitation, \nhousing, roads, basic utilities, and public service facilities \nnecessary to support a civilized society and a competitive economy. I \nbelieve that providing additional tax-exempt bond authority to tribal \ngovernments will go a long way toward attracting new sources of capital \nto Indian reservations. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and \nto include it in the pending tax relief legislation under \nconsideration.\n\n\n                   tribal natural resource tax relief\n\n  Mr. President, on a fifth measure, I rise today on behalf of myself, \nSenator Baucus, Senator Domenici, and Senator Inouye to introduce the \nTreatment of Indian Tribal Natural Resource Income Act of 1995. This \nbill would extend an exemption to income derived by individual Indians \nfrom the harvest of natural resources from tribal trust land that is \nnow extended to income derived by individual Indians from treaty-\nprotected Indian fishing activity. In 1988 Congress amended the \nInternal Revenue Code to provide the treaty fishing exemption under \nsection 7873, which serves as a model for this bill.\n  With most Indian reservations, tribes signing treaties with the \nUnited States assumed that the natural resources of the reservation, \nincluding timber and minerals, would be available for the use of the \ntribe and its members without taxation or other burden imposed by the \nUnited States. Accordingly, due to their status as nontaxable sovereign \nnations, tribal governments are not subject to Federal income tax under \ncurrent law and practice on revenues generated when the tribal \ngovernment carries out natural resource activities on the tribal trust \nland. However, in those cases where a tribe issues a subsistence permit \nor license to individual tribal members to harvest or process natural \nresources held in trust for the tribe by the United States, the \nInternal Revenue Service has been imposing a tax on that individual \nIndian's income. Such a tax is unfair and arbitrary, since in a 1956 \ncase, Squire versus Capoeman, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that natural \nresource income earned by individual Indians from their own individual \nallotments held in trust for them by the United States is exempt. That \ncase did not deal with individual income derived from lands held in \ntrust for an entire tribe. Recently the IRS has begun to take \nenforcement action to collect income taxes from Indian individuals \nharvesting the fruits of tribal trust lands. The effect of this IRS \ninterpretation has been to impose a tax on income from Indian tribal \ntrust lands which were never broken up and allotted, but not from \nallotted trust lands held for an individual Indian.\n  The bill I am introducing today would apply only to tribal members \nand only with regard to natural resources, underlying title to which is \nowned by the United States in trust for a tribe. It would remove the \nexisting anomaly which allows a tribe as a whole to harvest or process \nsuch resources free of tax, but imposes an income tax on an individual \ntribal member of that tribe carrying out activity permitted by the \ntribe. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and to include it in \nthe pending tax relief legislation under consideration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of each of the \nfive bills I am introducing today, as well as a section-by-section \ndescription of each bill's provisions, be inserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1303\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This tax \n     credit is designed to attract private industry and capital, \n     expand existing industry, and make the private sector a \n     permanent source of economic development on Indian \n     reservations.\n       Section 2(b) establishes a 10% tax credit for personal \n     property on reservations, and a 15% credit is provided for \n     new construction property and infrastructure investment on \n     reservations. The tax credit is not available for property \n     acquired by the taxpayer from a person who is related to the \n     taxpayer, nor for the development or operation of tribal \n     gaming establishments authorized under the Indian Gaming \n     Regulatory Act of 1988. The tax credit is allowed for \n     investments used to acquire or construct reservation \n     infrastructure, and for expenditures on personal property and \n     new construction real property used predominately in the \n     active conduct of a trade or business within an Indian \n     reservation. The credits would extend to all 32 States in \n     which the 555 federally-recognized tribes are located, using \n     the definition of Indian reservation codified in section 3 \n     (d) of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (25 U.S.C. 1452(d)) \n     and section 4 (10) of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 \n     (25 U.S.C. 1903 (10)). The full tax credit is available only \n     on an Indian reservation in which the Indian unemployment \n     rate exceeds 300 percent of the national average unemployment \n     rate at any time during the year in which the property is \n     placed in service or during the immediately preceding two \n     calendar years. A one-half tax credit (50%) is available to \n     those reservations where the Indian unemployment rate exceeds \n     150 percent but not 300 percent of the national rate during \n     the same period. No tax credit is extended under the bill to \n     any property on reservations where the Indian unemployment \n     rate does not exceed 150 percent of the national rate during \n     that period. The subsection provides a special timing rule \n     for large construction projects. All Indian unemployment \n     rates must be certified by the Secretary of the Interior.\n       Section 2(c) amends section 50 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     (relating to recapture in case of dispositions) by providing \n     authority for the recapture of tax credits through increased \n     taxes if the property is disposed of, ceases to be investment \n     credit property of the taxpayer, or is removed from the \n     Indian reservation, converted, or otherwise ceases to be \n     Indian reservation property.\n       Section 2(d) amends Section 50(c) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code (relating to basis adjustment to investment credit \n     property) to add Indian reservation credits to the types of \n     property subject to basis adjustment.\n       Section 2(e) amends Section 50(b) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code (relating to property used by governmental units or \n     foreign persons or entities) to add a conforming exception \n     for Indian reservation infrastructure investment.\n       Section 2(f) amends Section 49(a) (1) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of the Internal Revenue Code (relating to the \n     application of at-risk rules) to make a conforming addition \n     for qualified investment in qualified Indian reservation \n     property.\n       Section 2(g) amends Section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     to make several conforming clerical changes.\n       Section 2(h) provides an effective date of this measure, so \n     that it applies only to property placed in service after \n     December 31, 1995.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                                S. 1304\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

State law may require an electing tribe to post a \n     payment bond or take other reasonable measures to assure the \n     making of payments in lieu of contributions under this \n     section.''.\n       (d) Definitions.--Section 3306 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 (relating to definitions) is amended by adding at the \n     end the following new subsection:\n       ``(t) Indian Tribe.--For purposes of this chapter, the term \n     ``Indian tribe'' has the meaning given to such term by \n     section 4(e) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education \n     Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b(e)), and includes any \n     subdivision, subsidiary, or business enterprise chartered and \n     wholly owned by such an Indian tribe.''\n       (e) Transition Rule.--For purposes of the Federal \n     Unemployment Tax Act, service performed in the employ of an \n     Indian tribe (as defined in section 3306(t) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 (as added by this Act)) shall not be \n     treated as employment (within the meaning of section 3306 of \n     such Code) if--\n       (1) it is service which is performed before the date of \n     enactment of this Act and with respect to which the tax \n     imposed under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act has not been \n     paid; and\n       (2) such Indian tribe reimburses a State unemployment fund \n     for unemployment benefits paid for service attributable to \n     such tribe for such period.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n  Section-by-Section Analysis--Indian Tribal Government Unemployment \n             Compensation Act Tax Relief Amendments of 1995\n\n       Section 1 sets forth the short title of the Act.\n       Section 2. Treatment of Indian Tribal Governments Under \n     Federal Unemployment Tax Act.\n       Subsection 2(a) In General.--This subsection (a) amends \n     section 3306(c)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code. Section \n     3306(c)(7) provides an exemption from the 0.8% federal \n     unemployment tax for employment for a state, any of its \n     political subdivisions, or any of its wholly-owned \n     instrumentalities. This subsection of the bill would make \n     employment for a tribal government or any political \n     subdivision or wholly tribally owned subsidiary thereof \n     likewise exempt from the 0.8% federal unemployment tax.\n       Subsection 2(b). Payments in Lieu of Contributions.--This \n     subsection amends several \n\n[[Page S 14905]]\n     provisions of section 3309 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section \n     3309(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code now requires a state \n     unemployment fund to offer coverage and benefits to employees \n     of a state government, its political subdivisions and wholly-\n     owned instrumentalities, and to employees of a religious, \n     charitable, educational or other income tax exempt \n     organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code. These employers may then elect to either pay a \n     flat tax rate as do private, for-profit commercial \n     businesses, or to make contributions, on a reimbursable \n     basis, for all benefits paid out to their former employees.\n       Subsection 2(b)(1) of the bill would provide the same \n     options to a tribal government or any political subdivision \n     or wholly tribally owned subsidiary thereof. Section \n     3309(b)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code now exempts from \n     all unemployment taxes service performed by members of a \n     State or political subdivision legislative body or judiciary.\n       Subsection 2(b)(2) of the bill would provide the same \n     exemption to a tribal government's legislative body or \n     judiciary. Section 3309(b)(3)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code \n     now exempts from all unemployment taxes service designated by \n     State law to be a major nontenured policymaking or advisory \n     position or a policymaking or advisory position that \n     ordinarily does not require more than 8 hours per week.\n       Subsection 2(b)(3) of the bill would provide the same \n     exemption to the same service so designated by tribal law. \n     Section 3309(b)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code now exempts \n     from all unemployment taxes service that is part of an \n     unemployment work-relief or work-training program assisted or \n     financed in whole or in part by any Federal or state agency.\n       Subsection 2(b)(4) of the bill would provide the same \n     exemption to the same service assisted or financed in whole \n     or in part by a tribal government.\n       Subsection 2(c). State Law Coverage.--This subsection adds \n     a new subsection to section 3309 of the Internal Revenue \n     Code. Section 3309 contains provisions relating to State law \n     coverage of services performed for non-profit organizations \n     or governmental entities. Subsection (e) of the bill extends \n     to tribal governments and their subsidiaries certain \n     flexibilities now extended to other governments and to \n     charitable organizations. The new subsection provides that a \n     state must permit a tribe to choose to pay the comparable tax \n     rate paid by commercial businesses under the Act, or to \n     choose to reimburse, like other governments and charitable \n     organizations, the State fund in lieu of such contributions \n     with amounts equal to the compensation attributable under \n     State law to such service. The new subsection also provides \n     that a tribe may make separate elections for itself and one \n     or more of its enterprises, subsidiaries, or subdivisions.\n       Subsection 2(d). Definitions.--This subsection amends \n     section 3306 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 3306 \n     contains definitions relating to the Federal Unemployment Tax \n     Act provisions. Subsection (c) of the bill would add a \n     definition of an ``Indian tribe'' to mean for these purposes \n     a federally recognized Indian tribal government, adopting the \n     same definition of a tribe as that used in 25 U.S.C. 450b(e), \n     the Indian Self-Determination Act. The bill clarifies that, \n     just as the subdivisions of a state government are included \n     within the definition of a state, and consistent with federal \n     Indian law provisions recognizing the unique nature of tribal \n     government, included within the bill's definition of a tribe \n     are its subdivisions, subsidiaries and enterprises wholly \n     owned by the tribal government.\n       Subsection 2(e). Transition Rule.--This subsection of the \n     bill provides tax relief to those tribal governments who in \n     good faith did not pay federal or state unemployment taxes \n     deemed due by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service under the \n     Federal Unemployment Tax Act. It ceases all federal \n     assessment and collection actions aimed at extracting non-\n     federal funds from tribal governments who have not paid \n     unemployment taxes provided they reimburse a state fund for \n     all benefits paid to otherwise eligible former tribal \n     employees during this period of non-payment. This relief is \n     available only for periods prior to the date of enactment of \n     this bill. The bill does not authorize refund actions for \n     taxes already paid nor relief from a tribe's obligation to \n     reimburse a state unemployment fund for benefits paid to \n     former tribal employees.\n\n                                S. 1306\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FEDERAL TAX TREATMENT OF INCOME DERIVED BY INDIANS \n                   FROM NATURAL RESOURCES ACTIVITIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subchapter C of chapter 80 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to provisions affecting more \n     than one subtitle) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 7874.

These activities include those directly related to \n     cultivating, harvesting, processing, extracting, or \n     transporting such trust resources, and the selling of such \n     resources if substantially all of the selling activity is \n     performed by tribal members.

To the extent that it is derived from such a \n     natural resources activity, individual income from a \n     distribution made by a tribe to its members from an equity \n     interest in a qualified Indian entity is treated as exempt.\n       Section 2(b) sets forth a conforming amendment to the table \n     of sections in the Internal Revenue Code.\n       Section 2(c) provides that

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) increasing international competition, technological \n     advances, and structural changes in the United States economy \n     present new challenges to private businesses and public \n     policymakers in creating a skilled workforce with the ability \n     to adapt to change and technological progress;\n       (2) despite more than 60 years of federally funded \n     employment training programs, the Federal Government has no \n     single, coherent policy guiding employment training efforts;\n       (3) according to the General Accounting Office, there are \n     over 100 federally funded employment training programs, which \n     are administered by 15 different Federal agencies and cost \n     more than $20,000,000,000 annually;\n       (4) many of the programs fail to collect enough performance \n     data to determine the relative effectiveness of each of the \n     programs or the effectiveness of the programs as a whole;\n       (5) because of the fragmentation, duplication, and lack of \n     accountability that currently exist within and among Federal \n     employment training programs it is often difficult for \n     workers, jobseekers, and businesses to easily access the \n     services they need;\n       (6) high quality, innovative vocational education programs \n     provide youth with skills and knowledge on which to build \n     successful careers and, in providing the skills and \n     knowledge, vocational education serves as the foundation of a \n     successful workforce development system;\n       (7) in recent years, several States and communities have \n     begun to develop promising new initiatives such as--\n       (A) school-to-work programs to better integrate youth \n     employment and education programs; and\n       (B) one-stop systems to make workforce development \n     activities more accessible to workers, jobseekers, and \n     businesses; and\n       (8) Federal, State, and local governments have failed to \n     adequately allow for private sector leadership in designing \n     workforce development activities that are responsive to local \n     labor market needs.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to make the United States more competitive in the world \n     economy by eliminating the fragmentation in Federal \n     employment training efforts and creating coherent, integrated \n     statewide workforce development systems designed to develop \n     more fully the academic, occupational, and literacy skills of \n     all segments of the workforce;\n       (2) to ensure that all segments of the workforce will \n     obtain the skills necessary to earn wages sufficient to \n     maintain the highest quality of living in the world; and\n       (3) to promote the economic development of each State by \n     developing a skilled workforce that is responsive to the \n     labor market needs of the businesses of each State.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, as the former honorary chairman \nof Ethnic American Day, I have the distinct privilege of entering into \nthe Record the names of the individuals who have been awarded the \nNational Ethnic Coalition of Organizations [NECO] 1995 Ellis Island \nMedal of Honor.\n  NECO's distinguished board chairman is Mr. William Denis Fugazy. \nNECO, founded in 1984, is the only organization in the United States of \nAmerica that celebrates the ethnic diversity of the American \npopulation. NECO also serves as a watchdog for ethnic, racial, and \nreligious injustice, and has been a constant voice and vigorous \nadvocate for ethnic unity and pride in America. One of its programs is \nthe Ellis Island Medals of Honor.\n  Each year since 1986, NECO has recognized America's ethnic diversity \nby honoring the achievements and contributions of ethnic Americans in \nall professions, including government, entertainment, business and \nindustry, sports, health care, and communications. NECO's Ellis Island \nMedals of Honor embody the true spirit of what makes the United States \nunique among the world's nations.\n  Many of our country's ethnic groups have no direct connection to \nEllis Island. However, NECO rightly views Ellis Island as a landmark \nand symbol of the shared experiences of all immigrant groups that have \nlanded on our soil. Most have come to our shores because they were the \ntargets of ethnic, racial, and religious hatred, discrimination, \nstereotyping, and prejudice. Many continued to experience this \nintolerance in America itself.\n  NECO strives to eliminate this hatred. Through the Ellis Island \nMedals of Honor, NECO celebrates ethnic diversity and the great \ncontributions of immigrants to the American experience. Whether they \nhave entered past Lady Liberty in New York Harbor, John F. Kennedy \nInternational Airport, or through San Francisco Bay; whether they are \nNative Americans, African-Americans, Asian-Americans, or others who \nhave not entered this country through Ellis Island; NECO's Ellis Island \nMedals of Honor embrace all ethnic Americans who call this great \ncountry home.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to ask to have printed in the Record the \nNational Ethnic Coalition of Organizations 1995 Ellis Island Medals of \nHonor recipients. I extend my congratulations to this very \ndistinguished group of Americans.\n  The list follows:\n\n\n              1995 ELLIS ISLAND MEDALS OF HONOR RECIPIENTS\n\n       Dr. Mihran S.

Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to a \npolitician whose record refutes every negative interpretation of that \nword and whose life personifies the true meaning of the words ``public \nservice.'' In Everett, WA, Liz McLaughlin--affectionately known as Ms. \nLiz--has announced she will retire this year after nearly a decade on \nthe Snohomish County Council and a lifetime of citizen activism--\nalthough the latter will no doubt continue.\n  Liz was appointed to the Snohomish County Council in 1986, and it is \nno surprise that in her first special election and two subsequent \nreelections to this office, she never had a challenger. She was \nunbeatable because citizens knew and trusted her.\n  Liz started to meet community needs many years ago by working in the \nFamily Life Program at Everett Community College, showing early promise \nof her future accomplishments and leadership in children's and family \nissues. In 1979 she went to work for Congressman Al Swift where, as the \nfull-time representative of the Congressman, she worked closely with \npeople and federal agencies, as well as local and government projects \nwhich affected the whole community. And the people who met Liz \nthroughout those years attest to the fact that beyond her official and \nprofessional duties there was always the warm, personal, and caring \nquality that made her a true public servant.\n  After election to the county council, Liz focused on legislation \nwhich would affect families' and children's lives. She is proudest of \nher work in human services and was instrumental in establishing \ninnovative programs like Dispute Resolution Centers; Family Support \nCenters; the Public Housing Trust Fund, which sets aside city and \ncounty funds for low-income seniors and people with special needs; and \nthe North Sound Regional Support Network, a five-county association \nbringing mental health dollars to the local community to keep consumers \nclose to their families. Legislation she authored was passed state-wide \nto provide a permanent funding source for family and dispute resolution \ncenters.\n  As might be expected, she chairs the county council's health and \nhuman services committee, and also serves on the public works utilities \ncommittee. She is vice president of the Washington State Association of \nCounties Western Region, serves on the WSAC legislative steering \ncommittee, the Snohomish County Housing Trust Fund Advisory Board, the \nBoard of Health, and the National Association of Counties Education and \nLabor Committee.\n  In addition to her council boards, she has served as board president \nfor Everett Community College Foundation. Board member for Providence \nGeneral Medical Center, and co-chair of the Human Services Council \nPartnership Forum. She has served as a director or \n\n[[Page S 14943]]\n\nmember of numerous social service organizations and committees.\n  The daughter of Swedish immigrants, Liz was born and raised in \nMonroe, WA, and has lived in Everett for 45 years. Liz and her husband, \nDon, who is retired from Weyerhauser, have two grown sons and two \ngrandchildren. Liz's announcement of retirement was met with \nexpressions of regret and loss from her colleagues and constituents, \nbut they understand that she deserves more private time with her own \nfamily and, I am sure, some new challenges.\n  I believe Liz chose politics as a way to accomplish community good on \na larger scale than was possible as a lone caring individual. A strong \nbeliever in the two party system, she has long been active in her own \nDemocratic Party, but always respected and was respected by her friends \nin the Republican Party. She did not lose her civility nor her \nsensitivity to other points of view. And she never forgot her personal \nresponsibility to her constituents. A fellow councilwoman, Karen \nMiller, says: ``She always looked at how what we did would affect \npeople in their day-to-day living.''\n  Ms. Liz, I salute you. In these days of intense cynicism about \npolitics and politicians, your career stands out as a shining example \nof what a politician can accomplish and can be. You provide a model, in \nyour motivation and in your performance, for all who seek to be \nentrusted with the public trust.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/10/senate-section/article/S14942-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ZEBRA MUSSELS AND SEA LAMPREY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM, Mr. President, I would like to take this time to \nexpress my appreciation to the managers of the Commerce, Justice, State \nappropriations bill for their support and acceptance of an amendment \nwhich would provide funding for research on nonindigenous species in \nthe Great Lakes--zebra mussels and sea lamprey.\n  While zebra mussels may sound harmless, they have caused health \nhazards as well as economic and environmental devastation in the Great \nLakes region. For example, zebra mussels are largely responsible for \nincreasing the bacteria levels on beaches surrounding Lake St. Clair. \nBecause the zebra mussels consume particles in the lakes, sunlight is \nable to shine through the clear water. This increased sunlight reaches \nthe aquatic plants on the lake floor causing them to grow more rapidly \nand prolifically than they would without the aid of zebra mussels. \nWhile this may not sound problematic, these plants then trap bacteria \nwhich cause health hazards to swimmers. The Lake St. Clair beaches have \nbeen forced to close due to the unhealthy levels of e-coli bacteria in \nthe water.\n  In addition, while each zebra mussel is not much larger than a \nfingernail, they can cause multimillion-dollar problems to energy \nsystems in the Great Lakes. These tiny animals attach to water intake \nvalves needed to generate power for our communities. They attach to \neach other and create a reef-like barrier in these important intake \nvalves. Clearing the zebra mussels out of these valves is a \nmultimillion-dollar task.\n  I comment the Great Lakes Environmental Research Lab for their work \non eradicating the zebra mussel population and again I thank the \nmanagers for their support of GLERL's work.\n  I also appreciate the managers' support for additional funding for \nthe Great Lakes Fishery Commission. This commission is the only \norganization conducting research on reducing the sea lamprey population \nin the Great Lakes. The commercial fishery in the Great Lakes was all \nbut eliminated in the early 1950's largely due to the impact of the \ninvading sea lamprey. The Great Lakes Fishery Commission's work so far \nhas helped the fishery rebound to a current economic value in excess of \n$4 million annually.\n  Because of the explosion in the sea lamprey population, Canada \nintends to increase their contribution to the Great Lakes Fisheries \nCommission. By treaty, however, the United States must provide 69 \npercent of the funding for the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission. \nTherefore, we must increase our contribution in order to leverage \nadditional Canadian funding. I am pleased that the Canadians are \nworking with us on this problem and am confident that the funds spent \non sea lamprey research will be beneficial on a national as well as an \ninternational level.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/10/senate-section/article/S14943-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14943-S14944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          WE MUST SAVE MEDICARE--BUT WE MUST DO IT RESPONSIBLY\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if there is one thing that everyone \nseems to agree on in the debate over Medicare, it is that the future of \nthe program must be guaranteed. Thanks to Medicare, 99 percent of older \nAmericans now have health care coverage. It would be a tragedy for this \nprogram to become insolvent, and I am prepared to vote for the changes \nnecessary to preserve it, just as I have done in the past.\n  Where I differ with some congressional leaders, however, is over how \nmuch projected Medicare spending must be cut in order to save the \nprogram. The 7-year budget plan, which passed the Congress in June over \nmy objections, cuts projected Medicare spending by a whopping $270 \nbillion. This same budget plan also cuts projected Medicaid spending by \n$182 billion while providing $245 billion in new tax breaks.\n  I believe it is wrong to be making an unprecedented level of cuts to \nMedicare, Medicaid, and education while granting tax relief largely to \ntaxpayers making over $100,000 per year and to large corporations that \ntake advantage of tax loopholes.\n\n\n                           MEDICARE SOLVENCY\n\n  And according to Medicare experts, the amount needed to save the \nTrust Fund is $89 billion, not the $270 billion the budget would cut. \nClearly, the vast majority of the Medicare cuts--$181 billion--have \nnothing to do with keeping Medicare solvent. The reason this budget \ncuts Medicare three times more than is necessary to save the Trust Fund \nis to pay for the one big cost item in the budget: new tax breaks.\n\n\n             THE PLAN PROPOSED BY SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADERS\n\n  Under the plan passed by the Senate Finance Committee, premiums for \nMedicare part B, which pays for physician services, would double and \ncould exceed $100 per month in the year 2002. This premium would be \ndeducted monthly from seniors' Social Security checks. On top of that, \nthe part B deductible would also increase from $100 to $220.\n  Beneficiaries would also be given three options for receiving care: \nFirst, seniors could choose to remain in the traditional, fee-for-\nservice plan; second, beneficiaries could choose to move into private \nmanaged care plans, like health maintenance organizations [HMO's]; or \nthird, seniors could set up medical savings accounts [MSA's] to pay for \ntheir health care expenses. I believe Medicare should be expanded to \ngive seniors more choices for coverage, but the same basic level and \nquality of care now available to beneficiaries must be assured. I would \nalso oppose a proposal that would force seniors into health plans which \nrestrict their choice of doctor.\n  The wealthiest seniors--individuals with incomes over $75,000 and \ncouples making more than $150,000--would be asked to pay more for their \nMedicare by reducing the part B premium subsidy they receive. I support \nthis proposal as a part of an overall effort to control the rate of \ngrowth of Medicare spending.\n  The Senate proposal would also increase the eligibility age for \nMedicare from 65 to 67 between the years 2003 and 2027. This would mean \nthat people born since 1938 would have to wait longer for Medicare.\n  Finally, the majority of savings would come through reducing payments \nto hospitals, physicians, and other health care professionals who \nprovide Medicare services.\n\n\n                           IMPACT ON SENIORS\n\n  So what will these cuts mean to Medicare beneficiaries? I think the \nimpact could be quite serious. Medicare premiums and deductibles will \nincrease for North Dakota's 103,000 senior citizens, and quality and \navailability of care for all North Dakotans will be threatened.\n  I am concerned that the premium and deductible increases could make \nMedicare coverage unaffordable for some seniors. Most older Americans \nhave very modest incomes; 75 percent of seniors on Medicare live on \nless than $25,000 a year. And in North Dakota, older Americans get by \non even less: 70 percent of our State's seniors have incomes of under \n$15,000. \n\n[[Page S 14944]]\n\n  Already seniors spend 21 percent of their income on health care \ncosts. In 1994, the average older American spent $2,500 for health care \ncosts not covered by Medicare. Those over 75 pay even more, and these \nnumbers don't even include the cost of long-term nursing home care, \nwhich averages nearly $40,000 per year.\n  The portion of the cuts which do not fall on beneficiaries directly \nwill be borne by the doctors, hospitals, and other health care \nproviders who deliver Medicare services. Because of this, I am \nconcerned that the proposed level of cuts could create a quality gap \nbetween Medicare and the rest of the health system.\n  In effect, these cuts could create a second class health care system \nfor the elderly on Medicare. Even now, Medicare reimburses health care \nproviders at only 68 percent of the amount health providers get from \nprivate payors.\n  Another serious consequence of this budget plan on seniors is the \nsubstantial, $182 billion cut in projected spending on Medicaid. On top \nof new Medicare costs, Medicaid cuts could force hundreds of thousands \nof middle class seniors and their families to assume the burden of \nnursing home costs as well.\n\n\n                      IMPACT ON HEALTH CARE SYSTEM\n\n  Cuts of this magnitude could have devastating consequences for our \nhealth care system, particularly in rural areas.\n  These cuts would take $537 million out of North Dakota over the next \n7 years. That's $5,213 per Medicare beneficiary in North Dakota.\n  According to the North Dakota Hospital Association, as many as 12 to \n20 rural hospitals in North Dakota are in danger of being shut down by \nthese cuts. Rural hospitals rely heavily on Medicare patients, and many \nare already in very precarious financial condition. Other rural health \ncare providers are similarly dependent on Medicare patients for their \nlivelihood. These cuts will make access to health care even more of a \nproblem for all North Dakotans living in those areas.\n  Teaching hospitals are also in jeopardy. We need teaching hospitals \nto educate our health care professionals and to conduct invaluable \nmedical research which saves lives.\n  Another concern I have is that cuts of this magnitude cannot be \nabsorbed within the Medicare system alone and that health care \nproviders will have no choice but to shift their uncompensated costs \nonto their other patients in the form of higher fees. This means higher \nmedical bills and higher health insurance costs for the rest of the \npopulation.\n\n\n                          MEDICARE COST GROWTH\n\n  Are Medicare costs growing too fast? Do Medicare costs need to be \nbrought under control? Yes, absolutely.\n  Medicare Program costs are growing at a little over 10 percent per \nyear. But roughly one-half of this growth is caused by the increasing \nnumber of seniors in our country who become eligible for Medicare each \nmonth and the increased utilization of health care services that \nresults from people living longer.\n  This year, 37 million Americans are covered by the Medicare Program. \nEvery month over 200,000 older Americans enroll in Medicare for the \nfirst time. Just within the time frame of this budget, Medicare will \ncover 3.7 million more people than it does today.\n  A better measure of Medicare cost growth is to look at per person \ncosts. Currently the cost of health care per person is increasing in \nMedicare at about the same rate it is increasing in the private \nsector--roughly 7.6 percent per year. The budget cuts would limit per \nperson Medicare growth to 4.9 percent, while the private sector health \ncare would stay at 7.6 percent.\n\n\n                          WHAT SHOULD BE DONE\n\n  I believe it is possible to balance the budget and protect Medicare \nat the same time. But it will take the new leadership in Congress \ncompromising on their tax cuts and being straight about the Medicare \nTrust Fund. It will also mean that Democrats must acknowledge that the \ncurrent growth in Medicare spending is not sustainable and must be \nslowed.\n  We know that the amount needed to save the trust fund is $89 billion, \nnot the $270 billion cut in the budget plan. This level of savings is \nachievable without any new increases in costs for beneficiaries and \nwithout hurting our world class health care system.\n  The first thing we must do is crack down on the waste, fraud, and \nabuse in the Medicare system. The General Accounting Office has found \nthat as much as 10 cents of every dollar spent by Medicare goes to \nfraud and abuse. I regularly get letters from my constituents in North \nDakota describing the wasteful duplication of services and paperwork \nthat occur under Medicare. I have cosponsored legislation to address \nthis problem once and for all.\n  We must also modernize Medicare so that it has the same management \ntools as the private sector to control costs. Case management services, \nfor example, can improve the coordination and quality of care for \nbeneficiaries and save money for Medicare at the same time. New \ncomputer technology can help prevent Medicare from making duplicative \nor improper payments. Adopting a single claims form for providers can \ncut down on paperwork.\n  I believe Medicare must also place greater emphasis on preventive \ncare. Only a fraction of beneficiaries take advantage of the mammogram \nand flu shots covered by Medicare. We should improve these benefits and \ntake steps to promote their use.\n  Removing barriers to practice for qualified non-physician providers \nwill help Medicare save money and also help bring needed caregivers \ninto more of rural North Dakota.\n  Finally, modest reductions in the rate of growth of Medicare \nspending--only what's needed to reach $89 billion--will ensure that \nMedicare remains solvent while protecting benefits so that Medicare \nremains a program worth saving.\n  With a little good faith all around, I am hopeful Congress can pass \nthis kind of a plan later this year. It may take a Presidential veto \nbefore we get there, but I believe we can provide the fiscal discipline \nthe American people want from the Federal Government without \nsacrificing the health security that they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/10/senate-section/article/S14943-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14944-S14945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           SECOND MUNICIPAL LEADERS' SUMMIT ON CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to congratulate the municipal leaders' communique which was \nproduced at the Second Municipal Leaders Summit on Climate Change. It \nis important for our Nation to be made aware of the problems and \nprogress in the climate research and air quality fields. I ask that \nthis communique be printed in today's Record.\n  The communique follows:\n\n    Article 1--Local Authorities' Commitments to Climate Protection\n\n       1.1 We, the participants at the Second Municipal Leaders' \n     Summit on Climate Change, urge local authorities, especially \n     those in industrialized nations, who have not yet undertaken \n     climate protection activities to:\n       (a) endeavor to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 20% \n     from 1990 levels by 2005;\n       (b) develop a local action plan to reduce urban level \n     emissions of greenhouse gases and protect carbon sinks, which \n     could include protecting and establishing municipal forests, \n     managing urban growth, establishing sustainable \n     transportation modes, reducing the procurement of tropical \n     wood, etc.;\n       (c) set a target for emissions reduction appropriate to \n     local municipal capacity and circumstances;\n       (d) undertake to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas \n     emissions in the municipality's own operations, including \n     building, facilities, vehicle fleets, and employee travel;\n       (e) undertake initiatives to change public attitudes and \n     behavior to reduce energy consumption energy use;\n       (f) promote the advancement of renewable energy sources: \n     hydro-energy, solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, \n     biogas, biomass, as the only sustainable alternative forms \n     of energy, noting that existing nuclear technology is not \n     an appropriate alternative to fossil fuels.\n       Specific target dates for the above activities will be \n     established by ICLEI's Cities for Climate Protection \n     Campaign.\n       1.2 We urge local authorities in non-industrialised \n     countries and countries in transition to strive to break the \n     link between economic growth and energy consumption and, \n     instead of imitating the path taken by industrialised \n     nations, to take the wiser course and actively promote and \n     give priority to renewable energy sources such as solar power \n     and to newly emerging energy-efficient technologies. Energy \n     efficiency will also enable the freeing up of financial \n     resources for the economic and social development of these \n     communities in a more sustainable manner.\n\n           Article II--Communication to National Governments\n\n       2.1 We urge national governments and their utilities to \n     accord local authorities \n\n[[Page S 14945]]\n     greater powers, responsibilities and resources to enhance their \n     capacity to reduce local energy use and thus reduce net \n     greenhouse gas emissions.\n       2.2 We urge national governments to include local \n     participation in the formulation of their national climate \n     action plans and to enable local authorities by providing \n     adequate training and financial resources, for example, by \n     creating a dedicated fund to finance national and municipal \n     climate protection efforts.\n       2.3 We urge national governments to give priority in their \n     public infrastructure investments to local projects that \n     reduce energy use, save money, improve air quality, create \n     jobs, mitigate poverty, stimulate the local economy, and make \n     communities more liveable.\n       2.4 We urge national governments to be innovative in their \n     application of regulatory, tax, and other economic \n     instruments to help adjust public and private sector \n     behaviour in order to reduce fossil fuel consumption, protect \n     and restore forests, and encourage the use of renewable \n     energy sources.\n\n        Article III--Communication to the Conference of Parties\n\n\n       (a) recognition of local authorities as a distinct sector\n\n       3.1 For the critical purposes of implementing the Framework \n     Convention on Climate Change, we urge the Conference of the \n     Parties (COP) to recognise that local authorities around the \n     world are strategic partners with national governments in \n     climate protection by recognising that the municipal sector \n     is distinct from other sectors.\n\n\n         (b) local authority's input into the subsidiary bodies\n\n       3.2 We urge the COP to establish consultative processes \n     within the Subsidiary Bodies, pursuant to Articles 9 and 10 \n     of the Framework Convention, which permit and encourage local \n     authorities as a sector to advise the Subsidiary Bodies with \n     respect to scientific and technical matters, as well as to \n     implementation of the Convention.\n       3.3 We urge the COP to endorse the establishment of a Local \n     Authority Climate Assembly to facilitate municipal advice to \n     the COP on scientific, technical, and implementation matters \n     subject to Articles 9 and 10.\n       3.4 We urge the COP to include local authority \n     representation on all general advisory committees established \n     to advise the Subsidiary Bodies.\n\n\n            (c) greenhouse gas reductions in annex 1 parties\n\n       3.5 We urge the COP to endorse and implement the ``Draft \n     Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on \n     Climate Change on Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction,'' \n     proposed by Trinidad and Tobago on behalf of the Alliance of \n     Small Island States (AOSIS). Key provisions of the draft \n     protocol propose that Annex 1 Parties shall:\n       (a) Reduce their 1990 level of anthropogenic emissions of \n     carbon dioxide by at least 20% by the year 2005.\n       (b) Adopt specific targets and timetables to limit or \n     reduce other greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal \n     Protocol, including targets and timetables for methane, \n     nitrous oxides and fluorocarbons.\n       (c) Stimulate the use of green, renewable sources of \n     energy.\n       3.6 We urge the COP to give due recognition to local \n     authorities that undertake to reduce their emissions by 20% \n     or more, by endorsing the goals of the Cities for Climate \n     Protection Campaign, which is urging cities to adopt a 20% \n     reduction target as a minimum, and by facilitating \n     appropriate UN-sponsored recognition events and activities.\n\n\n          (d) greenhouse gas reductions in non-annex 1 parties\n\n       3.7 We urge the COP and other UN agencies to recognise the \n     important role that local authorities in both Annex 1 \\1\\ and \n     non-Annex Parties can play in contributing to greenhouse-gas \n     reduction through municipal policy exchanges, technology \n     transfer, and promotion of new technologies.\n     \\1\\ Australia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, \n     Czech Republic, Denmark, European Community, Estonia, \n     Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, \n     Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New \n     Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russian \n     Federation, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, \n     United Kingdom, United States of America.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       3.8 We urge the COP and other UN agencies to facilitate \n     this crucial partnership and help build local capacity for \n     reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by ensuring that local \n     authorities in developing countries and countries in \n     transition have access to scientific findings, technology, \n     programs and funding that will be available for the \n     implementation of the goals set out in the Framework \n     Convention on Climate Change--through their respective \n     national governments where appropriate--with the aim of \n     building local capacity in the area of methodologies and \n     policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n     Second Municipal Leaders' Summit on Climate Change, Berlin, \n     Germany, 29 March 1995.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/10/senate-section/article/S14944-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             J.P.

J.P. \nMcCarthy, whose gentle questions and quiet concerns made the radio \nsparkle for millions of listeners in Detroit and surrounding \ncommunities, passed away from pneumonia brought on by a rare blood \ndisease.\n  J.P. McCarthy interviewed Governors, legislators, businessmen, and \neven cardinals over the years, and became friends with almost all of \nthem. He asked probing questions with a sincerity and a keen sense of \ncivility that produced straight answers and more than a little \nenlightenment. He made our lives richer through his work.\n  And his work was not done merely on the radio. J.P. generously gave \nof his time and effort for numerous charities in and around his \nhometown. Many was the time when he would stay up late at a fundraiser, \nknowing full well that he would have to get up before 5 a.m. the next \nmorning so that he could be on the air.\n  But, full as has schedule was, J.P. never neglected his family. After \nwork he would return home for lunch with his wife, Judy, even when he \ncould have been hob-knobbing with the rich and famous. That was the \nkind of man he was: devoted to family and friends, always certain of \nwhere his priorities should lay.\n  Cardinal Adam Maida, the archbishop of Detroit, told those of us at \nJ.P.'s funeral that perhaps the strongest influence on his friend's \nlife was his faith.

Mr. President, over the last 4 years, much has \nalready been said and done to pay tribute to our Nation's veterans of \nWorld War II. However, because this tribute is so special, I come \nforward today to bring to the attention of this body the late Judge \nMaurice Sapienza's poem, ``This is V-J Day.''\n  The late Judge Sapienza was born on October 10, 1915, and died on \nApril 6, 1991. A graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, \nJudge Sapienza was not only a distinguished legal scholar, but a noted \npoet who edited several anthologies of verse. Judge Sapienza composed \n``This is V-J Day'' in 1945, and dedicated it to the memory of \nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt. It was read over the radio on \nSeptember 2, 1945, and subsequently published.\n  As we come to the end of the period of commemorating the 50th \nanniversary of World War II, I think it is very appropriate for this \nbody to contemplate Judge Sapienza's moving words. Therefore, I ask \nthat Judge Sapienza's poem be printed in the Record.\n  The poem follows:\n\n                            This Is V-J Day\n\n                         (By Maurice Sapienza)\n\n     LISTEN:\n     This is the voice of your country:\n     I am the United States of America.\n     From my infancy up to this great, victorious day,\n     I have been proud of my officers and men.\n     They have trained my strength,\n     They have guided my way to Victory again\n     And forced the Rising Sun to set.\n     Now never again shall I forced to rout\n     This treacherous enemy.\n\n     Look, do you see my ships?\n     Listen, do you hear my guns?\n     Let the world see and hear me.\n     I have a story to tell.\n\n     Do you remember December, 1941?\n     Do you remember Pearl Harbor?\n     Let us go back to December 6, 1941.\n     Almost all my ships were there\n     In Pearl Harbor.\n     They were snugly anchored\n     Beam to beam, stern to bow,\n     Proud, strong, and safe.\n\n     Safe? Yes, the Pacific was a safe sea.\n     There was no threat to meet.\n     That afternoon, my chiefs\n     Were somewhere. Someone said\n     One was playing golf.\n     I am not sure.\n     Someone said one was given a note\n     To alert me from attack.\n     But he must have known\n     There was no danger\n     For he let me slumber in my anchorage.\n\n     My men had confidence in me.\n     They went to parties that night.\n     They had a good time.\n     Many hosts\n\n[[Page S 14946]]\n\n     Were entertaining them.\n     Their bars flowed freely with the best.\n     I had no cause to worry.\n\n     That night, a strange message went out.\n     A call to Tokyo was made.\n     Our monitors were alert.\n     They saw nothing to arouse them.\n     In the message:\n     ``The hibiscus is in bloom''\n     It was true. The hibiscus blooms all year.\n     It is the flower of Hawaii.\n     It is a beautiful flower\n     And colors this peaceful paradise.\n\n     The next day came early.\n     It was Sunday, December 7, 1941.\n     Do you remember that morning?\n     Come back there with me.\n     Look, the sun was rising;\n     It cast its slanting light\n     Above the ragged mountain rims,\n     Until its light-columns settled on the surfaces\n     And slowly started on their daily\n     March across the earth.\n\n     Down the green slopes they came,\n     Across the valleys studded with pineapples--\n     Across the fields of sugar cane,\n     Over Schofield Barracks and Waianae,\n     Where Marines and Army men slumbered,\n     To Wheeler Fields, drying the dew\n     On planes and landing strips.\n     They slowly advanced\n     Toward low-lying Pearl Harbor,\n     Where my ships, in domino-rows,\n     Snuggled close to each other.\n\n     It was a peaceful scene\n     That the rays of the sun disclosed.\n     I watched the island birds\n     Open their eyes, stretch and shake their wings,\n     Before starting their forage for food.\n     I saw a few of them\n     Wing skyward slowly.\n\n     As I looked about\n     I saw that dawn\n     Had stirred the wing-men\n     At Hickam Field.\n     Mechanics were towing their planes\n     Into the landing strips,\n     Spinning slow propellers,\n     Pouring gasoline into the empty tanks,\n     And warming motors for the take-offs.\n     Men were moving listlessly\n     Inside my ships\n     And in the B.O.Q.s beside them.\n\n     Somewhere near,\n     An Army Private\n     Turned the bowl-shaped antennas\n     Of the Radar he loved.\n     Radio pulses were beaming out\n     As he watched the oscilloscope screen\n     Register the homing-pigeon pulses,\n     Splash fluorescent wakes of tiny lights\n     On the mirror screen\n     He saw the unseen terrain\n     Flash in view;\n     The coastline, the harbor,\n     My ships, and the mountains.\n\n     Some of the pulses beat sky-ward.\n     Squadrons of planes scurried them back\n     With tell-tale report.\n     It was a moment of indecision then--\n     A moment that rises in the history of man\n     With a message of significance to the alert;\n     A moment that heralds the tides of fate\n     And challenges the wisdom of man.\n     In such a moment, he made his report:\n     ``Unidentified planes approaching''\n     It was a terse report.\n     It met a terse reply:\n     ``Friendly planes expected.''\n\n     The hum of his radar transmitter\n     Drowned in the drone\n     Of approaching planes.\n     The rays of the sun\n     Moved on unconcerned.\n     The quietness of the day of rest\n     Neglected the crescendo tones.\n\n     SUDDENLY\n     Bombs burst on earth.\n     I looked over the Harbor:\n     Planes were everywhere,\n     Zooming and screaming,\n     Unloosening tiny specks\n     That grew larger and larger\n     Until they burst in fire and thunder.\n     Wheeler Field, Hickam Field,\n     Both were writhing in flames.\n     Then hell broke loose.\n     The savage fury of violent death\n     Shook my ships\n     And tore gaping, mangled holes within my decks.\n     I had no steam to run.\n     I could only shudder and groan,\n     As bombs struck home.\n\n     There were some ships\n     That stung away some planes.\n     My men were all confused.\n     Death snatched them by the handful.\n     Some fired back.\n     Many never had the chance to move.\n     One by one my ships began to sink.\n     My men were perishing in flame and smoke.\n     One of my ships made the sea\n     And zig-zagged away from falling bombs.\n     One ship shuddered\n     When a fast torpedo\n     Bit into her side\n     And tore her flesh wide open;\n     But her 50-caliber guns\n     Gallantly blazed at once,\n     And her heavier guns\n     Swung up and fired away.\n     No plane got through\n     The wall of steel she blazed upright.\n\n     It was not long before the flames and smoke\n     Had blotted out the sun\n     And cast a pall of grimness on Pearl Harbor.\n     And the petals of ``hibiscus''\n     That was in ``full bloom''\n     Lay shattered and still\n     At the bottom of the sea.\n     How much more do you want to see?\n     Do you think that I will ever forget\n     My wounds, my deaths?\n     Oh, but I do not grieve my loss of ships:\n     They were salvaged soon\n     And put to sea\n     With the steam of anger at full speed.\n     It is the pain and death my men have suffered\n     That hurts me most.\n\n     There, above the Harbor,\n     Stands a hill.\n     It is a hill full of red earth\n     That some volcano upheaved\n     In its gasping throes.\n     That red earth is red dirt, red dust.\n     But in it lies a richer dust,\n     A dust that gashed vermillion\n     When the reaper plowed\n     His sudden harvest.\n     I see that hill there now.\n     It is a hallowed hill\n     That stares up to the sky\n     And bares a chest of crosses--\n     They are the white medals of men\n     Who died with and around me--\n     And I grieve because\n     They cannot be raised and salvaged\n     To stand upon my decks again.\n     They were gallant and brave.\n     And wherever I go,\n     They shall be my gods.\n\n     Can you hear me,\n     You who are there beneath that earth,\n     You who went down in my ships,\n     You who went skyward in planes\n     And plummeted to your graves in flames,\n     You who fired your guns until the last--\n     LISTEN\n     I am your Country.\n     And I have welded the Army, Navy, and Air Force to a oneness,\n     Into the most powerful weapon\n     This world has ever seen.\n\n     Listen to me just this once:\n     I will never forget you.\n     I have tried to avenge you.\n     Remember the Coral Sea,\n     And remember what I did at Midway:\n     My T.B.F.s\n     Covered torpedoes with their fusilage\n     And made the Japs\n     Think they were just ordinary fighters.\n     Did you see them hold their fire\n     Until torpedoes flashed to them\n     And bit with savage reprisal\n     Into their steel bellies?\n\n     O, you who died,\n     Listen\n     I put my fighting marines\n     Ashore on Guadalcanal\n     With an umbrella of steel.\n     I took death by the hair\n     And flung him\n     Across the Solomons,\n     Attu, Kiska,\n     Lae, Wake Island,\n     Tarawa, Makin,\n     Across the Central Pacific,\n     To Kwajalein, Eniwetok,\n     Across Tokyo in B-29s,\n

Mr. President, on September 29, I was unable to \nvoice my opposition to the amendment proposed by Senator Inouye that \nreduced funding for international broadcasting. There are many programs \nand institutions worthy of support, but I believe it was self-defeating \nto augment one at the expense of another, which is one of the most \nvaluable instruments of American foreign policy--Radio Free Europe/\nRadio Liberty.\n  I come to this issue with a good deal of experience as to the \nimportance of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The Radios, as they are \ncommonly called, have set standards for objective journalism and \nanalysis that are emulated and respected by news organizations and \nmedia across central Europe and the former Soviet Union.\n  Many of the millions worldwide that listen to our U.S.-supported \nbroadcasters live in countries where information and news continue to \nbe controlled by the government. In these parts of the world, \ngovernment information bureaus, government wire agencies, government \nradios and television channels continue to constrict the free passage \nof ideas.\n  In an attempt to find offsetting funds in the bill, the sponsors of \nthis amendment--naively and recklessly, in my opinion--would hobble an \nimportant instrument for promoting U.S. interests abroad. Last year, \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, which authorizes funds for the Radios, \ndebated and eventually agreed on a sensible plan to restructure and \nstreamline the broadcasting programs.\n  As we speak, Mr. President, U.S.-supported international broadcasting \nis becoming a more efficient and effective operation. The drastic cuts \nin this amendment, if left as is, will undermine the reform effort and \nwill almost certainly force the elimination of important radio services \naround the world.\n  Let's go over the International Broadcasting Act that this Congress \nenacted last year with bipartisan support as part of the State \nDepartment authorization bill. First, the act consolidated all the U.S. \ninternational broadcasting services and created a new broadcasting \nBoard of Governors, which is now in place.\n  Second, the plan called for reductions in Voice of America and Radio \nFree Europe/Radio Liberty broadcasts to Eastern Europe and the former \nSoviet Union by one-third. In the last year, over 1,250 jobs in \nprogramming, news gathering, broadcasting, and support services have \nbeen eliminated.\n  Moving the headquarters of Radio Free Europe from Munich to Prague \nthis fall, when completed, will reduce personnel costs by one-third. \nPresident Havel of the Czech Republic generously offered the Radios the \nuse of the former Czechoslovak Parliament building at a symbolic fee of \n$12 per year.\n  Overall, the plan will save well over $400 million by 1997.\n  Moreover, Congress has directed that the funding of Radio Free \nEurope/Radio Liberty be assumed by the private sector by the end of the \ncentury. The radios are taking this seriously; indeed, the move to \nprague is a step on the path to privatization. The research arm of \nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has already been privatized.\n  Mr. President, the president's fiscal 1996 request for international \nbroadcasting is 20 percent lower than the 1994 level. The committee \nappropriation of $355 million is $40 million less than the President's \nrequest and $30 million less than the amount authorized by the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee. In other words, international broadcasting \nis already facing severe reductions that will force the elimination of \nlanguage services and hours of broadcasting.\n  This further cut to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty could \nirreplaceably damage our ability to broadcast to areas of the world \nwhere the United States has important national security interests. It \nis my firm belief that in the post-cold war world the United States \nmust retain diversity and choice in the means by which it conducts its \nforeign policy. Gutting the radios--on top of the drastic cuts to State \nDepartment operations in the bill--would severely limit U.S. \nflexibility in promoting our goals overseas.\n  Once again, Mr. President, allow me to explain to my colleagues why \nthe freedom radios are still as important today as they were during the \nlast 40 years. Leaders such as Vaclav Havel, Lech Walesa, and Boris \nYeltsin have all testified to the valuable contribution of Radio Free \nEurope/Radio Liberty in the demise of communism in Eastern Europe and \nthe former Soviet Union.\n  Democratic government and market economies have not yet fully taken \nroot in these parts of the world. The radios now offer a dual role: to \nprovide a model of how an independent media should function, and to \nkeep honest those who might seek to reestablish repression of the \npress. A survey of leaders of the former Soviet empire by the open \nmedia research institute found that nearly three-quarters of the \nrespondents felt strongly that Western radio broadcasts were still \nneeded.\n  Some 25 million listeners still tune in to Radio Free Europe/Radio \nLiberty. The radios provide critical information to the people of the \nformer Soviet Union and Eastern Europe about the events in Chechnya and \nthe former Yugoslavia. As you know, controlling the media and spreading \ndisinformation are key strategies of the Bosnian Serb leaders, and in \nseveral new democracies there is only partial news freedom.\n  While Voice of America tells America's story, the radios act as \nsurrogate media in the absence of free and independent media in the \nformer Soviet empire, in Cuba, and now in Communist Asia. They fill the \ninformation gap--in the local languages--where governments deny \ncitizens the fundamental right spelled out in article 19 of the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights: ``To seek, receive, and impart \ninformation and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.''\n  Mr. President, Congress has already authorized a plan to restructure \nand economize the radios. The Appropriations Committee has subjected \nthe programs to further spending reductions. I believe that additional \ncuts for U.S.-sponsored international broadcasting would be contrary to \nAmerican interests abroad, and I urge that the amendment be dropped in \nconference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/10/senate-section/article/S14947-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14947-S14949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       VISIT OF POPE JOHN PAUL II\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe visit of His Holiness, Pope John Paul II, to the United States over \nthe past several days. In the space of just 5 days, the Pope left a \nlasting impression in the lives of millions of his faithful followers, \nincluding many people from the State of Connecticut, thousands of \n\n[[Page S 14948]]\nwhom journeyed to New York to see the Pope in person.\n  As the Rev. Aldo J. Tos, pastor of St. Joseph's Church in Greenwich \nVillage said, ``Let us say the stone has been dropped into the pools of \nhumanity. We await the ripples.'' In the hope of stirring the pools and \nencouraging the ripples, I ask that the text of the Pope's homily at \nthe Mass at Camden Yards in Baltimore on Sunday, as compiled by the \nAssociated Press, be printed in the Record following my remarks. In \nthat homily, the Pope speaks of timeless virtues with a timely message, \nasking us, `` `How ought we to live together?' In seeking an answer to \nthis question, can society exclude moral truth and moral reasoning? Can \nthe Biblical wisdom which played such a formative part in the very \nfounding of your country be excluded from that debate?''\n  Mr. President, we are at a moment in our history when society is \nengaged in serious debate over the place of moral truth in public \npolicy, especially as we grapple with the deteriorating condition of \naspects of our culture. The debate is alive in this Chamber, affecting \nour views and our votes on a wide range of government laws and programs \nthat have an impact on the behavior and destiny of the people of this \nand other nations. As we participate in that debate, we would do well \nto keep these words of Pope John Paul in mind: ``It would indeed be sad \nif the United States were to turn away from that enterprising spirit \nwhich has always sought the most practical and responsible ways of \ncontinuing to share with others the blessings God has richly bestowed \nhere.''\n  The spirit of America (the ``extraordinary human epic,'' as the Pope \nproclaimed) has been lifted up by the visit of this wise and holy man, \nand I hope his words will echo in millions of hearts and inspire many \nto do great things. As Pope John Paul II said, ``Every generation of \nAmericans needs to know that freedom consists not in doing what we \nlike, but in having the right to do what we ought.''\n  The text follows:\n\n Transcript of Pope John Paul II's Homily at Camden Yards, Baltimore, \n                            October 9, 1995\n\n       Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ, each day, the church \n     begins the Liturgy of the Hours with the pslam which we have \n     just prayed together: ``Come, let us sing joyfully to the \n     Lord.'' In that call, ringing down the centuries and echoing \n     across the face of the globe, the psalmist summons the people \n     of God to sing the praises of the Lord and to bear great \n     witness to the marvelous things God has done for us.\n       The psalmist's call to hear the Lord's voice has particular \n     significance for us as we celebrate this Mass in Baltimore. \n     Maryland was the birthplace of the church in colonial \n     America. More than 360 years ago, a small band of Catholics \n     came to the New World to build a home where they could \n     ``singe joyfully to the Lord'' in freedom. They established a \n     colony whose hallmark was religious tolerance, which would \n     later become one of the cultural cornerstones of American \n     democracy. Baltimore is the senior metropolitan See in the \n     United States. Its first bishop, John Carroll, stands out as \n     a model who can still inspire the church in America today. \n     Here we held the great provincial and plenary councils which \n     guided the church's expansion as waves of immigrants came to \n     these shores in search of a better life.\n       Here in Baltimore, in 1884, the bishops of the United \n     States authorized the ``Baltimore Catechism,'' which formed \n     the faith of tens of millions of Catholics for decades. In \n     Baltimore, the country's Catholic school system began under \n     the leadership of Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton. The first \n     seminary in the United States was established here, under the \n     protection of the virgin mother of God, as was America's \n     first Catholic college for women. Since those heroic \n     beginnings, men and women of every race and social class have \n     built the Catholic community we see in America today, a great \n     spiritual movement of witness, of apostolate, of good works, \n     of Catholic institutions and organizations.\n       With warm affection, therefore, I greet your archbishop, \n     Cardinal Keeler, and thank him for his sensitive leadership \n     in this local church and his work on behalf of the bishops' \n     conference. With esteem I greet the other cardinals and \n     bishops present here in great numbers, the priests, deacons \n     and seminarians, the women and men religious, and all God's \n     people, the ``living stones'' whom the spirit uses to build \n     up the body of Christ. I gladly greet the members of the \n     various Christian churches and ecclesial communities. I \n     assure them of the Catholic church's ardent desire to \n     celebrate the jubilee of the year 2000 as a great occasion to \n     move closer to overcoming the divisions of the second \n     millennium. I thank the civil authorities who have wished to \n     share this sacred moment with us.\n       (Remarks in Castilian, followed by this English \n     translation) . . . I greet the Spanish-speaking faithful \n     present here and all those following this Mass on radio or \n     television. The church is your spiritual home. Your parishes, \n     associations, schools and religious education programs need \n     your cooperation and the enthusiasm of your faith. With \n     special affection, I encourage you to transmit your Catholic \n     traditions to the younger generations.\n       Our celebration today speaks to us, speaks to us not only \n     of the past. The eucharist always makes present anew the \n     saving mystery of Christ's death and resurrection, and points \n     to the future definitive fulfillment of God's plan of \n     salvation. Two years ago, at Denver, I was deeply impressed \n     by the vitality of America's young people as they bore \n     enthusiastic witness to their love of Christ, and showed \n     that they were not afraid of the demands of the Gospel. \n     Today, I offer this Mass for a strengthening of that \n     vitality and Christian courage at every level of the \n     church in the United States: among the laity, among the \n     priests and religious, among my brother bishops. The whole \n     church is preparing for the third Christian millennium. \n     The challenge of the great jubilee of the year 2000 is the \n     new evangelization: a deepening of faith and a vigorous \n     response to the Christian vocation to holiness and \n     service. This is what the successor of Peter has come to \n     Baltimore to urge upon each one of you: the courage to \n     bear witness to the gospel of our redemption.\n       In today's Gospel reading, the apostles ask Jesus: \n     ``Increase our faith.'' This must be our constant prayer. \n     Faith is always demanding, because faith leads us beyond \n     ourselves. It leads us directly to God. Faith also imparts a \n     vision of life's purpose and stimulates us to action. The \n     Gospel of Jesus Christ is not a private opinion, a remote \n     spiritual ideal, or a mere program for personal growth. The \n     Gospel is the power which can transform the world! The Gospel \n     is no abstraction: it is the living person of Jesus Christ, \n     the word of God, the reflection of the Father's glory, the \n     Incarnate Son who reveals the deepest meaning of our humanity \n     and the noble destiny to which the whole human family is \n     called. Christ has commanded us to let the light of the \n     Gospel shine forth in our service to society. How can we \n     profess faith in God's word, and then refuse to let it \n     inspire and direct our thinking, our activity, our decisions, \n     and our responsibilities towards one another?\n       In America, Christian faith has found expression in an \n     impressive array of witnesses and achievements. We must \n     recall with gratitude the inspiring work of education carried \n     out in countless families, schools and universities, and all \n     the healing and consolation imparted in hospitals and \n     hospices and shelters. We must give thanks for the practical \n     living out of God's call in devoted service to others, in \n     commitment to social justice, in responsible involvement in \n     political life, in a wide variety of charitable and social \n     organizations, and in the growth of ecumenical and \n     interreligious understanding and cooperation.\n       In a more global context, we should thank God for the great \n     generosity of American Catholics whose support of the foreign \n     missions has greatly contributed to the spiritual and \n     material well-being of their brothers and sisters in other \n     lands. The Church in the United States has sent brave \n     missionary men and women out to the nations, and not a few of \n     them have borne the ultimate witness to the ancient truth \n     that the blood of martyrs is the seed of Christianity. In my \n     visits to Catholic communities around the world I often meet \n     American missionaries, lay, religious and priests. I wish to \n     make an appeal to young Catholics to consider the missionary \n     vocation. I know that the ``spirit of Denver'' is alive in \n     many young hearts.\n       Today, though, some Catholics are tempted to discouragement \n     or disillusionment, like the prophet Habakkuk in the first \n     reading. They are tempted to cry out to the Lord in a \n     different way: why does God not intervene when violence \n     threatens his people; why does God let us see ruin and \n     misery; why does God permit evil? Like the prophet Habakkuk, \n     and like the thirsty Israelites in the desert at Meribah and \n     Massah, our trust can falter; we can lose patience with God. \n     In the drama of history, we can find our dependence upon God \n     burdensome rather than liberating. We too can ``harden our \n     hearts.'' And yet the prophet gives us an answer to our \n     impatience: ``If God delays, wait for him; he will surely \n     come, he will not be late.'' A Polish proverb expresses the \n     same conviction in another way: ``God takes his time, but he \n     is just.'' . . . (Remarks in another language, then English \n     translation): Our waiting for God is never in vain.\n       Every moment is our opportunity to model ourselves on Jesus \n     Christ--to allow the power of the Gospel to transform our \n     personal lives and our service to others, according to the \n     spirit of the Beatitudes. ``Bear your share of the hardship \n     which the gospel entails,'' writes Paul to Timothy in today's \n     second reading. This is no idle exhortation to endurance. No, \n     it is an invitation to enter more deeply into the Christian \n     vocation which belongs to us all by Baptism. There is no evil \n     to be faced that Christ does not face with us. There is no \n     enemy that Christ has not already conquered. There is no \n     cross to bear that Christ has not already borne for us, and \n     does not now bear with us. And on the far side of every cross \n     we find the newness of life in the Holy Spirit, that new life \n     which will reach its fulfillment in the resurrection. This is \n     our faith. This is our witness before the world.\n\n[[Page S 14949]]\n\n       Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ: ``The spirit God has \n     given us is no cowardly spirit. . . . Therefore, never be \n     ashamed of your testimony to our Lord.''\n       Thus wrote St. Paul to Timothy, almost 2,000 years ago; \n     thus speaks the church to American Catholics today. Christian \n     witness takes different forms at different moments in the \n     life of a nation. Sometimes, witnessing to Christ will mean \n     drawing out of a culture the full meaning of its noblest \n     intentions, a fullness that is revealed in Christ. At other \n     times, witnessing to Christ means challenging that culture, \n     especially when the truth about the human person is under \n     assault. America has always wanted to be a land of the free. \n     Today, the challenge facing America is to find freedom's \n     fulfillment in the truth: the truth that is intrinsic to \n     human life created in God's image and likeness, the truth \n     that is written on the human heart, the truth that can be \n     known by reason and can therefore form the basis of a \n     profound and universal dialogue among people about the \n     direction they must give to their lives and their activities.\n       One hundred thirty years ago, President Abraham Lincoln \n     asked whether a nation ``conceived in liberty and dedicated \n     to the proposition that all men are created equal'' could \n     ``long endure.'' President Lincoln's question is no less a \n     question for the present generation of Americans. Democracy \n     cannot be sustained without a shared commitment to certain \n     moral truths about the human person and human community. The \n     basic question before a democratic society is: ``How ought we \n     live together?'' In seeking an answer to this question, can \n     society exclude moral truth and moral reasoning? Can the \n     Biblical wisdom which played such a formative part in the \n     very founding of your country be excluded from that debate?\n       Would not doing so means that tens of millions of Americans \n     could no longer offer the contributions of their deepest \n     convictions to the formation of public policy? Surely it is \n     important for America that the moral truths which make \n     freedom possible should be passed on to each new generation. \n     Every generation of Americans needs to know that freedom \n     consists not in doing what we like, but in having the right \n     to do what we ought.\n       How appropriate is St. Paul's charge to Timothy! ``Guard \n     the rich deposit of faith with the help of the Holy Spirit \n     who dwells within us.'' That charge speaks to parents and \n     teachers; it speaks in a special and urgent way to you, my \n     brother bishops, successors of the apostles. Christ asks us \n     to guard the truth because, as he promised us: ``You will \n     know the truth and the truth will make you free.'' Depositum \n     custodi! We must guard the truth that is the condition of \n     authentic freedom, the truth that allows freedom to be \n     fulfilled in goodness. We must guard the deposit of divine \n     truth handed down to us in the church, especially in view of \n     the challenges posed by a materialistic culture and by a \n     permissive mentality that reduces freedom to license. But we \n     bishops must do more than guard this truth. We must proclaim \n     it, in season and out of season; we must celebrate it with \n     God's people, in the sacraments; we must live it in charity \n     and service; we must bear public witness to the truth that is \n     Jesus Christ.\n       Dear brothers and sisters: Catholics of America! Always be \n     guided by the truth--by the truth about God who created and \n     redeemed us, and by the truth about the human person, made in \n     the image and likeness of God and destined for a glorious \n     fulfillment in the Kingdom to come. Always be convincing \n     witnesses to the truth. ``Stir into a flame the gift of God'' \n     that has been bestowed upon you in baptism. Light your \n     nation--light the world--with the power of that flame! \n     Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/10/senate-section/article/S14947-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO BOBBY RAY MEMORIAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, tomorrow afternoon, several of my \nfellow Tennesseans will dedicate a new elementary school that honors a \nvery special war hero from McMinnville. I will not be able to join them \nin this celebration but would like to take a moment to recognize the \nvalor and determination of David Robert Ray and wish the students and \nfaculty at Bobby Ray Memorial Elementary the very best in their new \nschool.\n  A hospital corpsman second class [HC2c] in the U.S. Navy, Bobby Ray \nserved in South Vietnam as a Marine medic. When this country called, he \nleft his home in McMinnville to help his fellow countrymen who were \nfighting a foreign people on foreign soil. His life was dedicated to \nsaving others, and he always did it with commitment and courage even as \ngunshots and mortar shells blasted around him.\n  On March 19, 1969, at the age of 24, Bobby Ray went above and beyond \nthe call of duty. As enemy troops began a heavy assault on the Marines' \nBattery D. Ray began working on the serious and heavy casualties that \nfell from rocket and mortar blasts. As he treated a fallen marine, Ray \nhimself became seriously wounded. Refusing medical help, he continued \nto provide emergency medical treatment to the other casualties. As the \nenemy drew closer, Ray was forced to battle oncoming soldiers while he \nadministered medical aid. He did this until he ran out of ammunition \nand was fatally wounded. But before he died, Bobby Ray performed one \nmore lifesaving act. He threw himself on the last patient he ever \ntreated and saved him from an enemy grenade.\n  Hospital Corpsman Second Class David Robert Ray gave his own life to \nsave the lives of many others. He became an inspiration to the soldiers \nin Battery D, who went on to defeat the enemy. For this ultimate \nsacrifice, the United States awarded Ray the Medal of Honor \nposthumously.\n  Tomorrow, Bobby Ray's family and hometown friends will gather in his \nhonor to dedicate the Bobby Ray Memorial Elementary School. The \nstudents who attend this school will never know David Robert Ray--they \nare too young. But they will know of his dedication to serving his \ncountry and to saving the lives of others. Without ever meeting him, \nthese children will know who Bobby Ray was, and hopefully, will learn \nfrom his incredible act of selflessness.\n  So, today, Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to Bobby Ray, \nthe man, the medic, the soldier, and the hero. And today, I wish to \nthank him and every American who has given the ultimate sacrifice to \nserve their country and their countrymen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/10/senate-section/article/S14949-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               LOU PANOS\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to call to the \nattention of my colleagues the establishment of a scholarship at Towson \nState University's School of Communications in honor of my good friend \nLou Panos, dean of Maryland's journalistic community. The scholarship \nmarks this distinguished Marylander's 70th birthday and I can think of \nnot more fitting way for him to be honored.\n  Anyone who has had the good fortune to have worked with Lou in his \nmany public capacities would immediately describe him as a solid \nprofessional and an unusually civil practitioner of his craft. He has \ncombined with these sterling personal qualities his thoughtfulness and \na sense of fairness which has consistently singled him out among his \ncontemporaries. Lou Panos' long and distinguished career reflects his \nlongtime commitment to public service. He has been involved in a wide \nrange of public service: as a sergeant at arms in the U.S. Army, 1944-\n46, as a journalist, as press secretary to Gov. Harry Hughes, and as \nthe director of public affairs for the Maryland Shock Trauma Center and \nthe Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services Systems.\n  In view of Lou Panos' commitment to high personal and professional \nstandards, this scholarship represents his dedication to opportunity \nand education. It is my hope that this scholarship will provide the \nchance for deserving young people to follow in his path.\n  I want to take this opportunity to congratulate all those who were \ninvolved in instituting this scholarship, Pautuxent Papers and Towson \nState University's School of Communications, and the friends and \ncolleagues of this most amiable Marylander. I know that all of those \ninvolved in this tribute share in my deep appreciation for Lou's \noutstanding leadership over the years. On this important occasion, I am \npleased to join in saluting Lou Panos for his renowned service and in \nwishing him the very best in the years ahead. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/10/senate-section/article/S14949-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14949-S14950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EDUCATION CUTS JUST AREN'T SMART\n\n\n Slashing education hurts productivity, causes long-term economic pain\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are confronting a crucial point \nin the history of our Nation. The next few decades could determine \nwhether America has what it takes to adjust to a more competitive world \nwith global markets. And quality education will be the key.\n  This Nation has enjoyed the greatest education system in the world. \nWe cannot let up now, as the nature of our workforce changes. Global \ncompetition is putting greater and greater pressure on our workers, \nmaking it more important than ever that Americans have the educational \ntools they need to stay competitive and become even more productive. \n\n[[Page S 14950]]\n\n  That is why I am astounded that the Senate Appropriations Committee \nhas approved an education funding bill that slashes our investment in \neducation by $2.2 billion--a 7.7 percent reduction below the 1995 \namount.\n  Yet, this Congress passed a Defense appropriations bill that provides \n$6.7 billion more in spending for defense programs than the Pentagon \nwanted or believes we need. It makes no sense to take $2 to $3 billion \nfrom education while questionable military projects like star wars \nreceive increased funding. In fact, eliminating funding for two \namphibious ships, which were added to the defense bill by the \nRepublican Congress, could restore education spending to the 1995 \nlevel.\n  I find it unconscionable to deny more than 55,000 low-income children \nthe opportunity to enroll in Head Start or to deny 6.5 million \ndisadvantaged kids the help they need to improve their math and reading \nskills in order to pay for unneeded military hardware. We are saying to \nlocal school districts that we cannot afford to help them implement the \nreform plans they have developed--but we can afford an enormous \nincrease in our defense spending that the military experts say we do \nnot need.\n  I hear from parents and students in North Dakota and across the \ncountry every week about the difficult time they are having paying for \na college education. And yet the majority party in Congress has \nresponded by cutting Federal financial aid by 11.4 percent and higher \neducation by 7.5 percent.\n  If these programs are not an investment in our Nation's defense, then \nI do not know what is. I think these education cuts will prove to be \ndevastating for the future of our country. Education ought to rank at \nthe top of the national agenda, and if funding is not restored to \nreasonable levels, I will find it impossible to support this \nappropriations bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/10/senate-section/article/S14949-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14950-S14951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE MEXICAN BAILOUT AND PROPOSED BAILOUT FUND\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise this evening because the annual \nmeeting of the International Monetary Fund, IMF, and the World Bank are \nbeing held in Washington this week; as a matter of fact, this very \nevening. As financial leaders gather from all over the world, I think \nit is incumbent that we review recent developments concerning the IMF, \nthe Mexican bailout and the IMF's proposed international bailout fund.\n  The IMF recently released its annual survey of global capital \nmarkets, which includes an analysis of the Mexican peso crisis. This \nIMF report confirms many of the concerns that I have expressed since \nthe beginning of the year. The IMF report also raises many troubling \nquestions.\n  First, did the Mexican Government persuade the U.S. officials to \napprove a loan package by exaggerating this crisis after denying there \nwas a problem for over a year? And by overstating the crisis, did the \nMexican Government increase its own problems and further destabilize \nthe peso?\n  Second, was the bailout, as structured, really necessary? The Mexican \nGovernment and the Clinton administration claimed that without the \nbailout, conditions in Mexico would have been far worse. But the \nsituation in Mexico is a disaster. Just ask the Mexican people.\n  Third, was the crisis in Mexico certain to spread to other emerging \nmarkets? That is the rumor that was spread. That is what Congress was \ntold. According to the IMF report, the answer is no. The IMF report \nstates that:\n\n     once the panic trading subsided, markets discriminated, \n     albeit imperfectly, among countries according to the quality \n     of their economic fundamentals.\n\n  Fourth, should the administration have sent American taxpayers' \ndollars to pay off rich tesobono holders? The administration pushed \nthis bailout plan without a single vote of Congress. The American \npeople should not have been forced to bear the financial risk of the \nMexican Government and foreign investors. The administration should not \nhave soothed the pains of speculative investors at the expense of the \nAmerican taxpayers and the Mexican people.\n  Mr. President, we now know that the U.S. tax dollars were sent to \nMexico to bail out speculators. In fact, the IMF report indicates that \nthe peso's devaluation was precipitated and made far worse by the \nmassive withdrawal of money by Mexican and foreign investors. We now \nknow that Mexican investors who had a firsthand view of Mexico's \nrapidly deteriorating political and economic situation in 1994 were the \nfirst to cash in their holdings and take their money out of the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, the IMF report underscores the initial question that \nthe American taxpayers have asked over and over: Why were billions of \nAmerican taxpayers' dollars sent to a foreign country that was first \nabandoned by its own wealthy citizens, citizens who, Mr. President, had \ninside information and bailed out?\n  At a minimum, the Mexican Government should have looked to its own \nrich countrymen for help before turning to U.S. taxpayers to bail them \nout. At a minimum, our Treasury Department should have insisted upon \nthat.\n  The IMF report confirms that the Mexican Government withheld \nimportant financial data and provided inaccurate and overly optimistic \neconomic forecasts. If a country does not provide complete and accurate \ndisclosure of key economic figures, we should punish this deception, \nnot reward it.\n  Mr. President, I am also troubled by the IMF's role in the Mexican \npeso crisis. I am deeply concerned by the recent Whittome report, an \ninternal study which focuses on the IMF's review of economic conditions \nin Mexico. Unfortunately, the U.S. Department of Treasury has \nclassified this report. But according to news articles in the \ninternational press service, the Whittome report concluded that the IMF \ndistorted its own reporting on Mexico in response to political pressure \nfrom the Mexican Government.\n  Why is this report being withheld from the American public and the \nCongress? We have a right to know what happened in this Mexican \nbailout. Unfortunately, this administration has made a habit of \nconcealment. The Treasury Department has classified the Whittome report \nso the American people cannot read it and make their own judgment about \nhow this crisis was handled. Mr. President, that is wrong. People have \na right to know.\n  The Mexican Government has been less than candid with the American \npeople and the world financial markets. The administration should not \nbe aiding them in their disingenuous behavior. We should not reward bad \neconomic policies or deception. That report should be made public.\n  The IMF and the World Bank and the Clinton administration have \nproposed the creation of a $50 billion bailout fund to handle future \nMexico-style crises. I am opposed to using U.S. taxpayers' dollars to \nsupport this bailout fund.\n  The American taxpayers have already been forced to contribute more \nthan their fair share. The Mexican bailout was billed to the Congress \nand the American people as an international effort, but American \ntaxpayers were left holding the bag.\n  The American people are sick and tired of picking up the check. We \nstill have not been paid back for the first bailout, and despite last \nweek's propaganda, I doubt we ever will be. The Mexican Government and \nthe U.S. Treasury have proudly proclaimed that the prepayment of $700 \nmillion of a $12.5 billion debt shows the bailout was a success.\n  What they have not told us is that this so-called ``prepayment'' of \n$700 million is only a fraction of the $2 billion that is due in a few \nweeks. What about the remaining $1.3 billion that is due at that time? \nIt is no accident that this publicity coincides with Mexican President \nZedillo's visit to Washington and the IMF's annual meeting.\n  I do not see how we can have a serious discussion about increasing \nthe amount of money the IMF makes available to bail out other countries \nif we cannot trust the IMF's own reports, if we do not even get to the \nsee the IMF's report, if the Treasury Department classifies it.\n  The IMF's future role in the world economy must be reexamined, \nespecially in the light of the disturbing reports that the fund has \nbecome too easily swayed and manipulated by political pressures. We \nmust demand candor, honesty, and good business judgment from our own \nofficials and from anyone else asking for U.S. taxpayers' dollars. The \nAmerican people deserve accountability. As the World Bank and the \n\n[[Page S 14951]]\nIMF consider international bailout funds and other mechanics that deal \nwith global economic problems, the Congress must not be idle.\n  Mr. President, the Congress must remain vigilant in its efforts to \nprotect taxpayers' dollars. We will be watching for the full payment \nfrom the Mexican Government at the end of this month, and we will be \nclosely reviewing any proposed international bailout fund. If the \nadministration is ready to declare the Mexican bailout a success, then \nwe should have immediate repayment of the entire $12.5 billion of \ntaxpayers' money.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/10/senate-section/article/S14950-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14951-S14952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PRAISING SOUTH DAKOTA YOUNG PEOPLE\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise today to praise Paul Glader, a \nyoung man from my home State of South Dakota. Although only 17, Paul \nhas accomplished much. At his young age, he already is an experienced, \nsuccessful journalist, having published several articles in local and \nregional newspapers. Paul is, indeed, a talented, articulate person.\n  I always am pleased and impressed with the accomplishments of young \nSouth Dakotans. Paul and other talented, young South Dakotans represent \nthe future of my State. I am proud of their successes. I encourage and \nsupport their efforts.\n  Mr. President, Paul recently sent me three articles he published \nwhile working as a news editorial intern at the Indianapolis News. The \narticles demonstrate that Paul Glader has a promising, exciting future. \nI look forward to seeing more of Paul's work as he pursues his career. \nI am pleased to ask unanimous consent that three of his columns be \nprinted in the Record at the end of my remarks. Again, my \ncongratulations to Paul Glader. I wish him continued success.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Indianapolis News, July 6, 1995]\n\n                       Changing Prisoners' Paths\n\n                            (By Paul Glader)\n\n       An innovative prison industry program in Florida is proof \n     that prisons sometimes can develop good citizens rather than \n     hardened criminals.\n       At a prison in Dade County, 85 inmates manufacture modular \n     homes for Prison Rehabilitative Industries & Diversified \n     Enterprises Inc., better known as PRIDE. While they work, \n     they learn marketable skills in carpentry, electrical \n     installation, plumbing and air conditioning.\n       During fiscal 1993-94, more than 5,200 Florida inmates \n     worked for PRIDE. Today, some of the men grow crops and \n     livestock, while others learn upholstery, printing, \n     dentistry, optical work, tire retreading, computers, \n     merchandise or architecture.\n       Since PRIDE was chartered by the Florida Legislature in \n     1981, the corporation has operated 57 industries at 22 state \n     correctional institutions across Florida.\n       By now, you are wondering how much it costs Florida \n     taxpayers to pay PRIDE.\n       Nothing.\n       By non-profit, public/private corporation finished in the \n     black this year with gross sales of $78 million and net \n     earnings of $4 million. Out of that $4 million, it paid \n     nearly $1.2 million to the Department of Correction for \n     inmate incarceration, $635,000 for inmate services and \n     $261,000 for victim restitution, retaining a $1.9 million \n     surplus.\n       Obviously, the program works well economically. But that is \n     not the only benefit and certainly not the most important.\n       Through teaching skills, PRIDE reduces prison idleness, \n     provides incentive for good behavior and reduces the cost to \n     state government.\n       PRIDE also is placing prisoners in jobs after they leave \n     prison. Many are becoming productive rather then destructive \n     citizens because of newfound skills and character.\n       David Jackson, a former inmate and PRIDE worker, now works \n     at Premdor Inc. of Tampa and makes wood doors, Premdor \n     General Manager Frank Moore said that David started as a \n     laborer and worked his way up to lead man of the paint \n     department, supervising three other workers.\n       Jackson recently was named employee of the month at \n     Premdor, ``I love my job,'' he said. Jackson also said he \n     learned a work ethic at PRIDE of staying with a project until \n     it was finished and doing the best possible quality of work.\n       A tracking study of 3,876 PRIDE graduates from 1991 through \n     1994 showed 873 of them had jobs upon release from prison. Of \n     those 873, only 11 percent returned to prison. That is \n     significant compared to the national recidivism rate of 70 \n     percent.\n       PRIDE officials said that they help prisoners with housing, \n     transportation, clothing and support when they are released \n     so they can land on their feet and start working right away.\n       Sometimes PRIDE employees have an extra motivation for hard \n     work. Female inmates in PRIDE's textile industry sew their \n     own garments. Briefs they sew are purchased by all female \n     correctional institutions in Florida. They may end up wearing \n     what they made.\n       PRIDE workers also have made silk screen decals for St. \n     Petersburg police cars. These inmates, who may have ridden in \n     the cars as detainees before sprucing them up, impressed \n     Officer Pete Venero. ``They do fantastic work for real \n     competitive prices,'' he said.\n       From a public policy standpoint, PRIDE is like a glass of \n     ice water to a parched throat.\n       Both political parties sing the woeful ballads of prison \n     overcrowding, repeat offenders and prisons' cost to \n     taxpayers. Here is a remedy that works.\n       There is a lesson here for Indiana, Mayor Stephen Goldsmith \n     has brought the idea of privatization and competition to city \n     government. The race for governor in 1996 ought to include \n     some PRIDE-like proposals for expanding Indiana's prison \n     industries.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Indianapolis News, May 24, 1995]\n\n                      Saying Bye to Backyard Nukes\n\n                            (By Paul Glader)\n\n       I lived with the Cold War in may backyard.\n       Ranchers around my area in remote South Dakota sold 1.5-\n     acre sections of their land to serve as nuclear missile \n     launch pads for the U.S. Air Force nearly 30 years ago. More \n     than 13,500 acres in South Dakota were used for this purpose.\n       The government purposefully put the missiles in states such \n     as South Dakota, North Dakota and Wyoming because of their \n     low populations.\n       Razor wire surrounded the spots, and missile silos tunneled \n     60 feet below the surface. A Minuteman II missile rested \n     inside each silo. Small bases were built to house the \n     soldiers who monitored the groups of missile sites.\n       Occasionally, the soldiers would allow schoolchildren to \n     tour the bases, where they would explain how the missiles \n     program worked. In general, however, people in the area \n     understood little about the international significance of the \n     projectiles in their pastures.\n       To think that this prairie--their homes and cattle \n     industry--could be in the sights of the Soviet Union's \n     military was a sick contrast to the quiet, peaceful ranch \n     country.\n       Cows grazed around the sites. The high-tech mesh of metal \n     and wires contrasted with the dry rolling plains.\n       My sister and I would use the missile stations as \n     checkpoints when we rode our bikes up the long gravel roads.\n       Armored vehicles periodically zoomed up and down the roads \n     to check on disturbances at the missile sites. Often, the \n     culprits were only birds flying past the radar.\n       Nearly two years ago, the Air Force vehicles stopped \n     zooming past.\n       Camouflaged personnel disappeared.\n       Monstrous Air Force semi-trucks came and hauled away the \n     unearthed missiles.\n       For a time, the silos lay empty.\n       Then the government contracted with blasting firms to come \n     and implode the silos with dynamite. This measure was \n     required under the START I treaty.\n       While home this winter, I covered the blast project for \n     several newspapers in my area. The Air Force officials let \n     the rancher push the button to detonate the implosion on his \n     land. Rather than watching catastrophic destruction, I \n     witnessed a small BOOM and a mushroom puff of dirt.\n       It is the end of an era for the U.S. military.\n       The Cold War seemed like a gigantic game of chicken that \n     never developed. We can be thankful, however, that the \n     weapon-holders didn't act prematurely.\n       Sometimes when you hear about highly complex international \n     disarmament pacts such as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty and START I and II treaties, it is easy to be \n     confused. It is easy to wonder, ``Are they actually \n     disarming?''\n       But you can be assured by South Dakota's common people that \n     START treaties are followed on this side of the ocean.\n       The missile wing in ranch country brought down utility \n     bills, and the Air Force paid for maintenance of the gravel \n     roads. On one hand, many of us were disappointed to see the \n     money leave our vast, poor land.\n       On the other hand, people there may find joy in the fact \n     that we finally may be off the Russian surveillance system.\n       But in the perspective of most, the missiles and personnel \n     just came and went.\n       Life hasn't changed too much for us. We still have to fight \n     our own Cold War every winter when we put on our coveralls \n     and go feed the cows.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Indianapolis News, July 20, 1995]\n\n                       Leaving the Frontier Land\n\n                            (By Paul Glader)\n\n       Leaving a place called Opal to move to the other side of \n     South Dakota with my family last month was the most difficult \n     departure I've ever made.\n       Actually, Opal is not a town; it is a ranching community. \n     It has a post office (run by a ranchwife in her basement); a \n     K-8 school (two rooms located seven miles east of the post \n     office); a fire department (a rancher's garage storing two \n     watertanks on gooseneck trailers ready to hitch to a pickup); \n     and a small community church.\n       During the first week after our family moved to the small, \n     double-wide trailer-\n\n[[Page S 14952]]\n     house at Opal, we found out some of the fringe benefits of my father's \n     position as country preacher to this ranching community: Mail \n     comes three times a week; everybody burns his own trash; you \n     don't have to respect the 55 mph signs that dot the vast \n     system of gravel roads; and rattlesnakes will keep you \n     company when you are lonely.\n       Some visitors to Opal likened the place to a desert with \n     its dry, yellow grasslands. But those who live around Opal \n     feel it's a haven, partly because some of them own 10,000 or \n     more acres of ranchland there. Their ranches are their \n     castles and their sources of income.\n       My family did not own cattle or land. We were outsiders \n     coming in. We adapted to the area and loved the people but \n     still felt separate. You have to be born into a ranch family \n     to be a cowboy. I knew I would never become one.\n       But now that we have moved from Opal, I see the profound \n     impact Opal and its people had on my life, even though I \n     remained a city-slicker while I was there.\n       A natural development for young boys was to seek work as a \n     junior ranch hand. I worked for many ranchers, mostly hoeing \n     tree patches, cleaning sheep barns, occasionally driving \n     tractors and helping with sheep shearings.\n       One rancher, Clair Weiss, often had me hoe his eight-row \n     tree patch. (Each row, by the way, was about 200 yards long.) \n     I remember baking in the sun while chopping the 3-foot high \n     weeds down from around the small cedar trees.\n       Some boys who grow up on the plains love the adventuresome, \n     back-breaking cowboy life and grow up to own ranches. As I \n     hoed my way past long rows of trees, I knew I couldn't spend \n     my life in this place. But I realized that somehow, this \n     exhausting labor in the hot sun would be to my benefit in the \n     long run.\n       I knew I had to finish the job, and do it well, or Weiss \n     wouldn't be pleased with me. Today, I cherish that early \n     lesson complete with blisters and sunburn because the work \n     ethic has stayed with me in jobs since them.\n       When I was 14, I met a hermit. He lived three miles from me \n     as a crow flies. Through the years, he has become one of my \n     best friends. He left art, academia and business to find \n     truth and serenity away from the fast-paced world. He only \n     gets to town about twice a year for supplies.\n       This modern-day hermit counseled me to continue learning \n     rather than spend my time on pleasure, as did many of my \n     peers.\n       He always told me of his new experiments with animals, such \n     as training his dog, geese, turkeys and pheasants to get \n     along. He also trained his geese to fly alongside his pickup \n     truck.\n       He started teaching me photography, and took my senior \n     pictures for no charge. He had dinner with my family and made \n     dinner for our family many times.\n       We talked on the phone at least three times a week. Our \n     conversations ranged from the adverse effects of Keynesian \n     economics to gardening techniques.\n       He understood my desires for culture, knowledge and success \n     because he once had them.\n       He calls me his grandson. I call him ``grampaw.'' Now that \n     I am gone, our relationship will have to be maintained \n     through phone calls and letters instead of regular get-\n     togethers.\n       I miss my ascetic grampaw. I miss the boots, wranglers, \n     belt buckles and cowboy hats.\n       Sometimes we don't realize the good things until we have \n     left them. Now that I have moved, I see there is no place on \n     earth like Opal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/10/senate-section/article/S14951-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO NORMAN SANDAGER\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I rise to pay special tribute to \nNorman Sandager, a South Dakotan and a veteran of the Korean war. \nNorman represents the very best our Nation sent to Korea when on June \n25, 1950, the North Korean People's Army swept over the 38th parallel \nin an effort to extinguish the light of freedom for the people of South \nKorea. As a U.S. marine, and commander of a machine gun squadron, \nNorman Sandager helped thrust back an invading tide of communist \naggression in South Korea. In fact, Norman successfully led his machine \ngun squadron of 13 men through 200 days of combat without losing a \nsingle soldier or taking any wounded in his group. Norman's achievement \nspeaks highly of his courage and commitment.\n  Mr. President, the Korean war is sometimes referred to as the \n``forgotten war,'' possibly because it so closely followed the Second \nWorld War and was in many ways overshadowed by the divisive Vietnam \nwar. Nevertheless, Norman's service and sacrifice are not forgotten. \nNorman put his life in harm's way by crossing the 38th parallel five \ntimes on behalf of a people he did not know except for the shared bond \nof liberty and freedom. In doing so he has enobled himself and our \nNation. It is for his service and the service of thousands of brave, \npatriotic Americans that we recently dedicated the Korean War \nMemorial--a moving tribute to those who served. As a Vietnam veteran \nmyself, having served in the United States Army, I extend my sincere \nappreciation for his answering the call to duty more than 40 years ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/10/senate-section/article/S14952-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--EXTRADITION TREATY WITH BOLIVIA, \n                       TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 104-22\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM.

Those notes set forth the expectations of the \ntwo Governments regarding the types of assistance each Government would \nprovide to the other in extradition proceedings, pursuant to Article \nXVI of the Treaty.\n  The Treaty establishes the conditions and procedures for extradition \nbetween the United States and Bolivia. It also provides a legal basis \nfor temporarily surrendering prisoners to stand trial for crimes \nagainst the laws of the Requesting State.\n  The Treaty represents an important step in combatting narcotics \ntrafficking and terrorism, by providing for the mandatory extradition \nof nationals of the Requested State in a broad range of serious \ncriminal offenses.\n  The provisions in this Treaty are substantively similar to those of \nother extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States.\n  This Treaty will make a significant contribution to international \ncooperation in law enforcement. I recommend that the Senate give early \nand favorable consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and \nconsent to ratification.\n                                                  William J.
