Mr. President, I have the first motion to instruct the \nconferees, and this motion does, in fact, relate to the nursing home \nstandards. Is it in order now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it is in order.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I send my motion to the desk to instruct \nconferees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                      motion to instruct conferees\n\n       Mr. Pryor moves that the managers on the part of the Senate \n     at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses \n     on the Senate amendments to the bill H.R. 2491 be instructed \n     to insist upon maintaining the Federal nursing home reform \n     provisions of law that were enacted as part of the Omnibus \n     Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 and that provide for \n     Federal quality standards and mechanisms for enforcement of \n     such standards for nursing homes under the medicare and \n     medicaid programs without an option for a State to receive a \n     waiver of such standards.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nArkansas is recognized for 40 minutes.\n  The Senator from Michigan will be recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, later today, the U.S. Senate is going to be \nmaking a very, very interesting decision relating to the choice of the \nstandards that we are going to employ for the 2 million nursing home \nresidents who are today residing in America's nursing homes.\n  By the year 2030, Mr. President, we will no longer have 2 million \nnursing home residents. We are going to have 4.3 million nursing home \nresidents residing in America's nursing homes. The question that we are \ngoing to decide this afternoon, Mr. President, is going to be that \nchoice that we express as to which standards and how high the standards \nwill be of protection--or I should say the protection for these nursing \nhome residents who today reside in America's nursing homes.\n  In 1987, the U.S. Congress decided, after serious studies, after \nabsolute horror stories, that it was time to have uniform standards on \nthe Federal level. In 1987, for the first time, sweeping reform \nmeasures, sweeping standards were enacted in what we call now OBRA '87. \nMr. President, necessitating this action was the fact that many of the \nStates were not complying with the law, nor were they enforcing present \nState standards, nor was there a uniform code of standards nationwide \nthat governed the policing, you might say, the regulating and the \nstandard setting that protected nursing home patients.\n  OBRA '87 came about. Today we are proud to report that, last evening, \napproximately 142,000 nursing home residents in America went to bed, \nwent to sleep unrestrained. We are proud to report, Mr. President, that \n30,000 nursing home patients today in America do not have bedsores \nbecause of the nursing home reforms and the strict guidelines of 1987.\n  In 1987, it was not a partisan effort. In fact, the late Senator John \nHeinz, former Senator Durenberger, former Senator Mitchell, majority \nleader George Mitchell of Maine, and many others in the Senate \ncoalesced to bring about a bipartisan effort to have uniform, very \ncarefully crafted procedures and standards on the national level, \nwhereby these nursing home residents would be protected.\n  Mr. President, the irony of all of this argument today is, I do not \nknow why this issue is before the U.S. Senate. These standards were \nworking. In fact, these standards were working very well.\n  I ask unanimous consent that each of these letters I will refer to be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Beverly Enterprises, Inc.,\n\n                                 Fort Smith, AR, October 25, 1995.\n     Hon. David Pryor,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pryor: Beverly Enterprises, the nation's \n     largest provider of long term care services in the United \n     States, supports strong, uniform and consistent Federal \n     Standards for nursing homes and believes the focus of current \n     efforts should be on improving, not eliminating the current \n     standards.\n       Since Congress enacted the Nursing Home Reform Statute of \n     1987 (OBRA '87), Beverly has supported the Statute and \n     continues to support the retention of Federal Standards.\n       It is critical that the health, well-being and dignity of \n     our nation's elderly citizens be protected in every nursing \n     home in the country. We believe that Federal quality \n     standards are an effective way to ensure that this is \n     achieved.\n       Beverly's commitment to the OBRA '87 Standards is evidenced \n     by our institution's training programs throughout the company \n     and the adoption and application of standards that in many \n     instances exceed OBRA requirements. Prior to the \n     implementation of OBRA '87, in October of 1990, our quality \n     Management program required our facilities to meet standards \n     similar to those required by OBRA '87. As a result we have \n     exceeded the compliance rate of the industry as a whole for \n     the last five years. The recent Consumer Report study \n     recognized Beverly's compliance rates.\n       We recognize the need for industry-wide standards. We agree \n     fully that there must be uniformity and consistency in \n     quality standards across the States. OBRA '87 has been an \n     impartial landmark in setting the ground work and we urge \n     Congress not to eliminate the progress that has been made in \n     improving the care provided to our nation's frail elderly.\n           Sincerely,\n     David Banks.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n   Statement of Stewart Bainum, Jr., Submitted to the Senate Special \n                  Committee on Aging, October 26, 1995\n\n       As the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Manor Care, \n     Inc., I want to express our strong support for retention of \n     the Nursing Home Reform Act of 1987 (OBRA `87). Manor Care \n     owns and operates 170 skilled nursing \n\n[[Page S 16945]]\n     facilities in 28 states, and provides care to over 20,000 residents.\n       The OBRA `87 reforms represent the most comprehensive \n     revision of nursing home regulations since the inception the \n     Medicare and Medicaid programs in the sixties. As I recall, \n     the bill was over 1000 pages long, and addressed critical \n     areas of care, such as resident assessment and care planning, \n     nurse aid training and testing, resident rights, nurse \n     staffing ratios, and enforcement. The final product reflected \n     the agreement reached among 60 national organizations, \n     representing consumers, seniors, providers, and state \n     regulators. It was a painstaking process that worked. In \n     fact, OBRA might depict one of the finest collaborative \n     achievements ever in the history of health care legislation.\n       Manor Care proudly supported OBRA in 1987 because the \n     legislation offered a valuable means of protecting and \n     promoting the quality of life for one of the most vulnerable \n     segments of our population. We must afford nursing home \n     residents an environment which is safe and ensures their \n     physical and mental well-being. OBRA `87 has been widely \n     successful in accomplishing this goal.\n       Manor Care pledges to continue to meet these federal \n     quality standards because they are reasonable, and have led \n     to significant improvements in the care delivered to our \n     residents. As a national company, we are supportive of the \n     uniformity and consistency these standards provide across the \n     states.\n        OBRA created a system of care delivery to help guarantee \n     the dignity and respect of institutionalized seniors. Do not \n     undo the valuable work that has been done. We ask that \n     Congress support retention of the Nursing Home Reform Act and \n     its standards. Stated most simply, it is the right thing to \n     do.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, one of the letters is from Beverly \nEnterprises, dated October 25, 1995. This is the largest provider of \nlong-term care services in the United States, supporting keeping the \nstronger--not the weaker--standards embodied in this concept and \ninstructing our conferees to maintain the strongest nursing home \nstandards.\n  I will quote from the letter:\n\n       Beverly Enterprises, the nation's largest provider of long-\n     term care services in the United States, supports strong \n     uniform and consistent Federal standards for nursing homes \n     and believes the focus of current efforts should be on \n     improving, not eliminating the current standards.\n\n  This is signed by David Banks, the chief operating officer and \nchairman of the board of Beverly Enterprises.\n  Here is a statement of Stewart Bainum, Jr., to the Special Committee \non Aging, October 26, 1995.\n\n       As Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Manor Care, \n     Inc., I want to express our strong support for retention of \n     the Nursing Home Reform Act of 1987.\n       Manor Care proudly supported OBRA in 1987 because the \n     legislation offered a valuable means of protecting and \n     promoting the quality of life of one of the most vulnerable \n     segments of our population.\n\n  Mr. President, what we have seen is, once again, that these standards \nare working so well--they are working as the Congress intended them to \nwork--and we have seen a dramatic decrease in the dehydration of \nnursing home residents, a 50-percent decrease in dehydration since \n1987. Second, we have seen a remarkable decrease of physical \nrestraints, some 50 percent, as compared to pre-1987 periods. We have \nseen a remarkable decrease in indwelling urinary catheters used on \nnursing home residents. We also point with great pride to that \nsignificant victory. Across the board, the nursing home regulations \nhave not only worked, but they have worked well and they are working \ntoday.\n  So why are we trying to repeal the nursing home standards that \neveryone agreed to in 1987, that even the major providers agree to \ntoday, that all of the statistics show are working, that the nursing \nhome residents are being protected, as they have been never before \nprotected in our nursing homes? Why is it that we are suddenly trying \nto eliminate these standards?\n  Mr. President, to me, that is a mystery.\n  On October 27, by a vote of 51 to 48 in this Chamber, the Senate went \non record as adopting the more stringent and retaining the Federal \nstandards for nursing home protection.\n  A short while later, only about 6 hours later, Mr. President, we were \ndiscussing and had laid before the Senate the so-called Roth amendment \nwhich was sponsored by our colleague and friend, Senator Roth, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee.\n  By a vote of 57 to 42, Senator Roth's amendment prevailed. In my \nopinion and in the opinion of others, Mr. President, we dramatically, I \nshould say, weakened the present nursing home standards.\n  This is just not my opinion that we are weakening these standards, \nMr. President. It is also the opinion written on November 1 by the \nNational Association of State Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program \nDirectors, Mr. President.\n\n       Today we are writing to voice our opposition--from the \n     ombudsmen who are out there in these nursing homes every \n     day--to Senator Roth's omnibus floor amendment [which] was \n     passed and included nursing home provisions that can gravely \n     weaken the quality of care standards you helped to reinstate.\n       . . . we believe this will be harmful to the quality of \n     care provided to nursing home residents across the country.\n\n  Mr. President, not only do the ombudsmen out there in these homes \nevery day feel that we are about to weaken these standards unless we \ninstruct our conferees to keep the present hard standards--I should say \nstronger standards.\n  We have a letter from the Nursing Home Reform Coalition group.\n\n       The Coalition, however, does have serious concerns about \n     the amendment providing for state waivers from the federal \n     standards, passed by the Senate on Friday, October 27. The \n     language in the amendment would allow States with standards \n     ``equivalent to or stricter than'' the federal requirements \n     to use its own standards.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       We urge you, Senator Pryor, and your colleagues, to \n     consider the following recommendations:\n       Do not support maintaining this waiver provision\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Provisions giving the Secretary the authority to take \n     action against a facility providing substandard care, and \n     where the state has not taken adequate enforcement action.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the \nNursing Home Reform group, from the Ombudsmen who have written in about \nthe nursing home standards be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         National Association of State Long-Term Care Ombudsman \n           Programs,\n                                     Austin, TX, November 1, 1995.\n     Hon. David Pryor,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pryor: Thank you for your successful effort in \n     offering an amendment that reinstated the nursing home \n     quality standards into the Senate Budget Reconciliation Bill. \n     It was rewarding that it received some bipartisan support. \n     This was particularly meaningful considering the House Bill \n     eliminated these critical federal standards entirely.\n       Today we are writing to voice our opposition to Senator \n     Roth's omnibus floor amendment was passed and included \n     nursing home provisions that can gravely weaken the quality \n     of care standards you helped reinstate.\n       As you know, the Roth amendment allows States to apply for \n     and be granted waivers from the federal nursing home \n     regulations. As stated in the amendment, a State can seek a \n     waiver if it has equivalent to or stricter requirements as \n     determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. For \n     the following reasons, we believe this will be harmful to the \n     quality of care provided to nursing home residents across the \n     country.\n       It could lead to 52 different sets of standards. This would \n     make federal oversight and enforcement impossible.\n       The provision lets the door open for States to seek private \n     accreditation of nursing homes as their form of quality \n     standards. The Ombudsman Program's experience has shown that \n     accreditation alone is no indication of quality care.\n       This would crate another level of federal bureaucracy \n     charged with the task of approving and then monitoring the \n     waiver.\n       There would be increased cost upon the states to write and \n     apply for a waiver as well as the federal government's cost \n     with the administration of the waivers.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      National Citizens' Coalition\n\n\n                                      for Nursing Home Reform,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 1, 1995.\n     Hon. David Pryor,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pryor: The National Citizens' Coalition for \n     Nursing Home Reform commends you for your leadership in \n     having the federal nursing home standards maintained in \n     federal law. As you are aware, federal standards are critical \n     to achieving and maintaining uniform basic good standards of \n     quality of care and life for our nation's nursing home \n     residents, many of whom are frail and vulnerable.\n       The Coalition, however, does have serious concerns about \n     the amendment providing for state waivers from the federal \n     standards, passed by the Senate on Friday, October 27. The \n     language in the amendment would allow \n\n[[Page S 16946]]\n     States with standards ``equivalent to or stricter than'' the federal \n     requirements to use its own standards.\n       If states had standards that were stronger than the federal \n     standards, there would be no need for a waiver, as the \n     stronger standards could be implemented through state \n     licensing requirements. States and facilities are always held \n     to the higher of state or federal standards. Thus, nothing is \n     gained by providing for such a waiver.\n       Further, it is unclear whether all of the state's standards \n     would have to be equal to or stronger than the federal \n     requirements, or whether a state waiver request would be \n     approved if some of the state standards were equal or \n     stronger. Only enforcement provisions are specified in the \n     amendment language, thus casting doubt that all standards in \n     state law will be evaluated.\n       When evaluating standards, it is not enough to approve a \n     waiver request based on the fact that a state plan contains \n     the same broad categories of requirements contained in the \n     federal standards. The Secretary has the responsibility of \n     also evaluating the substance of each category under the \n     state plan, and only approve a waiver if the substance of \n     each category is equal to or stronger than the federal \n     standards.\n       To highlight the importance of the substantive requirements \n     of the federal standards, the bill recently passed by the \n     House of Representatives contains what have been described as \n     ``Quality Standards for Nursing Homes,'' provisions which \n     will replace the standards contained in the Nursing Home \n     Reform Act. In reality, the provisions in the House bill are \n     a mere shell--lacking any substance--of the requirements \n     under the Nursing Home Reform Act. Evaluating any State plan \n     under the type of general provisions contained in the House \n     bill, is no guarantee of the strength of those state \n     provisions. We have prepared side-by-side comparisons of \n     the requirements contained in the House MediGrant bill \n     with the requirements in the Nursing Home Reform Act, and \n     would be happy to share that with you. The same omission \n     occurs in the lack of substantive language in the waiver \n     provision.\n       Many states will argue that they currently have provisions \n     that are as good or better than the federal law. Most states \n     currently make that argument. California, for example, \n     announced in October 1990, the effective date of the nursing \n     home reform act, that since it's law was as good as the \n     federal law, it would not implement the federal law. A class \n     action lawsuit was filed against the state to compel \n     implementation of the law. The federal district court ruled \n     that California's law was not equivalent to federal law, and \n     ordered the state to implement the entire law immediately.\n       Currently, no state has all the provisions of the Federal \n     law, and there is no provision for a waiver from the federal \n     standards. This amendment will result only in costly and \n     unnecessary reviews of state plans and time spent defending \n     denials of waiver requests. Considering the budgetary cuts \n     facing the state and the federal governments, this is surely \n     not the most effective use of limited funds and resources.\n       The language in this amendment leaves several other \n     loopholes which would undermine the strength of the federal \n     standards. First, there is a provision for a 120-day approval \n     period, a time frame that includes public comment. This time \n     frame is not adequate for public comment to be solicited, \n     received, and the state plan evaluated. So the question \n     arises, what happens if there has been no approval or denial \n     by the 120th day? The amendment language is silent. It would \n     be a travesty if the waiver were deemed approved. We could \n     guarantee that states would then be free to implement \n     standards that were not at least equal to the federal \n     requirements. Residents would, once again, be put at risk of \n     being subjected to lower quality standards, poor care, and \n     violations of their rights.\n       Additionally, the amendment language does not include any \n     authority for the federal government to take enforcement \n     action against facilities. The enforcement authorized by the \n     amendment is against the State for failing to comply with \n     Medicaid law, or with the state law they have been granted a \n     waiver to use a place of federal law. Thus the Secretary \n     could never take action against a facility, an important tool \n     for achieving facility compliance in meeting contract \n     obligations.\n       Further, subparagraph (b) Penalty for Noncompliance limits \n     the federal government's ability to enforce the Medicaid \n     requirements to a withholding of ``up to but not more than'' \n     2% of the State's ``MediGrant.'' Studies have shown that poor \n     care in nursing homes results in high costs to Medicare due \n     to unnecessary hospitalizations. The state, however, incurs \n     no cost after the resident leaves the nursing facility for \n     the hospital. Thus, it may prove to be less costly for some \n     states to incur a 2% penalty than to ensure that quality \n     standards are being maintained.\n       Uniform standards for nursing homes, in addition to \n     providing protections for residents and families, also serve \n     another purpose. Standardized resident-level data is \n     necessary in order to generate quality indicators. This \n     enables Federal oversight of quality issues across states and \n     facilitates quality improvement activities which result in \n     cost effective techniques for the care of nursing home \n     residents. This data also provides meaningful consumer \n     information. Allowing states to obtain a waiver from the \n     federal standards would seriously inhibit the ability to \n     collect this important data.\n       We urge you, Senator Pryor, and your colleagues, to \n     consider the following recommendations:\n       Do not support maintaining this waiver provision.\n       If it is inevitable that this provision will remain in the \n     bill, we urge you support including the following provisions \n     in the bill:\n       The requirement for a written determination that all \n     provisions and substance of state law are equal to or \n     stricter than the federal requirements in assuring that \n     residents attain and/or maintain their highest practicable \n     physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being before a waiver \n     will be granted;\n       Stating that any waiver request not approved in writing \n     within the specified time period would be deemed denied;\n       Provisions giving the Secretary the authority to take \n     action against a facility providing substandard care, and \n     where the state has not taken adequate enforcement action;\n       Requirement that the penalty for failure of a State to \n     comply with a provision of Medicaid law, or State law \n     requirements under a waiver, is the current 100% withholding \n     of Medicaid payments to the state;\n       Including a private right of action for residents and their \n     representatives to challenge the Secretary's granting of a \n     waiver before it goes into effect.\n       Thank you for your dedication to the quality of care and \n     services provided to nursing home residents. We look forward \n     to working with you on these issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Elma Holder,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. I offer also some other concerns I have about the \nstandards as set forth in the Roth language versus the language that we \nare trying to get the conferees to adopt at this time.\n  First, in States that get waivers, the Secretary of HHS will have no \nenforcement authority against individual facilities and weaker \nenforcement authority against the States as a whole.\n  Now, why do we want weaker authority? Why do we want weaker \nstandards? This is something that we are asking today as a question.\n  The second weakness is, Mr. President, that the language only says \nwhat the Secretary can do to the States, not to individual nursing \nhomes.\n  For example, if a State has been given a waiver, if HHS determines \nthat the State, for example, of New Hampshire has laws and regulations \nthat are equal to or better than the Federal provisions, so the HHS \nSecretary stamps a document saying, ``You are under no Federal \nregulations,'' then the State of New Hampshire at that time, \nnotwithstanding that a nursing home or several nursing homes absolutely \nare giving unconscionable treatment to their nursing home residents, \nthe Federal Government has no authority, no empowerment to do anything \nabout those particular homes.\n  They can move against a State. They cannot move against the \nparticular homes. Those residents, those nursing home residents, Mr. \nPresident, are sitting there, lying there, housed there absolutely \nhelpless and without an advocate to come to their side to protect them.\n  The third concern, Mr. President, current law today allows the \nSecretary to withhold all Medicaid funds from the States that have \nproblems in nursing homes.\n  Senator Roth's amendment that was approved by the Senate which \npreempted the so-called Pryor-Cohen amendment, the Roth amendment only \nallows the Secretary to withhold 2 percent of Medicaid funds from \nwaiver States.\n  What kind of a lever is that? What kind of a bargaining chip is that, \njust to be able to hold 2 percent of the Medicaid funds from those \nStates with a waiver?\n  Also, Mr. President, look at the litigation. Just imagine the \nlitigation that is going to result if we do not keep the present \nstandards. If we wade off into this unknown field that our colleagues \non the other side of the aisle have presented to us and say, ``If you \nget a waiver, you can do this,'' but there are no guidelines. We are \nnot sure what is going to be the law or the regulations that each State \nwill adopt. We will just do our best.\n  Mr. President, how much litigation is going to result from this \nindecision, from this attempt at obfuscation of the nursing home \nstandards that have served us so well since 1987? To me it is \nunconscionable for us to think about watering down the present \nstandards that we see today that have served us so well in nursing home \nstandards.\n  Mr. President, I am very hopeful that the Senate later on this \nafternoon \n\n[[Page S 16947]]\nwhen we begin our voting process is going to support this motion to \ninstruct the conferees to keep the present nursing home standards that \nwe have and, once again, that have served us so very well.\n  Mr. President, we are also looking today at the typical nursing home \nresident. We look at those nursing home residents and realize that \nbefore 1987 and before we had these particular nursing home standards \nthat we are trying to maintain today--look at the characteristics of a \nnursing home patient, of a nursing home resident. All of us in this \nChamber, perhaps, have someone in a nursing home--an aunt, uncle, a \nmother, dad, grandmother, grandparent, grandfather, relative, good \nfriend. We will look at the characteristic of the nursing home patient \nand residents that we have today.\n  Mr. President, 77 percent of all of the nursing home residents need \nhelp in dressing; 63 percent need help in toileting; 91 percent need \nhelp in bathing; 66 percent have a mental disorder. Mr. President, \nalso, over 50 percent of the nursing home residents today in America \nhave no relative, no friend, no one that becomes their friend and their \nadvocate to make periodic visits, to make certain that basic rights are \nadhered to.\n  We have certain things that OBRA '87 brought about. The right for the \nnursing home patients and residents to choose their own physician. We \nare about to repeal that, perhaps. We have basically the protection \nthat the nursing home residents can open their own mail and have the \nconfidentiality of their medical records being protected. We are about \nto repeal that.\n  Mr. President, the average nursing home resident out there today, we \nfeel, needs every protection, the highest standards that we can bring \nabout. And for us to turn our back and say we are going to, basically, \nobliterate these standards and have them no longer, in my opinion would \nbe a tragedy and a disgrace.\n\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague from Michigan, who has now come to \nthe floor. I understand he is going to manage this issue for the other \nside. So, since he wants to speak, I assume, I will at this point yield \nthe floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time for the quorum not be charged against either \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may need to \nspeak more generally on the reconciliation bill that is going to be \ndealt with later this week.\n  Earlier, when this issue regarding motions to instruct was being \ntalked about, there were several I was considering bringing. Because of \nthe unanimous-consent agreement that was entered into, these are \nprecluded from being brought here today, but I would like to speak \nresponsive to those because I think it is important, as our conferees \nbegin to meet, that they focus on some of the issues of difference that \nexisted between the Senate package and the package that passed the \nHouse.\n  In particular, as you will note, Mr. President, back during the final \nhours of debate on the reconciliation bill, the so-called Byrd rule was \ninvoked to remove from the Senate reconciliation bill a number of \nprovisions which related to the welfare reform proposals that are in \nthe reconciliation bill. I had considered bringing back some of those \nin the form of instructions to our Senate conferees to accede to what \nthe House has attempted to do in these areas, because I think it was a \nhuge mistake for the Senate to remove some of these things from our \npackage.\n  Specifically, during the final hours of that debate we removed part \nof the welfare reform bill that would have provided States with an \nincentive, in the form of additional dollars, to those States that were \nable to reduce the rate of illegitimate births, of out-of-wedlock \nbirths, through various programs they might enact so long as they did \nnot simultaneously increase the abortion rate as a way they might \naccomplish the reduction in the out-of-wedlock births. This was a topic \nwe debated at great length here in the Senate when the topic of welfare \nreform was before us. It is one that really had quite a bit of \nconsensus support on both sides of the aisle. In fact, an amendment \nrelating to it was defeated, an effort to take it out of our welfare \nbill, with more than 60 Senators voting to retain this so-called \nillegitimacy bonus language in the bill.\n  I think we have heard, from both sides of the aisle and across \nAmerica, great concern expressed in an ongoing basis over the problem \nof rising numbers of illegitimate births in our country. Indeed, we \nhave even heard percentages that are projected to be as high as 40 \npercent of all children born in this country by the year 2000 will be \nborn out of wedlock. The social indicators are that children born under \nthese circumstances typically have higher rates of dropout from school, \nhigher drug abuse rates, higher likelihood of becoming, themselves, \ninvolved in some type of criminal activity. It is a problem that spans \nthe entire country and it is one which we in the Congress, I think, \nhave responsibility to address.\n  The one and only way in which we attempted to address this very \nspecifically in the welfare reform bill was through this provision, \nwhich would have provided States with the incentive to reduce the \nnumber of illegitimate births. For that reason, I was stunned when the \nByrd rule was invoked, to try to remove--and in fact it did remove--\nthis provision from the bill. In my judgment it was a terrible \nstatement to make at the time when people from all political \nperspectives are arguing this is a problem of national concern and a \nproblem we must address.\n  I can understand there were politics involved in the invocation of \nthe Byrd rule with regard to the reconciliation bill on a number of \nfronts. But this statement was a mistake. I think making this statement \nsent the wrong signal. I think in many ways it was a repudiation of the \nconcerns of average men and women, citizens across this country, who \nhave been focusing on what we are doing here and asking, hoping the \nCongress will be responsive to a serious problem.\n  So, Mr. President, I say again, even though it is not in the form of \nan instruction, it is this Senator's hope the conferees will work to \nmake sure the provisions in the reconciliation bill which addressed \nout-of-wedlock births in the form of providing States with financial \nincentives to address these problems locally will keep such language in \nwhatever package returns to us.\n  Another provision which was likewise removed was the provision which \nwould have capped the amount of time that people could be recipients of \nwelfare benefits to 5 years. As I have traveled throughout my State, \none of the concerns I hear expressed constantly by people is the notion \nthat they do not want to see welfare become a way of life. The best and \nsurest way to address that, I think, was the approach which we took \nhere in the Senate in the welfare bill we did consider. It was \noverwhelmingly adopted. Approximately 87 Senators joined together to \nsupport the bill. In that bill we had a 5-year limit on the benefits \nthat people would be allowed to receive from the welfare system. That, \ntoo, was a provision that was struck during the debate on the \nreconciliation package, again, I think sending absolutely the worst \npossible signal the Congress of the United States could send to people \nin this country who look to us to set rules that are fair and \nresponsive to their concerns.\n  As I talk to the hard-working men and women of my State, who pay \ntheir bills and pay the taxes and are genuinely compassionate toward \nthose in need, what I hear them say is, ``Fine, we want to provide a \nsafety net. We want to be helpful. But we think there are certain \npoints at which enough is enough. Five years seems like a reasonable \nperiod of time for them.''\n  For that reason, I sincerely hope, again, the conferees on the \nreconciliation package, whether or not it is in the form of an \ninstruction from us, will be responsive to these concerns and retain \nthe sort of language which we had \n\n[[Page S 16948]]\nin the Senate bill prior to the invocation of the Byrd rule during the \nlast hours of debate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that the time for the quorum not be charged \nagainst either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes off the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/13/senate-section/article/S16943-5", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16948-S16949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE IMPENDING SHUTDOWN OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am not going to speak specifically to the \nresolution, but I do want to speak to the underlying issues with which \nthe resolution--and the other business which we will be taking up \ntoday--is involved. That, of course, is the question of the impending \nshutdown of the Federal Government, what has brought it about, and \nwhere we are going.\n  I think it is unfortunate that it has been characterized--but it is \nnot unusual--as I understand it, by the national press as an event \nwhich is involving a confrontation over personalities, a confrontation \nthat has borne the position of business as usual, or politics as usual; \nnot necessarily name calling, maybe name implying, rather than a \nconfrontation for what it is.\n  This is an issue involving some very substantive philosophical \ndifferences that we have arrived at, and we have not yet arrived \ncompletely at the point of final decision, if there is ever a final \npoint of decision, in the business of governing because the point of \nfinal decision is more appropriately the reconciliation bill at which \nthis motion to instruct is directed. The reconciliation bill, which is \nnow being conferenced, involves the fundamental changes which we as \nRepublicans have proposed--or many of them anyway--especially in the \nentitlement accounts; fundamental changes which go to the fact that we \nbelieve the Nation's budget must be brought under control, that our \nFederal Government must work towards a balanced budget; and that needs \nto be done within a confined period of time; that we need to reach that \nbalanced budget by the year 2002, or 7 years from now; that the way you \nreach that is not by cutting the Federal Government but slowing its \nrate of growth, and specifically slowing the rate of growth in certain \nmajor entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, farm \nprograms; and, that in slowing the rate of growth of the Federal \nGovernment we believe--and we have put forward proposals with which we \nthink we can deliver better programs.\n  We can, for example--and have--put forward a program which is going \nto deliver to our senior citizens we believe a much stronger Medicare \nsystem, at least one which will be solvent, which is absolutely \ncritical, something which will not occur if action is not taken. As we \nhave heard from the Medicare trustees, the Medicare trustees say that \nit is going to be insolvent unless something is done. What we have \nproposed--and what is being discussed--essentially is to say to seniors \nwe are not going to allow you to keep your present health care system. \nBut, if you wish to participate in it, we will give you a chose of \nother forms of health care delivery. We are going to give you choices \nof other forms of health delivery, like I or other Members of Congress \nhave, and using an HMO, or a PPO, or some of these other initials, \nwhich mean basically groups of doctors and different types of health-\ncare suppliers getting together and offering you, the seniors, service.\n  We are going to bring the marketplace into the Medicare system, and \nby bringing the marketplace into the Medicare system hopefully create \nmore efficiencies of delivery of service while still delivering first \nclass-service, and in the process giving our seniors more choices; and, \nalso in the process slowing the rate of growth of Medicare.\n  We have proposed in the welfare area that we take this system--which \nis so fundamentally flawed, which has created such dependency amongst \nso many of our citizenry and has not allowed people to get off the \nsystem but rather put people into the system for generations--and say \nto those folks, ``Listen. You can only be on welfare for 5 years. You \nhave got to be willing to go to work, if you are going to get welfare \nbenefits.'' And, more importantly, we are going to turn it back to the \nStates and allow the States to manage this welfare system, something \nthat we should never have taken from in the first place because the \nStates can do it so much better, to be quite honest, because they are \ncloser to the people that are impacted by this.\n\n  So we are putting forward ideas which fundamentally reform the way \nthis Government operates.\n  Today we are confronted with the fact that the President has vetoed \nthe continuing resolution, which would allow the Government to operate \nfor a couple of weeks, because he disagrees with the basic theme of the \nproposals that we are putting forward. It is the administration's \nessential position that the status quo works. I do not believe the \nstatus quo works. And many of us obviously on this side of the aisle do \nnot believe that the status quo works. We happen to believe that this \nGovernment needs to be adjusted, that we cannot pass a Government on to \nour children which is fundamentally bankrupt and expect our children to \nhave an opportunity to prosper.\n  So we come to the point of decision. That point of decision is going \nto be the reconciliation bill. But, prior to getting to that point, we \nhave reached this preliminary discussion over about how we fund the \nGovernment for the next 2 weeks. And the President has decided to make \na stand at this point on his belief that the Government of the status \nquo is appropriate. So that is his right. It is his right to put \nforward that philosophical position--that this Government is not large \nenough, that it should get larger, that this Government should take \nmore taxes from our citizens rather than less tax taxes, that this \nGovernment, which has a Medicare system which is going to be bankrupt, \naccording to our own trustees, should pursue a system which does not \ncorrect that system, or improve that system. That is his right to put \nforward those philosophical differences.\n  What I think is unfortunate, however, is that, as we move forward \nover the next week, we will be in a period of confrontation which \nappears to be one surrounding politics as usual--name calling or \nposturing that is superficial--rather than one that in actuality we are \nreally discussing here, really getting to the question of how this \nGovernment is delivered over the next 7 years, as to how this \nGovernment is going to be restructured and reformed, and, in my \nopinion, improved, and significantly strengthened.\n  So as we take up this issue for the balance of the day--and I suspect \nwe are going to be in this matter of the Government shutdown for quite \na few days because I do not see any immediate resolution of it--I hope \nthat we will stick to the issue of discussing the substance that has \ngotten us here, the substantive issue which have brought us to this \npoint.\n  Those substantive issues really come down to this. Do we wish to \nbring the Government into balance? Do we wish to have a Government \nwhich is fiscally responsible, one which is a Government which we can \nafford, and a Government which our children can afford? That is what \nthis debate is really all about. It is not about who talked to who on \nthe flight to Israel. It is not about what the phone conversations \nwere, and the tone of the phone conversations. It is about whether or \nnot we as a nation are going to finally make some decisions, and we in \nthe Congress and this President as a Presidency are going to finally \nmake some decisions about restructuring this Government and make it \naffordable for our children, and how we go about doing it.\n  My expectation is that we will not resolve this overnight; that \ndecisions which will be made in the next 24 hours will not be those so \nmomentous as to \n\n[[Page S 16949]]\ncomplete or even significantly impact that final decision process, but \nit may well be significant in impacting the manner in which we get to \nthat final decision. We can spend our time over the next few days as we \ndebate this continuing resolution, which is simply a preamble to the \nmajor issue which is reconciliation, we can spend our time debating the \nsuperficial issues of who, where, when, or what names we call each \nother or we can talk in terms of the substance of the debate which is \nhow do we reform this Government and how do we take this Government \nwhich is so completely out of control and bring it under control; how \ndo we give our children an opportunity to have a lifestyle that is \nbetter than ours; how do we become a generation which passes more on to \nchildren than was passed on to us by our elders.\n  These are the core issues, the issues of substance which we should be \ndiscussing over the next few days, and hopefully we can attend to those \nissues rather than become involved in the ancillary issues of name \ncalling, political posturing, of Government by polls and Government by \nreelection.\n  Mr. President, I yield back such time as I may have.\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

Mr. President, I was not planning to respond to my good \nfriend from New Hampshire, and I agree with him 100 percent; it is not \nthe time for name calling and politicization of this issue any longer. \nBut I do feel it is time to set the record straight, and I would like \nto take just a moment of the Senate's time to sort of begin to set the \nrecord straight as to what is happening right now with regard to this \nissue of so-called shutting down the Government.\n  This is not something that just happened in the last 24 or 36 or 48 \nhours. This has been going on for several months now. In fact, back on \nSeptember 22, Speaker Gingrich boasted:\n\n       I don't care what the price is. I don't care if we have no \n     executive offices. I don't care if we have no bonds for 60 \n     days, not this time.\n\n  That is a quote in the Washington Post September 22, 1995.\n  Look at what the Republicans have done. This is a fact. They have \ncompletely shut the Democrats out of the budget process. We know it. \nThey know it. It is a fact of life. We have not been a part of this \nprocess. We have wanted to be a part of this process, but we have not \nbeen included. For example, after proposing the most massive cut in \nMedicare in the history of America, our Republican friends held only 1 \nday of hearings on this proposal--1 day. It is the biggest cut in \nMedicare we have had since 1965.\n  By comparison, the House held 42 days of hearings on Whitewater, \nWaco, and Ruby Ridge. The Senate held 48 days of hearings on these same \nissues. One day of hearings, 1 day of hearings on this massive Medicare \ncut.\n  Mr. President, I do think it is time to set the record straight. I \nalso think it is time to realize that the President is not willing to \nimpose an $11 a month premium increase on every single Medicare \nbeneficiary as a condition for keeping the Government running.\n  Look who is being held hostage here. Every Medicare recipient in \nAmerica is being held hostage, and the price is closing down the \nGovernment. And we are going to blame it on the President of the United \nStates.\n  What is happening is we are only implementing what we call the \nGingrich strategy. This is the implementation of a strategy that was \nconceived long ago but today is manufactured. It is an artificial \ncrisis that has been created. It is a confrontation that has been \ndreamed up by people who do not care if this Government functions or \nnot. It is a shameful experience. It is an experience about which I \nthink most good-willed people in this body actually shudder when \nthinking about the Founding Fathers of this country--bringing us to \nthis point of closing down the Government in order to make political \nhay.\n  Mr. President, you know and all of us know that this artificial \ncrisis basically revolves around one provision, the Medicare provision \nin the reconciliation bill, and the continuing resolution. But the \ntruth is that the Medicare provision in this particular continuing \nresolution is also included in the reconciliation bill.\n  Why is it we have not straightened that out so far? It is pretty \napparent. We have not even appointed the conferees to go to conference \non the reconciliation bill, and yet we are about to close down the \nGovernment. We do not even have the conferees appointed. There is no \none to go to conference with and to solve this issue. That has to be a \nproblem, and it has to be a responsibility of the majority party in the \nSenate and in the House. The Chair knows this. I know this. My \ncolleagues know this.\n  I think it is time to set the record straight. Earlier this morning, \nthe Democratic party, Democratic side of the aisle had agreed; we \nthought we were getting ready, with unanimous consent, by voice vote to \ngo ahead and pass the continuing resolution, let it go down to the \nPresident, not hold up this thing any longer, not continue the threat \nof closing down the Government, and then let the President veto it. Let \nhim do it early in the day.\n  We wanted that to happen. I hope that can still happen. Right now I \ndo not know exactly what is going on, but I do know this, that this \nPresident at this moment is ready, willing, and able to talk to the \nother side of the aisle, I assume at the White House or anywhere else, \nand talk to them about the measures necessary to keep this Government \nfunctioning as it was intended to function and to stop implementing \nthis grand Gingrich strategy, this contrived artificial crisis which \ndoes not have to happen.\n  Mr. President, I understand my good friend and colleague from North \nDakota would like 4 minutes, and I yield my friend 4 minutes at this \ntime.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me take just a minute to follow on these comments.\n  We are here in the middle of a significant debate about the \nreconciliation bill and about the continuing resolution, the debt \nextension, and the public might wonder why. Why are we doing all of \nthis?\n  A continuing resolution is necessary because virtually none of the \nappropriations bills have been passed on time. I think one of them \nreached the President on time. Most of them have not been passed \nthrough conference and sent to the President. They are supposed to be \ndone, but they are not done.\n  Even more important, the law requires that the reconciliation bill be \npassed by Congress on June 15. It is now November 13. The fact is we \nare now going to in November and December debate a reconciliation bill \nfor which there have not been conferees appointed 5 months after the \nlaw requires this Congress to do its job.\n  It seems to me it is hard for people who are doing this to claim they \nare part of some reform party. So I guess the point I would make about \nthis issue of the shutdown is people are wanting to know who is going \nto share the blame or claim the credit. There is going to be no credit \nhere, no credit in a shutdown.\n  Yes. I would say it is true there are too many pollsters in the White \nHouse. But it is also true, painfully true, there are too many \nRepublican Senators running for President. That colors all of these \ndecisions. And it is also true that Speaker Gingrich has boasted for \nmonths about the train wreck he is apparently going to engineer and \napparently we will realize this week.\n  There will be nothing but blame if this happens. It is not a \nthoughtful approach and not the right way for us to do public policy. \nFor 200 years representative democracy has rested on the ability to \ncompromise among differing points of view, and that is what ought to \nhappen today and tomorrow. And we ought to solve these problems.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/13/senate-section/article/S16949-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16949-S16967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE 7-YEAR BALANCED BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1995\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n               Motion to Instruct--Nursing Home Standards\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. On the specific amendment offered by the Senator from \nArkansas, I came just to offer a word of \n\n[[Page S 16950]]\nencouragement. This is a very important amendment. Those who talk about \nreform and a new and different future and then say, ``By the way, why \ndo we not get rid of Federal standards or national quality standards on \nnursing homes'' do no service to the word change or reform.\n  I have sat in nursing homes for some good long while, regrettably. \nMany of us probably have with parents and other loved ones. I also sat \nrecently at a hearing at which we heard from people who led the charge \nfor nursing home reform in 1987 for Federal quality standards. You all \nknow the stories. You have read the stories of the 1950's, 1960's, \n1970's about what was going on in some nursing homes in this country. \nFor good reason we adopted national quality standards.\n  Anyone who wants to retreat once again to experience the stories that \nwe heard in the hearing recently by families who had loved ones in \nnursing homes, anyone who wants to retreat to that era is not \nunderstanding, in my judgment, what that era was all about. We have, I \nthink, done a real service for our country and for senior citizens with \nthe quality standards that came from the 1987 act, and we ought not to \nretreat on those standards and we ought not repeal those standards.\n  The first inclination of the Senate and the House was to go ahead and \nrepeal them. Then the Senator from Arkansas raised such a fuss, as did \nothers of us, that they finally said, ``Let's not repeal them outright. \nLet's just say we won't repeal them, but give the States the ability to \nseek waivers,'' which is the same thing for a State that wants to get \nthem repealed.\n  So I am pleased today to add my voice to the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Arkansas. This makes good sense. Every Member of the House \nand Senate ought to vote for this. I am all for change. I am all for \nconstructive change that improves things that need improving, but I am \nnot for change that suggests let us turn back the clock to the 1950's \nhere with respect to quality standards in nursing homes.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, if I might inquire, please, of the Chair, \nwhat is the time situation for the Democratic side and the Republican \nside of the aisle remaining on the motion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has 11 minutes 40 \nseconds. The Senator from Michigan has 4 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntime used in the quorum call not be charged to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield myself such time as I may have remaining. I may \nuse all of it; I may not.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important for us in this discussion of \nthe nursing home standards to emphasize several points that are part of \nthe Senate-passed reconciliation bill which is going to conference \nbecause some allusions have been made that would suggest that there is \nan interest in that package in backing away from Federal standards that \nhave been created here in the Congress.\n  I just would say this: I think that part of that attitude or that \nsentiment is also suggesting that somehow the States and local \ncommunities of our country are lacking in the compassion and the \nconcerns that we have here in Washington. I cannot speak for what might \nhave been the conditions in the 1950's or 1960's that were referenced, \nbut I believe that in the 1990's Governors and State legislators have \nevery bit as much concern and compassion about these issues as we do \nhere in Washington.\n  I also think it is the case that a lot of States had these concerns \nbefore we did here in Washington. Proponents of the Federal standards \nhave suggested that what this legislation does, as passed over here, is \nto eliminate these standards altogether. But the bottom line, Mr. \nPresident, is that the Senate bill does include the Federal nursing \nhome standards.\n  States, however, have complained about the administrative burdens \nassociated with implementing these Federal standards since the very \nbeginning. Obviously, there is inevitably some tug of war that goes on \nbetween Federal and State governments over the rules and regulations. \nWe do not in the legislation we passed propose in any sense to back \naway from the Federal standards that are out there, but we do \nacknowledge sometimes the implementation of a Washington-knows-best, \none- size-fits-all approach does not translate into efficiency in \ngovernment at the State and local level because of the diversity \nbetween the 50 States.\n  Therefore, what we have done in the bill that passed the Senate is \nnot back away from Federal standards. We have retained them in the \nlegislation. What we have done, however, is include a provision that \nonly allows States with nursing home standards that are equal to or \nstricter--or stricter--than the Federal standards to seek a waiver from \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  Let me just go over that again, Mr. President. We are not talking \nabout less stringent standards. We are talking about States that have \nequal or more strict standards may seek a waiver from the Secretary of \nHHS to be able to use their standards and to supplant Federal standards \nwith the stricter standards that they may have at the State level.\n  We are talking here about seeking a waiver, Mr. President. We are not \ntalking about anything that happens automatically. The Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services must reach the conclusion that the State \nstandards are equal to or stricter than the Federal standards before \nthe waiver will be granted. If the Secretary does not believe that the \nState nursing home standards are equal to or stricter than the Federal \nstandards, no waiver will be granted. That seems to me to be the best \nway, Mr. President, to preserve the tough standards that I think all of \nus here at the Federal level want to see maintained across this \ncountry.\n  I just say that the comments of the Senator from North Dakota struck \nhome with me, as I am sure they did with many others, because I would \nbet virtually every Member of this body has had a loved one at one time \nor another confined to some type of care facility, a nursing home or \nother similar care-providing facility. We want those tough standards. \nBut we also recognize, and I think this compromise is the way to \nachieve it, that sometimes the States can do it better, the States can \ndo it less expensively, and the States can have tougher standards.\n  Obviously, different States have had different experiences. But my \nState, I think, is a good example of one which was ahead of the curve \non these issues. Michigan was interested in quality nursing homes long \nbefore the Federal Government established its standards in 1990. \nIndeed, the Michigan Nursing Home Reform Act was passed and signed in \n1978. And it was a much tougher law than anything that existed at the \ntime.\n  It still contains some of the strongest penalties in the country for \npoor performance. In fact, recently an effort to test the standards of \nour nursing homes found that our State government did its tests. Only \none nursing home it went into failed to meet the tough standards \nMichigan imposed. We are proud of the way we oversee these facilities. \nI think other States are, too. I think this waiver system is the way to \nbalance Federal concerns with State flexibility.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. My time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Michigan has \nexpired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Might the Senator from West Virginia ask the Senator \nfrom Arkansas a question?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, should the Senator from West Virginia like \n\n[[Page S 16951]]\n  some time to ask a question to the Senator from Michigan, I will be \nglad to yield to him 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Michigan, I \njust came on the floor this moment, but I thought I heard the Senator \nsaying that States, where standards are as strict or stricter than \nFederal standards, could seek a waiver.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Right.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. That leads to the question as to States which are \nnot restricted or whose standards are in compilation or regulations are \nbeing made, et cetera. I ask this question: It was my impression at one \ntime in the evolution of the majority party's standards for nursing \nhomes that each State was allowed to describe and make its own \nstandards; is that correct?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, it is my understanding we are debating \ntoday the current focus of the reconciliation debate, which is the bill \nthat passed the Senate. I believe in the perfecting amendment the \nFinance Committee brought to us, the concerns that were raised about \nstandards being below Federal standards were addressed in such a way \nthat the only waivers that will be permitted are those which would be \noffered for States that have standards that are equal to or stricter \nthan.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I understand that. I am not even talking about the \nwaiver question. I am talking about the matter of States setting \nstandards, whether or not they get to the waiver point. Is it not true \nthat all 50 States would then get to set their own standards, and then \nat some point along the line, obviously somebody would make a judgment \nas to whether the waiver was justified or unjustified?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Right now, my understanding is States are free to set \ntheir standards today. The issue of whether to comply with their own \nstandards or to be held to a higher or Federal standard is going to be \ndetermined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services who would be \nempowered to decide whether or not those State standards that they \nmight set were equal to or stricter than the Federal standards. If they \nare not, then they cannot be used.\n  That is my understanding of the way this would work. I believe right \nnow the legislature of Michigan or the legislature of West Virginia \ncould pass legislation that would have standards of their own choosing. \nThe issue of whether or not those would be preempted by Federal \nstandards, I think, would be determined, under our bill, by the \nSecretary of HHS who might decide the Michigan standards, as has been \nthe case for many years, are tough standards; tougher, in fact, in many \ncases than Federal standards.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I think before the time runs out, let me just make \nmy point to the Senator. And that is, I understand the point the \nSenator is making, but I think there are a large number of States, I \nbelieve, which do not come under any kind of Federal standards, whether \nthey are by waiver or not, which are allowed to make their own \nstandards, which is not exactly the same as it is today where States do \nhave to comply with certain Federal standards, witness 1987. And that \nthe Senator makes the assumption that the junior Senator from West \nVirginia would not make, and that is that the States would make \nstandards for their nursing homes which would be at or above Federal \nstandards. That is something which concerns me greatly, but I was \ntrying to seek information from the Senator.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Just in summary, my impression and understanding of what \nwe attempted to accomplish here was to create a Federal standard that \nwould be a floor rather than a ceiling, and if States wanted to have \nmore strict standards, they would be permitted waivers to do so, but \nthey would not be permitted waivers if they had standards less strict. \nThat is my impression of the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I do not plan to use 8 minutes, but I would \nlike to, basically, close my proposal that our conferees, when named, \nbe instructed to keep the present standards for nursing homes this \nCongress adopted by an overwhelming bipartisan support in the great \neffort of 1987.\n  I would like to talk about the substance of the difference between \nour proposal and the proposal as supported, evidently, by our good \nfriend from Michigan and his colleagues on the other side.\n  First, we are yielding two things in the Roth proposal that we voted \nfor on October 27. We are yielding two things. The Federal Government, \nnotwithstanding the fact that all nursing home residents--most of them, \ntwo-thirds--are Medicaid paid for, so there is a Federal involvement, a \nFederal attachment, but the Federal Government is saying, unless we \ninstruct the conferees, unless we keep the present standards, the U.S. \nGovernment is saying in effect, we are giving up any protection or any \nregulations or any enforcement opportunities, notwithstanding the fact \nthat nursing home residents are not treated fairly; that they are given \npoor food; that they are not clothed properly, they are not bathed \nproperly. All this can take place, and if a State has a waiver, Mr. \nPresident, the Federal Government has given up that opportunity to \nenforce standards.\n  The second major concept that I would like to talk about that my \nfriend from Michigan has raised--and I thank my good friend from West \nVirginia who has been so strong in the movement behind keeping the \nstrongest and strictest standards--is the concept of a State being able \nto adopt stronger standards. That is the law today. That is the beauty \nof the 1987 law.\n  The Federal Government said, ``States, if you want to, you can adopt \nstronger standards than the Federal Government has.'' That is what we \nsaid to the States. There is a former Governor of a great State, a \ngreat Governor of the State of West Virginia. I was the Governor of \nArkansas. I may not have been a very great Governor, but I was a \nGovernor. I said, that makes sense. I said that in 1987, that makes \nsense.\n  So today we give the States that opportunity to go forward to adopt \nany stronger standards they would like if they think that Federal \nstandards are not sufficient. But if the States apply to HHS and the \nSecretary of HHS stamps that piece of paper and says you have a waiver, \nthen the Federal Government is walking away from its powers to enforce, \nthe Federal Government is walking away from its powers to regulate, and \nwe are going to rue the day, because we are going to find ourselves \nback in the pre-1987 period of time when we saw that many of the \nnursing home residents were not being cared for, that they were not \nbeing protected, that there were too many bedsores, that they were \nimproperly tied up, that they were improperly looked after, basically, \nMr. President, and there is no reason--there is no reason--as Time \nmagazine said, there is no reason for us to go back to the dark ages. \nThere is no reason for it. There is no support for it.\n  I can say, if we had the 2 million nursing home residents out there \nin our country voting as to whether they would like to have this extra \namount of protection by the Federal Government, I think all of us in \nthis body would know what that vote would be. I bet it would be \nunanimous, of all 2 million residents out there who would be saying, \n``Thank you for that extra protection because my quality of life is \nbeing made better.''\n  Mr. President, this has been an issue for some weeks now that has \nbasically been a very grave concern to many in this body and many in \nthe other body, many organizations. But if I might, I would like to \nstate just a few of the groups who have written in support of keeping \nthe strongest standards:\n  The American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging; the \nAmerican Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; the \nAmerican Geriatrics Society; the American Health Care Association; the \nAmerican Medical Directors Association; the Catholic Health \nAssociation; the Catholic Social Services Organization; the United Auto \nWorkers, and actually a long list of individual nursing homes across \nour country that in the past you might have said, ``Well, these nursing \n\n\n[[Page S 16952]]\nhomes would like to get by with no regulations.'' That is not the case.\n  These regulations, these standards are uniform. They are true in \nevery State. They are the same in every State. If I had a mother living \ntoday and she were in a nursing home in California, I could be living \nin Oregon and I would know exactly what those regulations were, because \nthey are the same all over this country. We need to keep that. We \nshould not obfuscate the nursing home regulations. We should not invite \nlawsuit after lawsuit to try to find out what these regulations meant. \nI have a letter from the National Senior Citizens Law Center.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that their analysis of the legislation, as \nproposed by Senator Roth, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   National Senior\n\n\n                                          Citizens Law Center,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 1, 1995.\n     Hon. David Pryor,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pryor: At the request of Theresa Forster of \n     your staff, I have reviewed the language of the Roth \n     Amendment that addresses nursing home reform. For the reasons \n     stated below, I do not believe that the Roth Amendment \n     reinstates the federal nursing home reform law, as does the \n     Pryor/Cohen Amendment, Number 2983, which was approved by the \n     Senate earlier in the day on October 27. The Roth Amendment \n     fails to provide nursing facility residents with the full \n     protection of the federal law.\n       1. The waiver language does not make sense, when analyzed. \n     Although there is surface appeal to saying that the \n     protections of federal law will be waived only if the \n     Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services \n     determines that a state's law is ``equivalent to or stricter \n     than the requirements'' of federal law, this provision does \n     not make sense when it is analyzed. If a state's law were the \n     same as or stricter than federal law--and therefore the state \n     was doing the same or more than federal law required--why \n     would the state want or need to get a wavier of the federal \n     law? It makes no sense.\n       Senator Cohen said on the Senate floor on October 27:\n       ``I do not know of any State that has the same or better \n     [standards] than the Federal ones. But assuming States come \n     forward, as they have not in the past, and raise their \n     standards to those at the Federal level. If they can \n     establish that, and if they can satisfy the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services that they have done that, that does \n     not mean they are free and clear to go forward and then abuse \n     their patients. . . .'' [emphasis supplied]\n       Congressional Record, Oct. 27, 1995, S 16044. As Senator \n     Cohen correctly points out, states could meet the Roth \n     Amendment test only by raising their standards to the level \n     of current federal standards. Therefore, the waiver provision \n     makes no sense.\n       Moreover, a state can always offer more protection to \n     residents than federal law provides, under state licensing \n     authority, and some states do. For example, some states \n     require more extensive training for nurse aides than federal \n     law currently provides.\n       2. The Roth Amendment includes no standards for the \n     Secretary to use in considering states' waiver requests. In \n     reality, under the Roth Amendment, states will seek waivers \n     of the federal law when their laws are different from federal \n     law. However, the Roth Amendment includes no standards for \n     the Secretary to use in analyzing a state's law. Does a \n     state's law have to be equally stringent in each and every \n     aspect of federal law? Or will waivers of parts of the law be \n     allowed?\n       Current federal law addresses, with respect to standards \n     required of nursing facilities: quality of life, quality \n     assessment and assurance, scope of services and activities \n     under plan of care, resident assessment, provision of \n     services and activities, required training of nurse aides, \n     physician services, clinical records, residents' rights \n     (including free choice, freedom from restraints, privacy, \n     confidentiality, accommodation of needs, grievances, \n     participation in resident and family groups, participation in \n     other activities, examination of survey results, notice of \n     rights and services, rights of incompetent residents, \n     transfer and discharge rights, access and visitation rights, \n     equal access to quality care, admission policy protection of \n     residents' funds), administration and other matters, life \n     safety code, and sanitary and infection control and physical \n     environment. Current federal law also addresses the survey \n     and certification process and enforcement of standards.\n       Senator Cohen said on the Senate floor on October 27: ``The \n     amendment clearly indicates that no such waiver is allowed \n     unless the Secretary approves the waiver, and only if each \n     standards is equal to or more stringent than the Federal \n     Standard.'' [emphasis supplied]\n       Congressional Record, Oct. 27, 1995, S 16043. The language \n     of the Roth amendment does not state that each state standard \n     must equal each federal standard.\n       Moreover, the federal reform law now permits states to use \n     their own laws and systems to enforce nursing home standards \n     if they demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that \n     their laws are as effective as the remedies specified by the \n     federal law in deterring noncompliance and correcting \n     deficiencies. 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1396r(h)(2)(B)(ii). No state has \n     used the process provided by the reform law to request the \n     right to use its own enforcement system since the new system \n     went into place July 1, 1995.\n       3. The Roth Amendment offers no process for the Secretary \n     to use in granting state waivers. The Amendment authorizes a \n     120-day ``approval period,'' (Sec. 2137(a)(2)(C)), but does \n     not specify what processes the Secretary must use. For \n     example, there is no provision for notice to the public or \n     for a public hearing on a state's request for a waiver. There \n     is no requirement that the Secretary issue a written \n     determination that a state's law meets the stringency \n     standard and no provision for residents to seek judicial \n     review of the Secretary's decision to grant a waiver.\n       4. The Roth Amendment does not specify what happens to a \n     state's request for waiver if the Secretary falls to act \n     within the 120 day approval period. If the Secretary does not \n     act to grant or to deny a waiver request within the 120 day \n     approval period, the Amendment does not say whether the \n     waiver request is deemed approved or deemed denied. If the \n     Secretary receives many waiver requests, he/she may need more \n     than 120 days to decide the requests.\n       5. In reality, many states will argue that their laws are \n     equal to or more stringent than federal law. Despite the \n     language of the amendment, which limits waivers to states \n     whose laws are equivalent to or stricter than federal law, \n     many states will argue that their laws meet the standard, \n     regardless of the merits. Many states already routinely make \n     this argument.\n       California argued in the summer of 1990 that its law was as \n     good as federal law when it sought an exemption from the law \n     from the Health care Financing Administration and from \n     Congress. California also argued that complying with federal \n     law would cost billions of dollars more than the existing \n     system. HCFA rejected a waiver because it had no authority to \n     waive the federal law and Congress also refused to exempt \n     California from the requirements of federal law. California \n     nevertheless went forward with it defiance of federal law and \n     announced publicly on October 1, 1990, the effective date of \n     the law, that it would not implement federal law. As a \n     result, a statewide class of residents in California sued the \n     state to compel it to implement the federal law. I was and \n     still am, lead attorney for plaintiffs in that litigation. \n     The federal district court ruled in January 1991 that \n     California's law was not the same as federal law and that it \n     offered residents less protection. Finding that residents \n     faced irreparable harm from California's conduct, the court \n     ordered California to implement the entire law immediately. \n     If the reform law had not been in place, with its lack of \n     provision for waiver of federal standards, California \n     residents would not have been protected.\n       6. The federal government would lose current authority to \n     enforce standards of care against nursing facilities. Section \n     2137(a)(2)(D), ``No waiver of enforcement,'' begins, ``A \n     state granted a waiver . . . shall be subject to [three \n     categories of penalties].'' This provision addresses solely \n     the authority of the Secretary to impose penalties against \n     states that fail to meet state standards for which they \n     received a waiver. This language does not retain authority in \n     the Secretary to impose penalties against nursing facilities \n     that fail to meet standards.\n       Subsection (iii) of 2137(a)(2)(D) does not appear to make \n     sense. Although its purports to give the Secretary \n     enforcement authority under the reform law, the opening \n     language of the section quoted above restricts this federal \n     enforcement authority to actions against states.\n       Senator Cohen insisted in his statement on October 27 that \n     ``the Federal Government must continue a central role in \n     monitoring and enforcing nursing home standards.'' \n     Congressional Record, Oct. 27, 1995, S 16043. However, the \n     language of the Roth Amendment does not carry out his intent.\n       7. The Secretary's penalty against states for noncompliance \n     is considerably weaker than current federal law. Section \n     2137(b) limits the financial penalty against states to no \n     more than 2% of the federal payment under section 2121(c). \n     Current federal law authorizes the Secretary to withhold all \n     of a state's Medicaid payments if he/she finds that the state \n     plan does not conform to the requirements of the Medicaid law \n     or if a state fails to comply with the law in its \n     administration of the state plan. 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1316(a)(1).\n       When California announced on October 1, 1990 that it would \n     not implement the nursing home reform law, the Secretary \n     issued a determination that California was not in compliance \n     with federal law. 56 Federal Register 80 (Jan. 2, 1991). All \n     of California's Medicaid money for nursing homes was \n     jeopardized.\n       A maximum of a 2% penalty is a considerably weaker federal \n     sanction.\n       At the Senate Aging Committee hearing on October 26, the \n     witnesses made clear that there needs to be a federal set of \n     standards that are uniform for everyone, no matter where they \n     live. Waivers for what are fundamental rights for individuals \n     who live in nursing facilities (as witnesses described the \n     law) would be granted or denied in a highly political \n     situation, not on their merits.\n\n[[Page S 16953]]\n\n       Thank you for your efforts on behalf of nursing home \n     residents. The Pryor/Cohen Amendment, No. 2983, offers \n     better, more comprehensive protection to residents than the \n     Roth Amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Toby S. Edelman.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, they have analyzed this particular issue, I \nthink, as well as and as objectively and as fairly as they know how. \nThey come down with the bottom line that we do not want to see \ncompromised the safety, health, and the quality of life for the nursing \nhome residents of the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I see no other Senator seeking recognition. Therefore, \nI yield the remainder of my time, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I do not think I have requested the yeas \nand nays.\n  Therefore, I request the yeas and nays on my motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily lay \naside the motion to instruct the conferees on the nursing home \nstandards.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record as part of this debate, since our time has expired, a \nreport.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Reasons Why the Nursing Home Reform Provisions in OBRA '87 Should Be \n                                Repealed\n\n       1. The cost to the Medicare program for the survey and \n     certification of Nursing Homes (skilled nursing facilities) \n     will be approximately one hundred million dollars for the \n     current fiscal year. Combine the national Medicare cost with \n     the one hundred million dollar cost to the Medicaid program \n     to do surveys of Medicaid nursing facilities and you can \n     project a total national savings of two hundred million \n     dollars to Medicare and Medicaid.\n       2. The survey, enforcement and certification requirements \n     flowing from OBRA '87 are excessive in scope, difficult to \n     administer and were not pilot tested to demonstrate their \n     applicability. As a result there is gross inconsistency in \n     survey findings and enforcement remedies between individual \n     states and HCFA regions across the country.\n       For example, for the 1,676 national surveys competed \n     between July 1, 1995 and September 1, 1995, Michigan found \n     only 1.6% (1 of 61) of facilities surveyed to be in \n     ``substantial compliance'' and not requiring any enforcement \n     remedies. The national percentage of facilities in \n     ``substantial compliance'' for the same period was 32%. \n     Michigan continues to identify 60% of its facilities as \n     providers of ``substandard quality of care'' when utilizing \n     the HCFA definition while the national rate is 18%. These \n     unacceptable variations are largely due to vague statutory \n     requirements that have been implemented without adequate \n     evaluation and training.\n       3. Implementation of the enforcement requirements in OBRA \n     '87 has resulted in inappropriate labelling of some providers \n     as providers of ``Substandard Quality of Care'' when the \n     infractions cited are easily correctable. In the meantime, \n     these providers are prohibited for the next two years from \n     having state approval of a nurse aide training program \n     operated in or by that facility.\n       4. Administration of the enforcement processes required by \n     OBRA '87 is incredibly complex and cannot be administered by \n     the states without a significant increase in the budget and \n     the number of personnel dedicated to this task. Individual \n     states should be given the opportunity to design and \n     implement a survey and enforcement program that make sense, \n     are affordable and can be administered by that state.\n       5. States have existed state licensure and enforcement laws \n     and regulations. They should be given a chance to use this \n     authority. In the past there was a disincentive to do so \n     since Medicare and Medicaid regulations took precedence since \n     they controlled funding to the facility. States would welcome \n     the opportunity to design their own programs--probably \n     incorporating some of the positive elements of OBRA '87 but \n     leaving out those components that have not worked.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                      motion to instruct--medicare\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk and ask \nthat it be stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n motion to instruct budget conferees of H.R. 2491, offered by senator \n                              rockefeller\n\n       I move to instruct the conferees on the part of the Senate \n     not to agree to any reductions in Medicare beyond the $89 \n     billion needed to maintain the solvency of the Medicare Trust \n     Fund through the year 2006, and to reduce tax breaks for \n     upper-income taxpayers and corporations by the amount \n     necessary to ensure deficit neutrality.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, we have come to one of those days, I \nthink, in the Senate and in this Congress which is pretty definitional. \nI think, based upon some town meetings that I held yesterday in West \nVirginia in very rural counties, people are really looking at the \nCongress today to find out what we are made of and whether or not we \ncan govern. I think there is a suspicion that we cannot, but there is a \nhope that we will. The day that that will be determined will be, I \nsuppose, today and tomorrow, but basically today, up until midnight.\n  Mr. President, the reason that I have offered this motion, which the \nclerk just read, is to, in fact, do a favor for every Senator and to \ngive every Senator an additional chance to defend what is probably the \nmost popular program in this country--and that is Medicare--and to \nprotect that program from robbery that can, in fact, still be stopped. \nBut, at the moment, it is not being stopped and, therefore, 37 million \nAmericans are in jeopardy.\n  The motion, as the clerk read it, gives very precise instructions to \nthe conferees of this reconciliation bill, who are in fact still trying \nto figure out what to do. If a Senator, at a later hour, is to vote for \nthis motion, the Senator will be telling the conferees that Medicare--\nagain, probably the most popular program in the country--should only be \ncut to ensure that Medicare's solvency, the trust fund's solvency, is \nensured through 2006.\n  Now, there is no reason to ensure solvency longer than that period \nbecause, in fact, there has to be a longer term solution made, in any \nevent, and that, I hope--and I know the majority leader hopes, and I \nknow the ranking member of the Finance Committee hopes--that will be \ndone by some kind of a commission which will be sort of a binding \ncommission, a Base Closing Commission, wherein hard decisions will be \nmade about the future of Medicare, how it is to be paid for, what it is \nto offer, et cetera, and that will be remanded back, so to speak, to \nthe Congress, who will vote that up or down, and the President will \nsign it.\n  My feeling would be, of course, that the Congress would vote for the \nbill, as they did the Social Security Commission, because it would be \ncarefully thought through by a group of experts, and that is the longer \nterm solution. But that is for another day.\n  For the moment, we have to figure out how can we get from here to the \nyear 2006 and keep Medicare solvent. The trustees of the Medicare \nhospital insurance trust fund have made it very clear in public \nstatements, private statements, writings, official statements, \nunofficial statements, and in any statement they have ever made about \nthis, that all of the problems of Medicare part A can be solved by \nmeans of an $89 billion cut. Of course, that is $181 billion less than \nthe excessive and, I think, dangerous, and certainly unnecessary, cut \nof $270 million, which was put forward by the two versions of the \nRepublican budgets now passed by the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Mr. President, $270 billion of Republican cuts get you to the year \n2006 for solvency, and $89 billion of Democratic cuts get you to the \nyear 2006 for solvency.\n  At some point, one has to ask the logical question: How come if both \nget you to the same place for solvency, even give or take a year, why \nis there such a difference? Why is there a $181 billion difference in \nwhat the Democrats are suggesting--this is what the trustees suggested \nto us--and what the Republicans are suggesting? \n\n[[Page S 16954]]\n\n  This motion is a final chance to go on record for the survival and \nthe solvency of Medicare. I repeat, a final chance. It really is. Every \nRepublican Senator can take advantage in a sense of this 1-day special \nopportunity. If you want to make it clear that you do not want Medicare \nto wither on the vine, this is definitely the vote for you.\n  These are not political words, in fact. The words could not be more \nclear. They could not be more precise. Mr. President, $89 billion does \nthe job. Anything else is for some other purpose. Mr. President, $89 \nbillion in cuts give Medicare solvency for the short and medium term. \nAnything else above that is for some other purpose.\n  The trustees of the Medicare trust fund have said in print and in \nevery other way that $89 billion of savings is precisely the amount \nneeded to ensure Medicare solvency until that magic year of the year \n2006. The problem for the Republican budget is that it needs a lot more \nmoney than $89 billion in cuts of Medicare.\n  I am trying to say this as objectively as I can. It really does need \nmore money. If there were $89 billion in cuts made out of Medicare, a \nmajor function of the Republican budget would fall on its face. I have \na very strong suspicion, as do most of my colleagues on this side of \nthe aisle and surely some on the other side of the aisle, that the \nreason for $270 billion of cuts in Medicare and the reason, in fact, \nfor $187 billion or $182 billion in cuts in Medicaid adding to $450 \nbillion, to give ample savings or cuts so that the $245 billion tax \nbreak can be paid for.\n  There are not many places in the Federal Government that you can go \nfor money anymore. You cannot go to the Defense Department. We made \nabout as many cuts as we can make there. You cannot go elsewhere--to \nthe National Endowment for the Arts. You cannot go to AmeriCorps; that \nis being abolished. You really have to go to Medicare and Medicaid.\n  If the proposition that people want to have a tax break for certain \npeople and certain corporations, then, obviously, at the exact same \nmoment as 7 years is being used to reduce the budget deficit to zero or \npurportedly to zero--there is discussion about that--you have to get a \nvery large amount of money from some other source. Of course, that \nsource, the largest of all of those sources, and the most tempting \ntarget, is Medicare. That is exactly where the Republicans go.\n  They do that, as I indicate, to pay for tax breaks that are listed \none after another after another, promising special dividends galore for \npeople who are already wealthy, and corporations that want to pay less \nare willing to make working families pay more.\n  Now, I do not agree with that philosophy. This is a democratic \nsociety, a democratic body. The Republicans control the Senate. The \nRepublicans control the House. They have made their decision. This is \nwhat they want to do.\n  Let it be clear that raiding Medicare is not reform. The last time I \nspoke on this subject, I had a Webster's dictionary and I looked up \n``reform'' in that dictionary. Once again, I refer to that because the \nrecord of definition of ``reform'' is ``to put or change into an \nimproved form or condition.'' That is how Webster defines reform: to \nput or change into an improved form or condition.\n  Cutting $270 billion, $181 billion in excess of what is necessary, is \ncertainly not putting or changing Medicare into an improved form or \ncondition. Not only that, it is making decisions about Medicare which \nshould not be made now, which should be made in the context of the \nlonger term, which is the idea of the commission.\n  Often Republicans say, ``Well, Democrats are afraid to means test.'' \nI do not think that is the case. I think Democrats are not afraid to \nmeans test. In this case, this Senator would not be afraid to means \ntest. I would be very much afraid to means test in the absence of any \nother consideration of what is going on in Medicare. I want to look at \nmeans testing in the broad spectrum of a larger commission, which is \nwhat I think that President Clinton would do, perhaps within a year or, \nif he is reelected, within 2 years. Then call together 30 experts, as \nhe did for the Greenspan commission, and sit down and discuss Medicare \nbehind closed doors, with the public involved through consumers and \nseniors, experts, actuaries, and everybody else.\n  When you want to, as Webster says, ``to put or change into an \nimproved form or condition,'' you want to make sure you are doing the \nright thing with something that means so much to senior citizens and to \nsome disabled, as does Medicare.\n  So, $270 billion is not going to put Medicare into better form. It \nwill put it into far worse form, a much worse condition. I think that \nis axiomatic. The numbers would simply say that. We do not have to wait \nand see. I do not want to wait and see right now what that means.\n  The reconciliation bill lays out how to get $270 billion out of \nMedicare in various cold print. The majority party has said premiums \nand deductibles for seniors shall be doubled. Nothing hidden. The \nseniors I was with yesterday, their premiums will be doubled. Their \ndeductibles will be doubled. Hospitals will get less. Rural hospitals--\nI was in a county yesterday in which one of the rural hospitals had \njust closed, gone bankrupt. I am trying to figure out a way to save it. \nIn the meantime, their costs, were they open, would go up, which makes \nit, of course, more difficult to open. Doctors will get less from \nMedicare.\n  What is interesting is that some doctors have told us for the record \nthat they are just not going to take older Americans as patients any \nlonger. They are not going to accept them as patients. There will be a \nlittle sign on their shingle which says Dr. So and So, ``Medicare \npatients, not accepted.'' They have said that to us, Mr. President. I \ndo not create that.\n  If all the cutbacks and price increases for seniors could not \ngenerate $270 billion, then there is some automatic chain saw which no \nlonger exists in the Senate budget which does in some other draconian \nform exist in the House budget, some automatic chain saw will keep on \ncutting Medicare.\n  The Senate had a very infamous section to it called ``BELT,'' to whip \nout, to rip-off, so to speak, and then to take Medicare and cut it \nblindly. In other words, if Medicare grew faster--everybody knew \nMedicare definitely was going to grow faster. They set in this BELT \nprogram a very low growth possibility so obviously Medicare would fail \nthe test, BELT would be put into effect, and then a whole series of \ncuts would then be put into effect in a whole series of services so \nthey could no longer be offered to Medicare patients.\n\n  I think the minority embarrassed the majority in this body to take \nthat out. I am glad. I congratulate the majority party for doing that \nbecause I think it was wise to do. But that has not happened in the \nHouse, where it is very hard to embarrass the majority party. The \nminority party is not very good at it over there. They do not have the \nnumbers to do it.\n  In any event, as far as we know, it stays there, a BELT-like \ninstrument, which is a meat ax, and that will just make the problem of \nseniors and paying for Medicare much, much, much, much worse. We offer \nthis motion to instruct conferees to give Senators another chance to \nfix this budget--again; to get the priorities straight--again. \nBalancing the budget does not mean, I do not think, by definition, \ndestroying Medicare, hurting Medicare, spending huge sums on new tax \nbreaks and increasing the debt over the next 7 years. It means \nprotecting Medicare's solvency with the $89 billion. It means limiting \ntax relief to what we can afford.\n  Notice I am not saying abolish tax relief altogether, but simply \nlimiting it to what we can truly afford. And then limiting it to those \nwho can use it the best, who either need it the most or can use it the \nmost productively, in terms of jobs, in terms of giving people a better \nopportunity, a life. Of course, it means using some common fiscal \nsense. That is the kind of budget we should be working together to pass \nin this body.\n  I urge every Senator to vote for this motion. I am not sure that \nevery Senator will, but I urge every Senator to do that. It is a bonus \nvote. Yes, it is our final--and yes it is a desperate--act, to try to \nconvince Senators on the Republican side to protect Medicare and not \nsacrifice Medicare at this very early stage on the alter of budget \ndeficit reduction for the purpose of a tax break. \n\n[[Page S 16955]]\n\n  Let us remember why Americans of all ages feel so strongly about \nMedicare. It is one of the country's proudest achievements. It enables \nevery American to count on dignity and decency when they retire and get \nolder. It tells families fortunate enough to have parents and \ngrandparents who grow old that they will not have to make the terrible \nchoice between buying a house or sending a child to college and paying \nthe health bill of a mother, father, grandmother or grandfather, as \nthey get into their seventies and eighties or beyond that.\n  The Members of this body on both sides of the aisle should always \nhave courage to change course when the signs are obvious that it is \ntime to go down a different road. We are at, now, such a time. This \nmotion is a genuine effort to give Senators a chance to do just that. I \ndo not know of any other way to appeal to the conscience of the \nmajority in the Senate than by this motion to instruct the conferees. \nWe have exhausted every other opportunity. We cannot vote on bills \nanymore. All we can do is to make a motion to instruct the conferees to \nconsider what it is we have been trying to say. There is nothing else \nleft to us, so we do what we possibly can to protect seniors.\n  The plan to use Medicare to pay for other agendas is just not \nworking. The public is not buying it. It is going over like a lead \nballoon out there on Main Street and in the coffee shops and living \nrooms and senior centers where cutting $270 billion from Medicare is \nunderstood very clearly.\n  Again, I was at two town meetings yesterday in my State, in \nrelatively rural counties. The people understand, there, the seniors \nunderstand, there, very well, exactly what has happened. They did not \nneed to get a lecture from me on it. They understood it. That message \nhas really gotten through. It is really hurting.\n  If I were a member of the majority party in this body I would hear \nthat message loud and clear. I would be somewhat afraid of that \nmessage. But most important, I would respect that message because it is \na message which is coming directly from people who are affected by it \nand they do understand it. They understand it very clearly. The \nAmerican people are really paying attention to this part of our debate \nover priorities.\n  A lot of the rest may go by, but this part they are paying close \nattention to. They are tuned in and they are turned off and they are \nangry and they are scared. Not by the minority, but by the fact that \ntheir premiums and deductibles will get doubled; that they may be \nturned away by hospitals or doctors; that hospitals will lose money. \nHospitals will not turn them away--but they are scared of the idea of \n$270 billion in Medicare cuts. And they have every reason to be scared \nabout that, because the $270 billion in cuts are not needed, they are \nnot called for. They have another agenda.\n  Before Medicare was enacted, just under half of America's elderly had \nno health insurance--over half had no health insurance, in fact, \nwhatsoever. Can you imagine that? To be 80 years old and have no health \ninsurance? What would that mean to a lady or a man, perhaps living by \nthemselves, to have no health insurance? Today, 97 percent of America's \nseniors do have health insurance, thanks to Medicare. And that includes \n330,115 older and disabled citizens in my State of West Virginia. I \nhappen to care about them. I want to see the right thing done by them. \nThe right thing can still be done by them, for them, by us.\n  Nationwide, these are Americans whose average income is $17,750, \nwhich is not very much money. Not so in West Virginia. In West Virginia \nthe average income for seniors is $10,700 a year, of which already one-\nfifth is being spent on health care. So think about what an $11 premium \nincrease per month would mean? In other words, if you start out with \n$10,700 and then already 21 percent is being spent for health care, so \nthat is more than $2,000. And then you have to add on another $1,000 \njust for the premium. You come very quickly to the point where these \nfolks, who are real people--you know they are real people, they come \nout in the cold to meetings in West Virginia and other States, and meet \nwith us. They are afraid. I did not tell them to be afraid. They are \nafraid. They arrive at the meetings afraid. That is why they came to \nthe meeting, because they are afraid and they want to know is there \ngoing to be a change in this policy?\n  They want to stay healthy. They want to stay alive. They do not even \nget prescription drugs, do they, under Medicare? They do not even get \nprescription drug coverage; or home care, which is what we all want. \nThey cannot get that under Medicare. But certain things they can get \nand they really do want them.\n  If I could be very blunt about it, Medicare, I think, is on the short \nlist of America's all-time great accomplishments as a Nation. I think \nit belongs on the list that includes winning the American revolution, \nbreaking off with the British, in other words, and starting the world's \ngreatest democracy; establishing Social Security; stopping Hitler and \nending the Asia part of the Second World War; sending a man to the \nMoon. I put Medicare in a league with those. We had hundreds of \nthousands of soldiers killed in the Second World War. We have hundreds \nof thousands of seniors who live, dependent, upon Medicare in West \nVirginia, and 37 million across the country each and every year, except \nthat the number gets larger.\n\n  Medicare should not be treated like the bank standing there on the \ncorner to be robbed so the money can be just handed out to the most \nwealthy, even though some of the intentions might be good. Before the \nconferees finish their work, this motion is a chance to give up on an \nidea that is making Americans mad. And it is not just senior Americans.\n  At town meetings I have gone to over recent months--and the one I was \nat yesterday--it is not just the seniors that are mad. It is all of \nthose folks that turn out in those rural counties that are mad. They \nare angry that this is happening--happening in a sense without their \nknowledge. The knowledge has gotten through because of the press after \nits usual preoccupation with trying to figure out not the substance of \nthe issue but who wins and who loses. Are the Republicans up? Are the \nDemocrats down? What is Clinton going to do? What is he not going to do \nin the offer to the President today? That is what it always is. That is \nwhat these people have to get. It is political warfare. It has nothing \nto do with their lives. That is for the most part what the media out \nthere covers. So it is hard for them to get the point, but they are \ninformed on this issue.\n  So, again, before the conferees finish their work, this motion is a \nchance to give up on the idea that is making Americans so mad and is \nforcing the budget process to remain divided and contentious--in some \nways is forcing a constitutional crisis. I will get to that in a \nmoment. The Senators on this side have absolutely no choice, Mr. \nPresident--no choice.\n  We have exhausted our remedies. There is nothing more we can do. We \nare in the minority trying to fight for Medicare. But we have exhausted \nour remedies except for something called a motion to instruct \nconferees, which probably will not pass, but I hope it does. I hope it \ndoes because it is in the interest of everybody in this body and \ncertainly in the interest of senior Americans.\n  The President has absolutely no choice but to promise the veto pen. \nWe were elected to stand for what we think this country stands for. \nThat includes the idea of health, income security through Medicare, \nthrough Medicaid, and through Social Security--all of these things--\nwhen you have finally finished your working years and you reach your \nlater years.\n  I know the people of West Virginia expect me to keep fighting for \nMedicare. They told me that yesterday. Go back there and fight. Go back \nthere and fight. That was their instruction. They understand that \nbalancing the budget does not mean using Medicare as some kind of a \nfund for giveaways. It means using Medicare for Medicare.\n  The Senate can agree on a budget that will eliminate the deficit, but \nonly when we first agree that Medicare should still be standing the day \nthat vital goal is reached.\n  Mr. President, I voted for a balanced budget in 7 years. It was not \nthe one that prevailed. It was another one. But \n\n[[Page S 16956]]\nit balances the budget in 7 years. I am for that.\n  So I do not offer this as some kind of an evasive mechanism. I offer \nit with the deepest sincerity, with a real sense of fear for what is \ngoing to happen to our seniors, and potentially to our country.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote for this motion to protect Medicare \nand the millions of seniors who should hear from us that their security \nis not being traded away.\n  Let me also just make a comment at this point. If I might ask how \nmuch time is remaining to this Senator?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator has 11 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, let me also comment on the issue that \nfills the morning headlines and the news stories--as well it should--\nthat relates directly to Medicare and the 37 million senior citizens \nwho count on Medicare. We all know too well that some are not acting as \nif it is not going to happen. But, you know, it is right on the \nthreshold. We are right on the brink.\n  The Federal Government may shut down within 24 hours. That may be a \nthought that pleases a lot of people, but if you are trying to land an \nairplane and you are trying to make sure that you can get a passport to \ncome back from Europe to this country, or whatever, this is a very, \nvery grave subject. This has not happened, I think, since perhaps in \nthe year 1990. And there is some thought that, if this happens, this \ntime it will last longer. The last time it cost the American taxpayers \n$1.7 billion. Heavens only know what it will cost this time. But here \nwe are.\n  Is the Government going to shut down in 24 hours? Beyond that, the \nUnited States' fiscal integrity is on the line as it has never been on \nthe line before.\n  When Robert Rubin talks, it is interesting. He is not just sort of \ntalking like the Secretary of the Treasury, so to speak. He is scared. \nHe is afraid of what is going to happen.\n  Why are we in peril? Why is our integrity in peril? Because our debt \nceiling limit may not be extended in time. Why? Because the party, to \nbe quite honest about it, Mr. President, that sought control of this \nCongress, that asked for the votes to be able to control this \nCongress--and has those votes and does control this Congress easily--\nneeded to be the majority party. You are. I would say to the Presiding \nOfficer, you all are in charge. And the majority party now refuses to \ntake care of one of the most basic responsibilities involved in \nGovernment.\n  The Republican leaders are actually refusing to allow two basic \nmeasures--the continuing resolution and the debt ceiling extension--to \ntravel from Congress to the President without a bunch of unnecessary, \ninappropriate, frankly some just silly baggage loaded onto these two \nmonumental bills because of what can happen.\n  It would be one thing if the majority would claim that they have \ncompleted their own promised work on the budget and a series of \nappropriations bills. But they have not. They are still negotiating the \nreconciliation bill in some room somewhere to figure out amongst \nthemselves just exactly how they plan to cut Medicare by $270 billion. \nThat is going on right now. And then to dole most of that money out \nthrough tax breaks.\n  The Republican majority still needs to finish their own work on the \nbudget, and we are 24 hours from shutting down the Government. Shutting \ndown the Government is like shutting down the people, in certain \nrespects--not in all respects, but shutting down the work of the people \nand what the people need to have done.\n  So, for some reason, even though any teacher would give the \nRepublicans an ``incomplete'' today on their promise to produce a 7-\nyear budget plan, we find the majority party playing with fire and \nendangering the country in ways that can be and have to be avoided.\n  Take the continuing resolution. That is the basic piece of \nlegislation to keep the Federal Government operating so national parks \nstay open, passports get approved, checks go out. The list goes on and \non and on. Of all possible pieces of baggage that the majority party \ncould attach to this bill, never, ever, ever, never, ever, ever, did I \nthink that they would take a premium increase in Medicare, a premium \nincrease for Medicare beneficiaries and make it as their top priority--\nto say to the President of the United States, ``You take this premium \nincrease, Mr. President, or we will shut down the Government.'' Take \nthis premium increase on 37 million seniors in this country or we will \nshut down the Government.\n  We used to do that kind of stuff at camp except we did not run the \nGovernment. But that is the kind of stuff we used to do at camp, I say \nto my friend from Arkansas. The Republican leaders are actually \ndemanding that the President swallow an increase in Medicare premiums \nin order to keep the Government running. The Government is meant to be \nserious stuff. The premium increase or whatever is going to happen, \nthat comes in the commission stage later on. That should not be the \nissue now. The issue now should be to make Medicare solvent. I say to \nthe President, do not swallow this ridiculous demand and do not give in \nto it. Do not do that to our country. Do not do that to your office. Do \nnot humble your office in that manner, by agreeing to this Republican \ndemand to hurt seniors as a tradeoff to keep the Government running.\n  More than three-quarters of all Americans on Medicare have yearly \nincomes of less than $25,000 a year, and as I have said, in my home \nState of West Virginia--and I daresay in the home State of the Senator \nfrom Arkansas it is not much more than what it is in West Virginia--the \naverage annual income for Medicare beneficiaries is $10,700 a year--not \n$25,000, not $17,000, $10,700 a year, and $2,000 plus already of that \ngoes to health care. So that leaves them $8,000 for the rest of the \nyear for everything else. And now we are going to add $150 or whatever \nof new premiums--and that is just part of doubling Medicare copays and \ndeductibles as is contemplated in the rest of the majority party's \nbudget plan.\n  The specific Medicare premium increase that the Republican leaders \nare demanding would cost our seniors an extra $11 a month. That means \ntheir premium would go from $42.50 to $53.50 a month. Maybe the upper-\nincome Americans in this body and some others of the upper-income \nAmericans who are counting on a tax cut in the Republican budget bill \nwill not notice the $11 increase in their premium insurance, but I \nguarantee you every last senior that I saw yesterday in town meetings--\nthat I have seen during the course of these years--will feel it and \nwill have to make choices as a result of it. An extra $11 a month in \ncost just might mean skipping a couple more meals at the end of the \nmonth.\n  Just talk, you say. No, it is not. It just is not. That is how fine \nthe margin is for them. Or not being able to pick up one's heart \nmedicine or coming up short when it is time to pay for the heating \nbill.\n  That is why the President cannot in this Senator's judgment and will \nnot in this Senator's judgment and should not even consider the idea of \nbeing pushed by Republicans to raise Medicare premiums even before they \nhave finished their budget.\n  Today is the day that the Republicans should give up trying to use \nMedicare and 37 million seniors and disabled Americans as pawns. This \nis that day. It is a ploy that is not working. It is a ploy which is \nnot good. I think most Republicans probably recognize that at this \npoint.\n  Mr. President, I close simply by saying that what I am doing is \nbegging my colleagues to walk away from this Medicare premium change at \nthis point. Do not make the President veto it because of something like \nthat. Let us try to do this properly and rationally.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield my remaining time to the \nSenator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time remaining under the control of the \nSenator from West Virginia has expired.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \nallowed 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I thank my colleague from West Virginia. His statement was eloquent. \nIt \n\n[[Page S 16957]]\nwas delivered with compassion and force as always, and I applaud him \nfor his commitment to this cause.\n  The Senator from West Virginia has brought up a most telling point \nwhich brings us to the brink of the so-called closing down of the \nGovernment, which does not have to happen. The Medicare issue that is \ntoday in the reconciliation bill is also the issue--that is, \nthreatening to bring down the Government--that the Republicans have put \ninto the concurrent resolution. It is the same issue. It should not be \ndebated in the continuing resolution. It should be debated in the \nreconciliation bill, as my colleague and friend from West Virginia \nknows, but there is a reason why there is no debate going on between \nthe conferees of the House and Senate, Republicans and Democrats on \nreconciliation. We do not have any conferees. There is no one to confer \nwith. And as a result we find the Government is about to close down. We \nhope not. It is not necessary. It is manufactured, this crisis.\n  In behalf of the Democratic leader, I would like for the Record to \nindicate that no Democratic Senator would require nor request a vote on \nsending the continuing resolution in its current form to the President. \nWe understood and hoped this morning that there would be presented the \ncontinuing resolution to the Senate. We were not. No Democratic Senator \nvoted for the continuing resolution which passed on Thursday, and we \nsee no reason to delay the continuing resolution going to the President \nfor his disposition.\n  I ask for 30 additional seconds, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Nor do we attempt to slow down this process. We want to \nsee this process go forward. We want to prevent this Government closing \ndown. It does not have to. It is our understanding on the Democratic \nside of the aisle that Republicans may now seek to amend the continuing \nresolution further and we are now waiting word as to what that \namendment might be.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank the distinguished manager. \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nrequire.\n  Let me today respond in part at least to some of the issues that were \nraised by our colleague from West Virginia in presenting his motion to \ninstruct conferees. What I would like to begin with is a discussion of \nthe numbers themselves.\n  The Senator from West Virginia and others on the Democratic side of \nthe aisle have contended in recent weeks that if we only reduced the \ngrowth of Medicare spending by $89 billion, somehow this alone would be \nenough to make the Medicare Program solvent, to preserve and protect \nand strengthen it.\n  That is simply not the case. The $89 billion number which has floated \naround here for some time is a number which at least many of us \nconsider to be a number in great dispute. Once again, it is a number \nthat comes not from the Congressional Budget Office, the office that I \nwould assume Members of Congress would look to for accurate \ninformation, but, rather, comes from the Office of Management and \nBudget.\n  We have talked on numerous occasions here on the floor of how, when \nthe President was first elected, he came to Congress and said, ``It's \ntime to end the games of rosy scenarios and administration politicking \nby using executive branch numbers. Let's all use the same numbers. \nLet's all use the CBO.'' But now when the crisis hits, when the crunch \ntime comes, we are back using OMB numbers. And $89 billion simply will \nnot get the job done.\n  In fact, it is interesting to note, Mr. President, that the President \nhimself in his proposals to bring the budget into balance has suggested \na number in the range of $127 billion as the amount of dollars that \nneed to be reduced in Medicare spending over the next few years in \norder to bring the budget into balance. That $127 billion is also an \nOMB number. If it was calculated by the CBO, using the assumptions we \nhave made here, it would be much higher. In fact, I think it would be \ncloser to $190 billion, using CBO kinds of assumptions, to get the job \ndone.\n  But the $89 billion proposed by this motion really only covers part \nof Medicare. That is the second thing that needs to be put into \nperspective. That covers part A of the trust fund. Let us look at that \ntrust fund. Part A of the trust fund will go into deficit this year for \nthe first time in its history. We have heard a lot of talk during the \ndebate about the Medicare Program, from the beginning when the \ntrustees' report was released, that, in fact, the trustees' report \nshould not be taken too seriously. After all, for years and years the \ntrustees have prophesied that at some date in the future Medicare part \nA would go bankrupt.\n  Now we are hearing a different story. Now maybe there is a need to \nadjust it. I say that $89 billion is not enough. There is a very \nserious need because part A, for the first time, in 1996 will run a \ndeficit. And at this point there is no foreseeable stage in the future \nwhen it will not run on an annual basis deficits that will grow larger \nand larger and larger.\n  That is because the structure of the program, the way it is currently \nset up, absolutely guarantees that the deficits in part A will continue \nto grow. It will grow faster, faster, and even faster in about 15 years \nas people in the so-called baby-boom generation reach an age when they \nbecome consumers of entitlements rather than people providing revenue \nto these trust funds.\n  Reductions of $89 billion in spending in Medicare represents business \nas usual, represents the approach that has been taken for too long here \nin the Congress of the United States, the kind of piecemeal, one-step-\nat-a-time approach to Medicare that has caused the program to continue \nto run at growth rates that are far greater than what the private \nsector sees in health care provider increases.\n  It is time to end that approach and play by the real numbers and time \nto play by the CBO numbers. The $89 billion is a stopgap solution; we \nneed a longer solution. We need not only a solution for part A, we need \nto solve the problems of part B, because part B is growing too fast as \nwell. That is what we have attempted to do in this budget \nreconciliation package.\n  Mr. President, the allusions that have been made suggest that the \nchanges we are talking about are ones that are simply designed to cause \npeople hardship and difficulty. That is not the case. Let me just \nreview for the Congress today some of the changes that are incorporated \nin our reconciliation package.\n  First, as was alluded to by the Senator from West Virginia, we intend \nto means test beneficiaries so that upper income citizens are not on \nthe same level as those in greater need and, in fact, do pay their fair \nshare. It is suggested that before we move in that direction, we should \nhave a long-term study and commission or some other form of assessing \nwhether or not to move toward the pay-your-fair-share approach. I think \nwe should put the commissions out of commission. I think this is an \napproach that is needed now. We do not need to delay in making that \ndecision.\n  Second, what we have tried to do in our plan is try to provide those \npeople who are in the Medicare Program with the right to choose a \nprogram that is best for them.\n  The Senator from West Virginia made a comment or two that I was \nstruck by. He talked about how Medicare does not provide for \npharmaceuticals. It does not provide, as you also know, Mr. President, \nfor things like new eyeglasses. That is because we have a one-size-\nfits-all Medicare plan. If you are a senior citizen in this country, \nyou do not have a choice, you are in Medicare and you only get one \napproach. If you are not, if you are in the younger age category, you \nhave a lot of choices.\n\n  What we want to do and one of the ways we intend to bring down the \ngrowth of Medicare is by giving our seniors the right to choose \ndifferent options. I know seniors who say, ``What I would like is a \nsystem where I do not have to pay for pharmaceuticals, where we have a \nbreak on drugs like a lot of private health care plans have.'' We want \nto give seniors that right. We do not want to take away their choices. \nWe want to expand them. \n\n[[Page S 16958]]\n\n  I know seniors who say, ``I would like to have a situation where I \ncan get my eyeglasses changed and not have to be hit in the pocketbook \nby the excessive costs of new eyeglass prescriptions.'' We want to give \nthem that choice, not diminish their choice; expand it.\n  Finally, what we want to do is eliminate the waste and the fraud and \nthe mismanagement in the Medicare Program. One of the ways we intend to \nreduce the growth of Medicare is by enforcing tough standards to deal \nwith fraud and abuse. Indeed, Mr. President, this Senator offered an \namendment which was adopted to provide the beneficiaries of Medicare \nwith an opportunity to obtain rewards for ferreting out the waste and \nfraud and bringing it to the attention of Federal officials or finding \nways to make the program run more efficiently.\n  There are a lot of ways we can address these problems. Every way does \nnot include, as was suggested earlier, simply more hardship for people. \nWe are trying to be innovative and broaden the choices for people. And \nwhat we are trying to do is offer a long-term solution to this problem, \nbecause it is not going to get better, Mr. President, it is going to \nget worse.\n  If you are in Medicare now or if you are approaching Medicare age, we \nare facing insolvency in the Medicare system. And the motion to \ninstruct, if it were to be implemented, would not offset that potential \ninsolvency because, Mr. President, in just a few years, as the \nentitlement commission indicated just last summer, we are talking about \na day in this country, if we do not slow the rate of growth of these \nprograms, when entitlement spending and spending on the interest on the \nnational debt will together consume all of the revenues of Government. \nThat would mean no national security, no law enforcement, no spending \non education, training, highways, or anything else unless we started \nborrowing money at a level that this country's economy could not \nsustain, which means we have to address these problems now, early in \nthe process, not much later on. That is what the Republican plan \nintends to do.\n  Finally, I would like to just address another point or two with \nregard to the Medicare issue. Today, it is being suggested that the \nlines are clearly drawn, that there is a side that cares about seniors \nand a side that does not. The majority party cares about seniors of \nthis country. It was not the majority party that increased the tax on \nthe earnings of Social Security beneficiaries. In fact, every Member of \nthe majority party voted against those tax hikes in 1993. It was the \nother side who imposed those higher taxes.\n  It was not the majority party that just last week wanted to give the \nPresident the ability to tap into the Social Security trust funds to \ndeal with our debt limit. We want to protect those Social Security \ntrust funds. And that is why our short-term debt ceiling bill would \nkeep those trust funds sacred.\n  Finally, it was not the majority party that introduced a balanced \nbudget plan that would dramatically change the CPI without any \nconsideration of those issues. It was the balanced budget plan offered \non the other side.\n  Mr. President, we see a lot of polls. We see polls that were alluded \nto by the Senator from West Virginia that say, ``Gee, these plans may \nor may not be popular today.'' But, Mr. President, every day the polls \nchange. If there is a new TV ad attacking a plan, that will change the \npolls. If there is a story in the newspaper or on the news, that will \nchange the polls. We did not come here, Mr. President, to change our \nphilosophies, to change our objectives, to change what we were sent \nhere to do based on the intermittent polls conducted by various \npollsters whether for the media or on a partisan basis.\n  We came here to fulfill promises that were made. And those promises, \njust so I can bring them back to the foreground, which underlie what we \nare trying to do across the board with this budget, were to, first, end \nthe red ink in Washington, 25 years of deficit spending. That is what \nour budget does. It brings the budget into balance. And what does that \nmean? It means lower interest rates. It means the Federal Government \nfinally operating the way we have to operate in our families and many \nState and local governments have to operate. That is by spending no \nmore than you take in.\n  Second, we have an obligation and a promise and a commitment to \npreserve, protect, and strengthen Medicare, not through next year's \nelection but into the future. And that is what our plan accomplishes.\n  Finally, we have a commitment, a promise, to let people keep more of \nwhat they earn. We heard a lot of talk about this tax cut already. I do \nnot want to get into great detail about it here again today. The motion \nto instruct suggests that somehow we would offset any budget impact of \nthis reduction in the change in the rate of growth of Medicare by \nreducing so-called tax breaks for upper income taxpayers and \ncorporations.\n  Mr. President, the tax cuts that are part of this reconciliation \npackage, just to go over them one more time, fall to families, fall to \nsmall businesses in great degree. Over $140 billion of the $245 \nbillion--actually a $225 billion net tax cut--is the family tax credit, \nand 83 percent of that, under the current version, goes to families who \nmake less than $100,000 a year and over 70 percent to families making \nless than $75,000 a year.\n  Another major part of that tax cut is the spousal IRA; another part \nis ending the marriage penalty; another part is to allow family farmers \nand small business people to pass on their assets to their children \nwithout facing huge Federal taxes at the time somebody passes away.\n  The only way we are going to offset the change that would be \nsuggested in this motion through tax changes would be to hit families \nand undermine the tax cuts which we have developed for them. That is \nnot the way, I think, we should do business, Mr. President.\n  So, for all of these reasons, we stand strong, I think, in support of \nthe original reconciliation package of the past.\n  At this time, I yield such time as we may have remaining to the \nSenator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has 7\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I, of course as all of us, have listened with great \ninterest this morning. Medicare is an item in which all of us have a \ngreat interest.\n  I would like, as the Senator from West Virginia indicated, to say to \nthe town meeting, Let's take the easy way out. I would like to say, We \ndon't really need to make the tough decisions. We can put it off again, \nas we have in the past. I guess it would be easier to fix it through \nthe next election rather than through the next generation.\n  I do not think that is why we are here. Many of us just came here, \nand we came here with a dedication to make some fundamental changes. We \ncame here with some dedication to not continue as we have over the last \n30 years and just fix it so it is easy, just fix it so we can get by \nuntil the next crisis, but rather really look at making some \nfundamental changes.\n  I think there is a concept we all have to consider, and that is, when \nyou look at the way things are and you are not happy with them, then \nyou have to make some change. You cannot expect to get different \nresults by continuing to do the same thing, which is what has gone on \nhere for too long.\n  We are seeking to make some changes. We are seeking to make a \nphilosophical difference, a fundamental difference in direction, and I \nunderstand there are changes. I happen to believe, and I think the \nmajority party believes, we ought to have less Government, it ought to \nbe less costly, we ought to balance the budget, we ought to have \nfundamental reform in welfare, we need to strengthen and maintain \nMedicare, Medicaid, we need to have tax reduction--we believe in that.\n  I understand there are those who believe more Government is better, \nand that is a legitimate view. I do not share it.\n  I am a little concerned, frankly, in the area of public policy where \nwe transfer decisions to people, but they have to be based on facts. I \nheard yesterday on the TV how we are raising the Medicare premium. It \nis just not a fact. We now pay 31.5 percent. That is what we will \ncontinue to pay. It has been that way since 1990. It was raised by a \nDemocratic Congress in the Budget Reconciliation Act. That is a fact. \n\n[[Page S 16959]]\n We are not raising it. It is continuing on where it was as a \npercentage of the cost of that premium.\n  A balanced budget, how long has it been? Almost everyone who will get \nup and object to what is happening has been here for these years when \nwe have not balanced the budget. Now, I know there are various ways to \ndo it, but we do need to change. We talked about the taxes--not \naccurate. We talked about great educational cuts, less than one-tenth \nof 1 percent.\n  So, Mr. President, we need to talk about facts if we are going to \nhave a participatory Government. The President has not participated in \nthis dialog and still does not.\n  So, of course, we are talking about a popular program and all of us \nwant to maintain it. That is really the issue: How do you best do it.\n\n  Why is it attached? Why is this portion attached? Let me tell you \nwhy. Because in part A, which it deals with, part A is withheld from \nSocial Security and you cannot change the computers as quickly. If you \nwaited until after the first of the year to do this, then it would be \nMay again before you could change the computers back to 31.5 percent. \nThere is a logical reason for it being there. The rest of Medicare is \nnot there. This one is there because it is a mechanical process that \nhas to be accommodated.\n  I, too, come from a rural State. Let me tell you some of the things \nin Medicare that are going to be useful to rural States. The Senator \nfrom West Virginia talked about hospitals that have been closed. We \njust had one close. It had a utilization of 4 percent. You cannot \noperate that way.\n  Under the current law, the Federal Government cannot reimburse for \nhospitals that are not full hospitals. We have a proposition in here to \nredefine hospitals so that a community like that can have an emergency \nroom, it can have a stabilizing facility so that you could be there and \nbe reimbursed by the Federal Government.\n  We have Medicare bonus payments so physicians come to these rural \nareas. We have telemedicine grants, rural emergency access, hospitals \nwhich I just spoke about. We do something to equalize HMO and Medicare. \nIn Florida, they get $650 a month for Medicare. In Wyoming and South \nDakota, it is $150. That is not fairness, that is not equity.\n  These are the kind of changes, if we want to have a strong Medicare \nProgram, that have to be made over time. We cannot take the easy way \nout. We cannot just patch it up and see if it can go forward. We have \nto make some changes, and that is what it is all about.\n  Only that portion that has to do with this maintaining the 31.5-\npercent level is in this proposition that we are talking about, and it \nis in there for a particular reason, a mechanical reason, so that it \ncan continue to be.\n  So, Mr. President, I suggest to you we need to reach down, we need to \ntake a look at the kind of results we want, we need to take a look at \nthe fact that under the proposal that is being talked about here, there \nis only stability for about 6 years, when we are talking about going on \nto 2009 when the baby boomers come in. You need to do something before \nthat. We do not need to go to another committee. We have been through \nthis time and time and time again. We have spent all 2 years on this \nmatter--everyone in this body.\n  So we know what decisions have to be made. They are tough. Of course, \nthey are tough. Decisions are not easy. We are here to be trustees for \npeople to make decisions to make things work. We are not here to pass \nit off. We are not here to be easy. We are not here to be able to get \non TV and make things sound great. We are here to deal with the facts. \nWe are here to deal with change. We are here to deal with maintaining \nMedicare so that we have a program for the elderly, and if we want to \ndo that, then we have to make a fundamental change.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair indicates to the Senator only 10 \nseconds is remaining.\n  Mr. THOMAS. My time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on the motion.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, has all time expired on the motion to \ninstruct that was offered by the Senator from West Virginia?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I believe under the previous order, it is \nnow in order to offer a third motion to instruct conferees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. There are two motions \npending, the motion to instruct regarding Social Security and the \nmotion to instruct regarding health care.\n\n\n                  Motion to Instruct--Social Security\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham] moves to instruct \n     conferees on H.R. 2491, the Balanced Budget Reconciliation \n     Act of 1995--\n       (1) to honor section 13301 of the Budget Enforcement Act of \n     1990,\n       (2) not to include in the conference report any language \n     that violates this section, and thus\n       (3) not to include the $12 billion in Social Security cuts \n     that were included as an offset for on-budget spending in the \n     Finance Committee's amendment.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I control 20 minutes. The Senator from \nSouth Carolina controls 20 minutes. I defer to the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank my distinguished colleague from Florida.\n  Mr. President, the reason we make this motion is not simply to obey \nthe law, but to understand and appreciate the reasons that we \noverwhelmingly passed this law back in 1990.\n  Let me ask unanimous consent at this point to have section 13301 of \nthe Budget Act printed in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Subtitle C--Social Security\n\n     SEC. 13301. OFF-BUDGET STATUS OF OASDI TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Exclusion of Social Security From All Budgets.--\n     Nothwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts and \n     disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund \n     shall not be counted as new budget, authority, outlays, and \n     receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of--\n       (1) the budget of the United States Government as submitted \n     by the President,\n       (2) the congressional budget, or\n       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985.\n       (b) Exclusion of Social Security From Congressional \n     Budget.--Section 301(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974 is amended by adding at the end the following: ``The \n     concurrent resolution shall not include the outlays and \n     revenue totals of the old age, survivors, and disability \n     insurance program established under title II of the Social \n     Security Act or the related provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 in the surplus or deficit totals \n     required by this subsection or in any other surplus or \n     deficit totals required by this title.''.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this section essentially says, ``thou \nshall not use Social Security trust funds in computing the deficit or \nthe debt.''\n  We passed this provision back in 1990 after the Budget Committee had \nfully considered the particular problem. What we had been doing was \nobscuring the true size of the deficit, not by reducing it, but by \nmoving it. In other words, we would take the surplus in the trust funds \nfor Social Security and count them as revenues so that, when balanced \nagainst the expenditure column, it looked like we had reduced the \ndeficit.\n  The truth of the matter is that we were only moving the deficit--from \nwhat we owned the financial markets to what we owned the Social \nSecurity trust fund. That is why my colleagues on the Budget Committee \nvoted overwhelmingly to take the Social Security trust fund off budget \nby a vote of 20-1 on July 10, 1990.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the record of this vote printed in \nthe Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hollings Motion To Report the Social Security Preservation Act\n\n       The Committee agreed to the Hollings motion to report the \n     Social Security Preservation Act by a vote of 20 yeas to 1 \n     nay:\n       Yeas: Mr. Sasser, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Johnston, Mr. Riegle, \n     Mr. Exon, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Simon, Mr. Sanford, Mr. Wirth, \n     Mr. Fowler, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Robb, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \n     Boschwitz, Mr. Symms, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Kasten, Mr. Nickles, \n     Mr. Bond.\n\n[[Page S 16960]]\n\n       Nays: Mr. Gramm.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Senator Domenici, myself, and the rest of the Senate \nBudget Committee save the Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm, voted that \ntrust funds of Social Security not be used in calculating the annual \ndeficits or surpluses. Soon thereafter, on October 18, 1990, we had a \nvote in the U.S. Senate and passed the same legislation by a vote of \n98-2.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that vote be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Vote on Hollings-Heinz, et al., Amendment Which Excludes the Social \nSecurity Trust Funds From the Budget Deficit Calculation, Beginning in \n                            Fiscal Year 1991\n\n       Yeas (98)--Democrats: Adams, Akaka, Baucus, Bentsen, Biden, \n     Bingaman, Boren, Bradley, Breaux, Bryan, Bumpers, Burdick, \n     Byrd, Conrad, Cranston, Daschle, DeConcini, Dixon, Dodd, \n     Exon, Ford, Fowler, Glenn, Gore, Graham, Harkin, Heflin, \n     Hollings, Inouye, Johnston, Kennedy, Kerrey, Kerry, Kohl, \n     Lautenberg, Leahy, Levin, Lieberman, Metzenbaum, Mikulski, \n     Mitchell, Moynihan, Nunn, Pell, Pryor, Reid, Riegle, Robb, \n     Rockefeller, Sanford, Sarbanes, Sasser, Shelby, Simon, Wirth.\n       Republicans: Bond, Boschwitz, Burns, Chafee, Coats, \n     Cochran, Cohen, D'Amato, Danforth, Dole, Domenici, \n     Durenberger, Garn, Gorton, Gramm, Grassley, Hatch, Hatfield, \n     Heinz, Helms, Humphrey, Jeffords, Kassebaum, Kasten, Lott, \n     Lugar, Mack, McCain, McClure, McConnell, Murkowski, Nickles, \n     Packwood, Pressler, Roth, Rudman, Simpson, Specter, Stevens, \n     Symms, Thurmond, Warner, Wilson.\n       Nays (2)--Republicans: Armstrong, Wallop.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, at that particular time, so there will \nbe no misunderstanding, the present leader of the budget in the U.S. \nSenate, the chairman of our committee, Senator Domenici of New Mexico, \nsaid:\n\n       I support taking Social Security out of the budget deficit \n     calculation. I support the Heinz-Hollings-Moynihan amendment.\n\n  Thereafter, the Senator did have some misgivings, and I want to quote \nhim:\n\n       The issues involved with taking Social Security, including \n     interest, out of the budget deficit, are not as simple or \n     painless as they seem, or as the sponsors of this measure \n     have suggested. If we take interest off budget, then we have \n     to come up with more deficit reduction, and that means only \n     one of two things--more taxes or more spending cuts.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, we get right to the meat of the coconut. The real \nfiscal cancer in the Federal Government today is the amount that we \nhave to pay annually in interest costs on the national debt. The \nestimate for this fiscal year is $348 billion. We could adopt the GOP \nbudget in the next 10 minutes, and we still would not have not cut \nspending. Why? Because spending for our interest costs on the national \ndebt are up to a billion dollars a day.\n  It gets worse and worse and worse every day, and it will be next to \nimpossible to attack this problem if we do not act now. We are 7 years \nand two Presidential elections from the time when Medicare will go into \nthe red. We are 25 years away from the time when Social Security \nsurpluses will be exhausted. Yet we constantly hear the rhetoric about \nthe looming crisis in Social Security and the need to ``protect, \npreserve, and strengthen'' Medicare--all because we do not want to talk \nabout the fiscal crisis that we are in this very minute. Why do we \navoid this reality? Because if we were to talk about it, we might be \nforced to do something about it.\n  In order to do something about it, you have to have a balanced \napproach that includes spending cuts as well as revenue increases. Our \nbudget history for the last 15 years highlights this reality. When \nHoward Baker was the majority leader, he and I joined in trying to pass \na budget freeze from 1981 to 1985. We said, ``Take this year's budget \nfor next year.'' That would have saved billions of dollars, but alas, \nthat road was not travelled.\n  Having not succeeded there, I started working with Senator Gramm of \nTexas and Senator Rudman of New Hampshire and said, under Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings, that we would have truth in budgeting. We would not only have \nthe freeze, but additional cuts across the board as well. We were on \ncourse with automatic $37-billion-a-year cuts, in an orderly fashion, \nto give us a balanced budget by 1990.\n  In 1986, we expanded our field of vision saying, wait a minute, it is \nnot just the Appropriations Committee appropriating and spending more; \nthat Finance Committee should be responsible as well in cracking down \non unnecessary tax breaks. As a result, we had tax reform which \npurported to end corporate welfare.\n  By 1987, we met in the Budget Committee and considered other freezes, \ncuts, loophole closings. I remember telling Dick Darman, Director of \nOMB for President Bush, ``Look, unless we grab a hold of this now with \nsome kind of taxes, as well as the cuts and freezes and loophole \nclosings, we are going to be in desperate circumstances. We are going \nto run up to about $400 billion deficits, the debt growing all along, \nand interest costs growing all along.''\n  As a result, eight of us in the Budget Committee voted in a \nbipartisan fashion to increase taxes. You cannot find that type of \ncandor anymore around this Capitol, around the White House or anywhere \nelse in this city. But, you are not going to get on top of this cancer \nunless you have that kind of surgery. Because, unless revenues are part \nof the solution increase taxes will continue to rise.\n  So let me be clear, Mr. President, those who say they are against \ntaxes and want to cut spending, and even taxes, are totally off base \nwith respect to fiscal responsibility. They know it, you know it, and \nthe blooming press knows it, but they will not print it because they \nhave joined in the pollster conspiracy. When the question is asked: Are \nyou for taxes? The answer invariably is: Oh, I am against taxes. So we \nall jump on the bandwagon. A public servant who comes out for paying a \nbill is portrayed as some fellow for wasteful spending. You cannot get \nany more wasteful than a billion dollars a day in interest costs for \nnothing. It was only $75 billion when Reagan took over. It is now $348 \nbillion. That is an increase of $273 billion for absolutely nothing.\n  So my point is, let us quit obscuring the size of the deficit. Let us \nquit moving the deficit from the general fund over to the Social \nSecurity.\n  My colleague from Florida will talk specifically about the $12 \nbillion they borrowed from the trust fund when they had to pick up \nvotes on the other side of the aisle with the Roth amendment. In \noffsetting their amendment, they used $12 billion that under the law \nshould not be used for additional spending but should be credited to \nthe Social Security Trust fund. It is the height of what we call smoke \nand mirrors. People sincerely get on the floor and claim, ``We are not \nusing smoke and mirrors.'' False. That is exactly what you are doing \nwhen you use the surpluses in the Social Security trust fund to claim \nthat you are balanced and when you backload all of the tough choices.\n  Indeed, 50 percent of the proposed cuts under the GOP plan do not \ncome until after the Presidential election in the year 2000.\n  This year, to be specific, we are trying to cut $45 billion in \nspending under the Republican budget. In the year 2002, Mr. President, \nwe will have to slash $347 billion. We cannot get the $45 billion this \nyear, much less the $347 necessary in year 7. That is why 10 of the 13 \nappropriations bill are not over to the President--because Republicans \ncannot agree on what to cut.\n  We have friends on both sides of the aisle who think we ought to do \nmore in education, more in technology, in legal services, and right \ndown the list.\n  Mr. President, we should look at what we have been doing. We have \nbeen long on sweeping promises to the American people and slow on \nresults. In 1981 under President Reagan, the first concurrent budget \nresolution for the fiscal year 1982 predicted a deficit by fiscal year \n1984 of zero. No deficit, a balanced budget.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that page printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Excerpt From First Concurrent Resolution on the Budget--Fiscal Year \n                                  1982\n\n       (4) the amount of the deficit in the budget which is \n     appropriate in the light of economic conditions and all other \n     relevant factors is as follows:\n       Fiscal year 1982: $48,800,000,000;\n       Fiscal year 1983: $21,400,000,000;\n       Fiscal year 1984: $0;\n       (b) the appropriate level of the public debt is as follows:\n\n[[Page S 16961]]\n\n       Fiscal year 1982: $1,091,200,000,000;\n       Fiscal year 1983: $1,154,300,000,000;\n       Fiscal year 1984: $1,197,600,000,000;\n\n     and the amount by which the temporary statutory limit on such \n     debt should be accordingly increased is as follows:\n       Fiscal year 1982: $91,400,000,000;\n       Fiscal year 1983: $63,100,000,000;\n       Fiscal year 1984: $43,300,000,000.\n       (b) Based on allocations of the appropriate levels of total \n     new budget authority and of total budget outlays as set forth \n     in paragraphs (2) and (3) of the preceding subsection of this \n     resolution, the Congress hereby determines and declares \n     pursuant to section 301(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974 that, for the fiscal years beginning on October 1, 1981, \n     October 1, 1982, and October 1, 1983, the appropriate level\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Then in 1985--we need not put that in; everyone knows \nthat Gramm-Rudman-Hollings was a 5-year path to a balanced budget.\n  They talk about fiscal responsibility. I will show them the TV where \nI got the Good Government Award for ending deficits for all time from \nPresident Ronald Wilson Reagan.\n  By 1990, we got together--and please, my gracious, put this in the \nRecord, please. I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent resolution \non the budget for the year 1991 be printed at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Excerpt From Concurrent Resolution on the Budget--Fiscal Year 1991\n\n       (3) The appropriate levels of total budget outlays are as \n     follows:\n       Fiscal year 1991: $1,002,300,000,000;\n       Fiscal year 1992: $1,024,800,000,000;\n       Fiscal year 1993: $1,049,900,000,000;\n       Fiscal year 1994: $1,059,900,000,000;\n       Fiscal year 1995: $1,080,900,000,000.\n       (4)(A) The amounts of the deficits are as follows:\n       Fiscal year 1991: $143,700,000,000;\n       Fiscal year 1992: $100,900,000,000;\n       Fiscal year 1993: $62,000,000,000;\n       Fiscal year 1994: $14,700,000,000.\n       (B) The amount of the surplus is as follows:\n       Fiscal year 1995: $20,500,000,000.\n       (5) The appropriate levels of the public debt are as \n     follows:\n       Fiscal year 1991: $3,369,600,000,000;\n       Fiscal year 1992: $3,540,900,000,000;\n       Fiscal year 1993: $3,676,700,000,000;\n       Fiscal year 1994: $3,766,900,000,000;\n       Fiscal year 1995: $3,827,600,000,000.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The record I read--and everybody should fall down dead \nfrom shock--``The amount of surplus is as follows: Fiscal year 1995, \n$20.5 billion.'' That was at the end of September, a month before last. \nWe are supposed to have a $20.5 billion surplus.

The unrealistic cuts are completely unrealistic. We cut \nMedicare and Medicaid under President Reagan. We cut Medicare and \nMedicaid under President Bush. We cut $57 billion under President \nClinton from Medicare. At that time when we could not get a single \nRepublican vote in either the House or Senate, we cut Medicare.\n  Now, after all of those cuts, Republicans are arguing to reduce \nMedicare by another $270 billion just to give everyone a tax cut and \nreap the political benefit in next year's elections?\n  It is a disgrace. They ought to be ashamed of themselves. You cannot \ngenerate that amount of savings. It will not happen. Nor will you save \nthe over $80 billion banked on from welfare reform. You cannot set up a \njobs program, a training program, a day care center program and \neverything else to put those on welfare to work without spending more \nmoney. Ask your Governor, because I can assure you, you will be hearing \nfrom him or her in the coming months. It is totally unrealistic.\n  As a final trick, the GOP plan borrows $636 billion from Social \nSecurity over the next 7 years in order to obscure the size of the \ndeficit and say the job is done.\n  Added to the over $484 billion that we already owe Social Security, \nwe will owe the Social Security trust fund $1 trillion in the year \n2002. It is sordid \n\n[[Page S 16962]]\ngamesmanship, Mr. President. Sordid gamesmanship.\n  With this one instruction, Mr. President, we can hopefully sober them \nup. Maybe the media that is supposed to keep us honest can help out a \nbit. I think it was Jefferson who said, if it is between the free \nGovernment and the free press, I choose the latter.\n  Why? You can get a free Government, but you will not hold it along \nunless you have free media. I hope that still holds true for the press \nin Washington, DC. This media crowd is fast asleep. There one exception \nthat I have found in a recent USA Today article entitled ``The Balanced \nBudget Myth,''.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the USA Today, Nov. 6, 1995]\n\n                        The Balanced-Budget Myth\n\n       Each day, the debate over balancing the budget produces \n     another dire warning. The cuts are too deep! say the \n     Democrats. Taxes must fall! say the Republicans.\n       But after they compromise and begin arguing over who won a \n     few weeks from now, one truth will remain: Both sides will be \n     lying, because neither is talking about a truly balanced \n     budget at all.\n       The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office underscored \n     that point recently. It pointed out that come 2002, when the \n     budget will be ``balanced'' under Republican plans, the \n     government will still be borrowing more than $100 billion a \n     year. This is done by writing IOUs from the Treasury to \n     Social Security and other trust funds that Congress declares \n     ``off-budget.''\n       The bill for this little game won't come due in the \n     political life of President Clinton or much of today's \n     Congress. But the public will pay it soon enough.\n       To understand, look, ahead to 2005. That's just 10 years \n     away, about the time it takes for an 11-year-old child to go \n     from grade school through college.\n       That year a critical balance tips. Increased costs for \n     Social Security will begin to deplete Congress' cushion. \n     Because the Social Security trust fund is a fiction filled \n     with nothing but government promises to pay, Congress will \n     gradually lose its fudge factor.\n       By 2013, when the trust fund peaks, taxpayers will feel a \n     hard bite. They'll have to start doing what the trust fund \n     was supposed to do--pay for the retirement of 75 million baby \n     boomers. The budget will plummet into a sea of red ink, with \n     $760 billion a year deficits by 2030. By then the government \n     will have to double the current 12.4% employer-employee \n     payroll tax to cover Social Security obligations.\n       That's unaffordable. Yet, neither President Clinton nor \n     leaders of either party in Congress acknowledge reform is \n     needed to avert economic catastrophe. To do so would require \n     Republicans to get off their tax-cut bandwagon and democrats \n     to accept deeper spending cuts. Both prefer the myths that a \n     budget borrowing from Social Security is balanced and a trust \n     fund filled with IOUs to be paid by today's 11-year-olds has \n     value.\n       Those are frauds only fundamental reform can fix.\n       The leaders of Clinton's commission on entitlements--Sen. \n     Robert Kerrey, D-Neb., and former Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.--\n     last year recommended raising the retirement age to 70 and \n     converting a portion of the current payroll tax into a \n     mandated personal retirement account. The Concord Coalition, \n     a deficit watchdog, has called for cutting benefits to upper-\n     income retirees. Other proposals include taxing all income \n     for Social Security and subjecting all benefits to normal \n     income taxation.\n       Which measures are best? Only a thorough debate of the \n     various measures can decide. But first political leaders must \n     give up their convenient budget myths and face the fact--a \n     Social Security train wreck is coming, and sooner than they \n     think.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. ``Both sides will be lying,'' it says. ``After the \ncompromise,'' and again arguing over who won a few weeks from now, \n``one truth will remain. Both sides will be lying because neither is \ntalking about a truly balanced budget.''\n  Once again, Mr. President, we have lied to the American people. In \nthis context, I just hope the media will wake up and start reporting \nit. The real deficit had to be reported by Chairman Kasich in the \nconference report. He reported $108 billion deficit.\n  June O'Neill, in a letter on October 20--and I ask unanimous consent \nto have the letter printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Congressional Budget Office,\n\n\n                                                U.S. Congress,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: Pursuant to Section 205(a) of the budget \n     resolution for fiscal year 1996 (H. Con. Res. 67), the \n     Congressional Budget Office provided the Chairman of the \n     Senate Budget Committee on October 18 with a projection of \n     the budget deficits or surpluses that would result from \n     enactment of the reconciliation legislation submitted to the \n     Budget Committee. As specified in section 205(a), CBO \n     provided projections (using the economic and technical \n     assumptions underlying the budget resolution and assuming the \n     level of discretionary spending specified in that resolution) \n     of the deficit or surplus of the total budget--that is, the \n     deficit or surplus resulting from all budgetary transactions \n     of the federal government, including Social Security and \n     Postal Service spending and receipts that are designated as \n     off-budget transactions. As stated in the letter to Chairman \n     Dominici, CBO projected that there will be a total-budget \n     surplus of $10 billion in 2002. Excluding an estimated off-\n     budget surplus of $115 billion in 2002 from the calculation, \n     CBO would project an on-budget deficit of $105 billion in \n     2002. (The letter you received yesterday incorrectly stated \n     these two figures.)\n       If you wish further details of this projection, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The staff contact is Jim Horney, who \n     can be reached at 226-2880.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Director of the CBO, estimates a projected budget \ndeficit of $105 billion in 2002.\n  We had to write and insist that she follow section 13301 of the \nBudget Act. Two days before, she had said ``Why, heavens above, we have \na $10 billion surplus.'' Two days later, obeying the law, she found \n$105 billion deficit.\n  No wonder in the New York Times Adam Clymer wrote the article here \nabout 10 days ago that 81 percent of the American people do not believe \nthe budget will be balanced. God bless them for their common sense.\n  I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hatch). Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I believe under the previous order I have \n20 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has 20 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to commend my colleague from South \nCarolina, who has been toiling in these vineyards with the goal of \nachieving a balanced budget for many years and has given us the \nbackground, the historical context in which a very serious event \noccurred on October 27. Let me recall for the Senate what happened that \nnight.\n  You may remember we had been in session for many hours that day. That \nwas the day in which we cast some 40 individual votes. We had been \nwaiting to receive the final amendment that would encapsulate a number \nof revisions to the Finance Committee's section of the reconciliation \nbill. After having requested for the better part of 36 hours the \nlegislative language of those revisions and the impact which they would \nhave, finally, at approximately 6:25 in the evening, we received \nversion 1 and, at 9:45, received version 2 of what came to be known as \nthe Roth amendment.\n  So, just prior to the Senate's final vote on the reconciliation \nlegislation, Senator Roth submitted an amendment which adds the \nfollowing components. It modified certain Medicare provisions, it \nchanged nursing home standards, and, the most significant provision \nfrom an economic standpoint, it reallocated the Medicaid funding \nformula.\n  Those modifications had a total cost of approximately $13 billion. \nThe motion which I have offered goes to the budget offset, which was \noffered in the amendment of Senator Roth, as the basis of paying for \nthe modifications in his amendment.\n  The amendment of Senator Roth directed that all outlay programs \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee use a cost-of-living \nadjustment rate of 2.6 percent rather than the 3.1 percent cost of \nliving, which had been estimated several months earlier in the budget \nresolution.\n  Let me quote the language of the amendment by Senator Roth as it \nrelates to the methods of paying for the additional spending in his \namendment.\n  ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law''--I say to my \ncolleague, Senator Hollings:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the case of \n     any program within the jurisdiction of the Committee on \n     Finance of the U.S. Senate which is adjusted for any increase \n     in the Consumer Price Index for all urban wage earners and \n     clerical workers \n\n[[Page S 16963]]\n     [CPI-W] for the United States city average for all items, any such \n     adjustment which takes effect during the fiscal year 1996 \n     shall be equal to 2.6 percent.\n\n  That amendment raised several questions. One of those questions is \njust exactly what programs is this provision intended to affect. \nApplication of the 2.6 percent rate would impact a number of outlay \nprograms, including railroad retirement benefits and supplemental \nSocial Security income.\n  But, by far, the lion's share of the impact would be on one program. \nMr. President, you guessed it, that program is Social Security. \nApproximately $12 of every $13 affected by this amendment, or $12 \nbillion of the $13 billion in savings, comes from one program: Social \nSecurity.\n  Some have stated this is not a raid on the Social Security trust \nfund; instead, it merely recognizes the economic reality that the cost-\nof-living adjustment will be 2.6 percent rather than the 3.1 percent \nupon which the budget was predicated when we passed the original budget \nresolution last spring. As a result of this lower actual cost of \nliving, the Federal Government will pay out less in numerous outlay \nprograms, including Social Security.\n\n  At first that seems to be a plausible argument. But like so many \nthings, the devil is in the details. And here is what the devil says. \nThe devil says that there is no real money being saved by legislating \nat this lower rate. That is why the Congressional Budget Office stated \nthat the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and \nBudget do not score savings for a cost of living that would have \nhappened anyway under current law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately after my \nremarks, a memorandum from Mr. Paul Van de Water, Assistant Director of \nthe Congressional Budget Office in the Budget Analysis Division, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. What Mr. Van de Water said is that the policy of the \nCongressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget is \nnot to score savings when the law would have incorporated those savings \nin any event.\n  The reason the Congressional Budget Office historically does not \nscore an updated cost-of-living assumption alone, out of the context of \nall of the other economic factors which influence the ultimate Federal \ndeficit or surplus--the size of the deficit, the size of the surplus--\nis that to do so would create a very dangerous temptation.\n  What would that temptation be? The temptation would be for a Member \nof Congress to look at all the factors such as are listed on this chart \nthat go into arriving at an overall assessment of the Federal \nGovernment's fiscal condition. Suppose, for instance, if you focused on \nthe issue of inflation and because of the change in inflation rates \nbetween the time that the original budget resolution was passed until \nthe time that the debate was taking place--in this case, on the 27th of \nOctober--if the movement of inflation had been such that it had \nincreased revenues or had suppressed outlays, then we might say, let us \nchange the inflation adjustment factor and take the benefit that would \ngive us in terms of additional expenditures because of higher revenues \nor additional moneys being available because of we have repressed our \nexpenditures.\n  But what if the other had occurred? Suppose, in fact, inflation had \nincreased and therefore had caused us to have to spend more money on \nthings like the national debt and had reduced our revenues because \nhigher inflation had resulted in less economic activity? Which Senator \nwould come forward then to offer an amendment to say, ``Let us come up \nwith some additional spending cuts, let us find a source of taxation in \norder to counterbalance what has happened in the area of inflation''?\n  The fact is, there would be very, very few who would do so. So, \ninstead, by being able to pick and choose which factors happen to \nbenefit the position that one wished to advocate, you would do exactly \nas the Senator from South Carolina has suggested we have been doing for \nthe better part of the last two decades, and that is creating the \nsmoke, looking into the fraudulent mirror that gives us the false sense \nwe are making progress in reducing the deficit but actually contributes \nto higher and higher deficits, higher and higher national debt.\n  So, how does the Congressional Budget Office deal with this issue? \nThe Congressional Budget Office says they will only revise the baseline \nif they take into account all factors, not just cherry picking those \nthat happen to have a beneficial effect. Let me quote, again, from the \nletter from Mr. Van de Water.\n\n       At the request of the budget committees, CBO [the \n     Congressional Budget Office] has from time to time, updated \n     the baseline to reflect recent economic and technical \n     developments. In such circumstances, however, we insist on \n     incorporating all relevant new information, not just selected \n     items such as COLA's [cost-of-living adjustments].\n\n  Did the Roth amendment take into account all economic changes and \ntechnical developments during the 8 months since the economic baseline \nhad been established? You see all the factors that primarily influenced \nthat economic baseline.\n  Does the amendment take into account the fact that interest rates \nhave actually been higher than assumed in the baseline, which results \nin higher outlays? No.\n  Does the amendment take into account the fact that the Federal \nGovernment be required to make an additional $20 billion in payments \nresulting from adverse court decisions in the banking area? No.\n  No, the Roth amendment only takes into account a portion of the \ninflation factor--namely, cost of living. Furthermore, the amendment \nonly takes into account the cost of living as it relates to outlays \nrather than both outlays and revenues. And, moreover, it relates only \nto certain outlays, those within the Finance Committee's jurisdiction.\n  Mr. President, this is the most compelling detail in the devil's \nbrew. If we had followed the Congressional Budget Office precedent and \ntaken into account all factors, we would not have had a $13 billion \nsavings to use to finance these new spending items in the Roth \namendment. No. In fact, we would not have had any savings at all. The \neconomic reality is that the baseline assumptions were too optimistic.\n  Let me quote again from Mr. Van de Water's memo.\n\n       In this instance, if we were to include all of the \n     information in our August baseline, plus the actual 1996 cost \n     of living, our estimate of the year 2002 deficit would have \n     been higher, not lower.\n\n  It would have been a higher deficit, Mr. President, not a lower \ndeficit.\n  An economic update would show a higher deficit, and we count the \nupdate as saving money. I call it a raid on the Federal accounts. And \nsince the Roth legislative language calls for the money to come from \n$12 out of every $13 from the Social Security payments, Mr. Senator \nfrom South Carolina, I call it a raid on the Social Security trust \nfund.\n  Some may argue that this macroanalysis proves too much and that the \nRoth amendment deals only with Finance Committee programs. Let us look \nnarrowly and see if there has been a raid, looking only at Finance \nCommittee programs.\n  The Roth amendment takes into account only outlays impacted by a \nlower 2.6 cost of living. The Social Security fund will spend fewer \ndollars to meet its obligations to the Social Security beneficiaries at \na 2.6 cost-of-living adjustment. It would have had a 3.1-percent cost-\nof-living adjustment. True, but there are other ramifications to that \nlower cost of living. For example, many workers' salaries are tied to \nthe same consumer price index that is the basis of our cost of living. \nIf those salaries rise by only 2.6 percent rather than 3.1 percent, \nwhat happens to the payroll taxes withheld from their checks? They will \nbe lower than the economic baseline projected, and, as a result, less \nmoney will flow into the Social Security trust fund.\n  Does the Roth amendment take these lower revenues into account? Mr. \nPresident, sadly, no. It only takes credit for lower outlays and does \nnot recognize the effect of lower receipts into the Social Security \ntrust fund.\n  Just what would be the impact of an updated economic assumption on \nthe Social Security trust fund? Outlays are reduced by $18 billion--$12 \nbillion by the COLA reduction and $6 billion from \n\n[[Page S 16964]]\nother changes. But, Mr. President, revenues are down by $62 billion as \na result of economic changes such as the lower amount of payroll taxes \ncoming into the Social Security trust fund.\n  Thus, the net effect to the Social Security trust fund of the $18 \nbillion of lower outlays but the $62 billion in lower revenue to the \nSocial Security trust fund is a decrease of $44 billion in the status \nof the Social Security trust fund over the 7 years from that which had \noriginally been estimated under the budget resolution.\n  So, Mr. President, we are diverting $12 billion from the Social \nSecurity trust fund in order to finance additional spending while the \ntrust fund will actually have $44 billion less than originally \nprojected. That, Mr. President, is a raid on the Social Security trust \nfund.\n  I find it quite ironic that Congress would be so concerned about the \nSocial Security trust fund that we would attach a rider to the debt \nceiling extension legislation which would preclude the Secretary of the \nTreasury from using Social Security and other trust funds as a form of \ncash management during this period in which we are about to reach our \nlegal spending level.\n  Why would we be so concerned that we would put the ability of the \nFederal Government to meet its financial obligations at risk but then \nwe would so freely raid the very same trust fund to pay for additional \nspending, additional spending unrelated to Social Security obligations? \nWe cannot have it both ways.\n  We cannot say, on the one hand, that we want to be the great \ndefenders of the Social Security trust fund, but, on the other hand, \nraid the Social Security trust fund. We cannot say, on the one hand, \nthat these COLA modifications merely reflect reality and that it would \nhave happened anyway, and then it is not real savings but just funny \nmoney and cannot be used to offset real spending. If it is a real cut, \non the other hand, then it constitutes a diversion of funds and a raid \non the Social Security trust fund. You cannot have it both ways, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Either conclusion--either that it is phony money to support real \nspending or that it is a raid on the Social Security trust fund, real \nmoney to support real spending--either one of those conclusions \njustifies jettisoning the Roth amendment as the basis of paying for an \nadditional $12 billion in new spending unrelated to Social Security \nobligations.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to adopt the motion offered by the \nSenator from South Carolina and myself to instruct the conferees not to \ninclude the $12 billion in Social Security cuts contained in the Roth \nFinance Committee amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     To: Sue Nelson.\n     From: Paul Van de Water, Assistant Director of CBO in the \n         Budget Analysis Division.\n     Subject: Taking account of the actual COLA.\n       The budget resolution baseline assumes a 3.1-percent cost-\n     of-living adjustment for Social Security and other federal \n     programs in January 1996. The actual COLA will be 2.6 \n     percent. Two clear precedents apply in this situation.\n       CBO and OMB do not score savings for legislating a COLA \n     that would happen anyway under current law. This rule was \n     applied to veterans compensation in 1991 and to Food Stamps \n     in 1992.\n       At the request of the Budget Committees, CBO has from time \n     to time updated the baseline to reflect recent economic and \n     technical developments. In such circumstances, however, we \n     insist on incorporating all relevant new information, not \n     just selected items, such as COLAs. In this instance, if we \n     were to include all the information in our August baseline \n     plus the actual 1996 COLA, our estimate of the 2002 deficit \n     using the discretionary spending amounts specified in the \n     budget resolution would be higher, not lower.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, could the President inform us as to how \nmuch time remains on this motion to instruct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has 2 minutes and 12 \nseconds, and the Senator from Michigan has 20 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We will reserve our time, Mr. President.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum and seek \nunanimous consent that the time not be charged to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield at this time such time as he may \nneed to the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Michigan for \nyielding.\n  I have listened with a tremendous amount of interest to the debate \nover this motion to instruct conferees. I guess the thing that \nfrustrates me most in the midst of all of this, in the midst of a \nPresidential veto this morning, is that by the unwillingness of this \nadministration to act we are clearly putting a variety of trust funds \nin jeopardy at this moment that budget reconciliation has in every way \nsought to assure.\n  During our debate on the balanced budget amendment, we heard the \nother side literally go on for days that the reason we were balancing \nthe budget was a variety of things, and that we were going to do it on \nthe back of the Social Security trust funds. It was the only way \nRepublicans could figure out a way to balance the budget. I think what \nis their greatest frustration today is that we have offered a truly \nlegitimate balanced budget and the trust funds are secure, and in fact \nthe trust funds are safe.\n  When the Senator from Florida suggests in his motion not to include \nthe $12 billion in Social Security cuts that are included as an offset \nin relation to CPI adjustment, I find it interesting that he would \nphrase it that way when in fact but just a few days ago he voted for a \nSimon-Conrad budget that did the same thing. So we have really reduced \nthe debate in this Chamber to politics, plain and simple raw politics: \nDo you want to maintain the stability programs like Social Security and \nbalance the budget in doing so, or do you really want to progress down \nthe same old path of spend and spend and promise well more than this \nGovernment could possibly provide or the taxpayers would be willing to \npay for.\n  That is what we have reduced ourselves to in the final hours of a \ncritical debate on a very conclusive process that honors the commitment \nthat a variety of us made to the American people some months ago, that \nwe would work in every way for a balanced budget by downsizing all of \nthe areas of Government, except Social Security would remain sound and \nstable and off the table.\n  We have done all of those things, but because that is what the \nAmerican people want and because there are many who are very fearful \nthat they lose control of the phenomenal power they have exercised for \ndecades in the ability to promise and spend and promise and spend and \nliterally make our citizenry the victims of a government instead of the \nbeneficiaries of a government, we have finally arrived at this debate.\n  What we are offering is very straightforward in protecting these \nsystems and assuring their stability out into the future. Everyone \nknows that the only real saving grace of Social Security or any of \nthese kinds of programs that extend benefits to citizens in our society \neither based on a commitment long term in an actuarial sense like \nSocial Security or even that of qualifying under certain criteria for \nneed, the only way you can offer those is if you have a balanced \nbudget. The only way you can guarantee 30 years out that the \nbeneficiaries of Social Security are going to get their Social Security \nchecks is if there is no massive debt in this country that is pulling \n$400 billion or $500 billion a year out of general fund moneys to pay \ninterest on debt. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy. We know that. The \nAmerican people know it. That is why for the last many months we have \nstruggled on key and important budget issues from both sides of the \naisle trying to strike the compromise and split the difference and \n\n[[Page S 16965]]\nyet continually march ourselves toward a balanced budget by the year \n2002.\n  So when I look at instructions like this, these are like reverter \nclauses--revert to the old ways, revert backward, revert to deficit \nspending, revert to trust fund instability, revert to debt, revert to \nborrowing back money from future generations and not being willing to \npay for it. But what the American people said is, do not revert at all. \nThey instructed us last November. We had our instructions as conferees \nin a massive referendum across this country that was one of the most \npolitically realigning referendums in the history of our country. They \nsaid to us as conferees: Balance the budget, stabilize the programs, \nreduce the unnecessary spending, reprioritize the programs of \nGovernment. If it is 30 years old, it is not working, and its intent \nhas never been met, review it and get rid of it, but honor Social \nSecurity and in so doing make sure it is strong. That is exactly what \nwe have done in all instances here.\n  Every Senator on this floor serves as a member of the board of \ndirectors of Social Security. We have the absolute responsibility by \nour pledge, and that is to uphold the Constitution, and our commitment \nto the American citizens that we will honor programs of this nature by \nproviding for their stability, and we must manage them accordingly.\n  For this Senate to vote to follow the instructions of this motion to \nthe conferees would not be to strengthen or stabilize, it would be to \nperpetuate the past. And the past, by all estimation, is wrong and has \nbrought about the kind of instability, the kind of doubt in the minds \nof the American people that beg for change. And we have offered that in \nthe budget reconciliation process that we are currently under that will \nspell not only significant change, but tremendous stability.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Michigan for yielding. I \nyield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, can I inquire as to how much time we have \nremaining at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 12 minutes 41 \nseconds. The Senator from Florida has 2 minutes 12 seconds.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may need \njust to enter a few additional comments into the Record that I would \nlike to make after the fine address by the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Florida, in explaining his motion, at \nthe conclusion of his remarks, commented on the issues that pertain to \nthe short-term debt bill which we voted on here last Thursday night and \nexpressed puzzlement that in that short-term debt bill the Republican \nMembers here who supported it included a provision that would limit the \nability of the President to raid those Social Security trust funds that \nare in fact the subject of his motion today. He said he is puzzled \nbecause of the Roth amendment, which his motion specifically addresses, \nto change the number that is employed for calculation of Consumer Price \nIndex changes.\n  I guess I have sort of the reverse puzzlement. I am puzzled that \npeople who, on the one hand, argue that they are concerned about the \nSocial Security and other trust funds' integrity were willing to vote \nagainst the short-term debt limit issue, a bill that we passed last \nThursday night, because if this is the issue that they hold as so vital \nand important, I would think they would have joined us in calling for \nthose various trust funds to be off limits and to prevent the President \nfrom having the ability to raid those trust funds.\n  During the debate on the debt limit, the Democrats supported an \namendment offered, I believe, by the Senator from New York, which would \nhave given the administration the authority to raid Federal workers' \nretirement trust funds, the elderly's trust funds, Social Security \nbenefits, and the pensions of our country's veterans. The amendment \nwould have essentially stricken all language pertaining to all of those \ntrust funds from the short-term debt bill.\n  Now, I understand that on final passage people might have found some \nof the provisions, in addition to those trust fund provisions, \nobjectionable. But I was amazed that no effort was made at the time of \nconsideration of the Moynihan amendment to limit that amendment to the \nareas that did not pertain to these trust funds, but rather to include \nthem.\n  In short, the Democrats had the opportunity to make the strong \nstatement, which this motion to instruct suggests they wish to make, \nregarding the integrity of these trust funds by either voting against \nthat Moynihan amendment, as we did on our side, or by offering a \nsmaller version of the Moynihan amendment that would have only focused \non those aspects of the short-term debt bill that were unrelated to the \ntrust funds. And yet that did not happen.\n  The President, of course, has said he needs the extension of the debt \nlimit. He has now vetoed that extension. The administration now says \nthat they can raid the $1.3 trillion in pension funds of Federal \nworkers and the Social Security trust fund in order to keep the \nGovernment from defaulting. This does not seem to me, Mr. President, \nconsistent with the concerns that are certainly embodied in this motion \nand that the Senator from Florida has spoken about many times here to \nus, the concern that relates to the integrity of these trust funds.\n  And I find that far more puzzling--far more puzzling--than the issues \nthat were raised by the Senator from Florida with regard to the \nRepublican position regarding the Moynihan amendment. One of the \nreasons this Senator voted against the Moynihan amendment was because \nit would have provided that kind of basically unlimited credit card \noption to the President and to his economic advisers to tap into those \ntrust funds in order to address these issues pertaining to the payment \nof U.S. obligations.\n\n  I would like to now turn briefly to address some of the issues that \nwere raised by the Senator from South Carolina with reference to the \nvarious ways by which the budget deficit is calculated. The fact is \nthat ever since the Budget Act of 1974, every budget has calculated the \nbudget on a unified basis. Now, I am not at great odds with the Senator \nfrom South Carolina in the concerns that have been expressed that we \nneed to go further, that we are not going far enough in terms of \nreducing the growth of Federal spending. On those points I am in \nagreement. In fact, I was sort of, I have to say, surprised and pleased \nto hear his concerns as expressed today because we have had numerous \nopportunities before the Senate over the last few months to vote to \ntighten the belt further, and all too infrequently have we heard \nsupport for those gestures on the other side of the aisle.\n  But the fact is, Mr. President, both the Office of Management and \nBudget and the Congressional Budget Office use the unified budget to \ncalculate the deficit. When the Democrats were in charge here in \nCongress, they calculated the deficit including the Social Security \ntrust funds. Both budgets submitted by President Clinton this year \nincluded the Social Security surplus in their calculations. And, \nindeed, some of the changes in the level of the deficit that have been \npointed to, with pride, by the President are, in fact, changes that \nwere in large part obtained because of these Social Security trust fund \nsurpluses that the President uses in his calculations.\n  In short, Mr. President, I guess I would be more sympathetic to the \ncase that is being made if the same fervor had been used here on the \nfloor to criticize the President's budget when it came down here as is \nnow being employed to criticize our budget. The fact is that there \nseems to be a certain priority here. When the Republicans come forth \nusing the same unified budget that has been used every year since 1974, \nsuddenly the issue of using the trust funds is of great concern. When \nthe President comes forward using those same surpluses, the issue seems \nto not be on the front burner. I guess I have to draw a conclusion from \nthat discrepancy that this is more of a partisan attack than it is one \nof a substantive sort.\n  Let me talk about the broader question that was raised by the Senator \nfrom South Carolina, at least as it pertains to the deficits, because \nhe makes the point that in the 7-year period we are talking about, at \nthe end of that period of time, according to the unified budget, we \nwill have eliminated the \n\n[[Page S 16966]]\nFederal deficit, but because of the Social Security surplus' effects, \nthere will still be that deficit to contend with.\n  I have good news for the Senator from South Carolina. The good news \nis that not only is the Republican budget which we have been voting on \nhere in recent months the only budget that achieves balance using the \nSocial Security trust funds in the year 2002 according to CBO scoring, \nbut the Republicans are also the only people here who have a budget \nthat achieves balance without using the Social Security trust funds. \nAnd that will be achieved in the year 2005.\n  Indeed, Mr. President, according to the Senate Budget Committee, the \nsurplus from our balanced budget plan will exceed the surplus in the \nSocial Security trust fund in the year 2005. In other words, we are not \nonly on the way to achieving balance in the year 2002 under the unified \nbudget, but the plan which we have been fighting for here in the \nSenate, the plan that is responsive to citizens across this country who \nhave said it is time to put the Federal fiscal house in order will \nachieve balance even if you do not use a unified budget by the year \n2005.\n  In other words, it continues the job that we were sent here to do, to \nbring about the kind of fiscal integrity in Washington that every \nfamily in my State of Michigan from Sanilac County in the thumb all the \nway over to St. Joseph, MI, and Berrien County in southwest Michigan \nhas to do in their own home, that is, to bring about balance.\n  We will achieve that in the year 2005 under anybody's calculus. That \nis what is critical, because nobody else, Mr. President, even comes \nclose to achieving this balance. According to the CBO, the President's \nso-called balanced budget would still have a $200 billion deficit in \nthe year 2002.\n  And that $200 billion or so deficit will continue as far as the eye \ncan see.\n  So, Mr. President, I guess what I will just say in closing, one last \npoint just to follow up on the concerns that have been expressed \nrelative to the CPI, is that there was another balanced budget proposal \nbrought before the Senate which Senator Craig alluded to. It was \nbrought by Senators Simon and Conrad during our reconciliation debate. \nIt was brought and supported, I believe, exclusively by folks on the \nother side of the political aisle.\n  In that budget, they brought about balance by very substantially \ntapping into the Social Security trust funds by making a very \nsubstantial adjustment in the CPI, not an adjustment based on this \nyear's actual inflation numbers, as was the case with the Roth \namendment, but by simply on an across-the-board basis, adjusting at an \nadequate level to bring about a balanced budget. In short, they used \nthe Social Security changes, a reduction, in fact, Mr. President, of \nsome $41.1 billion in Social Security payments, to bring their budget \ninto balance.\n  In total, they reduced Federal outlays from the various trust funds, \nand so on, including Social Security, by over $73 billion over 7 years, \nall of it because of changes in the Consumer Price Index in order to \nmake their budget stand the challenge of reaching balance.\n  Mr. President, I will say, $73 billion is considerably more than $13 \nbillion, and it was not achieved based on an actual number, but rather \non a number that was needed to reach balance. So if there is a plan \nbefore the Senate that should be critically analyzed and, I believe, \nscrutinized very closely for having addressed the Social Security trust \nfund numbers improperly by making changes in the CPI that were very \nsubstantial, it was that amendment offered on the other side.\n  I suggest if there are concerns about the CPI that they should be \ndirected at those who proposed that approach, not the approach that was \nused on our side where the real inflation number was employed.\n  In summary, Mr. President, the fact is that we came here to balance \nthe budget. The Republican plan will put us in balance in the year 2002 \nusing the unified-budget approach that has been used by Presidents and \nCongresses since the 1974 Budget Act. The Republican plan will put us \ninto balance, regardless of whether you use a unified budget, by the \nyear 2005. It is the only plan in town that will accomplish those \nobjectives. It is the only plan in town that will begin to bring down \nthe interest rates that people pay across this country for student \nloans, new cars, new homes and various other things they need for their \nfamilies. It is the only plan that will restore fiscal integrity to the \nGovernment of the United States, and that is why we feel so strongly \nthat it is the right plan for America.\n  I yield back whatever time remains.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, to close the motion to instruct, I want to \nsay how much I admire the Senator from Michigan. In the several \nopportunities I have had to discuss with him issues from foreign policy \nto issues of our national fiscal future, he always approaches the \nquestion with a learned background and with thoughtful analysis. I \nthink that is in the tradition of the U.S. Senate and, frankly, that is \nwhat the American people would like to have us do: To have a reasoned \ndialog. We may disagree, but at least we will be disagreeing on a set \nof facts that are reasonable and we will be expressing the basis of our \ndisagreement in a manner that the American people can understand and \nevaluate. I commend him for his contribution to the Senate level of \ndiscussion.\n  Mr. President, the debate on the motion to instruct is not the debate \non whether you are for or against the balanced budget amendment or \nwhether you are for or against the goal of a balanced budget at an \nearly date. I share those goals. I voted for the balanced budget \namendment. I voted for a provision in the balanced budget amendment \nthat would define what constitutes balance as not including the use of \nthe Social Security surpluses to that end, and I have voted for a plan, \nalong with over 75 percent of my Democratic colleagues, that would \nhave achieved that objective and would have done so before the year \n2005.\n\n  What I think is significant about the direction of this motion is \nthat it goes to an unusual use of the Social Security trust fund. It is \nnot like the kind of cash management uses of the trust fund that have \nbeen used under both Republican and Democratic Secretaries of Treasury \nin time of need where, in every instance, the Social Security trust \nfund has been fully reimbursed after the moment of crisis has passed. \nIt is not like efforts that have resulted in a reduction in the outlays \nof Social Security where the money stayed in the Social Security trust \nfund and, therefore, contributed to a larger surplus and greater long-\nterm solvency.\n  What is unusual about this Roth amendment is it first cuts Social \nSecurity outlays by $12 billion and then shifts them and uses those \noutlays to support different spending, spending unrelated to Social \nSecurity.\n  I will ask to have printed in the Record the statement of the \nchairman of the Budget Committee when he was asked if this is what, in \nfact, is intended, and his response was: ``I want to say that the \ndollar numbers being referred to''--that is the $12 billion being \nremoved from the Social Security trust fund--``are actual. That is all \nI want to say.''\n  That is the quotation from the chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that portion of the Congressional Record \nof October 27 be printed in the Record immediately after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I just ask this question in closing. Here \nis what the motion says. Who wishes to disagree with these \npropositions: That we will honor section 13301 of the Budget \nEnforcement Act of 1990 which states that thou shalt not commingle the \ntrust fund of Social Security with general Federal spending. Who \ndisagrees with that proposition that we should honor that commitment \nmade in 1990?\n  Who disagrees with the proposition that we should not include in any \nconference report any language that violates section 13301 of the \nBudget Enforcement Act? Who disagrees that we should not include any \nlanguage that violates that principle of sanctity of the Social \nSecurity trust fund? \n\n[[Page S 16967]]\n\n  And who disagrees with the proposition, therefore, that we should not \ninclude $12 billion in Social Security cuts that were included as an \noffset for on-budget spending in the Finance Committee amendment?\n  That is what we are being asked to vote on: To honor, to not include \nand, therefore, to not violate our trust.\n  This is a motion that ought to be adopted unanimously by voice vote. \nI cannot believe that Members of the Senate are going to vote against a \nmotion that effectively says we will dishonor our commitment to \nmaintain the integrity of the Social Security trust fund, that we will \ninclude language that is contrary to the spirit and intent and very \nlanguage that we committed ourselves to in 1990 and, therefore, that we \nshould consummate that disavowal by raiding the Social Security trust \nfund of $12 billion to support spending unrelated to Social Security \nobligations.\n  Those are the questions: To honor, to violate, to include, to \nmaintain our sense of honor and responsibility to the Social Security \ntrust fund.\n  I urge, Mr. President, my colleagues' adoption of this motion to \ninstruct our conferees and that our conferees follow our admonition as \nthey proceed in the conference committee on the reconciliation \nlegislation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Mr. Graham. Mr. President, I am directing my attention to \n     section 7482 of the legislation, which begins on page 45 and \n     states:\n       ``Cost-of-Living Adjustments During Fiscal Year 1996.\n       ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the case \n     of any program within the jurisdiction of the Committee on \n     Finance of the United States Senate which is adjusted for any \n     increase in the consumer price index for all urban wage \n     earners and clerical workers (CPI-W) for the United States \n     city average of all items, any such adjustment which takes \n     effect during fiscal year 1996 shall be equal to 2.6 \n     percent''\n       It is to that section, Mr. President, that I direct the \n     point of order. I raise the point of order under section \n     310(d) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 against the \n     pending amendment because it counts $12 billion in cuts to \n     Social Security which is off budget to offset spending in the \n     amendment.\n       The Presiding Officer. Does the Senator from New Mexico \n     wish to be heard on this point of order?\n       Mr. Domenici. I want to say the dollar numbers being \n     referred to are actual. That is all I want to say.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Michigan has \n34 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, one more motion to \ninstruct the conferees is in order.\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Mr. President, over the weekend, both in reading various \nnewspaper accounts and watching the television accounts of the so-\ncalled standoff between the Congress and the President over the \nquestion of the continuing resolution, funds to keep the Government \nmoving forward, the debt limit, and the budget battle that is currently \nunderway in this Congress, I was particularly taken by an article in \nSaturday's Washington Post written by Ann Devroy titled, ``For Clinton, \nthe Battle Is To Stand Firm.''\n  What was interesting is that apparently the President's advisers and \npollsters have determined that, as Ann Devroy says, ``President \nClinton's reputation for vacillation has made his political need to \ndisplay strength of character now a silent partner in the \nnonnegotiation drama'' that is currently taking place here in \nWashington.\n  It goes on to say that the President's closest adviser is exulting \nthat polling has shown that the President is beginning to make progress \non what he stands for.\n  The article goes on to say that various sources that Ann Devroy has \ntalked to say--and she quotes--``We were told that what people in their \nfocus groups cite as what they disliked most about Clinton is he is \nweak, vacillating, opportunist, flip-flops constantly.''\n  ``Pollsters of both parties have''--again, quoting from the article--\n``Pollsters of both parties have throughout the Clinton presidency \nidentified as a significant problem for the president the perception \nthat he has no core beliefs.''\n  So what we have seen here now in the past couple of weeks, \nparticularly over this past weekend, and, undoubtedly, we will see this \nweek, is an attempt by the President, on the advice of his counselors, \non the advice of his pollsters, and on the advice of those conducting \nhis focus groups, to shore up his character, to define something of \nwhat the President believes in and, therefore, ``Stand firm, do not \nnegotiate with the Congress to find a break to the impasse that \ncurrently exists between the executive branch and the congressional \nbranch.''\n  That is what is guiding the decisionmaking process in the White House \nand the President's statements.\n  So, all the President's protestations about the Congress trying to \nshut down the Government, denying opportunities \n\n[[Page S 16968]]\nfor Americans to work, holding America hostage, apparently are all part \nof a grand political design, grand political scheme to shore up, as the \narticle quotes, shore up the fact that the President is perceived by \nmost people in the focus groups as weak, vacillating, opportunist, and \nflip-flopping.\n  We wonder why the American public is so cynical about the political \nprocess. We wonder why so few people today show up at the polls to \nvote. We wonder why the elections across the country--just this past \nTuesday, in many cases, less than one-quarter of those eligible to vote \neven bothered to show up to vote, when they see this kind of political \ncynicism operating in Washington, DC.\n  At the same time, I could not help but notice in Sunday's paper a \nstatement that the House minority leader, Mr. Gephardt, said in a \nrecent speech that the ``GOP budget goes to the very fringes of \nradicalism.'' And, of course, we have heard the Vice President and \nothers in the President's Cabinet repeat that mantra now, that it is \nextremism that is driving the GOP agenda.\n  So we have had the whole spin all weekend, the focus groups, the \nCabinet members, the Vice President this morning on the news shows, and \nother Cabinet members on the news shows, all pushing the latest White \nHouse line. Unfortunately, what they push and the rhetoric that comes \nacross is totally separate from the facts.\n  This so-called radical, extremist Republican budget over the next 7 \nyears increases spending $2.6 trillion, increases in revenues to the \nGovernment of $3.3 trillion. Spending will grow between now and the \nyear 2002 under the Republican radical, extremist budget, spending will \ngrow from $1.514 trillion in this current year to $1.844 trillion in \n2002, a 22-percent increase. Medicare spending--which I am sure \neveryone has heard from the President and his spokespeople that is \ngoing to produce dramatic cuts, throw people on the street, throw the \nelderly out of their nursing homes, and so forth--Medicare spending \nwill increase in that 7-year period 61 percent, from $178 billion in \n1995 to $286 billion in 2002. Medicaid spending will grow at a 41-\npercent increase. Total welfare spending will increase 38 percent. Food \nstamp spending will increase 45 percent; supplemental Social Security \nincome 69 percent; earned income tax credit spending 22 percent; foster \ncare spending 86 percent. This is the radical, extremist Republican \nbudget.\n  If we look a little more specifically at Medicare, I think we can \nbegin to understand the length to which the President and members of \nhis party will go to radically alter the news that is being presented \nto the American people, to put their political spin on something that \nis totally opposed by the facts of the situation.\n\n  Republicans are addressing the Medicare spending issue because the \nPresident's own trustees' report in April 1995 stated the following:\n\n       The Medicare program is clearly unsustainable in its \n     present form. . . . We strongly recommend that the crisis \n     presented by the financial condition of the Medicare trust \n     funds be urgently addressed on a comprehensive basis, \n     including a review of the program's financing methods, \n     benefit provisions, and delivery mechanisms.\n\n  That is the Medicare trustees' report of April 1995.\n  Incidentally, three of those trustees are members of the President's \nown Cabinet. Our party has stepped forward in a responsible way to \naddress this alarming report. It has done so by recognizing that unless \nwe slow the growth of Medicare from its current three-plus times the \nrate of inflation, to around two times the rate of inflation, we will \nnot successfully even begin to address the concern raised by the \ntrustees' report.\n  We are not the only ones who think that something needs to be done. \nOn October 5, 1993, the following statement was issued:\n\n       Today Medicaid and Medicare are going up at three times the \n     rate of inflation. We propose to let it go up at two times \n     the rate of inflation. That is not a Medicare or a Medicaid \n     cut. So when you hear all this business about cuts, let me \n     caution you that that is not what is going on.\n\n  What Republican said that? because that is exactly what Republicans \nhave attempted to do. So when you hear all this business about cuts, \nthis person said, ``Let me caution you that is not what is happening. \nWhat is happening is that we are reducing the rate of growth from three \ntimes the rate of inflation to two times the rate of inflation.'' That \nstatement was made by the President of the United States, William \nJefferson Clinton, in October 1993. You would never know that today, \nbecause what is coming out of the White House is the exact opposite of \nthat statement.\n  We are also talking about the level of premium at 31.5 percent. That \nis what it is currently today. You see this country offers an \nextraordinarily generous benefit program for those 65 and older called \nMedicare. Part A of Medicare hospitalization is 100 percent covered. \nAnd part B, which provides for doctors' fees and other nonhospital \ncosts, is paid for to the extent of 69.5 percent by the taxpayer. We \nare asking the elderly for that part B coverage only to cover 31.5 \npercent. That is the current rate that we are asking them to pay, their \npart, their share of the program. And the GOP budget plan requires that \nthat stay at that level, does not increase it but asks that it stay at \nthat level. But what the President would like to do is revert it back \nto a level of 25 percent. We are saying, given this trustees' report, \nthis is not responsible. Can we just ask those currently under Medicare \nto maintain their same level of support? That is the so-called cut that \nthe White House and the President, or those who speak for him, are \ntalking about. And it is not a cut.\n  Ironically, in the year 2002, under the Republican plan, Medicare \nrecipients will pay a $90-a-month premium, if current increases in \nMedicare costs are as projected. Under the President's plan, they will \npay $82-a-month premium, an $8 difference. This is what is labeled as \nthrowing people out of nursing homes, on the street, without medical \ncare. These are the cuts, the so-called cuts, in Medicare.\n  When we debated the balanced budget amendment earlier this year, we \nwere told by member after member of the Democratic Party, on the other \nside of the aisle, that balancing the budget was an absolute \nimperative, and I want to quote some of them. I will not give their \nnames:\n  ``The budget is not going to be balanced in 2002 unless the \nresponsible people, that is those of us in the Congress, in 1995 start \nto focus on their share of the work.''\n  ``Words on a piece of paper cannot balance the budget, only \nlegislators like you and I can,'' said another Senator.\n  A third said: ``Let's go on the record, Democrats and Republicans \nalike, that we are serious about deficit reduction, we are serious \nabout balancing the budget, because I think that we all are.''\n  Another said: ``I believe a balanced budget is the correct policy \ndecision for this country.''\n  Another said: ``Let Senators get to work and show Americans we have \nthe courage this amendment presumes that we lack.''\n  Republicans had the courage. They came forward with a balanced budget \nplan enacted over a 7-year period of time, because a $4.9 trillion debt \nis irresponsible legislating. The rate of growth of our debt is \nstaggering. It imposes a burden on the American economy and on the \nfuture and future generations that is immoral. We have come forward \nwith a plan. Our friends and colleagues from across the aisle did not \nbring forward a plan, and what little attempt they made out of the \nWhite House was discounted by the very scoring agency that the \nPresident asked us to use.\n  So now here we are with a plan, a plan to deal with one of the most \nserious financial crises this country has ever faced. It is not a \nradical plan. It is not an extremist plan. It is a responsible plan. \nAnd for the first time in decades, in response to the call of the \nAmerican people in November 1994, we are beginning to rein in the out-\nof-control growth of Government. For the first time in decades, we will \nactually limit the rate of growth of Government.\n  Finally, the Congress, under the leadership of the Republicans, has \nproven that they can deliver on the promises made to the American \npeople to balance the budget. \n\n[[Page S 16969]]\n\n  Several weeks ago, Mr. President, I stood on this floor discussing \nand debating the reconciliation bill which we were about to pass, that \nbill that combines a number of efforts to reach our goals for putting \nin place the process of responsible spending and balancing the budget, \nand I said:\n\n       The reconciliation bill we are debating not only makes \n     sense, it makes history. For many of us, a balanced Federal \n     budget is a distant memory. For decades it has been an empty \n     political promise. All that remains is one final act of \n     courage and vision.\n\n  I went on to say:\n\n       That courage will be tested in the Congress by some \n     difficult choices, and that vision will be measured in the \n     President as he becomes either a partner or a partisan. If \n     either he or we are unequal to the task, the patience of the \n     public will be exhausted, and we will have squandered a \n     unique opportunity, and we will feed a dangerous \n     disillusionment with American politics.\n\n  That moment is here. That time for courage is here. The courage has \nbeen met by the Republican budget plan. Republicans stand today and \nsay: Mr. President, we have a plan. We have responded to the call--your \ncall, our colleagues' call--to be responsible and balance this budget.\n  But the vision called for and necessary on the part of the President \nhas not been met. There is no vision beyond November 1996. The vision \nis to reelect the President at whatever cost. The vision is to make \nsure that the President's campaign succeeds, regardless of what he has \nsaid in the past, regardless of his rhetoric.\n  Just a few short weeks ago, it appeared we were on a path to \nnegotiating a sensible plan to balance this budget with the President's \nsupport. If you looked at what the President said and what he called \nfor, it was very close to what the Republicans enacted. But then \nsomeone determined that the President needed to have his weak, \nvacillating character firmed up. And so the whole plan was thrown out \nthe window.\n  Now we are in an exercise of what I think is the utmost in political \ncynicism: Of making sure that the President's political posture is the \nkind of posture that will be necessary to inch him up in the polls so \nthat he can be reelected in November of 1996.\n  The courage of the Republicans in providing a plan which, yes, \nincludes tough choices but, yes, responds to a desperate need, a need \nto get control of a government that for years and years and years has \nbeen simply out of control, that plan is before us, but that plan is \nbefore us without the vision of the executive branch and particularly \nof the President.\n  So while the Democrats continue their efforts to tear this bill apart \npiece by piece, we have to remember that the centerpiece of what we are \nattempting to do is to balance this budget. In the future, this will be \nrecalled as our contribution to history. If we ignore this budget \ncrisis, this country and future generations will pay dearly.\n  I think the argument for a balanced budget comes down to something \nsimple. It is one of our highest moral traditions that parents \nsacrifice for the sake of their children, and it is the depth of \nselfishness to call on children to sacrifice for the sake of their \nparents.\n  If we continue on our current path, we will violate a trust between \ngenerations, and we will earn the contempt of the future. This is our \nmoment. This is our time. It will take courage and it will take vision. \nLet us trust that both the Congress and the President will have an \nample amount of each in order to accomplish what I think we all know \nneeds to be accomplished.\n  Mr. President, I thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/13/senate-section/article/S16967-4", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16969-S16970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CONFUSION ABOUT WHY WE CANNOT ACT TOGETHER\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate having the opportunity to \nlisten to the Senator from Indiana talk about what we are facing in the \nnext 7 hours for this country. It is a very important time.\n  I was in my home State, as well as several other States, over the \nlast weekend, and I talked to people. People are really confused. \nPeople see Congress and they see the President, and they are confused \nabout why we cannot act together.\n  I think it is very important that we clarify to the greatest extent \nthat we can some of these issues. Let us talk about the continuing \nresolution that has been passed by the House, will be finally passed \nagain in the Senate today, we hope, that in another month, a few weeks \nmaybe, until December 1, anyway, call on the President to sit down with \nus and work out a budget reconciliation bill that we would hopefully \ncome to terms with by December 1, so that we can, in fact, take the \nfirst-year step of the 7-year march to a balanced budget. That is what \nthe Senator from Indiana was talking about--whether we are going to \ntake that first-year step of the balanced budget. We must have the \nspending levels that we are asking for in the continuing resolution in \norder to make the 7-year balanced budget.\n\n  If we do what the President wants, which is to continue spending at \nthis year's levels, we will not meet the 7-year deadline.\n  This Congress has spoken. We have passed a budget resolution that \nsets the cap on spending that is allowed if we are going to balance the \nbudget. We would love to sit down with the President and talk about \npriorities, but we cannot negotiate the cap. The cap has been passed. \nWe have a budget resolution on the table.\n  Has the President yet submitted to this Congress a balanced budget? \nNo. The President has yet to submit to Congress a budget that actually \nbalances. The best he could do was a budget that had $200 billion in \ndeficits. That was the very best. Never have we seen a balanced budget.\n  Congress has given the President a balanced budget. Perhaps the \nPresident does not like the priorities that we have. That is \nlegitimate. Let us sit down and talk about what we spend within the \ncap. But what the President is saying in the continuing resolution, \nwhich he says he will veto, is that we must continue spending at last \nyear's levels, which means to the American people and to Congress that \nthe President is not going to let us have the balanced budget that we \nmust have this year.\n  If we do not meet this year's test, we cannot do it in 7 years. The \nPresident first said he wanted 10 years, then 9, and then 8. At one \npoint, he said he would go along with 7 years. But he never submitted a \nbudget that would do it in 7 years--so Congress did. Now we are trying \nto pass a continuing resolution that will end on December 1, when we \nbelieve that two responsible branches of Government ought to be able to \nsit down and work out a budget reconciliation package for the American \npeople that would meet the budget test.\n  There are two things the President says he does not like in the \ncontinuing resolution. The first is he does not like the lower spending \nlevels that I have just talked about that are necessary for us to have \nthe 7-year balanced budget.\n  The second thing he does not like is the monthly Medicare part B \npremiums, which will rise in January $7 a month in order to meet \nexactly where we are now, and that is that the Federal Government will \nput in 69 percent, and the recipient will put in 31.5 percent. That is \nwhere we are. Anyone who was here when we passed Medicare--I was not--\nknows the Medicare part B premiums, which are the doctors' visits, were \nsupposed to be shared 50-50 between the recipient and the Government. \nThey are now at 69.5, Government, and 31.5, recipient. That is where we \nare now, and that is where the Congress is saying we must stay if we \nare going to keep Medicare from going bankrupt. We have to raise the \npremiums that go with the rise in costs to keep the level at 31.5 \npercent.\n  It would be irresponsible for the President not to sign a continuing \nresolution that allows us to put the paperwork in place to make that \nhappen. The President's own Cabinet has said Medicare will start going \ninto a deficit next year. The President's own Cabinet says that \nMedicare can only last with the trust fund that is built up until the \nyear 2002. So we are trying to save the Medicare system by keeping the \n31.5 percent level of the recipient in the part B premiums and to slow \nthe rate of growth over the next 7 years from 10 percent increase per \nyear, which is \n\n[[Page S 16970]]\nwhat we are looking at now, to 6.4 percent per year.\n\n  Now, in the private sector, health care costs are rising at 4 to 5 \npercent. So it would seem that a 6.4 percent growth would be a \nresponsible approach for Medicare growth. And that is what we are \ndoing. We are not cutting Medicare spending; we are increasing Medicare \nspending at a rate of 6.4 percent per year.\n  The President is not being responsible when he says he will veto a \ncontinuing resolution because the Medicare part B premium is going to \nincrease $7 per month to keep it at the 31.5 percent, and because he \ndoes not want to have the lower level of spending so we can meet our \nbudget resolution goal for this year, so that we can have the balanced \nbudget. The President cannot have it both ways. The President cannot go \nout and say, ``You cannot cut spending, you cannot balance the budget; \nI would like to see a balanced budget, but I am not going to give you \none.'' He cannot keep having it both ways.\n  The people of this country are not stupid. The people of this country \nunderstand that we are looking at a $5 trillion deficit, debt in this \ncountry--$5 trillion. I would venture to say that no one ever thought \nwe would reach the level of $5 trillion. But we have.\n  The American people know that everyone is going to have to pitch in. \nOur lifestyles are not the same as they used to be. No one's is. In \n1975, a family of four spent 33 percent of their annual income on the \nnecessities of transportation, housing, and utilities. In 1995, that \nlevel is 46 percent. So people are not stupid. They know that even if \nthey are making a little more money, they are not living at the same \nlevel they were. They know that. So they know that we are all going to \npitch in, that we are all going to do our part to make sure that we do \nhave a balanced budget in 7 years because our elderly want their \ngrandchildren to have a Medicare system. Our elderly want their \ngrandchildren to get jobs in the future. They want a sound economy. \nThey want low interest rates. They want this country to be the country \nthey had the opportunity to grow up in. That is what they want for \ntheir children.\n  Mr. President, that is what Congress is trying to give to the elderly \nand to the working middle-class taxpayers of our country.\n  Let us talk about the debt ceiling. The President has already vetoed \nthe debt ceiling. This is what Congress tried to do. We were trying to \nextend the debt level and raise it to December 12, a temporary lifting \nof the debt ceiling, once again, so that we would be able to get the \nbudget reconciliation in place, so that we would have the first year \nset out with the spending caps to go to the 7-year balanced budget. We \nbelieve it is a responsible approach to lift that debt ceiling.\n\n  We also provide that there will be no borrowing from trust funds. We \nprovide that habeas corpus reform will take place. We provide for \nregulatory reform to get the onerous restrictions off of our small \nbusinesses in this country so they will be able to compete in the \ninternational marketplace so they will be able to create the new jobs \nthat will get our economy going again.\n  We do ask for the commitment to the 7-year balanced budget so we will \nnot have to talk about whether it is 10, or 9, or 8, or 7 in the \nfuture, but everyone will realize and acknowledge and commit to the 7-\nyear balanced budget.\n  Now, Mr. President, our congressional leaders have said that we will \nnegotiate on this debt limit raising. I think we should. I think the \nPresident can have his way on some of these issues. I think Congress \nwould be willing to give.\n  Mr. President, it is very important that we not give on the bottom \nline, that we must have a temporary raising of the debt ceiling so that \nwe can responsibly do the budget reconciliation. It would give us the \nfinal budget for this fiscal year so that we will not have to argue \nanymore about how much we are going to spend and so that the markets in \nthis country will know that our commitment is good.\n  Once we prove to the marketplace, to our international allies and \npeople who are buying our debt, once we show that we have the will to \nbalance the budget, this economy is going to strengthen.\n  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, has said that \nvery thing--that once the commitment is shown, our economy will \nstrengthen. Interest rates will remain steady and low. We will not be \nlooking at runaway inflation, and we will start creating jobs in this \ncountry once again--not just service-sector jobs but real jobs; jobs \nwhere we can compete in the international marketplace, and we will not \nhave to have our businesses opening corporations and manufacturing \noperations overseas because they cannot afford to do business here.\n  Mr. President, that is what we are talking about. I hope for the \nAmerican people and for all of us that we and our leaders can come to \nterms. We do not want a Government shutdown. The last thing we want is \nto default on our debt. There must be some meetings. There must be some \ngive.\n  Mr. President, we are here to do our part.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Chair. I will not be very long. I know my \nfriend from Washington has a statement he would like to make.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/13/senate-section/article/S16969-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16970-S16971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PREMEDITATED TRAIN WRECK\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I am intrigued by the statements that have \nbeen made on the Senate floor recently in the last few moments, as if \nthis is a budget that has gone to the President.\n  This is no budget that has gone to the President. It is a continuing \nresolution that keeps Government running at a certain level, and a debt \nceiling that will allow us to secure the funds to do that.\n  The point keeps being made that the President will not do this. Well, \nthe President has not received a clean continuing resolution. There are \nadd-ons. The President has not received a clean debt ceiling increase. \nThere are add-ons.\n  Mr. President, just go back to April of this year. This is a \npremeditated--a premeditated--train wreck.\n  In April, the Republican leadership said this would happen. They \nwanted it to happen so they could talk about it. They want to put the \nPresident on the spot. I do not think any us would sit in the Oval \nOffice and allow Medicare to go up 25 percent.\n  That was an issue last week in several of the campaigns--I know it \nwas in my State--Medicare.\n  We talk about statements by the commission on Medicare. Last year \nwhen they gave us a report, it was not quite as good as it was this \nyear. This year they said Medicare would be solvent for an additional \nyear. We have more employment, more money going into Medicare.\n  Somehow or another we are being blamed for inefficiency of the \nmajority party. The inefficiency of the majority party is that they \nhave not done their work on time. October 1 was the deadline for the \nappropriations bills to be on the President's desk. Here it is, \nNovember 13, 6 weeks later, and we only have two or three at the White \nHouse--6 weeks late. So the majority has been inefficient in getting \nthe appropriations bills to the President.\n  This would eliminate the continuing resolution. All we need would be \na debt ceiling so we would not have two bills on the President's desk.\n  All we are asking, Mr. President, is that we not tie other items to a \ncontinuing resolution, increasing Medicare by 25 percent. Increasing \nMedicare by 25 percent--we are talking about the average income in my \nState of those on Medicare about $15,000. Add another $150 a year on to \nthat household?\n  I do not believe there is anyone here, if they were President, who \nwould sign a continuing resolution that binds the President's hands, or \na debt ceiling that binds the President's hands.\n  One thing you do not hear, you increase the debt ceiling, and after \nit reaches that, it is reduced. The debt ceiling is less at the time it \nexpires than they are making it now. Why? So if we do good work, have \ngood income, which we think we are going to, we have reduced the \ndeficit 3 consecutive years--exactly what we said we would do in 1993.\n  If we get the appropriations bills out of the House and the Senate \nand to the President's desk, if we just give him a clean debt ceiling \nand a clean continuing resolution, we can sit down and work. There will \nbe no problem. \n\n[[Page S 16971]]\n\n  The premeditated train wreck that was announced last April is \noccurring. There is not anything unknown about this. ``We are going to \ndo it. The President is going to do it our way or no way.''\n  I have been around here a little while and I have heard that before. \nI believe the best interests of this country are to give us a clean \ndebt ceiling, give us a clean continuing resolution, and then we can \nwork out the legislative problems after that.\n  I think we would find that things would move a lot faster than trying \nto tear up the country and to tear up the financial stability of this \ngreat Nation of ours.\n  I hope we can get a clean debt ceiling, a clean continuing \nresolution, and that the majority would do their work and give us the \nappropriations bills so the President would have an opportunity to sign \nthose, and we can continue with the things all of us want to, and that \nis work towards a balanced budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/13/senate-section/article/S16970-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            A BUDGET PROMISE\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in the middle of last week, at the \nsuggestion of one of my colleagues from Washington State in the House \nof Representatives, most of the Washington congressional delegation and \nseveral Members from other States in the country began a campaign to \nallow people in the United States to speak out in a tangible and \ndramatic fashion their desire that we stop coming up with excuses and \npass a budget which could promise a balance to the American people.\n  We wanted individual citizens throughout the country to be able to \nsay we have loaded enough in the way of debt on the backs of our \nchildren and grandchildren and that it was time to stop, time to chart \na new course of action. The way in which we proposed to do this was to \nsuggest to each and every individual in the country that he or she, if \nshe wished the President to sign a balanced budget bill, should send \nthe President a pen, a pen like the one I hold here in my hand, or, for \nthat matter, a No. 2 pencil, or, in the case of the very children who \nwill be saddled with the debts that we have run up in the past and that \nthis President insists that we continue to run up, even a crayon. We \nsuggested any writing instrument, in other words, Mr. President, except \nfor a red pen, on the ground that there was a sufficient amount of red \nink in Washington, DC, already.\n  This announcement took place on Wednesday of last week. On Friday \nafternoon I was present at radio station KVI in Seattle, a talk radio \nstation, which had not much more than 24 hours earlier taken up this \ncall and had suggested sending those pens either directly to the radio \nstation or to some two dozen drop-off points throughout western \nWashington.\n  By the time I reached the KVI studios, there were already huge piles \nof envelopes containing pens--some without notes, almost all with \nreturn addresses, some with short notes to the President--stacked on \nthe table surrounding the microphones in the studios. They numbered in \nthe thousands, produced simply by that single radio station.\n  Others in the State of Washington have taken up the cause. This \nmorning the National Taxpayers Union held a news conference attended by \nmyself and by the junior Senator from Georgia and my colleague in the \nHouse of Representatives, together with one of these radio talk show \nhosts, to ask that this cause be taken up by other radio stations \nacross the United States. If those stations have anything like the \nsuccess that we had, there will literally be hundreds of thousands, \nperhaps up to five digits, of pens delivered to the White House, each \nand every one of which asks the President to sign a bill. No more \nexcuses, no more deferrals, no more putting off to next year what we \nshould do this year, but a set of laws, a set of changes and directions \nthat will clearly promise us a balanced budget no later than shortly \nafter the turn of the new century.\n  It is ironic, I believe, that we should have to insist that the \nPresident of the United States do this because when he was a candidate \nfor President, Mr. Clinton promised to balance the budget in 5 years. \nHe abandoned that promise on being elected. And by the beginning of \nthis year, 2 years after being sworn in, he submitted a budget that \nwould never be balanced, in fact, a budget that would never have \ndeficits of less than $150 billion a year.\n  Later, he said perhaps he could do the job in 10 years, then 9, then \nbriefly 7, now back to 10, but that he could only do it if he were \nallowed to set the assumptions, to play with the statistics, so that \nbalancing the budget would become an easy task without any significant \nchanges in spending policies in the United States, a tactic which has \nbeen used briefly by Presidents, both Democrat and Republican, with \nunsurprising results--increasing rather than decreasing budget \ndeficits.\n  In addition, the proposal which we have been debating today, the \nreconciliation bill which will come before this body before the end of \nthe week and be sent to the President before the end of the week, does \nmuch more to keep the President's original promises than simply to \nbalance the budget, as important and difficult as that task is. It also \nkeeps the President's promises, since abandoned, to provide a tax cut \nfor middle-income Americans, and it will also keep the President's \npromise, to which he continues to give lip service and little more, to \nend welfare as we have known it.\n\n  It is over a bill that will carry out these promises of the President \nof the United States that all of the current furor takes place.\n  Rather than to promise to sign that bill, the President has committed \nhimself to vetoing it. As of the moment at which I speak, he has vetoed \none of the two much more modest interim measures that would allow him \nboth time to veto that bill and to discuss with Members of Congress \nwhat alternative approach to the same goal he would adopt without \ncausing the Government of the United States to come to a halt.\n  I am not sure precisely what the consequences of this course of \naction will be. Two bills, one of which has already been vetoed by the \nPresident and one of which is likely to be passed here later today and \nvetoed before the evening is up, will cause a certain degree of \ndisruption. A veto of the reconciliation bill, a repudiation of the \nPresident's three promises, will, I suspect, cause somewhat more in the \nway of disruption because it will be the last of a series of actions on \nthe part of the President that belie his promises and commitments as a \ncandidate in the early days of his Presidency.\n  So far, the President has been unwilling, in any rational and \nthoughtful fashion, to discuss these goals. So far, he simply says he \nwill not even begin to discuss them until preconditions are met which \nguarantee that he will never have to discuss them seriously. I suspect, \nhowever, that as has been the case so frequently in the past, once the \nshoe begins to pinch, the President will be willing to discuss this \nserious question, and I believe he will find Members on this side of \nthe aisle willing to discuss everything with him except for the \nunderlying premise that we must come up with a realistic method of \nbalancing the budget. Once that principle has been reached, we can \nreach an agreement and the President can use one of those hundreds of \nthousands of pens to sign a balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are in morning business, is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, with time limits of 10 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/13/senate-section/article/S16971-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16971-S16973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  A SHUTDOWN OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me comment on some of the discussion \nthat has taken place on the floor of the Senate today. First of all, I \nthink if there is a shutdown of the Federal Government, there will be \nno credit in any corner of this town, only blame and, in my judgment, \njustifiable blame. We ought not be at this position. We should not get \nto the point of a shutdown of Government services. We \n\n[[Page S 16972]]\nought not have a train wreck. And we certainly ought not have any kind \nof a default on the amount of money that is owed by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  It seems to me logical that the leaders of Congress and the President \nshould and will sit down and discuss the issues that are between the \ntwo sides and resolve them. It is interesting to me, this is not even \nthe stadium where the contest is going to occur. The major contest on \nthe reconciliation bill is going to occur in the stadium sometime in \nthe month of December. This is the bridge on the way to the stadium. \nThe continuing resolution and the debt ceiling issue come to us with \nattachments, little extras added on, that those who put them on \nunderstand the President will not accept. So it does create a \ncircumstance where we now have an 11th hour problem.\n  I hope this gets solved between now and midnight tonight. There is no \nreason for the Government to shut down. But I do want to say, those who \nhave made a case today on the floor of the Senate that this occurs \nbecause they have a plan and no one else does, because their plan will \nwork and no other plan will, because their plan calls for a balanced \nbudget and no one else wants one, is just hogwash. That is simply not \nthe case.\n  The case here is not a difference on the destination. I do not know \nof anybody in this Chamber who does not think there needs to be a \nbalance between spending and revenues.\n  We need to balance the Federal budget. There are many different ways \nto get to that point. And the debate, as aggressive and as significant \nas it is, is a debate about priorities.\n  We ought to be debating priorities. It only behooves the political \nprocess, in my judgment, to have one side which says, ``Roll over and \nplay dead,'' while the other side says, ``Here is the only way, here is \nthe road to a balanced budget.'' I tell you what all of this is about, \nin my judgment, when you take a look at the priorities. It is about \nmoney.\n  There is an article in the Washington Post about a speech given by \nthe Speaker of the House, Speaker Gingrich, which says that the problem \nin this country is that we need more campaign cash. We need more money \nspent on political campaigns. Of course, that defies traditional \nopinion, and certainly defies the judgment that I hold. There is too \nmuch money in politics and too much money in campaigns.\n  The Speaker says the problem is there is not enough money; we need \nmore spending on political campaigns. What a lot of nonsense.\n  The problem here, even on these issues, is money. Those who have are \ngoing to do just fine under these priorities and those who do not have \nso much are going to find they are going to have some problems. That is \nwhere the difference in priorities come in.\n  Let me just show a couple of quotes to my colleagues. These are not \nfrom a Democrat. They are from a Republican, Kevin Phillips, a \nRepublican political analyst. Here is how he says it --again, not a \nDemocrat--a Republican sees it.\n  He says:\n\n       The revolutionary ideology driving the new Republican \n     Medicare proposal is also simple: Cut middle-class programs \n     as much as possible and give the money back to the private \n     sector business, finance, and high-income taxpayers.\n\n  That is not a Democrat or a partisan. That is a Republican observing \nthe problem with this plan, these so-called reforms.\n  One more from Kevin Phillips, a Republican analyst, who says it this \nway:\n\n       Remember, at the same time as the Republicans proposed to \n     reduce Medicare spending by $270 billion over seven years \n     they want to cut taxes for corporations, investors, and \n     affluent families by $245 billion over the same period. This \n     is no coincidence.\n\n  Again, not a Democrat speaking, a Republican speaking about the \ndilemma of this plan.\n  I simply observe this. This notion that everyone is to tighten their \nbelts and this plan towards a balanced budget requires equality of \nsacrifice, and everybody in America is told it is time to buckle up, \nthat we are going to hunker down and solve this problem--well, it is \nnot quite true. What has happened this year is we have seen the \npriorities in the appropriations bills and the authorization bills \nestablished that, in my judgment, are not the right priorities for the \ncountry.\n  Yes, we should cut spending, and there are ways to cut spending in \nsignificant areas of the Federal budget. But the fact is that we, of \ncourse, have not gotten the appropriations bills done. The Congress has \npassed only a couple of appropriations bills that have gone to the \nPresident. Most of them are not passed. It is months late.\n  The reconciliation bill, which is now going to be the subject of this \ndebate in December, is 5 months late. June 15 is date by which the \nRepublicans who run the Congress are required to have a reconciliation \nbill passed by the Congress. It is 5 months late. The reconciliation \nbill has not even had a conference.\n  Those who would be expected to be conferees on the Democratic side \nare unaware of any meetings held, not invited to any meetings, 5 months \nlater no reconciliation bill, and all of the appropriations bills that \nare not done--that is most of them--the fact is that they have not been \ndone largely because of hangups and disagreements among Republicans. \nThey cannot agree among themselves. They have very controversial issues \nthat hang out there. So the bills do not get moving.\n  If all the appropriations bills were passed, we would not have a \nshutdown tonight because all of the appropriations bills would be law. \nBut they are not passed. Even those that have been passed by one \nChamber or another demonstrate to me that it is not a case of people \nsaying, let us all tighten our belts.\n  I have in my mind the defense bill. That came to the floor of the \nSenate, and it had a requirement, or request, by the Secretary of \nDefense which says, here is what we want for the defense of our \ncountry. Guess what? The conservative Senators said: We want $7 billion \nmore. You do not want to build star wars right now. We want to build \nit. You do not want to build B-2 bombers. We insist you buy 20 of them \nfor $30 billion. F-15's, buy more; F-16's, buy more; two amphibious \nassault ships, we do not want to choose between the two. Let us buy \nboth, one for $900 million, one for $1.3 billion.\n  I could read the rest. UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, a whole series \nof add-ons that were not requested by the military, not by the branch \nservices, the Air Force, the Marines, the Army, the Navy--not by the \nSecretary of Defense. Just by conservatives standing on the floor \nsaying: We are not spending enough; we want to spend more.\n  The only two areas where they want to spend more is, one, when the \ndefense bill comes to the floor, they say, let us spend money not \nrequested. And, second, according to the Speaker, let us spend more on \npolitical campaigns. We do not have enough spending in political \ncampaigns.\n  I do not have the foggiest idea where people get these notions. There \nis too much spending in political campaigns. That is the problem. It \nought to be cut down.\n  Guess what? All those folks who spend money on political campaigns \nare not going to grimace when they see this new Republican revolution \nbecause the fact is, they are treated with kid gloves. It is the other \nfolks that have to tighten the belts that grimace a little bit when \nthey see the results of their programs.\n  My point is that this is a legitimate debate about priorities. But \neven as we debate priorities about where to cut spending, as we do \nthat, there is no reason at all to allow the Government to shut down \ntonight. Leaders of Congress and this President have a responsibility, \nin my judgment, to sit down and think through this, and to clearly \ndecide immediately to pass a continuing resolution and a debt extension \nthat is clean, that gets us into the middle of December when we are \ngoing to have the real debate about the reconciliation bill.\n  No one ought to shy away from the debate about priorities. That is \nwhat this is all about. There is no problem with that. But it does not \nmake any sense at all for us to be hung up on the continuing resolution \nand debt extension with provisions put on each of them in a manner \nwhere it is well known the President will be required to veto.\n\n  So my hope is, between now and midnight tonight, the President and \nthe leaders of Congress can agree on a clean continuing resolution and \na clean debt extension. There is no reason to \n\n[[Page S 16973]]\nhang Congress up and have the Government shut down and default on debt \nin the next couple of weeks. Let us have this debate about priorities. \nBut let us do that in December on the reconciliation bill.\n  But I did want to take the floor today simply to say this is not as \nit is characterized by some as one side of the aisle wanting to cut \nspending and the other side does not. I think I have just demonstrated \nin at least one of the largest areas of Federal spending where there is \nprecious little appetite to do anything other than to spend more by \nconservatives who come to the floor. It is a big jobs program. There is \nno belt-tightening when that bill comes up.\n  I hope when we debate and sort through these priorities in the middle \nof December and write a reconciliation bill that we will do the best \nwith what each side wants: expanding economy, more jobs, and better \nopportunity in the private sector. We also want to ensure fairness in \nthe spending priorities and budget priorities here in the Congress.\n  I think when Kevin Phillips, who is not a Democrat--a Republican--\nevaluates the set of priorities that is brought to us now by the \nRepublicans, it demonstrates once again that there is plenty of room \nfor disagreement, and I think also plenty of room for compromise \nhopefully in the middle of December when the American people would \nexpect us to reach agreement. But, between now and then, there is no \nexcuse to have the Government shut down or to have a default at the end \nof this evening.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/13/senate-section/article/S16971-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PAYMENT OF VETERANS' BENEFITS\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I was in Amarillo, TX, this weekend \ndedicating a veterans' hospital addition, and I met a couple from \nFriona, TX. He is a disabled veteran. They were concerned about news \nreports they had heard over the weekend that veterans' benefits would \nnot be paid if the Government is shut down.\n  I am taking to the floor because I want to make sure that the veteran \nfrom Friona, TX, and every other veteran in this country knows that \nveterans' benefits will be paid December 1 unless this administration \ndecides that that is not the priority. I hope this administration will \nnot do that.\n  Veterans' benefits are a priority. Veterans' benefits are an \nentitlement. Never before have veterans' benefits not been paid when \nthere has been a temporary shutdown of Government.\n  So I came back to make sure. I talked to the budget committees. I \ntalked to the veterans' committees. We consulted the Congressional \nResearch Office to see if there was any merit in this alleged \nnonpayment of veterans' benefits, and in fact we were told that they \nhad never heard of anything like that. And in fact unless the \nadministration made the decision affirmatively to pay welfare \nrecipients but not veterans, that in fact veterans would be paid.\n  So I wish to take the floor to tell the veterans of this country that \nmost certainly they will be paid. There is cash flow to do that \nregardless of whether there is a continuing resolution or if the \nPresident vetoes the continuing resolution there are funds to pay the \nveterans' benefits, the next ones of which go out December 1. So I \nthink it would be highly appropriate if the Veterans Administration \nwould reassure the veterans of that because they are getting mixed \nsignals.\n  In my home State of Texas, some veterans' offices are saying, of \ncourse, checks are going to go out, and some Veterans Administration \noffices are saying they do not know; that it is up in the air. And then \nthere are reports that reporters calling the Veterans Administration \nhere are getting the word that they will not go out. So there is \nconfusion by the administration on this point. But there is no \nconfusion on the part of Congress that veterans' pay is absolutely \nessential, that it is covered, and that the checks will go out December \n1.\n  So I hope that the Veterans' Administration will, indeed, clarify \nthis so that our veterans are not worried that their payments are of \nlesser stature than those of welfare recipients in this country.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/13/senate-section/article/S16973-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16973-S16974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            REPUBLICAN PLAN\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, while I was presiding, I was desirous of \nresponding to some of the things that had been said about the subject \nof this morning's business by a number of the Members of the Congress, \nspecifically one from North Dakota.\n  During the course of his remarks, he talked about a plan, about the \nfact that the Republicans have talked about the plan that we had that \nwe are going to discuss, that we have sent to the President that will \nreach a balanced budget in a period of 7 years, as if somebody else had \na plan. I suggest that there is no other plan. If there is a plan, I \nhave not seen it.\n  The Senator was talking about repeating some of the things that had \nbeen said over and over again having to do with reducing Medicare in \norder to give tax breaks to the rich. I want to say, every time I hear \nthat, that the Republicans had no intention at any point of reducing \nMedicare. The Republicans gave a program that would have the effect of \nincreasing Medicare by approximately 6.4 percent each year. That would \nbe if a person were getting the maximum Medicare, as accorded today \nunder the current law. That person would receive $4,800 a year. At the \nend of the 7-year period, that same individual would be getting $6,700 \na year.\n  There is no way to say that that could be considered as a cut in \nMedicare. To say over and over and over again, with redundancy that is \nunbearable, that the Republicans are going to try to use cuts in \nMedicare--which I just talked about, that there are no cuts in \nMedicare--to give tax breaks to the rich is being unreasonable. Mr. \nPresident, 90 percent of the tax breaks that would come from a $500 tax \ncredit per child would go to families under $100,000 of income.\n  But I want to get down to the point where he was talking about our \nNation's defense. He was talking about the Senate bill that was too \nhigh, talking about the appropriations bill that was actually some $7 \nbillion more than asked for by the military. I think we all know, being \nrealistic, that when there is a Democrat in the White House, the \nmilitary is going to be influenced by what that Democrat or a \nRepublican in the White House might want.\n  We saw what happened back in the 1970's when we had a Democratic \nPresident in Jimmy Carter, and we saw our defense budget going down, \ngoing down and, of course, the social programs going up. Until such \ntime as 1980, we did not have enough money for spare parts, and we \nfound it necessary after 1980, up to 1985, to increase spending on \ndefense by about 40 percent.\n  We do not want that to happen again, and yet we have seen during the \ncourse of this administration cuts in our defense budget to the extent \nthat right now we are where we were in 1980.\n  This concerns me, because right now there is a crisis that is taking \nplace and a decision that has been made by this President to send up to \n25,000 troops on to the ground in Bosnia. You can talk about doing this \nand act like the budget is going to remain static during this time, and \nyet the foreign policy of this administration has put more and more \nmoney into humanitarian gestures, Mr. President, to the extent that he \nhas had to come back to this Congress for emergency supplementals.\n  This is the position we have found ourselves in: We have a \nRepublican-elected House and Senate. We have control. The Republicans \ngained control in the 1994 elections. And yet we have a President who \nsends our troops off on humanitarian missions, having no relativity to \nour Nation's defense. We sent them off to Somalia. Of course, our \ntroops went to Somalia in December under the last month of the Bush \nadministration. And yet, once that humanitarian mission, as described \nby President Bush when we sent the troops over to Somalia, was over, we \ntime and time again pleaded with President Clinton to bring our troops \nback from Somalia. There was no mission there that related to our \nNation's security interests. Yet, he did not bring them back and they \ndid not come back until 18 of our troops were murdered in cold blood \nand dragged through the mud through the streets of Mogadishu. \n\n[[Page S 16974]]\n\n  What we do not want to happen in Bosnia--if you look at what the \nadministration has done to our military--is for them to come back and \nsay we need another billion dollars. They came back for a $1.4 billion \nemergency supplemental just to cover these humanitarian missions in \nplaces like Somalia, Haiti, Rwanda, and other places. And we are in a \nposition where we did not have a voice in making the decision to spend \nthat money on humanitarian missions, money we have to borrow from \nfuture generations, because we are borrowing this money. Yet, we cannot \ndeny the President his request for emergency supplementals, because if \nwe do that, he will take it out of the operating account of our \nexisting military, and, of course, we are down now to a bare bones \nmilitary system.\n  I think what is happening right now in Bosnia has a far greater \nsignificance than what we have been talking about in just the cost.\n  I had occasion to spend 6 months in Bosnia. I did it all in 4 days. \nIt was the most miserable 4 days I ever spent. But I learned something \nwhile I was there. I looked around and I saw a country that had been \npounded and pounded. Yet, we are not real sure who is doing the \npounding all that time. We have three warring factions in Bosnia. We \nhave the Croats, the Bosnian Serbs, the Bosnian Moslems. Yet, while the \npeace talks are going on, I suggest to you that some of the parties \ncausing the problems over in Bosnia are not at the peace table.\n\n  So here we are faced with a dilemma where we are going to have to \nmake decisions as to what is taking place over there, and we are going \nto try to stop the President from sending 25,000 ground troops in there \nwhere, certainly, there will be many, many deaths.\n  I will wind this up by only repeating the words of the commander of \nthe U.N. forces in Bosnia, that British general, Gen. Michael Rose, who \nsaid, ``If the Americans send troops into Bosnia, they will sustain \nmore losses than they did during the Persian Gulf war.'' That was 390 \nlosses. I remember when I asked Secretary Christopher and Secretary \nPerry, ``Is whatever we are doing over in Bosnia significant enough--\nwhatever mission that is--for the loss of several hundred--specifically \nover 400--American lives?'' They said, ``Yes.''\n  So I think there is the basis of the difference of opinion. Is the \nmission of containing a civil war and of protecting the integrity of \nNATO worth several hundred American lives. I say, ``no.''\n  That is another debate that is going on now. I would like to advise \nthe President that it is my intention to introduce legislation that is \ngoing to make it more difficult for him to send troops into Bosnia on \nthe ground.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/13/senate-section/article/S16973-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16974-S16977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CUBAN LIBERTY AND DEMOCRATIC SOLIDARITY [LIBERTAD] ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask that the Chair lay before the \nSenate a message from the House on H.R. 927, a bill to seek \ninternational sanctions against the Castro government in Cuba, to plan \nfor support of a transition government leading to a democratically \nelected government in Cuba, and for other purposes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the House of Representatives:\n\n       Resolved, That the House disagree to the amendment of the \n     Senate to the bill to seek international sanctions against \n     the Castro government in Cuba, to plan for support of a \n     transition government leading to a democratically elected \n     government in Cuba, and for other purposes'', and ask a \n     conference with the Senate on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses thereon.\n       Ordered, That Mr. Gilman, Mr. Burton of Indiana, Ms. Ros-\n     Lehtinen, Mr. King, Mr. Diaz-Balart, Mr. Hamilton, Mr. \n     Gejdenson, Mr. Torricelli, and Mr. Menendez be the managers \n     of the conference on the part of the House.\n\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate on the pending matter for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to debate the message \nfrom the House requesting a conference on H.R. 927, the Cuban Liberty \nand Democratic Solidarity Act of 1995, and the naming of conferees.\n  I find it somewhat remarkable that today, of all days, we are being \nasked to deal with this matter, of all matters. I would have thought \nthat today we would be devoting ourselves instead to finding our way \nout of the serious box we have fallen into over the budget impasse.\n  Let us remember what is about to occur shortly in this Chamber. As of \nmidnight tonight, the Federal Government ceases all but essential \nservices. Likewise, the Government's ability to borrow shortly will be \nexhausted. Keeping our Government operating and keeping the U.S. \nTreasury solvent should, in my view, be the only business of this body \ntoday. Even if it were not in the throes of a critical fiscal crisis, I \nwould still argue the priorities of the leadership in taking up this \nparticular bill at this juncture.\n  The Senate, as my colleagues will recall, has already exhausted 5 \ndays debating this bill. There is no pressing reason why we must turn \nto it again now or go to a conference today or tomorrow. It is not as \nthough the Senate has nothing else to do. We have yet to complete the \nbulk of the so-called must-pass legislation for this year. To date, we \nhave completed action on only 4 of the 13 appropriations bills that we \nmust enact--only 4 of the 13. We have yet to complete action on budget \nreconciliation, on welfare reform, on Medicaid and Medicare reform.\n  Instead, here we are debating going to conference with the House on \nlegislation that has no particular urgency to it whatsoever. Fidel \nCastro has been around for more than three decades. I do not think \nanyone seriously believes that this legislation is likely to markedly \nalter his status or the current situation in Cuba any time soon, no \nmatter how much we may wish it so. In fact, as I argued when the Senate \nspent 5 days debating this bill last month, I believe this legislation \nis fatally flawed.\n  In this case of the House-passed version, this bill would actually do \nserious damage to the United States, especially to our Federal courts. \nFrankly, Mr. President, this legislation is nothing more than special \ninterest legislation par excellence. It is particularly ironic, Mr. \nPresident, that we should be here today deliberating legislation that \nfalls within the jurisdiction of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  As I am sure my colleagues are aware, the Foreign Relations Committee \nhas been basically shut down for the past 3 months by the chairman of \nthe committee, with the concurrence of the majority leader. Eighteen \nambassadorial nominees, nominees to China, South Africa, Pakistan, the \nPhilippines, and several dozens of treaties, including START II and the \nChemical Weapons Convention, have been held hostage by the chairman of \nthe committee until he secures passage on S. 908, the State Department \nreorganization legislation.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nhas been unable to pass that legislation to date because in its current \nform it does not enjoy bipartisan support. I appreciate the fact that \nthe Senator from North Carolina is unhappy that he cannot get his bill \npassed. That circumstance, Mr. President, happens to all of us in this \nbody from time to time. However, I believe it is the height of \nirresponsibility to hold up nearly all the other business of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee over one piece of legislation. I believe \nthe action is almost unprecedented, if not in fact unprecedented.\n  I, for one, would argue that it is far more important that the United \nStates be ably represented abroad at the highest diplomatic levels in \ncountries where there are a great many U.S. interests at stake. China, \nPakistan, South Africa, Indonesia--these are all countries of critical \nimportance to the \n\n[[Page S 16975]]\nUnited States and the conduct of our foreign policy.\n  I also believe that arms control must and should continue to be a \nhigh priority for the United States. START II and the Chemical Weapons \nConvention are critical elements in that arms control strategy. I would \nassert, Mr. President, that the American people care far more about \narms control and being well represented abroad than they care about how \nsome boxes get drawn on some State Department organizational chart or \nwho draws them.\n  Under the current circumstances, I am not prepared to facilitate \nefforts by the majority to pick and choose the foreign policy items \nthat they want acted upon while ambassadorial nominees and other major \nagenda items on the Foreign Relations Committee continue to be held \nhostage.\n  I would be far more sympathetic to proceeding with the matter before \nus if I thought some critical foreign policy issue were at stake. That \nis not the case, Mr. President. The motivation for moving the pending \nmatter this week and today is driven primarily by a domestic political \nagenda and by a Presidential straw poll that will be held this coming \nweekend in Florida.\n  If the leadership of the House and the Senate thinks that this bill \nis of such high priority that it must be acted upon this week, then I \nwould suggest that the House take up and pass the Senate version of the \nbill. While I believe that this version, the Senate version, has \nserious deficiencies, it is light years better than the House-passed \nversion of this same bill. Unfortunately, they are not prepared to take \nthat course of action because the sponsors of the bill are eager to \nrestore title III of the bill in conference, the most controversial \ntitle of the bill, that was deleted in this body.\n  Mr. President, I am obviously prepared to speak at some length about \nmy substantive objections to the bill at an appropriate moment. I \nrespectfully urge that we forget about dealing with this matter and \nreturn to the critical issues that threaten to close down the Federal \nGovernment in a matter of hours and to call into question the full \nfaith and credit of the U.S. Treasury.\n  Mr. President, I mentioned earlier there were some 18 nominees that \nwere at stake being held hostage. Let me identify them, if I can: Sri \nLanka, which has been vacant since August of this year; the APEC \nconvention; Cambodia; Malaysia, vacant since June; Thailand, vacant \nsince August of this year; Indonesia, vacant since July; Oman, vacant \nsince June; Pakistan, vacant since September; Lebanon, vacant for 1 \nyear, no ambassador there; South Africa; Cameroon; the Marshall \nIslands; Fiji; China; Mali; Rwanda; The Gambia.\n  All of these places, Mr. President, are without U.S. representation. \nWe could have dealt with these matters. They have come out of committee \nwithout any real controversy. It is not as if some of these people here \nare particularly controversial at all. That is not the issue. I would \nunderstand that if that were the case. We made the decision here we are \nnot going to deal with these Ambassadors over one piece of legislation.\n  But it is not just the Ambassadors. I mentioned earlier that treaties \nare being held up as well. START II, the Chemical Weapons Convention, \nnine bilateral investment treaties, five mutual legal assistance \ntreaties, five extradition treaties, three tax treaties, two \nenvironmental treaties, the Law of the Sea Convention, the Women's \nConvention, the American Convention on Human Rights.\n\n  Now, again, Mr. President, some of these matters might provoke some \ncontroversy. I would not suggest that they are necessarily in the same \nstatus as these ambassadorial nominations. But, nonetheless, these \nmatters certainly, I would argue, are of equal or greater significance \nthan the pending legislation that we would like to appoint conferees \non. As important as that legislation may be in the eyes of some people, \nit does not deserve to have a status higher than all of these other \nmatters and higher than the status that we ought to be providing to the \nSTART II Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Convention that has been \npending for some time.\n  Now, Mr. President, I mentioned earlier when we had the debate on the \nCuban legislation that I thought the bill was fatally flawed. I still \nbelieve that to be the case. Let me say once again this is not an issue \nof whether or not you like Fidel Castro or are happy with the present \nsituation in Cuba. I will state once again for the record, I am not. I \nwould like nothing more than to see democracy come to Cuba, that a \ndictator leave, that we try to be able to achieve some human rights in \nthat country and a restoration of representative government. That is \nnot the issue here before us.\n  The issue is, is this particular strategy incorporated in this \nlegislation the correct course to be followed? This legislation does \nnot in any way change the present embargo, although there are many who \nfeel the embargo ought to be modified because it is not achieving the \ndesired results.\n  The problem with this bill is that it places some contingencies on \nother foreign policy matters that ought to be of greater weight than \nwhat we are presently doing or not doing in Cuba. I said at the outset \nof that debate that when we consider matters such as the legislation \nbefore us, we ought to ask ourselves two basic questions: Is what is \nbeing proposed in the best interests of our own country? And is it \nlikely to achieve the desired results?\n  Mr. President, as you know, I had grave concerns about the \nlegislation as it was originally drafted. I believe the bill would have \ndone serious harm to our own country, particularly to our court system. \nFortunately, the centerpiece of that bill that would have caused that \nharm, title III, is no longer a part of the Senate version. As I \nmentioned earlier, I thought it would be at least better, if the House \nwanted to move this matter along, to just take up the Senate-passed \nbill and pass that. But thanks to Senator Kassebaum and others who \nworked so hard to correct this serious problem, it is no longer a part \nof the Senate version.\n\n  Notwithstanding, however, Mr. President, this change, the two basic \nquestions still remain: Is this bill in our own interests? Will it \nachieve the desired results? Regrettably, I believe the answer to both \nof those questions is still no. It is not in our interest, Mr. \nPresident, to complicate our relations with the governments of Russia \nor the other New Independent States that were formerly a part of the \nSoviet Union.\n  Yet provisions of this bill would do just that, by linking our \nassistance to Russia and these New Independent States based on their \npolicies toward Cuba. We provide assistance to Russia and the New \nIndependent States because, I believe, Mr. President, we want to see \nthem carry out the kinds of reforms and programs that we are funding, \nbecause we want to continue to strengthen this still fragile democracy \nthat exists in these nations. Conditioning our aid to Russia and to the \nNew Independent States based on what is going on in Cuba, I think, is \ncounterproductive, and yet that is exactly what we do in this bill.\n  It seems to me, Mr. President, we have to ask ourselves, is it in our \ninterest to try to shore up these democratic institutions, these \nfragile democracies that only a few months ago were in the grips of \ncommunism? Fragile as they are, should we be linking that assistance \nbased on whether or not they continue to provide concessional aid to \nCuba? We may not like the fact that they do that, but are we going to \njeopardize the democracies in Russia and the New Independent States \nsolely because they maintain concessional aid to Cuba? Yet, that is \nexactly what the bill does.\n\n  Again, I do not necessarily disagree if people want to have some \nstrong language about what we do, what kind of aid we provide to Cuba, \nwhat kind of support we provide. That is a legitimate debate. But to \nsay to Russia and the New Independent States, ``We are going to cut off \naid to you, we are going to deny you the kind of support'' that these \ncountries need if they are going to succeed in the transition to \ndemocracy, based on the fact that they provide concessional aid to \nCuba, I think, is very wrongheaded.\n  Provisions of this bill also impinge on arms control. Again, one can \nargue about whether or not you want to proceed with arms control. I \nthink it ought to be a source of some collective pride and sense of \nwell-being that today we no longer have any nuclear weapons that \nformerly resided in the \n\n[[Page S 16976]]\nSoviet Union pointed at us. There has been a remarkable degree of \nsuccess in dismantling that nuclear arsenal. And yet today, this bill \non Cuba threatens, in my view, our arms control agreements with Russia \nand the New Independent States, specifically when it comes to Russian \nverification of United States compliance with these arms control \nagreements.\n  As I said a moment ago, it is certainly legitimate for the United \nStates to discuss the types of activities that appropriately fall \nwithin the scope of verification of arms control treaties. That should \nbe done bilaterally with the Government of Russia, not unilaterally \nimposed by the Congress in the context of its debate about Cuba.\n  Other provisions of this legislation bar Cuban participation in \ninternational financial institutions. That might be fine, but the bar \ngoes until after democracy has been established in that country. We all \nknow the critical roles played by the World Bank and the International \nMonetary Fund in the early days of Russia's transition to democracy and \nto a market economy. It is foolhardy, in my view, Mr. President, to \nprohibit the IMF or the World Bank from offering their assistance and \nexpertise to a post-Castro government.\n  Mr. President, my objections to the underlying bill were based on \nseveral points. One is that, of course, to be tying our aid to Russia \nand to the New Independent States, based on Russia's continuing support \nof concessionary aid to Cuba, does not make a great deal of sense to \nme. In fact, to tie those two issues together jeopardizes, in fact, the \nvery fragile democracy that exists in Russia and in the New Independent \nStates.\n  Second, to tie arms control is just as dangerous, in my view. We have \nachieved great success in the last number of months by turning those \nmissiles, which were pointed at our shores, away from our shores and, \nin fact, the arms control efforts have proven a great success. To link \na future arms control success, based on whether or not Russia provides \nconcessionary aid or assistance, to Cuba seems to me to have misplaced \npriorities. Whatever one thinks about Cuba, you do not jeopardize arms \ncontrol because Russia does what 57 other countries in the world are \ndoing--that is, providing aid or assistance, or allowing their \nbusinesses to operate in Cuba. Again, I am not applauding those \nparticular actions, necessarily, but I do not think you want to link \nthe foreign policy of this country--particularly the vital interests \nthat we have with regard to Russia and the New Independent States--\nbased on a relationship that those countries may have with Cuba.\n  This bill--the underlying bill--would also have the United States \nspend more money on TV Marti. Here we are cutting public broadcasting \nin the United States, cutting into those budgets; yet, we turn around \nand support additional funding to TV Marti--a program that, by any \nestimation, with all the studies that have been done, has been an \nabysmal failure. GAO report after GAO report has found it is totally \nineffective, that virtually nobody in Cuba watches it, that it is a \ntotal waste of taxpayer money. Those are not my conclusions, but the \nconclusions of the General Accounting Office. Yet, we are going to \nspend more money on TV Marti at a very time, as I said, when, frankly, \nwe are told that resources are not there to support our own public \nbroadcasting efforts in this country.\n  As I said, Mr. President, during the consideration of the \nlegislation, the only individual who has truly benefited from the \ndebate, in my view, has been Fidel Castro. Once again, we have managed \nto make him larger than life and given him excuses for why his \ngovernment has failed or why the Cuban economy is in a shambles. Once \nagain, we will force our allies to come to his defense because they \nprofoundly disagree with our own tactics.\n  Consider what happened in the United Nations only a few days ago, \nwhere a resolution on Cuba was offered. We had one country that \nsupports us--one out of the entire world stood with us with regard to \nCuba, and that was Israel. I point out, as I have in the past, Israel, \nin fact, has businesses, Israeli businesses, doing business in Cuba. So \ninstead of having some profound affect on our allies around the world, \nwe are achieving just the opposite.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I object to us moving forward, for a number of \nreasons. Let me reiterate them for my colleagues. One is that I do not \nknow why, today, of all days, with the Government about to shut its \ndoors and close down, with all of the other pending matters we should \nbe raising before us, here we are dealing with a bill focused on Cuba. \nAs I said earlier, we have only dealt with 4 appropriations bills out \nof 13. Why do we not deal with some of those appropriations bills? It \nseems to me that ought to have a higher priority than a piece of \nlegislation that will have virtually no effect on Cuba, no effect on \nFidel Castro. Yet, we bring that up today, with no particular urgency \nabout it whatsoever.\n  Second, here we are moving to this bill, which comes under the \nappropriate jurisdiction of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \nYet, we are going to rush this bill to the forefront, while 18 nominees \nto serve as ambassadors to the United States have been in limbo for \nweeks now--not days, weeks. These are 18 ambassadors that are going to \ncritical countries, like Pakistan, China, and Indonesia, where we have \ncritical United States interests at stake. Yet, those nominees cannot \nbe voted on because the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee \nwants another bill to be resolved--a bill he has an interest in. Now, I \nrespect his interests. I disagree with him on what he wants to do in \nmajor part, but I know what it is like to have a bill you are \ninterested in. But this ties up 18 nominees to serve as ambassadors of \nthe United States to these foreign countries, and a number of \ncritically important treaties, including START II and the Chemical \nWeapons Convention, nine bilateral investment treaties, and a host of \nother agreements, all of which have been held up, not because there is \ngreat disagreement with them.\n  These treaties ought to be debated if people have disagreements. Let \nus debate it here on the floor of the Senate and vote on them. But here \nit is, the majority controlling, saying these nominees cannot come \nforward to serve as ambassadors, and a whole host of treaties cannot be \nbrought up. We will not deal with the reorganization of the State \nDepartment, but we are going to rush to the forefront a bill on Cuba.\n  It seems to me that we have misplaced priorities here, Mr. President. \nOn this very day, hours away from shutting down the Federal Government, \nwe are going to debate about whether or not we are going to cut off aid \nto Russia and jeopardize arms control because we are unhappy with how \nwe see things in Cuba. Try to explain that to the American public. If \nthey wonder what is going on in Washington, consider what we are \ndebating today. Here it is, the majority, which controls the debate and \nthe agenda, brings up a bill regarding Cuba. We are hours away from \nshutting down the Federal Government, while not even considering \nbringing up, as I said earlier, the nominees for the important \nambassadorial posts and these important treaties, not to mention \nappropriations bills, Medicare reform, Medicaid reform. All of that \ntakes a back bench while we deal with Cuba.\n\n  I mentioned earlier, I have problems with the underlying bill itself. \nThe fact that we are going to link United States assistance to Russia \nand the New Independent States based on whether Russia and the New \nIndependent States provide concessionary aid to Cuba--explain the logic \nof that to me, why you would jeopardize fragile democracies critically \nimportant to the United States and to Western Europe based on their \nconcessionary aid to an island 90 miles off our shore, and why you \njeopardize arms control--a critically important issue to this country. \nAnd yet this bill says that we will not provide the kind of assistance \nto the arms control effort if, in fact, Russia continues to provide \nconcessionary aid to Cuba.\n  It just does not make any sense. The international organizations here \nare saying no aid to a post-Castro government--not Castro. Forget that. \nNo aid to a post-Castro government in transition.\n  All of us recognize the value of the international organizations--a \nfew months ago when Russia was going through that transition--yet in \nthis bill we say with regard to Cuba ``No international financial \nassistance'' for \n\n[[Page S 16977]]\nthe World Bank or the IMF until democracy is absolutely established.\n  Were we to apply those provisions to the New Independent States and \nsome of the conditionality in this bill, we would still be denying that \nkind of assistance to them as they struggle to get their footing into \nestablished democracy, a firm democracy in their country.\n  Mr. President, I feel very strongly that today to be raising on the \nfloor of this body a bill involving Cuba, which I believe is \nfundamentally flawed--I realize it passed this body, but I know a \nnumber of my colleagues think it is a bad bill. Because we are going to \nhave a primary, a straw vote I guess it is, in Florida this weekend, we \nare rushing to get the Cuba bill done.\n  So the closure of the Federal Government, the important \nappropriations bills, Medicare, Medicaid, they all take a back seat \nhere now so that we can score some points to maybe win a straw poll in \nFlorida. That is the only reason this bill is being brought up now--the \nonly reason.\n  In fact, if they wanted to deal with this issue expeditiously, the \nHouse could adopt the Senate version and send it back over to us. No, \nthat is not the case.\n  So today we are going to try and move through to deal with this Cuban \naid bill while we put aside the very issue of whether or not the \nFederal Government is going to close its doors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/13/senate-section/article/S16974-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 115\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, the Democrats on this side still have \nobjection to this proposal, but nonetheless we feel the process is \nworthwhile.\n  Mr. DOLE. If I may proceed for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DOLE. First, let me state that the Senate will remain in session \nuntil midnight tonight in the hopes we can get this to the President \nvery quickly and that if he should veto the continuing resolution, \nwhich I hope he will not, there still might be time for the President \nand the leadership to work out some agreement that would prevent a \nshutdown of the Federal Government.\n  I am not an advocate of shutting down the Federal Government. I think \nthere ought to be some way to come together. I think the American \npeople expect us to do that.\n  This will be on its way to the House within a minute or two and will \ngo directly from the House and we will see it is expedited and over to \nthe President and hopefully the President will have it a little after 5 \no'clock. That would still give us 7 hours to resolve the difference.\n  There has been some discussion today of maybe changing one of the \nprovisions on Medicare, just writing in the figure $46.10 which would \namount to a freeze. That was raised by the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico in a talk show over the weekend and also by the Senator from \nOklahoma, Senator Nickles, and discussed by the Senate leadership at \n12:30 today, and then discussed with the Speaker maybe an hour or so \nago, along with a number of other things we are also looking into--\nitems of disagreement on the total reconciliation package, and we are \nabout to wrap that up.\n  Before we concluded our discussion, we understand Mr. McCurry \nresolved the matter for us at the White House, indicating in addition \nto the Medicare provision they had other substantive problems with the \ncontinuing resolution.\n  So it underscores that all this weekend was a smokescreen on \nMedicare, and the truth of the matter is there were other objections--\nnot just Medicare.\n  So they are playing the Medicare scare card all weekend, so we were \nworking on maybe a softer version just to freeze at $46.10 and that, \nagain, Mr. McCurry indicates was not satisfactory.\n  In fact the quote reads, ``Explain what's wrong with the freeze, just \nexplain what's wrong with the freeze.''\n\n       Mr. McCurry. Well, because the President prefers current \n     law. Current law is very clear on what premium increases \n     should be.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the entire transcript \nof the White House Press Secretary's remarks printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S 16978]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Regular Briefing by Michael McCurry, 2:23 P.M., EST, Monday, November \n                                13, 1995\n\n       Mr. McCurry. Let me--good afternoon, everyone. Let me start \n     with an announcement concerning the president's very \n     important trip to Japan for the meeting of the Asian Pacific \n     Economic Cooperation Forum leaders summit and very important \n     state visit, bilateral visit with the Japanese government.\n       First, as is obvious, the president has to tighten his \n     schedule in order to take the very important work that he \n     needs to do on this trip and fit it in to what will amount to \n     a weekend trip to Japan. (Laughter.) The president will \n     depart 11:00 Friday evening from Andrews Air Force Base, and \n     will return Tuesday morning at approximately 2:00 a.m. to \n     Andrews Air Force Base.\n       Question. Was that a.m. or p.m.?\n       Mr. McCurry. A.M. Tuesday morning. He will--he leaves at \n     11:00 p.m. Friday, and he will be returning at 2:00 in the \n     morning Tuesday morning; so in other words, very late Monday \n     night.\n       That will allow him to participate fully in the APEC \n     leaders meeting that will occur on Sunday. It will also allow \n     him to accept the gracious invitation of the emperor and \n     empress for a state visit to Japan, and to conduct important \n     bilateral meetings with Prime Minister Murayama. The United \n     States appreciate the courtesy of the emperor and empress in \n     allowing this schedule adjustment to occur. Obviously, we \n     also appreciate the cooperation of the Japanese government \n     and the Japanese people as we make these necessary \n     adjustments to the president's schedule. The president is \n     confident that this schedule will allow him to do the very \n     important work of advancing U.S. economic interests as we \n     participate in these important discussions with the other \n     Asian economies, and as we deal at a very important point \n     with the very important bilateral relationship we have with \n     the government of Japan.\n       Yeah, Mike?\n       Question. Is that locked in now, or if you get a deal can \n     you expand it back out?\n       Mr. McCurry. Say again?\n       Question. Can you expand it again if you get a deal, or is \n     this locked in?\n       Mr. McCurry. This is--we are making all the adjustments \n     necessary to follow this schedule, so this will be the \n     schedule.\n       Question. You mean even if you get a deal it will be the \n     schedule?\n       Mr. McCurry. There's nothing to indicate that that's going \n     to happen in a time that would allow us to open the trip back \n     up accordion style.\n       Question. Let's suppose that you don't get a deal----\n       Mr. McCurry. I'm not going to do ``supposes.'' This is the \n     schedule. We're announcing the schedule as it's now \n     announced.\n       Yes?\n       Question. How long will the state visit be then?\n       Mr. McCurry. It will be one day. It will be--the president \n     will fly from Osaka down to Tokyo on Sunday night. He will \n     have sessions beginning at 9:00 in the morning Monday, he \n     will conclude with a state dinner at the Imperial Palace \n     at conclusion of the state dinner.\n       Question. In his talk to the DLC, the president said \n     something like he hopes to be able to make this trip to \n     Ireland. Did he use that language because that trip could \n     also be in some danger because of the (threat ?) of a \n     government shutdown?\n       Mr. McCurry. Well, the president still is keeping to his \n     planned schedule. It's impossible for us now to predict what \n     will happen between now and the end of this month in this \n     rather fluid situation\n       Question. Is Mrs. Clinton going?\n       Mr. McCurry. Mrs. Clinton does plan--does plan to attend, \n     yes.\n       Question. Since you're talking about scheduling, if the CR \n     comes down here--it now looks like they're going to vote \n     about 5:30, what time do you think the president would take \n     action?\n       Mr. McCurry. He will exercise his veto as soon as he \n     receives the measure from the Hill. As you know, final \n     passage in Congress has very little to do with what time \n     Congress actually sends the measure of the White House. We \n     had final passage on the debt ceiling measure Friday that did \n     not arrive here until Sunday. So it's impossible for us to \n     predict to you now what time that measure will arrive from \n     the Congress.\n       Question. Will he do it in a public way?\n       Mr. McCurry. I'm not aware that--you've got more \n     information than I do! I'm not aware that the Senate has now \n     dropped the Medicare premium increase. I've heard one or two \n     members suggest that, but we don't have anything \n     authoritative from the Republican leadership indicating that \n     they're now dropping the Medicare premium increase from the \n     continuing resolution.\n       Question. What do you have from Domenici?\n       Mr. McCurry. We have what we've seen him say on CNN. (Cross \n     talk.)\n       Question. (Off mike)--saying he hasn't talked to Panetta?\n       Mr. McCurry. His conversations with Mr. Panetta, the idea \n     that he discussed is very much the same one that he's \n     discussed publicly now on television.\n       Question. Well what's your reaction?\n       Question. So what's your reaction to it?\n       Question. What's your reaction?\n       Mr. McCurry. Well, it's an interesting idea, but it's got \n     nothing to do with resolving the current crisis. The \n     president, as he's made clear, needs for them to drop the \n     Medicare premium increase from the continuing resolution so \n     that we can then get down to a serious discussion about what \n     will be in a continuing resolution that's appropriate and \n     acceptable to the president.\n       Question. In other words----\n       Question. So you're saying a freeze is not good enough?\n       Mr. McCurry. A freeze has to--a willingness on the part of \n     Congress to drop the Medicare premium increase can open the \n     way to further discussions. That's the most you can say at \n     this point because the president has substantive objections \n     to other aspects of the continuing, especially the level of \n     funding.\n       Question. Explain what's wrong with the freeze, just \n     explain what's wrong with a freeze.\n       Mr. McCurry. Well, because the president prefers current \n     law. Current law is very clear on what premium increases \n     should be.\n       Question. Mike, following up, when you say the objection to \n     other aspects of the CR is the funding levels, assuming the \n     Senate even takes up Mr. Domenici's proposal, which isn't at \n     all clear that it's been embraced by Senator Dole or the \n     leadership, and they send him down a bill with the 46-10 \n     frozen in there, whatever, are you saying he could still veto \n     because of the 60 percent funding levels? Is that still----\n       Mr. McCurry. The president--look, nothing has changed from \n     the viewpoint of the White House. The president is willing to \n     sit down with the bipartisan leadership of Congress to \n     discuss how we are going to avert this crisis, a shutdown in \n     our government, and the only condition he attaches to that is \n     some measure of good faith on the part of the leadership by \n     dropping the proposed Medicare premium increase that is in \n     the current version of the continuing resolution. If they \n     drop that, there is a basis upon which to have discussions \n     about how we move forward from here, even though the \n     president still has substantive objections to the continuing \n     resolution now pending in the Senate.\n       (Cross talk.)\n       Mr. McCurry. Well, if there's no action by the Congress, or \n     if there's no action on a measure that the president signs, \n     then the there's proceeds.\n       Question. Mike, suppose they sent him the thing with the \n     Medicare premium dropped, would he sign that? A CR with the \n     Medicare premium dropped, would he sign that?\n       Mr. McCurry. The president's made it clear he would sign a \n     clean extension, clean continuing resolution, one that \n     follows----\n       Question. That doesn't answer the question.\n       Mr. McCurry.--the formula that was developed in September. \n     Well, I can tell you what the president has said he will \n     sign, I can't speculate for you what the president will do on \n     something hypothetical that we don't have any indication at \n     all is the viewpoint of Congress. Is Congress going to pass \n     any of these things that you're suggesting and send it to the \n     president tonight? That's a different question. There's no \n     indication that's going to happen at this point.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Even though the President still has some objections to the \ncontinuing resolution now pending in the Senate, the point is a number \nof cases here that a freeze was not acceptable, and that they had other \nobjections--which they have a right to have--so I am not certain what \nthe offer to meet with the leadership really amounted to.\n  We have been saying all weekend, people should understand we are \ntalking about part B Medicare; part B Medicare, where all the money \nthat is not paid by the beneficiary is paid out of general revenues, \npaid by taxes by people that work at McDonald's, people that work right \nhere on the Senate floor.\n  You are asked to pay 68\\1/2\\ percent of some millionaires' part B \npremium or someone making $100,000 a year. It does not make a great \ndeal of sense to me.\n  All we were talking about, we were just keeping the 31.5 percent in \nplace long enough until we negotiate some agreement, hopefully, with \nthe President of the United States on an overall balanced budget over \nthe next 7 years.\n  So, we made our case. The President has made his case. I think they \nhave overstated the case. And today they admit that it is not just \nMedicare; even the freeze would not be satisfactory, because they have \nother objections, other objections in the continuing resolution.\n  So, it seems to me we have no other choice. We passed the resolution. \nI thank my colleagues on the other side for clearing the resolution, \nand we hope that as we speak it is on the way to the House and will \nsoon be on the way to the White House. If the President should deem it \nnecessary to veto it, that then he would be willing to sit down with \nus. We are the leaders, and we would be happy to try to work it out \nbefore midnight to avoid a shutdown. \n\n[[Page S 16979]]\n\n  As I have said earlier, the Senate will be in session and the House \nwill be in session until midnight. We are prepared to act up until \nmidnight or after, if necessary, to prevent a shutdown of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair now, under a unanimous-consent \nagreement, recognizes the Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/13/senate-section/article/S16977-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CUBAN LIBERTY AND DEMOCRATIC SOLIDARITY [LIBERTAD] ACT OF 1995\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the message from the \nHouse.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. Let me return to the \nsubject matter that is the pending business of the Senate, but let me \nalso state here in response to the distinguished majority leader, it \nwas our intention that this process do move forward, but also it is our \nstrong feeling this CR ought to be as clean as possible.\n  There is a place and time to negotiate the budget proposals for 7 \nyears, but we do not believe it ought to be part of a continuing \nresolution and that extraneous matter included in the CR is really a \nback-door attempt to achieve through this process efforts which should \nproperly be the subject of negotiations as part of the long-term budget \ncommitments of this country.\n  So the CR ought to be as clean as possible. As I mentioned earlier, \nwe have only dealt with 4 appropriations bills in the last number of \nmonths out of 13 that should come before this body. I think we might \nbetter spend our time in dealing with those appropriations bills, get \nthe job done, and then the need for a CR--of course, it becomes \nunnecessary.\n  In any event, Mr. President, I am aware our colleague from \nMassachusetts will be coming to the floor shortly to talk specifically \nabout some of the Medicare proposals.\n  Allow me to just wrap up my own comments about the matter that is \npresently before us, and that is the message to the House on the \nappointment of conferees dealing with the so-called Cuban bill.\n  I am somewhat mystified as to why this particular bill has such a \nhigh priority that we are willing to move almost everything else out of \nthe way to consider it. There is no sense of urgency about it \nwhatsoever. We are moving this bill out of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee while simultaneously holding up nominees to be Ambassadors \nand critically important treaties that ought to come before this.\n  Frankly, when you consider a sense of urgency, not to have United \nStates representation in the People's Republic of China, Pakistan, \nIndonesia, seems to be an issue that ought to be dealt with \nimmediately, rather than putting that on a back burner and dealing with \nthis bill, which most people think will have absolutely no effect \nwhatsoever on the Government in Cuba. It will complicate our \nrelationships with Russia, with the New Independent States, and others, \ngiven the fact that we link our aid to those nations and our arms \ncontrol efforts based on whether or not they provide any assistance to \nCuba. That ought not be the way we deal with the fragile democracies in \nRussia and in the New Independent States.\n\n  So, for those reasons, I feel it is worthwhile to focus some \nattention on this and to try to bring the attention of the U.S. Senate \nback to a discussion of what ought to be the subject matter for debate \nand discussion today, and that is the priorities of our overall budget \nfor this country and why it is we cannot seem to get a clean debt \nceiling extension in a CR that is devoid of extraneous matter, and then \nget to the business of negotiating on the budget over the next 7 years \nbut not tying up those two matters with matters that have no business \nbeing there at all.\n  With that, I ask the Chair to tell me what the pending business of \nthe Senate is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The present order of business is to recognize \nthe Senator from Massachusetts for pending business. And at that point \nwe are going to resume H.R. 2491.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. I gather the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], may \nbe a bit delayed. He should be here momentarily.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair. Before I proceed, could I make \nsure? I ask the Chair to please notify me if I should go over 10 \nminutes, because I do not want to take any more time than that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is allotted 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me just talk about one provision in this motion to \ninstruct conferees that Senator Kennedy is going to be making. This is \na provision that I worked on, which essentially says that the Congress \nshall be instructed to delete provisions that provide greater or lesser \nMedicaid spending in States based upon the votes needed for the passage \nof the legislation rather than the needs of the people in those States.\n  What I am essentially saying here is that what happened a couple of \nweeks ago in the dark of night was that the U.S. Senate exchanged \nMedicaid money for votes. What I am saying in this provision in this \ninstruction to the conferees is that when we develop a formula for \nallocating Medicaid--or what we call in Minnesota medical assistance \nfunds--it ought to be based upon some rational policy choice. It ought \nto be based upon the needs of the people in the States. It ought not to \nbe based on some kind of a deal which is all based upon the number of \nvotes to pass a particular piece of legislation.\n\n  From my State, on this Friday night in about 3 hours we went from \nseeing a cut of $2.4 billion to a cut of $2.9 billion. In other words, \nthe State of Minnesota lost $500 million.\n  Mr. President, we need to understand that in the State of Minnesota \naltogether the projected cuts on Medicare and medical assistance are \ngoing to be somewhere between $7 billion and $8 billion.\n  So the concern that I have--and the reason that I am working with \nSenator Kennedy on this, and so much appreciate his instruction to \nconferees--it seems to me that it is outrageous for the U.S. Senate to \nmake decisions on allocation of medical assistance funds to States \nbased upon some sort of \n\n[[Page S 16980]]\nwheeling and dealing that takes place where Senators leverage the votes \nfor the amount of money that goes to their States as opposed to some \nkind of rational policy, and as opposed to the needs of the people in \nthose States.\n  I am also out here as an advocate for my State of Minnesota. In the \ndark of night in 3 hours, all of a sudden Minnesota has $500 million \nless of support. Mr. President, let me now translate this, if I can, in \nhuman terms, in personal terms.\n  Let me first of all just say to my colleagues that I am concerned \nabout this because it is not just some dry formula. We are talking \nabout 300,000 children in the State of Minnesota that are covered by \nmedical assistance. With the kind of reductions that we are going to be \nfaced with--about $2.9 billion--the question becomes, What happens to \nthose children? Mr. President, in the State of Minnesota we have a \nprogram called the TEFRA Program, which is extremely important, that \nallows 300,000 children with severe disabilities to be eligible for \nMedicaid based upon their own income and which allows families, \ntherefore, to be able to keep those children at home.\n  Mr. President, the question becomes what happens to those children \nwith disabilities and those families that provide tender loving care to \nthose children with disabilities when we have these kind of draconian \nreductions in medical assistance? That is why I have some indignation \nabout some dark-of-the-night decision that takes $500 million more away \nfrom my State of Minnesota.\n  But it is not just my State. It is some of the most vulnerable \ncitizens in America. Mr. President, 60 percent of our medical \nassistance funds--that is what we call it in Minnesota; we are talking \nabout Medicaid nationally--will go to pay for nursing home care. About \ntwo-thirds of all of the seniors that are in nursing homes in Minnesota \nrely on some medical assistance funds.\n  Mr. President, I am a huge advocate of home-based care. I think \npeople should be able to live at home in as near a normal circumstance \nas possible with dignity. But sometimes the nursing home is the home \naway from home, and the question becomes what in the world are we going \nto do as caregivers who care about taking care of elderly people? What \nis going to happen to senior citizens that are in those nursing homes? \nWho is going to make up the difference?\n  Mr. President, all too often in my State of Minnesota--and I am \nguessing it is the same way in Louisiana or Michigan--I am hearing at \nthe county level commissioners say to me: Senator, what is going to \nhappen is we are going to be asked to raise the property taxes, and we \nare not going to be able to do so. And if we are not going to be able \nto do so, we are going to redefine eligibility; we are going to reduce \nservices, and there are going to be a lot of persons who will be hurt.\n  Above and beyond that, there are some 70,000 senior citizens in \nMinnesota who are below the poverty level, and for those senior \ncitizens the medical assistance funds are what enable them to pay their \npart B premium for Medicare, which is the physician services.\n  So again the question becomes, why does the U.S. Senate make \ndecisions based on wheeling and dealing to get votes, not based upon \nthe needs of citizens in our States? Why a medical assistance formula \nin the dark of night which is so patently unfair to so many States, \nincluding my State of Minnesota? And above and beyond my State and \nabove and beyond the formula the real issue is, what about the impact \non the people?\n  I have said 10 times in this Chamber that this is a rush to \nrecklessness. I will say it an 11th time. This is not good policy. It \ndoes not pay attention to the impact it is going to have on people's \nlives. This instruction to conferees which relates to this formula is \nextremely important.\n  I conclude by repeating it one more time. Our instruction is to \ndelete any provisions that provide a greater or lesser Medicaid \nspending in States based upon the votes needed for the passage of \nlegislation rather than the needs of the people in those States. \nWithout apology, without equivocation, I am proud to advocate it for \ncitizens in my State of Minnesota. It is not just the seniors. It is \nnot just the children. It is not just people with disabilities. It is \nalso a State that values good health care. We want support for our \nmedical education. We want our rural hospitals that depend so much on \nthe Medicare and Medicaid patient payment mix to be able to continue to \nprovide care. We want to be able to deliver primary care out in the \ncommunities. This budget that has been worked out is not based upon any \nkind of understanding of health care policy that will respond to \npeople's needs in Minnesota or Iowa or any other State.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes and 20 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes and 20 seconds back \nto the Senator from Massachusetts when he brings this motion out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, I take this time to voice my concern about \nthe current situation with regard to the continuing resolution that is \nbefore this Senate to try to keep the Government functioning. \nThroughout Washington and I think throughout the various States people \nwho work for the Federal Government and people who have concerns about \nthe services the Federal Government provides are wondering whether we \nin the Congress are going to be able to get together and make \nGovernment work or, rather, are we going to fight to the finish and \nnobody will be a winner, least of all the American people.\n  Many Federal offices right now are debating the question of whether \nthey are essential or not, which is sort of a novel thing to have to \ndebate as a Federal employee in offices on the Hill and other agencies \nbecause they know if they are a nonessential employee, they do not go \nto work tomorrow unless we fix this problem. But if they are an \nessential employee, they have to come to work even though they might \nnot get paid. So it is interesting to see whether you are determined to \nbe a Federal employee who is essential or one who is not in order to \ndetermine whether you come to work tomorrow or stay home because we in \nthe Congress and the administration have not been able to get \n\n[[Page S 16981]]\ntogether and even come to an agreement on how to continue the functions \nof the Government.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned that many people in my home State of \nLouisiana are beginning to believe that the Congress is sort of a \nnonessential arm of the Federal Government, and they are saying that \nRepublicans and Democrats in the Congress are really nonessential \nbecause they cannot get together to find a way to resolve this problem.\n  I think there is a lot of blame that should be evenly divided among \nall of us who have not been able to solve this problem. My Republican \ncolleagues, because they have not been able to pass all of the \nappropriations bills to fund Government, have necessitated a continuing \nresolution to continue the functions of Government as if they were \nbeing continued last year, because we have not finished the \nappropriations bills. The problem is they have added a couple of little \nitems to the continuing resolution which make major policy changes, and \nthat is where the problem is. But it is not an irresolvable problem, in \nmy opinion.\n  It should be that grown men and women can come together and say we \nare going to move toward a position that will allow the Government to \ncontinue, allow the functions of Government to work, and I happen to \nfeel if we are able to do that, everybody wins. The American people win \nbecause Government works. The Congress wins because we have been able \nto resolve a problem.\n  I think we all lose if we bring this Government to a standstill. We \nare admitting that we are unable to govern. We are admitting that we \ncannot make it work. We are admitting that we are so stubborn, in my \nopinion, that we cannot meet somewhere in the middle.\n  I think there is a way to fix this problem. I know there are those \nwho want to bring everything to a halt to make a political point, but I \nthink the political point we all make is that we all lose.\n  Let me suggest this. The whole question is about Medicare premiums. \nUnder the current law, Medicare premiums are going to fall down to \nabout 25 percent of the cost of insurance. That is going to occur \nJanuary 1. That means that if the law is not changed January 1, \nMedicare premiums will go down to about $42.50 unless some changes are \nmade. Republicans have said: Well, no, we are going to not let it go \ndown. We are going to keep it at 31\\1/2\\ percent, which means that come \nJanuary 1 Medicare recipients are going to have to pay about $53.50. \nThat is their proposal.\n  That is a major change. I do not think it ought to be on the CR. I \nthink it is a back-door way to change public policy, and that is not \nthe way we should be doing it. So there are those who say: No, it \nshould go down to $42.50. Others say: No, it should rise to $53.50 \nbecause Medicare is in danger of going bankrupt so we need to pay more \nto protect it.\n  Let me make a suggestion. Let me make a suggestion that grown men and \nwomen can agree to keep the premium just as it is, $46.10, until we \nwork out this problem. It does not go up. It does not go down. Keep it \nwhere it is until we resolve the major differences in the budget. Let \nus not make Medicare recipients hostage while we battle over what \nGovernment should do. Keep the premium exactly where it is--no \nincrease, no decrease.\n  Now, the administration points out, and I think correctly, that the \nRepublicans have also tried to do something different from the current \nCR, and that is that they would fund all of these other programs at the \nlowest level between the House and the Senate version of these \nappropriations bills. I think that is wrong. The current CR funds these \nprograms at an average of what the House did and the Senate did. So why \nnot do both of those things and fix this problem and assure the \nAmerican people that we can make Government work.\n  My suggestion is quite simple. Keep the Medicare premium at $46.10 \nand fund the rest of the programs at the average between the House and \nthe Senate. That is not magical.\n  I mean, I bet a person in the eighth grade could figure that out and \nsay that is a fair compromise. But you know what? He probably would not \nbe a politician, because if he is a politician he is going to say, \n``Well, I can't do that because the other side may get an advantage, \nand, by God, I sure can't let that happen.'' So, I almost have decided \nthe only way to solve some of these problems is to get people who are \nnot running for reelection to come in and sit down, maybe get some of \nthose kids in the eighth grade that know how to add and divide by two \nand split the difference.\n  I think we could bring this to a conclusion if we did just those two \nthings, fund all of the bills that have not been completed with an \naverage between the House and the Senate. It is easy to figure out. \nThat is what the current continuing resolution does exactly. If it was \ngood earlier, it is good now. And, second, freeze the Medicare premium \nat $46.10 until we finish this. We can send that to the White House, a \nbipartisan agreement between Republicans and Democrats to get the job \ndone. That would allow us enough time until the end of this month to \nwork on the bigger issues. We should not hold this country hostage, \nneither side, because of who gets the political gain.\n  Again, I repeat, the people of Louisiana are beginning to believe \nthat Congress is a nonessential Federal employee. And that is a bad \nstatement about the ability of this Congress to get the job done. I \nsuggest we come together and get the job done.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Massachusetts \nis recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/13/senate-section/article/S16980-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16981-S16991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE 7-YEAR BALANCED BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1995\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The motion is as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] on behalf of \n     himself, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. Pryor moves to instruct the \n     conferees on the part of the Senate to insist upon removal of \n     the following provisions included in the House or Senate \n     bills:\n       (1) Provisions eliminating requirements in the Medicaid law \n     providing drug discounts to State Medicaid programs, public \n     hospitals, other programs or facilities serving low income \n     people, such as community and migrant health centers, health \n     care for the homeless centers, Ryan White AIDS programs, \n     pediatric AIDS demonstrations, family planning clinics, black \n     lung clinics, and public housing clinics;\n       (2) Provisions benefitting unscrupulous health care \n     providers at the expense of Medicare and private patients by:\n       (a) repealing current prohibitions against additional \n     charges (balance billing) by physicians and other providers \n     rendering services to Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in \n     private insurance plans;\n       (b) weakening current statutory provisions to prevent and \n     combat fraud and abuse, including such abusive practices as \n     self-referral and kickbacks, and such proposals to weaken \n     anti-fraud efforts as establishing more lenient standards for \n     imposing civil money penalties;\n       (3) Provisions threatening the quality and affordability of \n     care in nursing homes by:\n       (a) weakening or eliminating Federal nursing home standards \n     by repealing such standards or allowing state waivers from \n     such standards and Federal enforcement of such standards;\n       (b) repealing prohibitions against nursing homes charging \n     Medicaid patients fees for covered services in addition to \n     the payment made by the State;\n       (c) repealing current prohibitions against States placing \n     liens on the homes of nursing home patients.\n       (4) Provisions providing greater or lesser Medicaid \n     spending in states based upon the votes needed for the \n     passage of legislation rather than the needs of the people in \n     those states.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 8 minutes.\n  Mr. President, in the reconciliation bill the Republicans have \nextended an open hand to powerful special interests \n\n[[Page S 16982]]\nand the back of their hand to the American people. Senior citizens, \nstudents, children, and working families will suffer so that the \nprivileged can profit. Republicans are engaged in an unseemly scheme to \nhide what they are doing from the American people. Their proposals are \ntoo harsh and too extreme. They cannot stand the light of day. And they \nknow it.\n  The fundamental injustice of the Republican plan is plain, $280 \nbillion of Medicare cuts that hurt senior citizens are being used to \npay for $245 billion in tax cuts that help the wealthiest individuals \nand corporations in America.\n  The Republican bill is also loaded with sweetheart deals for special \ninterests whose money and clout are being wielded behind closed doors \nto subvert the public interest and obtain undeserved favors. In \nparticular, the sections of the legislation dealing with health care \nare packed with payola for the powerful.\n  The dishonor roll of those who will benefit from the giveaways in \nthis Republican plan reads like a ``Who's Who'' of special interests in \nthe health care industry. The pharmaceutical industry, the most \nprofitable industry in America, benefits lavishly from the Republican \nprogram. The House bill repeals the requirement that the pharmaceutical \nindustry must give discounts to Medicaid nursing home patients and to \npublic hospitals and other institutions serving the poor.\n  The total cost to the taxpayers from these giveaways is $1.2 billion \na year. Democrats in the Finance Committee succeeded in eliminating \nthis giveaway for the Senate bill. Our motion is designed to ensure \nthat it is not included in the conference report. The American Medical \nAssociation also receives lavish benefits in the Republican bill in \nreturn for the AMA support of the excessive Republican cuts in \nMedicare.\n  In addition, the bill weakens the anti-fraud and conflict-of-interest \nrules for physicians. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that \nthese benefits to physicians will cost the taxpayers $1.5 billion over \nthe next 7 years.\n  The Republican bill also eliminates the provision in current law that \nprevents doctors from charging more than Medicare permits for those \nenrolled in HMO's and other private plans. The Republican plan will \npermit doctors to collect the difference from senior citizens. As a \nresult, senior citizens could pay as much as $5 billion more a year for \nmedical care because of the elimination of those protections.\n  Our motion directs the conferees to restore the limits on such \nbilling and maintain strong protections against fraud and abuse.\n  Another unacceptable provision of the House bill is its elimination \nof all the Federal nursing home standards, a payoff to unscrupulous \nnursing home operators who seek to profit from the misery of senior \ncitizens and the disabled. A Senate amendment purports to restore some \nof the standards, but, in fact, as my friend and colleague, Senator \nPryor, has pointed out, it leaves a loophole wide enough to permit \ncontinued abuse of tens of thousands of nursing home patients. It \nallows States to issue waivers that could weaken Federal standards and \navoid Federal oversight and enforcement. Our motion instructs the \nconferees to maintain the current strict standards and protections for \nour senior citizens in the nursing homes.\n  One of the cruelest aspects of the Republican proposal is its failure \nto protect nursing home patients or their relatives from financial \nabuse. The Republicans claim that they have now revised their bill to \nmaintain financial protection for the spouses of nursing home \nresidents. What they do not tell you is that they still allow nursing \nhomes to charge patients more than Medicaid will pay. Spouses can still \nbe forced to sell their home, exhaust their savings to give their loved \nones the care they need. That is not financial protection. It is \nfinancial abuse.\n  The Republican bill also wipes out the protections that have been in \nMedicaid since 1965 that prevent States from forcing adult children to \npay the costs of a parent's nursing home bill. The Republican bill even \nlets States put liens on the homes of nursing home patients if a spouse \nor child are still living there. Obviously, Republican family values \nstop at the nursing home door. Our motion will eliminate these \nindefensible proposals from the bill.\n  What a travesty it is for Republicans to call this bill a \nreconciliation bill. The only reconciliation is between the Republican \nmajority and special interest lobbyists for whom this bill has become \none large feeding trough. Who knows what additional giveaways will be \ncooked up behind the closed doors at the conference committee? Adoption \nof this motion is a needed step to expose those sweetheart deals and \neliminate them from the bill. I urge the Senate to adopt it.\n  The conference report on the reconciliation will come to the floor of \nthe Senate later this week. But today we face the possibility of a \nGovernment shutdown because the Republicans are attempting to blackmail \nthe President of the United States into signing a Medicare premium \nincrease as the price of keeping the Federal Government in operation. \nThis is the only proposal in the continuing resolution that would be \npermanent law. It should be rejected by the Senate and vetoed by the \nPresident. It is clear that there is a new meaning to GOP--Get Old \nPeople. The Republicans are not insisting that cuts in Medicare \npayments to doctors and hospitals be included in the continuing \nresolution.\n  I just want to underline that, Mr. President. In the particular \nprovisions that the Republicans have taken as part of the continuing \nresolution, it only applies to what will be paid for by our senior \ncitizens. The doctors are not being asked, nor are the hospitals, to \nmake a contribution. Only the individual senior citizens, through \nhigher part B premiums. That is what this battle is all about. Raising \nthe part B premiums is one of the very objectionable provisions of the \nreconciliation bill, and the Republicans have tried to add that \nparticular provision to this continuing resolution because they know it \nis an indefensible position. They are trying to force the President to \nsign this so that there can be a continuation of the funding of various \ngovernment programs. It is unacceptable, and the President is \nabsolutely right to reject it. They are not insisting that the fraud \nand waste be squeezed out of Medicare, though anti-fraud and abuse \nprovisions to protect the Medicare program have been added over the \nlast several years, and they are beginning to be effective.\n  I can remember hearings that we had in Faneuil Hall when we had 800 \nsenior citizens. They said, ``Before you begin to raise our premiums, \nSenator, before you continue to raise our deductibles, before you \ncontinue to raise our copays, let's get fraud and abuse out of the \nwhole Medicare system.'' There is not a senior citizen in this country \nwho does not understand that.\n  Instead of tightening those provisions that would bring billions of \ndollars into the Medicare system, what are our friends, the \nRepublicans, doing but weakening those provisions, which are so \nessential and important to the integrity of the system.\n  They are not insisting that senior citizens get the preventive and \noutpatient services that will keep them out of the hospital and reduce \nunnecessary Medicare spending. If you want to do something to control \nthe cost of the Medicare, you take those senior citizens on Medicare \nwho are going into the hospital unnecessarily--anywhere from 25 to 30 \npercent--and costing the Medicare system billions of dollars, and give \nthem preventive and outpatient care. Or try and provide some help and \nassistance in letting seniors remain home, if that is their choice. \nThat can save billions of dollars.\n  But those types of provisions are not included. There are no programs \nto increase preventive or outpatient services for our senior citizens \nthat will improve the quality of health and also save money. The only \nprovision the Republicans are insisting on is a new tax for senior \ncitizens in the form of higher Medicare premiums.\n  The Republican assault on Medicare is a frontal attack on the \nNation's elderly. Medicare is part of Social Security. It is a contract \nbetween the Government and the people that says, ``Pay into the trust \nfund during your working years and we will guarantee good health care \nin your retirement years.'' It is wrong for the Republicans to break \nthat contract. It is wrong for Republicans to propose deep cuts in \nMedicare in excess of anything needed \n\n[[Page S 16983]]\nto protect the trust fund. And it is doubly wrong for the Republicans \nto propose those deep cuts in Medicare in order to pay for tax breaks.\n  The cuts in Medicare are too harsh and too extreme: $280 billion over \nthe next 7 years. Premiums will double, deductibles will double, senior \ncitizens will be squeezed hard to give up their own doctors and HMOs.\n  The fundamental unfairness of this proposal is plain. Senior citizen \nmedian income is only $17,750 a year; 40 percent of the elderly \nAmericans have incomes of less than $10,000. Because of gaps in \nMedicare, they already pay too much for health care that they need. \nYet, the out-of-pocket costs they must pay for premiums and deductibles \nwill rise $71 billion over the next 7 years, an average of almost \n$4,000 for elderly couples.\n  The Republican premium is especially objectionable, because it breaks \nthe national contract with senior citizens over Social Security. Every \nAmerican should know about it. Every senior citizen should object to \nit. Medicare is part of Social Security. The Medicare premium is \ndeducted directly from a senior citizen's Social Security check. Every \nincrease in the Medicare premium is a reduction in Social Security \nbenefits, and the Republican plan proposes an increase in the part B \npremium and a reduction in Social Security which is unprecedented in \nsize.\n  The Republican plan proposes an increase in the part B premium and a \nreduction in Social Security which is unprecedented in size. Premiums \nare already scheduled to go up under current law, from $553 a year \ntoday to $730 by 2002. Under the Republican plan, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, the premium will go up much higher--to \n$1,068 a year.\n  As a result, over the life of the Republican plan, all senior \ncitizens will have a minimum of $1,240 more deducted from their Social \nSecurity checks. Every elderly couple will pay $2,480 more.\n  The impact of this program is devastating for moderate- and low-\nincome senior citizens. It is instructive to compare the premium \nincrease next year to the Social Security cost-of-living increase that \nmaintains the purchasing power of the Social Security check. One-\nquarter of all senior citizens have Social Security benefits of $5,364 \na year or less. The cost-of-living increase for a senior citizen at \nthis benefit level will be $139 next year.\n  The average senior citizen has a Social Security benefit of $7,874. \nThe cost-of-living increase for someone at this benefit level is $205.\n  But under the Republican plan, the premium next year will be $126 \nhigher than under current law. Average income senior citizens will be \nrobbed of almost two-thirds of their cost-of-living increase. Low-\nincome senior citizens will be robbed of a massive 90 percent of their \nincrease.\n  Senior citizens have earned their Social Security and Medicare \nbenefits through a lifetime of hard work. They have built this country \nand made it great. Because of their achievements, America has survived \nwar and depression. It is wrong to take away these benefits--and it is \nespecially wrong to take their Social Security cost-of-living increase \nto pay for an undeserved tax break for the wealthiest individuals and \ncorporations in America.\n  The Republicans' attack on Medicare will make life harder, sicker, \nand shorter for millions of elderly Americans. They deserve better from \nCongress. This cruel and unjust Republican plan to turn the Medicare \nTrust Fund into a slush fund for tax breaks for the wealthy deserves to \nbe defeated. And this attempt to sneak a Medicare premium increase into \nlaw as part of the continuing resolution needed to keep the Government \nrunning deserves the Presidential veto it will quickly receive.\n  It is irresponsible for the Republicans to threaten to shut down the \nGovernment if they do not get the unfair increase they want in the \nMedicare premium. I say, shame, shame, shame on the Republican party. \nNothing more clearly demonstrates the harsh and extreme nature of their \nright-wing agenda for Americans that this attack on senior citizens and \nthe willingness of Republicans in Congress to shut down the Government \nitself if they don't get their way.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have 20 minutes 10 seconds, and \nthe Senator from New Mexico has 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  First of all, I see Senator Pryor on the floor. He offered a set of \ninstructions to the conferees. I might tell him, I hope he wins 100 to \nnothing, because I am going to urge everybody to vote for him.\n  As a matter of fact, I think most of what the Senator from Arkansas \nis talking about will find its way into the reconciliation bill. I \nthink we had this battle once before. Senator Pryor won and we won \nalso. It is kind of a dual win. He won on his proposal, and we turned \naround and in our reconciliation bill we won, with Senator Cohen being \na cosponsor of Senator Pryor's and arguing in favor of ours.\n  I do not see why we ought to have any further argument. We are \nwilling to accept the Senator's motion. He would like to have a vote, \nbut I can assure him, there will be 100 in favor--well, if they are \nhere. We are going to tell every Republican to vote for it. Senator \nPryor is making some headway, at least he thinks he is.\n  There has been an argument on the floor about taxation and Medicare, \nsort of tying the two together, implying that we are reforming Medicare \nto save money so we can cut taxes.\n  Mr. President, and fellow Americans, let me say once and for all that \nthe reconciliation bill, which they seek to instruct us about, does not \nneed instruction on that issue, because what we have done in \nconference, that will come to us in the reconciliation bill, is nothing \nbut a simple proposition that says none of the savings that come in \npart A or part B--so none of the savings in Medicare that come from \nanywhere in Medicare--can be used for anything other than Medicare. In \nother words, we have created a lockbox, a trust, if you would like, and \nnot only did we leave in that trust fund what we saved in part A \nhospitals which belongs there, but the savings that will accrue because \nof part B--that is the everything but hospital insurance coverage for \nseniors--whatever we save there will all go into the trust fund.\n  Somebody might stand up and say, ``Well, that can't be, Senator \nDomenici, because we have never done that before.'' And that is right. \nWe have never taken the taxpayer part of Medicare and put it into the \ntrust fund. It has only been the entrusted money that went there.\n  But what we are saying now is that all of their savings go into the \ntrust fund to preserve, protect part A hospital coverage. What can we \nsay when we have done that? When we have done that, there is not any \nneed to instruct us. So if there is an instruction telling us not to \nuse any of Medicare savings for tax cuts, we will accept the \ninstruction, because we are not going to do that.\n  We have decided that we want to make the trust fund solvent for more \nthan just a few years. So we are going to make it solvent until \nsomewhere around 2010 and to 2015.\n  So, seniors, as you hear all of these things about the Republican \nplan, what we are doing is taking every single penny, dime, nickel, \ndollar, hundreds of thousands or billions, we are taking every bit of \nthat savings and putting it into Medicare hospitalization so it will \nnot go bankrupt.\n  I cannot do it any better than that. When the bill comes to the \nfloor, we will read you the language so that you will understand \nunequivocally, those who want to attack this plan can still run around \nand say, ``You are using Medicare savings to cut taxes,'' but if you \nread the law, it says you cannot do that because it says every bit of \nsavings in Medicare stays in Medicare.\n  We cannot be any more certain of what our intentions are, any more \ncertain of what we want to do on Medicare than to go the exceptional \nmile where never before have we put in that hospital trust fund dollars \nfrom the general taxpayer. But we are doing it here to the extent that \nwe are savings taxpayers' dollars. We are putting the savings in that \ntrust fund.\n  I am not sure what all these instructions are. My good friend, the \noccupant of the chair, has been here during the day, but to the extent \nthat there is an instruction telling us to make sure we are not \ncutting, reforming, changing \n\n[[Page S 16984]]\nMedicare to cut taxes, whatever that instruction is, we are going to \naccept that, too.\n  If we can sort it out here, we are going to give whoever proposed it \na resounding 100 votes, because we have already done it. We have made \nsure that we cannot use Medicare savings to cut taxes.\n  Now, in a while, I will wrap up the other ones and see how I can \ninform our Senators as to how to vote. For now, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes, or until the \nSenator from Arkansas returns.\n  Mr. President, the fact of the matter remains that if they found the \nsavings and premiums did not go up, in this particular instruction, \nsome $52 billion--if they did not go up, the tax breaks would not be \nthere, would they, I ask the Senator?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. They might be.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is not a question of might or might not. My \nunderstanding is that in order to condition the tax breaks, the other \nprovisions of the Republican budget had to be achieved and accomplished \nbefore the instructions went to the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The point is made. If they do not have this money, you \ndo not get the large tax breaks. So, senior citizens, understand that \nthey are taking your money right out here, as the chairman of the \nBudget Committee just said, putting it in some kind of box on the way \ninto the pockets of the wealthiest individuals and corporations.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has just reconfirmed what we have been \nsaying this whole time. If they did not have this increase in the \npremium, you would not have the tax breaks for the very wealthy. You \ncan describe that in whatever way.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I did not agree with that. It was another statement you \nmade. I will explain the tax cuts in just a moment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield whatever time the Senator from \nArkansas wants.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Massachusetts for \nyielding to me. I also thank my friend, the Senator from New Mexico, \nfor his statement about the nursing home standards. I hope that we will \nhave a 100 to 0 vote on that in a few minutes, after the Senate resumes \nits voting process. I am very grateful for all of the support that we \nhave had throughout the country to retain the present standards.\n  Mr. President, I want to talk about one other aspect of the Kennedy \nproposal that I strongly support. In fact, I support each of his very \nsplendid proposals within this motion to instruct the conferees. But \nthere is one specifically that I think deserves attention and emphasis \nat this point.\n  Before 1991, State Medicaid programs faced an intolerable situation. \nSince 1951, they were forced to pay the very highest prices for \nprescription drugs in the country. The irony was that these States and \ntheir Governors were buying medicines from the pharmaceutical companies \nfor the very lowest-income families in the country. Alone, they could \nnot afford these life-saving medications. Medicaid provided a lifeline \nfor their well-being and their quality of life. But because the drug \ncompanies refused to negotiate with State Medicaid programs on price \ndiscounts, these programs were paying the highest prices in the \ncountry.\n  Something important changed in 1991, something very like the nursing \nhome standards enacted in 1987. A coalition of individual Senators and \nCongressmen got together from both sides of the aisle and enacted \nsomething called the Medicaid prescription drug best-price rebate \nformula. Instead of being forced to pay the highest prices in the \ncountry, we told the States that they could purchase their prescription \ndrugs at the best prevailing price in the country. We guaranteed that--\nif the companies would not negotiate in good faith--the States would be \nassured of rebates justified by the large volumes of drugs they \npurchased and the acutely vulnerable populations they served.\n  Let me emphasize, Mr. President, how important a change this was for \nthe States. The Congress said that it would be the policy of our \ncountry to assure that States receive the best possible prices on \nmedicines for the poorest of the poor. We struck a deal, and that deal \nhas worked remarkably. It has been a remarkable work of efficiency and \nof fairness. I know of no State that does not appreciate and value this \nprogram. It has allowed the States, for the first time, to negotiate \nwith real leverage with the pharmaceutical companies.\n  Since 1991 alone, the States--including Wyoming, Arkansas, Michigan, \nand Massachusetts--have benefited to the extent of $5 billion in \nrebates from the pharmaceutical companies. These funds have gone \ndirectly to the States to help them support the poorest of the poor \nwithin our population.\n  That is not the end of the good aspects of this program, Mr. \nPresident. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that, over the \nnext 7 years, the States are going to gain another $12 billion in \nrebates. This is a tremendous boon to the States and their Medicaid \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, this is an amazing breakthrough. It is a program that \nhas worked, and it has worked well. The Governors have lauded this \nprogram. They have come to Washington to testify on behalf of keeping \nthis program. The Medicaid directors--those who work daily with a \ndiminishing number of dollars--say that Medicaid rebates are one of the \nbest things that ever happened to them.\n  Let me repeat: Prior to 1991, we were paying the highest drug prices \nfor the poor. The Medicaid rebate program was the first break that the \nStates had in this intolerable situation. Today, billions of dollars a \nyear are paid to the pharmaceutical companies by the Medicaid program. \nThis is the one opportunity for the pharmaceutical companies to do \ntheir share--their fair share, I might say--of contributing to helping \nthe poor and to assisting those who cannot afford their medicines. This \nis their one chance at justifying some of the very lavish tax breaks \nthat we are about to give to some, in my opinion, who should not be \ngetting tax breaks under the Republican proposal.\n  But let me tell you what has happened in the past few weeks. The drug \nindustry has lobbied intensely to water the rebate program down. There \nare changes proposed by the other side of the aisle which could \njeopardize the progress we made in 1991, as well as the progress we \nhave subsequently made on behalf of the Department of Veterans Affairs, \nIndian Health Service, Public Health Service, and other Government \nprograms.\n  The Senate language would strip flexibility and choices from the \nStates, prohibiting them from negotiating the deepest possible \ndiscounts. The House language allows drug companies to ignore the needs \nof the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Public Health Service and \nIndian Health Service. The House would also exempt nursing home drugs \nfrom rebates outright--gutting the Medicaid program and forcing States \nto pay far more for 70 percent of their drug purchases.\n  Tens of billions of dollars are being expended every year, and we are \non the verge of taking away the leverage in spending those tens of \nbillions of dollars. We are proposing to take leverage away from the \nStates, the Veterans Administration, the Public Health Service--they \nare going to be cut adrift. They will be forced to say to the public, \nwe are sorry, we don't have the leverage anymore to negotiate. The \nplaying field has been tilted against the poor and in favor of the most \nprofitable industry in the world.\n  This would be a terrible thing, Mr. President, if we were to weaken a \nhighly successful program which was born in a bipartisan spirit, has \nsaved billions in taxpayer's money and which has been kept together by \npeople who truly share the belief and the commitment to raising the \nquality of life of those who urgently need medicines but lack the \nresources to obtain them.\n  What will we be left with, Mr. President? A hollowed-out Medicaid \nrebate program that serves the drug industry more than the poor. \nDraconian restrictions on the number of drugs we can dispense to \nchildren and families under Medicaid. A free license to companies to \nignore veterans, AIDS patients, and those served in America's public \nhospitals and community health centers. \n\n[[Page S 16985]]\n\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to consider this \none fact. Rebates have allowed us to expand the reach of Medicaid and \nthe Veterans Health Administration and the Public Health Service. They \nhave served the neediest in our country--and have done so efficiently. \nWhat we are doing today is turning our backs on that progress. Instead, \nwe want to give an additional windfall to the pharmaceutical companies \nand allow them the opportunity to escape paying rebates back to the \nStates.\n  Once again, Mr. President, I do not know why we are doing this. It is \na program that has worked. It is a program that the Governors support. \nIt is a program that the Medicaid directors support. It is a program \nthat we should keep as it was passed in 1991. We should not change it.\n  I am very hopeful that the Senate will adopt Senator Kennedy's motion \nto instruct the conferees to keep the concept of buying Medicaid drugs \nat the best possible price, to preserve the States' leverage in serving \ntaxpayers, and to allow the pharmaceutical companies of America to \nparticipate in contributing to this tremendous cause.\n  I understand there is a possibility that Senator Dorgan of North \nDakota may want a few moments. At this time, Mr. President, I yield \nback my time to my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will yield myself a few minutes until the Senator from \nNorth Dakota arrives.\n  I want to again express the appreciation of all the Members to \nSenator Pryor from Arkansas. He was the Senator that really worked out \na bipartisan, cooperative agreement with the pharmaceutical companies \nso that those whose lives depend on many of these prescription drugs, \namong the poorest of the poor in our country, were not going to be \ndenied being able to receive those prescription drugs, and to work that \ndiscount out.\n  We have been able to extend the rebate program. It applies to the \nblack lung clinics. It applies to the neighborhood health centers that \nserve 6 million of the poorest Americans. We worked that out 2 years \nago, and we had bipartisan support and also had the support of the \npharmaceutical industry.\n  Now all of that is effectively being wiped out--over $200 million a \nyear will be lost in terms of the public health clinics. I hope that we \nwould say--this should be done, as I understand, with hearings or \njustification.\n  We have yet to hear why there is suddenly this very important need to \nwipe this kind of protection out--whether the poor are getting \nwealthier, whether there are less uninsured, we are moving beyond the \nneeds of the poorest.\n  Quite frankly, every indication is to the contrary. The total number \nof uninsured are going up, the number of poor children and generally \nneedy people in our society is going up.\n  I am just interested, since the Senator from Arkansas is a member of \nthe Finance Committee, if he would just review with me and correct me \nif he believes I am wrong on this point, that the Medicare part B \npremium is really very much a part of Social Security.\n  I remember when we heard long speeches in this body about how we were \nnot going to take away or touch Social Security. It is my understanding \nthat next year the Social Security COLA would be $139 for those Social \nSecurity recipients that are receiving $5,300 a year. That is $139 for \na COLA to offset the increases in the cost of living, which the seniors \nhave no ability to control.\n  The increase in the part B premium for next year is expected to be \n$136, so if you take the $136 which the seniors will have to pay in \nthis new kind of tax, and put that under their $139 in new dollars, \nthey will have for a COLA, they end up with $3.\n  In a very real way, this is diminishing or adding an additional tax \non Social Security. The neediest recipients of Social Security would \nhave received $139; but at the end of the day they only have $3, and \neffectively the increase in premiums is taking 98 percent of the COLA.\n  An average Social Security recipient receiving $7,800, will receive a \nCOLA of $205. You subtract $136 for their premium increase and end up \nwith $69, which means 66 percent of their premium will be taken.\n  Even those that get $10,000 in Social Security benefits--which is \nabout the highest level--get a COLA of $261; take $139 from there and \nthat leaves $125. So their COLA is effectively cut in half.\n  Does the Senator agree with me that these are real dollars for Social \nSecurity recipients, and that with the increase in the premiums that \nare being suggested by the Republicans, this, in effect, is an \nadditional tax? You can call it a fee or premium or whatever, but you \nare taking the money out of the paychecks of Social Security \nrecipients.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, if I may respond to my friend from \nMassachusetts, I think he is precisely on point. He is exactly right.\n  In addition, I might like to add just one more factor. I believe that \nsomething like 60 percent of all of the Social Security recipients are \non a fixed income. They cannot go out and sell some more shoes or sell \nsome more cars or do this or do that to increase their resources \nbecause they are locked in to an income.\n  If we take this money from their Social Security by essentially \nadding a tax to their part B premium, and add it to the dilemma of \ntrying to survive today, paying the costs of getting by, and paying the \ncosts of food and the tremendous escalating costs of their medicines, \nwe are going to impoverish many of our seniors today on Medicare.\n  I want to salute the Senator from Massachusetts for bringing this to \nour attention. I wanted to elaborate to some extent on the number who \nwere on fixed incomes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 final minute and \nhopefully the Senator from North Dakota will be here.\n  Mr. President, it is irresponsible, then, for the Republicans to \nthreaten to shut down the Government if they do not get the unfair \nincreases they want in the Medicare premium.\n  I say, ``shame, shame'' on the Republican Party. Nothing more clearly \ndemonstrates the harsh and extreme nature of their right-wing agenda \nfor Americans than this attack on senior citizens and the willingness \nof Republicans in Congress to shut down the Government itself if they \ndo not get their way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I express some concern about the \ncontinuing opposition to change that I hear here on the floor. Some \nconcern about how in the world we are going to get a consensus in \npublic policy when we have as much, I believe, misinformation as we \nhave here on the floor.\n  I think we really need to address ourselves, do our jobs here as \ntrustees for the American people in trying to find a way to do some \nthings, to make this fundamental change.\n  You have to go back, it seems to me, each time we do this, to \nexamining where we are. The Senator from Massachusetts who just left \ntalked about having more poor people than we have had, more different \nthan we have had. You cannot expect things to be different unless we \nmake some change. If you want different results, you have to make some \nchanges.\n  We have set about in this last few months coming to a culmination, \ncoming to the end, this week, the opportunity to make fundamental \nchange, the opportunity to balance the budget--which I suggest my \nfriends who have been here for 20 years, 30 years, have not done it for \n30 years--some fundamental change in welfare, welfare reform, the \nwelfare plan than that which has been in place for 25 years. We have, \nas the Senator suggests, more poor people than we did before. We have \nto make some changes.\n\n  Medicare? There is no question but that we have to make a change in \nMedicare. The trustees say we have to make a change in Medicare. \nMedicare has been growing at three times the rate of inflation. You \ncannot continue to do that. Obviously, we have to make some change.\n  Someone on the floor a while ago used a parallel of having a home \nwith no insulation and holes in the walls and cold was coming in. You \nhave two choices. You can either buy more fuel and start a fire and let \nmost of it go out through the hole in the wall, or you can find some \ninsulation and try to fix the wall. That is what we are seeking to do. \n\n[[Page S 16986]]\n\n  There is a limit to how much money you can put into health care. But \nwhat we need to do is fundamentally reduce some of the costs, and that \nis what we are seeking to do here in Medicare. We are seeking to give \nsome choices to the elderly, choices that you and I have as Government \nemployees, so they can choose appropriately; an opportunity to go into \nmanaged care which will be less expensive and provide excellent \nservices.\n  The idea that there is a tax increase, I do not quite understand. In \n1990, a Democrat-controlled Senate voted to increase part B premiums \nfrom 25 percent to 31\\1/2\\. That is where it is. But I hear from \neveryone, as if by rote, that ``you are raising taxes.'' We are not \nraising taxes at all. It is continuing at 31 percent of the premium. \nThat is where we are.\n  What are the words--``raising taxes so you can pay for tax breaks for \nthe rich,'' 90 percent of which goes to families earning below \n$100,000. These are the kinds of things that make it difficult, it \nseems to me, to have some kind of a public policy debate when those are \nthe kinds of things we talk about. They are not accurate.\n  There is a reason why this matter of the part B premium is on this \ncontinuing resolution. The reason has to do with the ability of Social \nSecurity to put it in the computer and not go back to 25, to go back to \n31 in May. That is the reason it is there. It is a legitimate, \nlogistical reason it is there. It is not a political reason, not a \npolitical reason to talk about.\n  So I guess I am really enthusiastic about the fact that we are going \nto have a chance to make some fundamental change, that we are going to \nhave a chance to change the programs that we see have not produced the \nkinds of things we want to have happen, to get the results that we \nwant. And that is what it is all about.\n  Mr. President, I urge my associates to vote in favor of our \nreconciliation and to go forward with the balanced budget proposal that \nthe Senator from New Mexico has given such great leadership in bringing \nto us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 9 minutes and \n36 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do the Democrats have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have 2 minutes and 19 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Dorgan, if I were to yield you 2 minutes, that \nwould give you 4. Would that help you out?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I wonder if it is possible to put the \nSenate in a quorum call, not to have the time going against either \nside, for the time being? It will be very short.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What is the purpose of it? We want to start voting. \nThat is the only reason I am reluctant, because I am going to start \nspeaking.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Senator Kennedy has been yielded this time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 2 minutes \nand 19 seconds.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator like 2 additional? I will yield 2 of \nmine, just to leave me 7.\n  Mr. President, so Senators and staffers will know, we are getting \nclose to the time for the first vote. My colleague will speak for 4 \nminutes, I will speak 7, if that is satisfactory to Senator Pryor?\n  Mr. PRYOR. The leader is Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We are fine. That is perfectly agreeable to me because \nthere is no other alternative.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 2 minutes to Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has \napproximately 4 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have had a healthy discussion on the \nfloor of the Senate today about four sense-of-the-Senate resolutions \nwhich we have been trying for some weeks actually to offer. We do this \nbecause we are concerned about the priorities. I know some have been on \nthe floor of the Senate saying one side wants a balanced budget and the \nother side does not care. Of course, that is not the case. The question \nis not whether we ought to balance the Federal budget. Of course we \nought to do that. The issue is priorities. What kind of choices do we \nmake? How do we balance the Federal budget?\n  Somebody says, ``Here is our destination.'' We say, ``Fine. We agree \nwith the destination.'' But there are a lot of different roads to get \nto the destination. Among the discussions we have had this afternoon \nare issues of Medicare, the use of Social Security funds, and the \nSenator from New Mexico and I have talked previously about the use of \nSocial Security funds. We will probably not agree on that issue. But I \ndo not think those of us who raise these questions have ever been \nwrong. I just want to go back for a couple of minutes on this issue of \nSocial Security.\n  It was 1983 that we passed a Social Security reform package. I happen \nto know that because I was on the Ways and Means Committee in the House \nat the time, and I happen to remember the day we did it because in the \nHouse, when we marked it up, I offered the amendment, the amendment in \nthe Ways and Means Committee that was defeated.\n  That said, if you are going to raise extra money each year for Social \nSecurity and call it Social Security revenue and put it in a trust \nfund, take it out of workers' paychecks and say, ``We promise you we \nwill keep it for the Social Security system,'' I said let us make sure \nit is not misused later.\n  That was 12 years ago, and every year since, as we began to accrue \nthese surpluses, every year since it has been used as an offset against \noperating revenue in the Federal budget. That is just a fact. That is \nnot something we ought to debate. That is a fact.\n  The argument I hear on the other side is it has been done over all \nthese years so let us keep doing it. That is an argument for business \nas usual. This ought not be business as usual, and we ought not \ncontinue to take money out of the Social Security trust funds to use to \nbalance the Federal budget.\n  I showed a chart on the floor here 1 day. I should have brought it \nback today. It has a little arrow on it. It says you cannot use money \nfor two different things. Double-entry bookkeeping does not mean you \ncan use the same money twice. Either the money is going to be in the \nSocial Security trust funds or it is not. It is going to be used over \nhere, in the operating revenues for the Federal budget, or the Social \nSecurity trust funds. They are going to be used one place or the other, \nnot both. Regrettably, what we have in the coming year is the use of \nthe Federal trust fund money over here in the operating revenues. And I \nhave thought it was wrong since 1983. I have addressed it \nlegislatively. I have offered amendments on it. It is wrong now. It is \ngoing to be even more wrong in the future because each year this amount \nof money grows.\n\n  So what you have here is a legislative sleight of hand of those who \nsay we are going to balance the Federal budget, in effect, in the year \n2002. Even under the most optimistic assumptions, you will still have a \n$110 billion budget deficit.\n  The Senator from New Mexico knows that on page 3 of the budget report \nthat came to the Congress, it has a section called deficits. You go to \n2002, on page 3, and evaluate what is this deficit? It is $110 billion. \nThat is what they say, not me. Why? Because, in order for them to say \nzero, they had to take that money from the Social Security trust fund \nand use it--or misuse it. That is the issue. They are funny about their \nissues--the issue of education, which I think is important. The issue \nof part B premiums is what is holding us up at the moment.\n  As you know, among other things, the circumstances in which the \nmajority party says we insist on this legislation, this stopgap \nlegislation, insist on increasing the part B premiums, makes no sense. \nThey ought to pass a clean stopgap bill, send it to the President, and \nlet us stop this. This makes no sense.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized. \n\n[[Page S 16987]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me first talk about the issue of \nwhether we have a balanced budget or not. The distinguished Senator has \njust addressed the issue of whether we do or do not because of the \ntrust fund.\n  Let me remind everyone who is listening and wondering about this \ncontentious issue that the trust fund must not be ignored. What is in \nthat trust fund should not be used to balance the budget. The President \nof the United States sent us a budget when he first went into office. \nHe used the trust fund as part of the unfunded budget. He sent us a \nbudget this year. He did it 3 months later, claiming it was in balance. \nHe used the trust fund. Mr. President, every President since I have \nbeen a Senator used it in the exact same way. The Republicans used it \nin the exact same way.\n  Lo and behold, 19 Democratic Senators on the floor of the Senate, \ncourageous Democrats, produced a balanced budget. One of them happened \nto have as a cosponsor along with the distinguished Senator, Senator \nSimon, his fellow Senator from his State as a cosponsor. And what kind \nof budget was that in terms of a balance? That was the exact same kind \nthe Republicans produced and all the Presidents produced. There was no \ndifference. It treated everything just like it has been treated before, \nexcepting now the distinguished Senator, Senator Dorgan, insists that \nwe are not in balance.\n\n  Frankly, I do not think the American people understand the argument, \nnor do they care about it. We are making such a gigantic step in the \ndirection of a balanced budget that I do not think anybody is going to \nask us to do more. That is essentially the argument--that we ought to \ndo more. We have not done enough.\n  Why are we on the floor now? The U.S. Senate passed a reconciliation \nbill, a big law change, to change the laws so we can get to a balance. \nThat already passed. We voted on 58 amendments. There might have been \ntwo or three of them who were Republican. They had every opportunity to \nvote. They lost. They might have won one or two.\n  When we are all finished, they want another day on the floor of the \nSenate. So now they say, let us instruct the conferees, the ones who \nare going to go off and meet with the House who have already been \nmeeting--who have already finished the budget--but for another meeting. \nThey want a chance to tell them what to do by virtue of motions to \ninstruct. This is nonbinding.\n  It is also a desperate act of, let us get one more opportunity on the \nfloor of the Senate to make some charges and allegations.\n  So we say, fine. Have at it.\n  I am pleased to tell those who offered all of these instructions, \nincluding my good friend, the Senator from Florida, Senator Graham, \nthat I am going to urge that every Republican Senator vote for his \ninstruction. So if he is worried about it, he should know that he is \ngoing to win tonight. He is going to win because, in our opinion--and \nwe are going to tell the Republicans--nothing in our budget bill \nviolated the Budget Enforcement Act.\n  Second, we do not include anything in the conference report that \nviolates that section that he refers to. And, lo and behold, we did not \nuse $12 billion in Social Security cuts to balance the budget. So we \nare going to vote for it, and the Senator's instruction, albeit after \nthe fact, is going to be noted and well taken. So I thank him for that.\n  I offered Senator Kennedy a proposal that we take all of his, except \none. So if anybody wonders how this big argument--he has about 10 \nprovisions. We said we did all of them in our reconciliation except one \nwith reference to balanced billing. So if we have to vote no on Senator \nKennedy's long list, it is because we do not agree on balanced billing. \nBut on all of the rest, we agree. If he would agree to strip that, we \nwill even vote for his instruction tonight. I will leave that for him \nto decide here in the next few minutes.\n  That leaves Senator Pryor. I have said we are going to vote for that. \nAnd I say to the Senator, I was thinking of what I said. I am not \nsaying we did every single thing that he is recommending in his \ninstruction. I am saying we went as far as we could go, and we will \naccept the instruction since it is not binding. We will say we told the \nconferees to do their very best on his instructions, and I think for \nthe most part it is going to be found to be rather close to what he \nwants. But I did not want him to think we adopted his exactly.\n  That means that we are not going to go with Senator Rockefeller, who \nhas something in his saying we should only raise $89 billion to make \npart B solvent. So he would like to make it solvent for only a few \nyears.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me finish my last reasoning since I did not have \nany time, and I will get back to the Senator. I do not want to run out \nof time.\n  So essentially the one we cannot agree to is we cannot agree to \nSenator Rockefeller's for one reason. He said we should only make the \npart A coverage solvent to the extent of $89 billion put back into it. \nWe are putting a lot more back into it because we want it to be solvent \nuntil the year 2010, maybe even 2015.\n  So we could not agree to that. The last part of his we would agree \nto. He says, do not use any of these to raise taxes. We did not. We put \nall of the Medicare savings back into Medicare. So, but for that, we \ncould even vote for his but we will have to vote no on that.\n  If Senator Kennedy will modify his, the Democratic Senators will have \ntheir great victory this afternoon. We will vote for them--all three.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for 30 seconds, \nno one is more accommodating than the Senator from New Mexico in \nattempting to try to find common ground. But the issue on the double \nbilling is one of extreme importance.\n  Now, of course, beneficiaries are not permitted to be charged above \nthe reimbursement for Medicare. And it is my understanding from \nreviewing the language that under the proposal that is being discussed \nin conference there can be additional charges to senior citizens. But \nwe want to retain current law.\n  All my legislation does is effectively retain current law. But, as I \nunderstand it, that is not the position of the Senator, the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will have a vote on the Senator's instruction. I \nthank the Senator.\n  Let me close by saying that this argument that we are having on the \nfloor has nothing to do with these instructions. It has to do with \nwhether or not we are going to get a balanced budget in 7 years using \nvalid economics and using valid assumptions on what Government will \ncost. We have done that. We have used the Congressional Budget Office, \nand we will actually have a balance. And we are able to give the \nAmerican taxpayers $245 billion back in taxes.\n  Let me say that while I cannot reveal the details of the conference, \nlo and behold, 90 percent of the tax cut is going back to middle-income \nAmericans. So if there was any fear that we were going all the way to \nthe House side, we did not. As a matter of fact, $75,000 is the \nearnings for a single head of household for the child care credit. And \nthe rest of it, 90 percent, will be for middle-income Americans.\n  We will have capital gains in. For those who do not like that because \nsome of it goes to rich people, that is just going to be the issue. But \nessentially we are passing a budget not for today, not for seniors, not \nfor cowboys, not for ranchers, not for schoolteachers, but for everyone \nin America, in particular our children. Whatever they do in their \nlives, we are hoping they will have a better life than we. And we do \nnot think that is the case with $200 billion deficits as far as the eye \ncan see. That is the real issue.\n\n  We are delighted to have another debate on it. In a few days we will \nbring the bill here on the floor, and we will have another 5 hours of \ndebate. We hope we can send to the President a real balanced budget.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Have we appointed \nconferees from this body to a conference on reconciliation? Has the \nSenate appointed conferees?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate has not.\n  Mr. PRYOR. So if we do not have any conferees, Mr. President, we do \nnot have a conference. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. \n\n[[Page S 16988]]\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. The Senator from New Mexico keeps talking about ``we'' \nhave decided, that ``we'' have decided that. But yet, there is no \nconference because there are no conferees.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Who does the Senator speak of when he is talking about \n``we'' have decided this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is not an appropriate parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, may I ask the Senator from New Mexico for \nhis comment----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are out of time. I will be pleased to correct the \nrecord.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom New Mexico be allowed to answer my question in 1 minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could I ask for 1 minute for Senator Cohen to put a \nstatement in the Record?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I would be glad to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator from Maine wish to include a statement \nin the Record?\n  Mr. COHEN. I will withhold.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, just as the Democrats \ndid last year when they put together the President's package with the \nlargest tax increase in history, only Democrats really put the package \ntogether. I happened to have been a Member. I was not invited to that \nmeeting. When it was finished, they called a meeting and said it is \nfinished.\n  So what we have been doing is meeting informally because we know we \nare going to have to write this package. We worked very hard day and \nnight, all weekend, and when we finally got together tonight we could \nnot appoint conferees because these motions were in the way. They \nwanted to have this debate today first.\n  So as soon as it is finished, we will appoint the conferees, and in \ndue course during this week the conferees will meet and they will put \ntogether, ratify, and approve a conference report.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might ask a question, as soon as the \nconference is finished, they will appoint conferees?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 1 minute has expired. Any debate at this \npoint would require a unanimous consent.\n  All time has expired.\n  The Senator from Maine has 1 minute.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, during the Senate debate on the budget \nreconciliation bill I offered an amendment with my colleague from \nArkansas, Mr. Pryor, to retain strong Federal standards for nursing \nhomes and I am pleased that the Senate-passed budget reconciliation \nbill maintains the tough Federal standards that are currently in place \nto protect elderly and disabled individuals living in nursing homes. \nThe continuation of OBRA '87 nursing home standards in the Senate bill \nis a major victory for today's 2 million nursing home residents, and \ntomorrow's growing elderly and disabled population.\n  A few weeks ago I chaired a hearing of the Senate Special Committee \non Aging to examine the need for strong Federal quality of care \nstandards in nursing homes. The testimony from family members and \nexpert witnesses convinced me more than ever that the Federal \nGovernment must continue to play a central role in monitoring and \nenforcing nursing home standards.\n  The law provides a framework through which facilities can help each \nresident reach his or her highest practicable physical, mental, and \ngeneral well-being. It also provides critical oversight and enforcement \nof nursing home standards, following years of evidence that the States \nsimply did not make enforcement of nursing home standards a high \npriority.\n  While the bill originally reported by the Finance Committee required \nthat States include certain quality of care provisions in their \nMedigrant State plans, I had strong concerns that many of the important \nOBRA '87 provisions were eliminated and that the bill lacked adequate \nFederal oversight and enforcement of nursing home standards.\n  Therefore, I worked with the Republican leadership and many of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that this bill keeps \nintact the standards, enforcement, and Federal oversight now contained \nin current law.\n  During the debate on the reconciliation bill and since its passage, \nthe nursing home standards provisions contained in the Senate bill have \nbeen attacked as inadequate and a return to the days when nursing home \nresidents were tethered and overdrugged. It is unfortunate that my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have chosen to play on the \nstrong emotions and fears of families of nursing home residents. They \nargue that the waiver provision included in the Senate-passed bill is a \nveiled attempt to gut nursing home enforcement. I want to assure my \ncolleagues that, while I would prefer that a waiver not exist, this is \nsimply not true.\n  An article appeared today, entitled, ``GOP Health Reforms Leaving \nNursing Homes Behind. Both the House and Senate Budget Plans Propose a \nWholesale Repeal of Important Nursing Home Standards First Passed in \n1987,'' paints a distorted picture of the facts. The headline leaves \nthe clear impression that both the Senate and House plans are callous \nand have turned their backs on nursing home residents. The article then \ngoes on to attack the waiver process in the Senate bill as a plan to \neliminate the Federal nursing home standards which we have all fought \nso hard to achieve.\n  Let me set the facts straight for the record.\n  First, the Senate bill continues Federal standards and enforcement. \nTo lump the Senate provisions as being as bad as the House bill is \nsimply unfair. The Senate recognized the need to maintain Federal law \nand did so in its reconciliation bill.\n  Second, the Senate-passed bill does provide for States to receive \nwaivers from the Federal nursing home reform law, but these are \nprovided in only very limited circumstances. Specifically, a State may \napply for a waiver of standards only if its standards are equal to or \nmore stringent than the Federal requirements. The amendment clearly \nindicates that no such waiver is allowed unless the Secretary approves \nthe waiver, and only if the standards are equal to or more stringent \nthan the Federal standard. Further, the provision specifies that \nwaivers allowed under this section in no way waive or limit the Federal \nGovernment's enforcement of tough nursing home standards, patient \nprotections, and other provisions of OBRA '87 against the States or the \nnursing homes.\n  Under the Senate-passed bill, even if a State obtains a waiver, the \nFederal Government retains the authority to go into specific facilities \nand impose penalties. Specifically, the Federal Government can still: \nperform look back inspections, through which the Federal Government \nreinspects a percentage of nursing homes already inspected by the \nStates to determine if the States are adequately enforcing OBRA '87; \nenter any nursing home facility to ensure compliance with OBRA; \nterminate a facility's certification for Medicaid if conditions in the \nfacility causes an immediate harm to residents; fine a facility if the \nnursing home is not complying with Federal law; terminate or suspend a \nwaiver of any State that is not enforcing the Federal nursing home \nstandards or has standards weaker than the Federal law.\n  Colleagues on the other side of the aisle argue that the Secretary \ndoes not retain these rights and that the Federal Government is unable \nto enforce Federal standards against individual facilities. I maintain \nthat this is simply not correct under the language of the Senate-passed \nprovision and have been urging the leadership to clarify this in \nconference so there will be no doubt of the intent. Rather than working \nconstructively to support and clarify this language, however, those on \nthe other side of the aisle have decided that they can score more \npolitical points if they provide strained readings of the provisions, \nenergize opposition among the nursing home patients' groups, and paint \na picture of all Republicans trying to roll back standards and \nenforcement.\n  The fact is that States are now allowed to apply more stringent \nstandards than the Federal Government under current law. So the waiver \nreally gives nothing to a State--other than the option of requiring \nnursing home standards that are tougher, with the Federal Government \nlooking over the shoulder of the State and facility every \n\n[[Page S 16989]]\nstep of the way. While I strongly share the concern of my colleague \nfrom Arkansas that States have not had a good history of enforcing \nstandards in nursing homes, the law should not automatically assume \nthat tough enforcement by States--with full monitoring and full \nenforcement by the Federal Government of standards--is absolutely \nimpossible.\n  Some critics also question whether a State could receive a waiver if \nits standards as a whole--rather than each and every standard--for \nnursing homes were equal to or more stringent than the Federal \nstandards. I believe that the language in the Senate-passed bill means \nthat each standard must be equal to or more equivalent to the Federal \nstandards in order to qualify a State for a waiver. Again, I would \nsupport language to even further clarify that this is the intent--but \nwe should do this in an effort to clarify and strengthen the bill, \nrather than suggesting that there is a veiled effort to create \nloopholes for nursing homes.\n  In addition, under the Senate-passed bill the Secretary is given 120 \ndays to approve or disapprove a waiver application from a State. \nOpponents challenge this provision as perhaps allowing a State waiver \nto go into effect by default if the Secretary does not act within this \ntime frame. This interpretation is a far stretch, since as my \ncolleagues well know, under current law similar waivers are not granted \nby default if the Secretary does not expressly approve the waiver.\n  As I stated on the floor during debate on the reconciliation bill, I \nam pleased that the amendment that I cosponsored to preserve the \ncurrent Federal law on nursing home standards was adopted and I \nsupported the Roth amendment to the bill only because I believe that \nthe waiver provisions contained in it do not undermine strong Federal \nenforcement and standards. I assure my colleagues that I will continue \nto press for strong Federal standards and enforcement, and will not \nsupport a conference report on the budget reconciliation bill that I \nbelieve will dilute either Federal standards or Federal enforcement \nagainst States or individual facilities.\n  Mr. President, I intend to support the motion of the Senator from \nArkansas, but I also want to indicate I believe that there has been a \ndistortion of what the Senate did last week. The indication is that \nsomehow the Republicans have been less than concerned about nursing \nhome residents and their rights and the standard that will be applied \nto make sure that at the very highest levels we maintain Federal \nenforcement obligation.\n  I wish to assure my colleague from Arkansas that the measure which \npassed--both measures--and I supported, and the Republican substitute, \nwill insist upon standards that States can measure up to are higher \nthan Federal standards. We still retain Federal enforcement rights. I \nbelieve you are insisting there be no waivers, but I wish to assure you \nthat Republicans, by no means, are going to tolerate any diminution of \neither standards or enforcement by the Federal Government.\n  Mr. PRYOR. If the Senator will yield, does the proposal that the \nSenator has accepted contain waivers by States?\n  Mr. COHEN. The proposal that was voted last week in the Senate \nallowed for States that either had equal to or greater standards to \napply for a waiver that could be granted but only if the Federal \nGovernment retained enforcement standards, enforcement rights. That is \nthe measure we debated.\n  Mr. PRYOR. That is a change of which I wish to warn my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been consumed, the question is \non agreeing to the motion of the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have a unanimous consent request. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the votes occur in the order in which they were deferred \nand that there be 2 minutes equally divided between each motion to \ninstruct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                   Motion to Instruct--Nursing Homes\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes to be equally divided \non the Senator's motion.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, what we are faced with right now is whether we are \ngoing to retain the Federal standards as adopted in OBRA 1987. These \nare high standards. They are accepted standards. They are understood \nstandards. They are standards that apply across this great country, \nacross this wide land of ours in each of our 50 States.\n  In my opinion, to relax these standards is going to be a statement \nthat we are making to 2 million nursing home residents that we do not \ncare enough about their safety to retain these high standards.\n  I have just seconds ago been informed that even though I had been \ntold earlier my motion would be accepted as is, there is going to be \nthe possibility of relaxation of some enforcement provisions made by \nthe Republicans in their so-called conference, and the conference does \nnot even exist with the Democrats. So this is our last opportunity. I \nhope we will support the motion that is before the Senate at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I waive my 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays are already ordered on this motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, this particular motion to instruct is to say to \nconferees that Medicare should not be cut by more than $89 billion, \nwhich is sufficient to keep it solvent to the year 2006, and that any \nmoney necessary to ensure budget neutrality would come from the tax \nbreak.

Let me say to all Senators on the Republican side, \nI would have urged that you support this but for the $89 billion \nlimitation, because we think we can do better and we \n\n[[Page S 16990]]\ndeserve to make the fund solvent for more than just a few years.\n  So we are going to make it solvent to about 2010, maybe 2014. But as \nfar as that portion of this that says we should not use Medicare to cut \ntaxes, I can assure you that we are not doing that. We have put all the \nMedicare savings back into the Medicare trust fund, even those that \ncome from the general taxpayer for part B, so we are not using any \nMedicare savings for tax cuts.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the Rockefeller motion and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this motion relates to a provision that \nwas included in the last hour of our consideration of the \nreconciliation bill. That provision purported to fund $13 billion of \nnew spending by utilizing funds out of the Social Security trust fund.\n  This motion states that it is not our intention to dishonor the \ncommitment that this Congress made in 1990 not to utilize the Social \nSecurity trust fund for financing the general purposes of Government \nand, therefore, instructs our conferees to desist from any actions that \nwould have that effect.\n  I believe this amendment is acceptable to the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the first portion of his instruction we \nhave never violated, so we can be instructed on it.\n  The second section, we have never violated it, so we can be \ninstructed not to.\n  The third one, on $12 billion worth of Social Security, we did not \nthink we violated it on the Senate floor. However, in the final \nproduct, we did not have to use that to get to a balanced budget, so I \nam recommending we vote aye on this instruction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.

There is 1 minute of debate time on each side \non this motion before the vote.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this motion retains existing law in four important \nareas: In the discounts which are currently available for prescription \ndrugs for our senior citizens; second, in the prohibition against \ndouble billing that is in existing law, so that the senior citizens \nwill not be charged a cost above that designated, for example, in \nMedicare; third, in anti-fraud and abuse, to make sure that the \nexisting provisions to prevent fraud and abuse to deal with those \nexigencies are preserved, which they are not preserved in the \nreconciliation bill at the current time; and fourth, in protections \nagainst additional costs in Medicaid, to make sure that there will not \nbe additional costs for nursing home residents on Medicaid, spouses and \ntheir families.\n  We preserve existing law in all four areas. This will save seniors \nand seniors' families billions of dollars and save billions of dollars \nfor the taxpayer, and I urge its acceptance.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you very much, Mr. President. I take to the floor \nlate this evening, and I know there is other business that will be \ncoming before the body, to talk about where we are as a country at this \npoint when everyone seems to be poised for a shutdown, representing the \nlargest State in the Union where, I daresay, Senator Feinstein and I \nhave more people who will be impacted by this shutdown than any other \nState in the Union. It is of grave concern to me. I believe the time \nhas come for us to work together and keep this Government functioning. \nI believe if we cannot do that, then we are not doing our jobs.\n  The time has come for the Republican Congress to admit to something \nthey do not want to admit to, and that is the occupant of the White \nHouse happens to be a Democrat. There is a Democrat in the White House, \na Democrat who has said in every possible way that we can make \nbipartisan progress on the budget if Republicans moderate their extreme \ncuts in four areas: Medicare is one area; Medicaid is the second; \neducation is the third; and environment is the fourth. And on the tax \nbreak side, that the Republican Congress not give huge tax breaks to \nthe wealthiest to pay for those mean-spirited cuts.\n  Those are the main areas of disagreement: Medicare, Medicaid, \nenvironment and education and huge tax breaks for the wealthiest among \nus.\n  There are other smaller areas of disagreement, but those are the \nmajor ones. When you stop and think about the thousands of things that \nwe deal with in this budget, if it can come down to four or five areas, \nI think there is room for us to work together. I do not think it is \nunreasonable for the President to simply ask for moderation on four \nareas crucial to all Americans, and I do not believe that the majority \nof Americans think that President Clinton is being unreasonable.\n  Why do I say that? Because it is clear, when you take $270 billion \nout of Medicare, you are hurting this very important and popular \nprogram. And you know that what Speaker Gingrich said is true, they \ncannot kill it outright, but this will allow it to ``wither on the \nvine.''\n  ``Wither on the vine,'' the very words of Speaker Gingrich. And you \nknow something, he cannot get out of it. That is what he said. \n\n[[Page S 16992]]\n\n  So the Republicans will allow Medicare--indeed, that is their plan--\nallow it to ``wither on the vine'' and then use the money to pay off \nthose who earn over $350,000 a year. They will get $5,600 a year in tax \nbreaks.\n  I listened to the chairman of the Budget Committee--I am on the \nBudget Committee, I serve there with great pride--when Senator Kennedy \nof Massachusetts asked a direct question to the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee. The answer came back, and I do give Chairman Domenici credit \nfor this. He said, basically, yes to the question, ``Didn't you have to \ncut Medicare $270 billion to make room for your tax cut?''\n  Of course he did. Of course he did. That was in the budget itself. It \nsaid there has to be enough cuts to be able to afford those tax breaks.\n  It is symmetry, my friends, and very clear: $245 billion in tax cuts \nfor the wealthiest; $270 billion cuts in Medicare. That is extreme. The \nRepublicans go too far.\n  I think the President is being very reasonable and very rational and \nvery correct in suggesting that they moderate those cuts, that they not \nharm Medicare, that they not cut Medicaid by $182 billion.\n  Who uses Medicaid? The disabled, the elderly in nursing homes. They \nstill, with all the hoopla, are going to change the national standards \nfor nursing homes. Their latest ploy is to have national standards that \nthe States will enforce. Wonderful. We know what happened when the \nStates were in charge of nursing homes. We remember those days.\n  I compliment my friend, Senator Pryor, for his work on this issue. We \nare not going to go back to the days where seniors were abused, \ndrugged, had bedsores or were given scalding baths. That is what \nhappened in the 1980's.\n  I have to say when I hear colleagues on the other side say, ``Well, \nthose Democrats just do not want change,'' yes, we want change but we \nwant good change. We want change that is good for the country, that \nmoves us forward, that keeps our values.\n  Yes, we have to look more carefully at the way we spend our dollars. \nYes, we have to balance the budget. But it is a question of how you do \nit and the President is right to stand firm. I hope he will continue to \nstand firm because the American people support that.\n  Change in and of itself is not necessarily good. It is like if you \nhave a teenage child. I have had a couple of them. They are past that \nstage. This is very good. When they were young and I said, ``You have \nto do better, you have to work harder''--``Yes, I will change.''\n  If they change for the better that is great, but if they came home \nand said, ``Mom I changed. I joined a gang,'' that would be a bad \nchange.\n  When you repeal nursing home standards, that is a bad change. When \nyou hurt seniors in Medicare, that is a bad change. When you cut so \ndeeply into education and student loans that you really in essence say \nto our young people they are not going to have opportunity, that is a \nbad change. We should stand for good change.\n  We protect the pensions of our workers. This Republican budget goes \nafter the pensions, allows them to be raided. That is a bad change.\n  This is not a revolution, this Republican revolution, that Americans \ncan really embrace, because it is an America that loses its values, \nhope, opportunity, fairness. That is what I think we try to stand for \non our side of the aisle. That is the kind of budget that we will \nsupport--yes, one that moves us toward balance.\n  How do you get there is the question. I think what is happening is \nthat my colleagues on the Republican side want to blackmail our \nPresident and send him a debt extension, force him to sign it while at \nthe same time a provision in there would tie his hands in future debt \ncrises. That is not what we need for the strongest, greatest country in \nthe world.\n  I used to be a stockbroker in another lifetime, and every time the \nPresident sneezed, the market would go down. People were worried. \nImagine what it would be like if a President signed a bill that \nessentially tied his hands behind his back so he could not act in a \ncrisis, to stand strong for the full faith and credit of the United \nStates of America. That would be a terrible thing for him to do, and he \nis not going to be blackmailed into doing it. God bless him for that \nand give him courage and give him strength for that.\n  Imagine, these short-term bills having all this extraneous matter--\nraising Medicare premiums. The Republicans cannot even wait for the \nreconciliation bill, they are going to put it in this short-term bill. \nRaising premiums instead of looking at Medicare as a whole unit and \nbringing in the doctor piece and bringing in the waste, fraud, and \nabuse piece, as Senator Kennedy said, and the hospital piece, and \nmaking sure the poor seniors are protected.\n  Why should the President sign a bill when he is up against the wall \nand being blackmailed into it? The President has every right to reject \nthis. He should.\n  I am here to say that right now if the Republicans in this U.S. \nSenate wanted to, they could sit down with us Democrats. We could send \na clean debt extension to the President, a clean continuing \nappropriations to the President, absent all this extraneous matter.\n  One of them even weakens environmental laws, threatening public \nhealth and safety. It is an outrage.\n  We do not have to shut down this Government and make people feel \nconcerned if they want to apply for veterans' benefits or Social \nSecurity benefits that the door will be closed. It is not necessary to \ndo that.\n  Send the President a clean extension of the debt. Send the President \na clean continuing resolution. We have many battles that we have to \nfight but we do not have to fight it on this short-term bill.\n  I am only going to go for another 2 or 3 minutes but I really need to \nsay that this crisis is a manufactured crisis. There is no reason for \nit to be happening. It is just an attempt by this Republican Congress \nto sneak things through here that they know they cannot get through in \nthe light of day. They do not want to vote to raise Medicare premiums, \nso they stick it in on this debt extension or on the continuing \nresolution. On the debt extension they weaken the environmental laws. \nThey are radical plans and their only hope of success is to slip it \nthrough.\n  We should not be playing a game here about who is more macho, Newt \nGingrich or President Clinton. Frankly, I do not care. I do not care \nabout that. What I care about is that my country functions, that my \ncountry operates, that we are not sending a signal to foreign countries \nthat there is some problem here with us doing our work.\n  The full faith and credit of the greatest Nation on Earth is at \nstake, so we should not play the high noon games, the macho games, and \nthe football games. We have a job to do. Keep the bills clean.\n  I also would like to take this opportunity to note that while the \nSenate voted unanimously to dock our pay if any part of the Government \nshuts down, the House of Representatives refused to do it. Speaker \nGingrich will not even meet with me and Congressman Durbin in order to \ndiscuss this matter.\n  Here we have a situation where Federal employees who work very hard \nare being disrupted, their families are frightened, and yet because \nSpeaker Gingrich does not want to act on this, Members of Congress will \nget their pay. Wonderful signal. Wonderful signal. Play games with the \nfaith and credit of the United States of America, but we get our pay.\n  I hope that Congressman Durbin will be able to get his bill offered \nover on that side under suspension of the rules. We passed it here \nunanimously with Senators Daschle and Dole going on my amendment.\n  I find it bizarre, just bizarre, that Speaker Gingrich is very \nwilling to give out the pain to the country but is protecting himself \nand his colleagues from any pain. It is wrong.\n  Mr. President, stand firm. You are right in what you are doing. Let \nus pass these short-term bills without extraneous amendments. Take the \nfour or five areas of disagreement in the budget and hammer out \nagreements. This Congress has only sent the President 5 appropriation \nbills out of 13. They have not even sent the reconciliation bill over \nto him yet, and they are playing games with these short-term bills.\n\n  Get your work done. Send it to the President. He will veto it, \nbecause it \n\n[[Page S 16993]]\nhas hurtful cuts in education, environment, Medicare and Medicaid, and \nfor its attack on working people and cozy tax breaks to the wealthiest \nand its raid on workers' pensions.\n  Send it to the President. Our founders envisioned that when there is \na split in values, there will be a veto. Then there will be a veto \noverride. And, if that fails, we will sit down and we will solve the \nproblems before us.\n  Our values are clashing. In many ways, it is important for America to \nunderstand that. This is not about some small matters. This is about \nthe heart and soul of America. Do we invest in our students? Do we care \nabout our seniors? Do we care about our children? Do we value them? Do \nwe want to balance the budget, but do it in a way that is humane and \ncompassionate and fair and just? Or do we want to slash and burn and \nuse those savings to give the wealthiest among us thousands of dollars \nevery year?\n  I hope the answer to that is no. I think the answer to that is no. \nAnd when the President stands tall and vetoes this bill, we will move \nthe debate forward. But that is a battle we do not have to have on the \nshort-term legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for 30 additional seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. In closing, strip these short-term bills of extraneous \nmaterial and let us govern.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. KERRY.

I do not need to have that additional part of the request. \nI think it would be sufficient simply to set it aside, and I would be \nhappy to go back in a quorum call.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think we are going to be able to work this \nout here momentarily. But we are not prepared at this moment to set the \nissue aside.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be set \naside temporarily for purposes of speaking as in morning business.\n  I ask the distinguished Senator from Mississippi how long he thinks \nit might be before we make a decision.\n  Mr. LOTT. Just momentarily.\n  Mr. KERRY. In that case, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for such \ntime as necessary, until the Senator has an answer, as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/13/senate-section/article/S16993-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16993-S16995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE DEBT CEILING\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from California \non her comments with respect to the budget. I would like to just say a \nfew words.\n  About a month ago, I came to the floor of the Senate and suggested \nthat, as every Senator here knew, we were headed towards this \ninevitable moment that we are now in. I think a lot of us felt then \nthat the American people would have been much better served if we had \nbeen able to come together on all sides of the aisle, as well as on the \nother end of Pennsylvania Avenue, in order to try to work out the \ndifferences between us.\n  But all of us understand there is a different dynamic that is working \nhere. And that dynamic, I feel, is underscored by those things that had \nbeen attached to the debt ceiling and to the continuing resolution.\n  Most Americans are sitting at home today sort of scratching their \nheads. They are saying to themselves, what in God's name is going on in \nWashington yet again? We thought that in 1994 we voted for a \n``change.'' Yet, here is Washington caught up in this paroxysm of \nbusiness as usual. For the average Americans who thought they voted to \nget rid of gridlock in 1994, here they are with a kind of gridlock \nrevisiting them. And a lot of people are probably saying a pox on both \nof your houses, all of you.\n  Undoubtedly, tomorrow, a lot of people are going to be confused as \nthey see this definition of nonessential employees. All of a sudden the \nGovernment is going to shut down for a little while and nonessential \nemployees are going to be sent home. I would not blame most Americans \nfor sitting at home and saying, ``What is this? They are nonessential \nemployees. The Government is going to function adequately for a few \ndays--what are we doing with these people who are nonessential \nemployees every other day of the year?'' So a whole lot of further \nconfusion sets in by virtue of this absolutely predictable moment.\n  Why is this happening? As the Senator from California pointed out, it \nis happening because our friends on the other side of the aisle have \nhad a responsibility to pass 13 appropriations bills. Last year, under \nthe Democratic leadership, we passed those bills. We sent them to the \nPresident on time. Now only five of those bills have been passed, so we \nneed to have what is called a continuing resolution, a temporarily \nspending measure, because they have not done their work.\n  Instead of just coming before the Senate and saying, give us a clean, \ntemporary spending measure--what ``clean'' means is just pass a \ntemporary spending measure; give us 2 more weeks to do our work. That \nis essentially what it means. We have not done our homework. So you go \nto the teacher and say, ``I need another 2 weeks.''\n  But, instead of just getting another 2 weeks to do the homework, they \nhave brought back other conditions and attached conditions to the \ntemporary extension that they simply could not get passed any other \nway.\n  They have had a regulatory relief bill here which the Senator from \nKansas has introduced, which the Senate refuses to pass. The Senate \nrefuses to pass it because it wants to attack things like letting \ncitizens know, in their communities, what kind of toxic chemicals are \nreleased in their communities.\n  It is just a voluntary knowledge issue. Should Americans know that a \nchemical company in the town in which our good citizens live is \nemitting X, Y, or Z toxics into the sky? It is a very simple issue. It \nis totally voluntary. Once people have learned that they are emitting \nthis, it does not forbid the emissions. It does not punish anybody. It \njust lets people know what they are breathing. Our friends want to do \naway with that. We have not allowed them to do away with that because \nwe think it is important for Americans to know what they are \n\n[[Page S 16994]]\nbreathing, and what a chemical company might be putting into the sky. \nThey do not.\n  Since they could not pass it in the normal course of business in the \nU.S. Senate, they have attached that kind of measure to the temporary \ndebt ceiling, to the continuing resolution. The result is we are not \ngoing to let them pass it. The President says, no. I am not going to \nhave legislative blackmail. I am not going to have a gun held to my \nhead which holds hostage the default of the United States of America to \nan agenda that cannot be passed otherwise.\n  That is part of what is at stake here, Mr. President. It is only part \nof what is at stake here.\n  The other part of what is at stake here is a great difference that is \nnow seeking definition in the debate in this country about what our \npriorities are as a Nation. I listened today. And I listened to the \nSpeaker of the House. I listened to the majority leader. They stood up \nin front of the country, and they said, ``We want to balance the \nbudget. They do not.'' I heard people say we want to just get the \nfiscal condition of this country under control, and they just want to \nspend money. That is not what this debate is about. That is not an \naccurate framing of what is at stake for this country. The issue is not \nwhether or not we want to balance the budget. The issue is not whether \nor not we want to get control of the fiscal mess which no Republican \nPresident in the last 12 years vetoed. The issue is how are we going to \nbalance the budget? Are we going to keep faith with the fundamental \nnotion of fairness in America, or are we going to trample on every \nnotion of fairness which has been part of the debate in this country \nsince we were founded?\n  Is it fair to cut the money that provides summer jobs for kids who \nsee no opportunity in their lives? Is it fair to ask senior citizens to \npay a double amount in their premiums even though they are on a fixed \nincome while you give a tax break to people earning more than $300,000 \na year?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DODD. I want to commend my colleague from Massachusetts. I hope \npeople are paying attention to what he is saying. It might be \nworthwhile if our colleague would share with us the very notion. People \nhear the words ``continuing resolution'' and ``debt ceiling.''\n  As I understand it, Mr. President, the continuing resolution means \nthat the Government is allowed to continue operating despite the fact \nthat the Congress has not completed its business on the normal \nappropriations bills. As I understand it, we have completed work on 4 \nof the 13 appropriations bills--9 have not been completed--and that \nbecause the Congress has not completed its work on that we have a \ncontinuing resolution.\n  Am I not correct? I ask my colleague, if that is not the case?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Senator from Connecticut is absolutely \ncorrect. The continuing resolution is simply an extension of the budget \nthat takes place because the budget has not been done by the people who \nare responsible for doing the budget.\n  Mr. DODD. I further ask my colleague. I understand that a minute ago \nhe said this. Maybe people are not aware of this. Is my colleague \nsuggesting that there are substantive pieces of legislation outside of \nthe budget considerations that are being attached to a continuing \nresolution merely to allow the Government to operate until we complete \nour business? For instance, in the area of regulatory reform, is that \nbeing put on this kind of a bill?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Senator from Connecticut is absolutely \ncorrect. I think it is an essential component of what people in America \nneed to understand; that while the dilemma is simply extending the \nbudget because the homework has not been done--and I repeat in direct \ncontrast to what happened last year under the Democratic leadership \nwhere all 13 appropriations bills were completed on time--the \nRepublicans who were supposed to bring a revolution to the U.S. Senate \nand to Washington have failed to complete the work on the vast majority \nof these appropriations bills. Now the issue before the American people \nis how do you have a budget since they failed to do this work, and how \ndo you continue to keep the Government moving for a short period of \ntime?\n  But instead of just passing a short-term continuation of the budget, \nwhat they have purposely done is added to these measures a list of \nitems that they know are calculated to punch hot buttons, and \ncalculated to serve political purposes for campaigns at home so they \ncan come in and say, ``Look. We tried to get this. But the President \nwill not give it to us.''\n  Those items are items which could not pass here independently, and \nthey effectively result in a kind of legislative political blackmail. \nThey hold the gun to the head of the President. They hold a gun to the \ncountry, and they say to the country, we cannot get our way any other \nway. So we are going to get our way by pushing the country to the brink \nof default for the first time in American history, and tell the \nPresident of the United States he either gives us our way or the \ncountry be damned.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KERRY. I want to finish the colloquy with the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I have been handed a one-page piece of paper that has just \nthe following words:\n\n       Section 106(c) of Public Law 104-31 is amended by striking \n     ``November 13th, 1995'' and inserting ``December 1, 1995.''\n\n  I am told that simple language would allow for the Government not to \nbe shut down--no other bills, no other ideas, no other failed pieces of \nlegislation--that simple clause would avoid the shutdown of the Federal \nGovernment of the United States if we would just adopt that simple \nlanguage for a week or two to allow us to go about the business of \nnegotiating all these other extraneous matters. The mere adoption of \nthat one sentence would avoid this kind of train wreck that we are \ngoing to see later on this evening.\n  I ask my colleague from Massachusetts. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. KERRY. The Senator from Connecticut has hit the nail on the head. \nThat is all it takes. It is very, very simple.\n  I might add, Mr. President, that if you want to add insult to injury \nfor the American people, it is my understanding that the Republicans \nhave agreed that nobody is going to forfeit any pay. So not only are we \ngoing to shut it down temporarily, but everybody is going to go home \nand are all going to get paid to sit at home.\n  What kind of a revolution is that? I mean this is the most \nextraordinary fakery I have ever heard in my life. We are going to shut \ndown the Government but we are not going to shut down the Government. \nPeople are still going to get paid, in effect.\n  This is going to cost the American people more money, and the farce \nof it is the revolution is paying people not to do their jobs. Boy, \nthat is a heck of a change in Washington, DC.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. KERRY. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am pleased to hear this discussion tonight because the \nNation is very confused. They hear all of this argument, and they do \nnot realize that the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from \nMassachusetts just pointed out that with one sentence that we could \nmove on and fight our battle on the budget, which is very legitimate. \nAfter all, we are going to see people on Medicare essentially lose at \nleast half of their Social Security COLA as a result of this increase \nin their premiums.\n  But the question I have for my friend from Massachusetts is this: As \nI understand it, in this debt limit bill--I say to my friend--included \nin it is the House regulatory reform language. And the reason I want to \nask my friend a question is this: He has been the leader in the Senate \nin trying to bring to the Senate a regulatory reform bill that makes \nsense, not one that guts the environment, not one that guts health and \nsafety. As I understand it, the House version of regulatory reform is \nincluded in this debt ceiling.\n  I would like him to address for me and for others what this really \nmeans if this were to become the law and to discuss with us why on \nEarth he thinks the Republicans would have put a regulatory reform bill \nthat deals nothing \n\n[[Page S 16995]]\nwith the debt on a debt ceiling increase. I would ask that question of \nmy friend.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would be delighted to say a few words \nabout that for my colleague from California.\n  The regulatory reform bill presents the most radical, overreaching \neffort to undo 25 years of environmental protection for the people of \nthis country.\n  The regulatory reform bill that is attached to the debt limit will \nundo the protection of our citizens for the inspection of food for the \npotential of carcinogens in that food. To everybody who has read about \nE. coli poisoning, the incidents of people who have died or gotten \nseriously ill as a consequence of the lack of inspection, that will now \nbe liberated. That will occur as a consequence of this.\n  I just share a list here. This is a long, rolling list. These are the \n88 different openings for people to stop the process of putting out \nlegitimate regulations within the Environmental Protection Agency. This \nlist, which could not pass the Senate, has been attached to the debt \nlimit.\n  Mr. NICKLES. We are not on debt limit.\n  Mr. KERRY. No, but it is attached to it. It is attached to it. What \nwe are talking about here is whether or not the President of the United \nStates is going to have this kind of gun held to his head or not.\n  Just take the continuing resolution. They have restrictions on \nFederal grants, lobbying to public interest groups; they have Medicare \npart B premium increases, abolition of certain agencies. These are not \nitems that ought to be on what the Senator from Connecticut has \nadequately pointed out ought to be very simply an extension of the \ncontinuing resolution.\n  Mr. President, I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nare going to say, look, we have been here for years, and we have never \nbalanced the budget. That is correct. Some of us tried. We tried with \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings. We tried with other efforts. We finally have \ncome to an agreement that this year we are going to try to do it. The \nquestion is how are we going to do it, not whether we are going to do \nit.\n  So when anybody hears our colleagues come to the floor and say the \nDemocrats do not want to balance the budget, I hope America will say, \n``Wrong; not true.'' We voted, 39 of us, for a 7-year balanced budget \non this side of the aisle. The difference is we did not do it by making \nit more expensive for kids to go to college. We did not do it by \ncutting out the volunteer corps of America, AmeriCorps. We did not do \nit by cutting student capacity to have summer jobs. We did not do it by \ntaking hot lunches away from kids. We did not do it by raiding the \npension funds of this country. We did not do it by denying the people \nat the lowest scale of income the earned-income tax credit, the ability \nto be able to work out of poverty.\n  Do you know how we did it? We did it by not giving to people this \nextraordinary $245 billion tax break, most of which is unexplainable in \nthe face of this kind of a deficit.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. I would be happy to yield, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DODD. I just wanted to ask----\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DODD. My colleague, did I understand him to say that we have an \nincrease in premiums for Medicare in this continuing resolution? We are \ngoing to have Medicare put on a continuing resolution and not save that \ndebate for the kind of attention it deserves with 37 million Americans \ndepending upon Medicare? That is wrapped up in the continuing \nresolution?\n  Mr. KERRY. The Senator from Connecticut is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. DODD. Can my colleague from Massachusetts explain, what is the \nwisdom of taking a simple extension of the continuing resolution and \nincorporating a critically important program to millions of Americans \nand their families in something like the continuing resolution? Why not \nleave that for the broader debate? Is there some rationale that my \ncolleague from Massachusetts, Mr. President, is aware of as to why we \nwould have an increase in premium costs in Medicare put on something \nlike this?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would say to my friend, there is \ncertainly no legitimate or fair rationale. I can certainly explain to \nmy colleague a political and craven rationale but not one that I think \nwould meet the test and standard of fairness.\n  Now, I know that the acting majority leader wanted to ask a question. \nI would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I understood when the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts started speaking he indicated he would speak until \nwe were ready to dispense with the other issues pending, and we have \ngotten an agreement on that and I am ready to ask for that consent when \nhe completes his statement.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Senator from Mississippi knows how to \nsilence the Senator from Massachusetts. If we can get consent on this, \nthe Senator from Massachusetts would be delighted to terminate his \ncolloquy. So I would be happy to move to that consent if we can.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/13/senate-section/article/S16993-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--HOUSE MESSAGE ON H.R. 927\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

I just want to comment briefly, if I could, and I \nappreciate the acting majority leaders's willingness to lay this matter \naside.\n  Let me say to my colleagues, I understand normally appointing \nconferees is a relatively routine matter. While I have underlying \nobjection to the bill, I was in the minority. The bill did pass. The \nSenator from Mississippi is absolutely correct; it passed with a pretty \ngood margin.\n  However, I point out to my colleagues that the principal author of \nthis legislation is also holding up 18 nominees to serve as Ambassadors \nfor this country, every single treaty including START II as well as the \nchemical weapons treaty. Frankly, moving this kind of bill to the \nforefront while every other major piece of legislation on the Foreign \nRelations Committee is held hostage because of one other piece of \nlegislation he is interested in, I say, with all due respect, this \nlegislation does not have the kind of urgency to it that the absence of \na United States representative in the People's Republic of China, in \nIndonesia, I think warrants.\n  So I have objected to this in the hopes that these holds that have \nnow gone for weeks--I would normally not \n\n[[Page S 16996]]\nengage in this kind of legislative maneuver, a procedural maneuver, but \nit has not been a question of days, it has been weeks--weeks have gone \nby despite the confirmation hearings in the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. Hearings on these treaties, all of these matters are being \nheld up, all of them, just so the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee can have a bill that he cares about be resolved to his \nliking.\n  So, with all due respect, I am going to hold up this bill until those \nmatters are resolved. Now, cloture motions can be filed, and I can be \nbeaten on this. But frankly, my patience has run out on this. The fact \nof the matter is our country's interests are not being well served by \nnot having a U.S. representative. Vote against these nominees if you \nwant to. Vote against these treaties if you want to. But do not deny \nthese people the opportunity for a hearing. First of all, it is not \nfair to their families. They have been confirmed by the committee, \nawaiting action here on the floor of the Senate, and yet weeks go by.\n  Some of these people are career people who have dedicated their lives \nto the foreign service of this country. They have been sent out by \ncommittee and are waiting in limbo. Weeks have gone by. That is just \nwrong. Vote against them, if you will, but do not deny them the \nopportunity of being voted up or down in the U.S. Senate. So I will \nstrenuously object to our naming conferees and moving forward on this \nbill.\n  I might also point out, as I mentioned earlier, we have some eight or \nnine appropriations bills--the Senator from Massachusetts has pointed \nout a regulatory reform bill--all of these things, welfare reform, \nMedicare, Medicaid, all of which I would argue have a far greater \nimportance than this bill, the so-called Cuban democracy bill, that \nfrankly is of highly questionable merit, in my view, taking priority \nover everything else.\n  So, for those reasons, I partook of the procedural vehicles available \nto me to slow down the naming of conferees. If there is a lift on the \nhold on these ambassadors and a lift on the hold on the treaties, I \nwill lift my hold on the conferees going forward on this particular \nbill that is before us. For those reasons, Mr. President, I have \nobjected.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me commend the distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut for a statement that I think enjoys broad-based, in \nfact unanimous, support on this side of the aisle. This has gone on too \nlong. There is absolutely no reason why ambassadors representing the \nforeign policy of this country ought not be appointed. I think you have \nto go back decades, if not generations, to find a time when this many \nambassadors were held hostage.\n  I think it is unfortunate, it is wrong, it is not the way to do \nbusiness. It sends exactly the wrong message, not to mention what an \nincredible inconvenience it is to people in the Foreign Service who are \ndepending upon some resolution of these matters. So, whether it is the \nambassadors or whether it is a number of other Federal agencies that \nhave to be dealt with in a reasonable way, this has gone on too long. \nAnd until we resolve those matters, I think it is fair to say that it \nwill be very difficult to resolve some of the legislation relating to \nforeign policy pending in the Senate.\n  I am very hopeful that we can resolve these matters in the not-too-\ndistant future because what is happening today is inexcusable. I think \nthe Senator from Connecticut speaks for all members of the Democratic \nCaucus in articulating very clearly our strong feelings about this \nmatter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/13/senate-section/article/S16995-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16996-S16999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me also commend the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts as well as the Senator from Connecticut for their \ncomments on the matter directly pertaining to our schedule tonight and \nthe next couple of days. I think there is some misunderstanding about \nwhat is involved with both the continuing resolution and the debt \nlimit. I think it is very important that everybody clearly understand \nwhat the circumstances are tonight.\n  Tonight the continuing resolution, which the President will veto, \nincludes the lowest funding level of either the House or the Senate. No \nprograms were zeroed out, but the floor is now set at 60 percent of the \n1995 level. Funding would be approved through December 1. The funding \nlevels are an issue of concern to a number of us. But the most \nimportant concern, and the one that I think has drawn the greatest \ndegree of anxiety across this country, and certainly the issue for \nwhich the President has said there is no compromise, is the increase in \nthe premium that senior citizens will pay as a result of mistakes that \nwe made in prior years in setting that premium.\n  I think everybody needs to understand that. We made a mistake several \nyears ago. Instead of setting the premium at 25 percent and locking \nthat percentage in for part B Medicare recipients, stipulated a dollar \namount that we believed to represent a 25 percent payment. In doing so, \nwe overestimated the amount it would take to reach 25 percent. As a \nresult, the real calculation was not 25 percent; it was 31.5 percent.\n  We realized it. We all concluded, I think virtually unanimously, \nseveral years ago when this issue came up that it ought not be 31.5 \npercent; it ought to be 25 percent. We locked it into law. We set a \ntimeframe within which that should happen. And now as a result of a \nrealization that they need additional revenue for a lot of other \nreasons, including this tax cut, our Republican colleagues are \nsuggesting that we legalize the glitch indefinitely.\n  That is the issue. Should we lock in an amount higher than we \nanticipated or intended, an amount we accidentally locked in several \nyears ago, just to come up with revenue necessary to do what the \nRepublican agenda has dictated? Should we effectively increase that \npremium to provide the pool of resources that they need for tax breaks \nfor the wealthy?\n  Mr. President, what the President has said is, that is not \nnegotiable. That Medicare premium increase is not something that \nbelongs in the continuing resolution. That is something that has to be \ntaken out. We can negotiate funding levels, and we can negotiate other \nmatters with regard to how the continuing resolution ought to be \ndrafted, but there ought not be any misunderstanding with regard to the \nimportance of Medicare premiums. That ought to be off the table. That \nought not to be in the continuing resolution. And that is where we are.\n  Mr. DODD. Would my distinguished Democratic leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I have been asking this question for the last couple of \nhours, Mr. President. Maybe the Democratic leader can enlighten me. I \ndo not understand for the life of me why we are attacking Medicare \npremiums in a continuing resolution.\n  Is there some reason why Medicare is being incorporated in a \ntemporary extension of the continuing resolution? Why are we taking \nsomething so critically important to millions of Americans, not only to \nthe direct recipients, but their families who depend upon this, to \navoid the kind of cataclysmic crisis that can affect them if they are \nafflicted with some serious illness? Why are we taking that as a \nsubject, which I think requires serious study and analysis before we \nmake changes in that program, why is that being incorporated by the \nRepublicans in a continuing resolution? What is the value and purpose \nof putting it here?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Well, I will respond to the distinguished Senator, I do \nnot know what the answer is. I have to assume that they believe \nincreasing premiums is more important than running the Government, is \nmore important than getting a continuing resolution, is more important \nthan any other priority out there. It is the most important issue for \nthem today. Raising those premiums has the priority that no other issue \nhas as we consider all of the other complexities involved in this \ndebate.\n  What is even more important to me is what this action says to the \nAmerican people in general and American seniors in particular. It says \nthat we are going to ask seniors to pay more \n\n[[Page S 16997]]\nbefore we ask doctors to take less. We are going to ask seniors to pay \nmore before we ask anybody else involved in Medicare, who may be \nbeneficiaries in other ways, to give some, to sacrifice as well. That, \nto me, is the fundamental inequality here that is the most \ndisheartening thing. We are asking seniors--many of whom can ill-afford \nit--to sacrifice before we have asked anybody else to contribute, \nbefore we have even come to any conclusions about what may be involved \nin the overall Medicare reform effort that many of us would like to see \nat some point this year.\n  We realize we have to change Medicare. We realize that the trust fund \nhas to be made solvent. We also realize this Medicare increase in a \nshort-term, stop-gap funding bill has absolutely nothing to do with the \ntrust fund. Now, not one dollar of this premium increase goes to the \ntrust fund--nothing. It all goes to deficit reduction or to the tax \ncut, one or the other, most likely to the tax breaks. So that is really \nthe issue here. We are holding hostage senior citizens asking them to \ndo something no one else is required to do. And so it is \nunderstandable, it seems to me, that the President is resolute in his \ndetermination to veto the continuing resolution as long as that is in \nthe bill.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the Senator from Nevada and then to the \nSenator from California.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the leader yielding. I say \nthrough the Chair to my friend from Connecticut, this Senator believes \nthat the reason the premium is being maintained is to fuel money for \nthe tax cut, the tax breaks. What other reason could there be that \nthere is this clamor to raise all this money on a document, a piece of \nlegislation, that it is untoward this would happen at a time when the \ncountry is about to shut down that they would hold so tight to this? It \nis my belief that it is to fuel the tax cuts, the tax breaks.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague----\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I retain the floor, and I will be happy to yield to the \nSenator from Connecticut to respond, and then I will yield to the \nSenator from California.\n  Mr. DODD. I raised the issue earlier. As I understand it, in this \ncontinuing resolution, so we avoid the shutdown that will occur in a \nfew hours, there is a simple one-sentence provision that would strike \n``November 13'' and put in ``December 1,'' which would avoid shutting \ndown the Federal Government tonight, as I understand it.\n  What we have now sent down to the President is some 15 or 16 pages, \nall getting involved in Medicare language, all of this language, \nextraneous language.\n  What my colleague from Nevada is saying is if they do not include an \nincreased cost in Medicare to the beneficiaries out there, then this \ntax break that goes to the top income earners in America would be in \ntrouble; is that the point?\n  Mr. REID. That was the point I was making to my friend from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I find that incredible. I ask the distinguished Democratic \nleader, with all the other things going on, what is the logic of saying \nwe are going to take care of those in the upper-income levels with tax \nbreaks at the cost of those who, as I understand it and he can correct \nme if I am wrong, but the median income of a Medicare recipient in \nAmerica is $17,000, unless you are a woman on Medicare and then your \nmedian income is $8,500 a year, that the premiums of those people are \ngoing to go up if this becomes law in order to provide a tax break for \npeople who have six-figure incomes. What is the logic in all of that, I \nask the Democratic leader?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I tell the Senator from Connecticut, I do not know what \nthe logic is. The numbers the Senator from Connecticut referred to are \naccurate. The fact is that a vast majority of senior citizens today \nmake less than $17,000. In South Dakota, and in many rural States, they \nmake less than $15,000. This $11 increase per month is more than many \nof them today have available for some of the fundamental needs they \nface each and every year. Their choice, in some cases, is whether they \nhave prescription drugs, whether they pay a heating bill, whether they \nare able to go into town, or whether they are able to buy groceries. \nAll that is affected by whether or not this goes into law tonight or \ntomorrow or the next day.\n  So the Senator from Connecticut is absolutely right. This is not an \neasy choice for many people out there who may be watching and wondering \nwhat is this all about. But that is what this fight is all about, \nprotecting what limited purchasing power they have, recognizing a \ncommitment we made 2 years ago that we would correct the inadvertent \nmistake we made in the Medicare law in the first place. That is what \nthis is about.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I just want to thank the Democratic leader \nfor coming over to the floor, because I believe that the people of \nAmerica want answers to these questions that he is raising, I say to my \nfriend, and the Senator from Connecticut, the Senator from Nevada and \nothers, the Senator from Massachusetts--both Senators from \nMassachusetts who were involved in this.\n  I say to my friend that 83 percent of those on Social Security earn \nless than $25,000 a year--83 percent. So we are talking about something \nbeing slipped into a continuing resolution which is extraneous to that \ncontinuing resolution, has nothing to do with whether this Government \ncan function, and the reason the Republicans are doing it is they do \nnot have the guts to vote up or down on it.\n  The fact of the matter is, they want to force the President of the \nUnited States into signing this thing, and he will not do it, and God \nbless him for that, because he is standing up for our grandmothers and \nour grandfathers.\n  I have a couple of questions for my leader. The symmetry of these \ncuts in Medicare and these tax breaks for the wealthiest cannot be \noverlooked, as brought out by my friend from Nevada, and it can, in \nfact, be the only answer: $270 billion in cuts in Medicare and $245 \nbillion in tax breaks. If you earn over $350,000, I say to my leader, \nyou get back $5,600 a year.\n  But I would like to address my leader's attention to this chart, \nbecause I think it is important that the people understand we are \nreally talking about Social Security here, not just Medicare, because \nwhat happens is, this is a time for seniors on Social Security to get \ntheir cost-of-living adjustment and their Medicare premium comes out of \ntheir Social Security cost-of-living adjustment.\n  If the Republicans have their way, and if they slip this Medicare \npremium increase through--and I know that the President will not stand \nfor it--but if they do, I ask the leader to explain this chart because \nwhat we see here is that the poorest seniors would wind up losing 98 \npercent of their COLA on Social Security. The seniors who average \n$7,000 a year would lose 66 percent of their Social Security COLA, and \nthe wealthiest would lose 52 percent. I say wealthiest, that is over \n$10,000 a year.\n  So you can see here the devastation that is being wrought. In other \nwords, the seniors look forward to their cost-of-living adjustment \nbecause their food bills go up, their cleaning bills go up, and now it \nis being eaten by the Republican increase in the Medicare premium.\n  So I just ask my leader to comment on this connection because \nRepublicans are always saying, ``Well, we don't touch Social \nSecurity,'' but the bottom line is, they would do so.\n  I also ask my leader to comment on why he believes they would put in \nextraneous materials into these bills that repeal 25 years of \nenvironmental law, why they would do it this way, why they would bring \nin criminal law reform on this, because I think people are confused. \nThey understand that, as Senator Dodd has pointed out, one sentence can \ntake care of the short-term problem, and then we will have the fight.\n  So I ask my leader to comment on the impact of Social Security \nrecipients of this stealth increase in premium, plus the whole notion \nof adding these extraneous matters to what should be a very \nstraightforward continuing resolution and debt increase.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from California makes two very good points. \nObviously, the increases that we are talking about here would have a \ndevastating impact. I was home in South \n\n[[Page S 16998]]\nDakota this last weekend. I wish I could tell the Senator from \nCalifornia precisely how many people I had the opportunity to talk to \nabout this very matter. But time and time again, people on the street, \nin meetings, at dinner, in restaurants would come up to me and say, \n``It is so important that you win this fight. It is so important that \nyou not let happen what we are told could happen if the President or if \nthe Democrats in Congress lose their resolve.''\n  This has nothing to do with cutting growth. What this is cutting is \nseniors' wallets, the opportunity for senior citizens to live in some \ndignity. This is telling senior citizens that the commitment we made to \nthem is over, that somehow they are going to have to give, even though \nno one else involved in Medicare gives at all.\n  We have $17 or $18 billion in fraud and abuse out there, according to \nthe General Accounting Office. We are not going after $1 of fraud and \nabuse, yet we are telling seniors that they have to pay increases in \ntheir part B premiums and that they will provide the sole source of \nrevenue increases for whatever reason? It is outrageous to make that \nkind of a statement.\n  Never mind the commitment. Never mind the impact that it might have \non seniors. The very thought that seniors are the only ones being asked \nto give tonight, to me, is inexcusable and just flat wrong.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield? I remember when the Republicans \nwith great fanfare said, ``We are going to save Medicare.''\n  Well, we all knew what it was about. They needed to find the money \nfor the tax cut, so they dreamed up this number of $270 billion. Even \nthough the Democratic leader and those of us who worked on it knows it \ntakes $89 billion to save Medicare, they are going to go after it to \nthe tune of $270 billion.\n  One of the things they said which I really could not disagree with \nwas, ``And this time we will go after the very wealthy seniors who are \non Medicare and ask them to pay just a little bit more.''\n  I say to my leader, after we have seen their proposal, is there \nanything in this continuing resolution where they have laid on this \nincrease in premiums to seniors that differentiates between those who \nearn under $5,000 or those who earn over $100,000? Do they have a \nsliding scale?\n  Or are they asking seniors, many of whom, as my friend has pointed \nout, have to choose, literally, between eating and buying a \npharmaceutical product to keep them alive--is there anything in this \nRepublican plan that makes that distinction between the poorest senior \nand the wealthiest senior?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. There is no distinction at all, I say to the Senator \nfrom California. That, really, is another part of the inequity here.\n  The Senator asked why would we do this on a continuing resolution? I \nthink one of the reasons they are proposing we do it on a continuing \nresolution is that they hope that by holding a gun to the head of the \nPresident, the President is going to cave, the President will give up \nhis resolve and say, ``If that is what it takes to have a continuing \nresolution, we will do it.''\n  Mr. President, the President has made it very clear that it does not \nmatter what form a continuing resolution may take. If it comes to him \nwith this extraneous and unfair provision in it, it will be vetoed. \nThere is no question he will veto any version of a continuing \nresolution that incorporates the Medicare provision in it. It does not \nmatter. This Republican strategy is not working. They can use as many \nprops and news conferences as they want, golf clubs and waffles--which, \nin my view, are extraordinarily sophormoric and unfortunate. That \nbelittles the congressional process. It demeans this debate. It has \nnothing to do with the serious, serious, consequences of what it is we \nare talking about here. And it will not change the outcome.\n  I hope that our House colleagues and the Republican leadership will \nunderstand how unfortunate it is that they would demean this debate in \nthe way that they have over the last weekend. There is no place for \nthat kind of sophormoric and childish behavior on national television.\n  That happened. It is unfortunate it happened. I hope we can raise the \nlevel of debate and take into account the gravity and the seriousness \nof situations that we are discussing here tonight. That really is \nsomething that I think all Americans--Republican and Democrat--can \nagree to. We should raise the level of debate and not use these silly \nprops, thinking that is somehow making a point. It is not making a \npoint.\n  The point is we have to get back to the real issue here. The real \nissue is we can pass a continuing resolution tonight. We have a few \nhours left. Do it before it is too late. Pass a clean CR. Leave this \nMedicare debate for another time. Do not ask seniors to do something \nyou are not asking anybody else to.\n  If we can do that, we can go home tonight. Federal workers can come \ntomorrow and this issue would be resolved.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. There is something I would like to inquire of the \nDemocratic leader because he made a passing reference to it. There may \nbe those saying tonight we have to deal with entitlements. We have to \ndeal with Medicare. We have to deal with Medicaid. I do not think \nanyone here is suggesting that is not a legitimate point.\n  The point is this: We are dealing with a 30-year old program that \ntook people in poverty in this country--between 35 percent and 40 \npercent of people over the age of 65 were living in poverty in 1960 in \nthis country; only 45 percent of them had any health insurance at all. \nBecause of Medicare we have taken people out of poverty and given them, \nin their retiring years, a sense of dignity, not made them wealthy \npeople, not provided them with great affluence, but merely taken away \nthe legitimate fear that people have that an illness will come along \nand destroy life savings, make it difficult for their own children to \nbe able to raise their families and educate their kids without having \nto worry about a catastrophic illness, bankrupting two generations in a \nfamily.\n  That is why we have Medicare. That is why it has been so successful.\n  As I understand it, what is being proposed here will increase the \npremiums for these people on Medicare. Obviously, we need to deal with \nthe long-term health care security issues. Medicare is a legitimate \nsubject of debate. I hear the Democratic leader saying so.\n  The point is you do not try to muscle this through on a continuing \nresolution. I ask if that is not the point he is making? that, in fact, \nit ought to be, even if people do not understand all of the nuances of \nthe procedural debates, that the suspicions of average Americans ought \nto be raised when they see something as critical as Medicare coming \nalong and all of a sudden it is slipped into a provision like this, a \nmajor change, a major change in Medicare, slipped into a continuing \nresolution that would then lock into law a fundamental change in one of \nthe most critical programs affecting millions of Americans.\n  The issue is not should we debate this issue of how do we provide for \nlong-term health security, but slipping this matter into a continuing \nresolution that could be adopted with a one-sentence provision, \navoiding the shutdown of the Federal Government, literally thousands of \npeople in this Federal Government not knowing whether to show up for \nwork tomorrow, all because there is a fear about debating this issue in \nthe normal course of congressional business.\n  Is that not what the Democratic leader is suggesting?\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator consider one comment?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me respond to the Senator and then I am happy to \nyield without losing my right to the floor.\n  The Senator from Connecticut said it as clearly and succinctly as \nanyone has tonight. The issue is not, should we address real reform in \nMedicare? The issue is, is this the vehicle on which to do it? Is this \nthe night to do it? And, when we get to the proper vehicle, we must ask \nourselves, is this the right way to do it?\n  Do we hold all Federal employees hostage to a resolution of this \nfundamental question about whether we ought to change Medicare at all, \ntonight, under these circumstances?\n  The Senator would conclude, as I concluded, that this is not the \ntime, \n\n[[Page S 16999]]\nthis is not the place, this is not the forum, this is not the right \nway, this is not sending the right message to seniors. This provision \nought to be stricken.\n  That is what we are suggesting. I think the Senator is absolutely \ncorrect in his assumption as he proposes the question tonight. I am \nhappy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I just hope as my two colleagues are \ndiscussing an issue of Medicare, particularly the Senator from \nConnecticut, I find that you omitted any reference to the report of the \ntrustees, trustees appointed by the President of the United States, who \ncame back and clearly provided this body, the Congress, with a report \nsaying that Medicare is going broke and that something has to be done. \nI hope the Senator, as he addresses this issue, would include reference \nto that report.\n  I, myself, am still hopeful. I just had a brief meeting with the \nmajority leader. There are conscientious efforts underway to resolve \nthis impasse. I am privileged to represent a great many Federal \nemployees. I would like to see it resolved.\n  When I hear debate like this and no reference to that trustees' \nreport, I feel it is selective argument.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me retain the floor and say the answer to that \ncomment is very simple: The increase in premium that the majority has \nincluded in the continuing resolution does not solve the solvency \nproblem by one nickel. It has absolutely nothing to do with solvency. \nIt has nothing to do with the trust fund. It has nothing to do with the \nlong-term projections of the future of the trust fund. It has nothing \nto do with the trustees' report.\n  The trustees said we have to resolve the trust fund solvency issue \nand, toward that end, we have to find ways to save $89 billion. Nothing \nin part B changes or premium increases has anything to do with the \ntrust fund, which is in part A.\n  That is why both of us have expressed our grave concern about what we \nare doing here. Perhaps if the premium increase had something to do \nwith the trust fund, we could better understand--though I would still \nargue that this should be decided in the broader context of Medicare \nreform--the emergency need to include it in a continuing resolution. \nBut it does not. There is absolutely no connection.\n  That makes it all the more critical, it seems to us, to take some \ntime to consider whether or not it is fair to ask seniors to do \nsomething that we are not asking anybody else to do, to determine \nwhether or not even in the overall context of Medicare reform this has \na place. Certainly, I hope the Senator from Virginia would agree.\n  Just to finish, certainly the Senator from Virginia would agree that \nwithout hearings, without any full appreciation of what it is we are \ndoing here, to add it to the continuing resolution is not a prudent \nthing to do.\n  I yield again to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate the Senator's yielding.\n  My good friend from Virginia has raised the issue of the trustees' \nreport. The trustees' report from last year painted a darker picture \nthan this year, but I did not hear a single voice being raised about \nthe condition of the trust fund a year ago. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, we are now cutting $270 billion in the proposal out of the \nMedicare trust fund, as the distinguished Democratic leader has pointed \nout, Mr. President. No one can explain to anyone why that number was \nchosen, except in the context of the tax breaks of $245 billion. The \nonly way you can pay for them is that size of a cut in Medicaid. There \nis no relationship between the size of that cut and what the trustees \nreported were the proposals with Medicare. That is point No. 2.\n\n  Point No. 3 is the one the Democratic leader has made in the \ndiscussion here, that matter that is included in this resolution deals \nwith part B, which does not have anything to do with the trust fund \nwhatsoever. So it is totally unrelated.\n  The last point I would make is this one. Normally, here, when there \nis a matter of this import involving this many Americans and something \nas critical as their health care, you would think there might be a set \nof hearings where we, as Members of this body, would enjoy the benefit \nof people who spend every day working at these issues as to how we \nmight fix this problem.\n  There has not been a single day of hearings, not one, on this issue. \nWe have had 27 days of hearings on Whitewater. We had 11 days of \nhearings on Waco. We had 10 days of hearings on Ruby Ridge. And not 1 \nday, not a single day, not 1 hour, not 1 hour of hearings on Medicare.\n  Mr. President, for 37 million Americans, their safety net in health \ncare is being written into this piece of paper, passed without even the \nconsiderations of what the implications are for people. That is not the \nway to legislate. That is not the way to deal with a legitimate issue \nof how you bring some trust and some faith and some soundness to the \nMedicare trust funds.\n  So for those reasons some of us, as I said a moment ago, object to \nthis because, frankly, we are just writing this into this particular \nproposal. We are not really examining how to fix this issue.\n  As I said a moment ago, the debate is not whether or not we ought to \ndo something about the trust fund. The Democratic leader has spoken on \nnumerous occasions about the importance of doing that. We all \nunderstand that. But that is not what this proposal is. It is written \nin here primarily, as was pointed out earlier by the Senator from \nNevada, to provide the resources for a tax break.\n  Here we are, going to shut down the Federal Government in 3 or 4 \nhours, thousands of people are either going to lose pay or be sitting \nhome wondering what is going to happen tomorrow, and it comes down to \nthis issue: Whether or not you can muscle the President into signing a \ncontinuing resolution which goes right at the heart of senior citizens, \nwhen a simple resolution extending the continuing resolution for a week \nor two would avoid the problem altogether.\n  It is a backhanded way of dealing with a very serious, very \nlegitimate issue that must be dealt with in a more profound way than we \nare this evening. I thank the Democratic leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/13/senate-section/article/S16996-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16999-S17000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DISCUSSIONS ON THE PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO ISRAEL\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me add another point that I think is \nimportant. It has been discussed over the weekend again, and for the \nlife of me I cannot understand how this got started, but there has been \nsome discussion, led particularly by the Speaker of the House, that on \nthe trip to Israel last week the President did not come back to discuss \nany of these matters with leadership.\n  I must tell you, I was there. The minority leader of the House, Dick \nGephardt, was there. The majority leader was there, and the Speaker was \nthere. The Israeli Ambassador was there. So there are a number of \npeople who were there who can vouch for what I am about to tell you.\n  The fact is that, not once, not twice, but on a number of occasions \nthroughout that trip, both going and coming back, the President came \nback and expressed himself, talked with us, hoped we could work \nsomething out. We did not talk specifics, but we talked very \nspecifically about the desire to resolve these differences. Not only \ndid the President come back to talk to us, but on a number of occasions \nhis Chief of Staff, Leon Panetta, came back.\n  As I say, I do not know how this got started. But there ought to be \nno question, and we ought to put to rest once and for all this rumor, \nthis innuendo, this statement on the part of Republican leadership, \nespecially the Speaker, that the President did not express any interest \nin open discussion of this issue.\n  He was there with some frequency. He came back on a number of \noccasions. And, of course, it was the Speaker's prerogative to seek the \nPresident if he felt so strongly about the need to talk. He could have \ncome up. If he did not think it was enough, as many times as the \nPresident came back and as many times as his Chief of Staff came back--\nif that was not enough--he could have sought out the President. There \nwas no ``do not enter'' sign in the quarters. There was no statement, \n``you are not welcome up here.'' There was every opportunity for people \nto come, every opportunity to talk with \n\n[[Page S 17000]]\nthe President, every opportunity to express themselves to the Chief of \nStaff or to the President.\n  So I must say, again, it does a real disservice to this dialog and, \nreally, to a factual and honest accounting of what happened on that \ntrip. The President came back on a number of occasions, and I have yet \nto see anyone else dispute that fact.\n  I hope that the Speaker would admit that on a number of occasions he \nhad conversations directly relevant to the budget with the President of \nthe United States on the trip and coming back from Israel just last \nweek, in fact, a week ago tonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/13/senate-section/article/S16999-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17000-S17001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE DEBT LIMIT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I also want to address, while I have the \nfloor--I know the Senator from Virginia is seeking recognition--but we \nhave not had the opportunity yet tonight to talk briefly about the debt \nlimit, at least I have not. I know some of my colleagues have addressed \nthe matter.\n  The President, as you know, vetoed the debt limit bill this \nafternoon. He did so for good reason. Let there be no doubt, we need to \nincrease the debt limit. We recognize how critical it is that the \nGovernment of the United States not go into default.\n  Let me offer praise for the Secretary of the Treasury for all that he \nhas done to educate, to inform, to bring everyone to a better \nunderstanding of the ramifications of default, beginning Wednesday, if \nnothing is done. As I understand it, there is some hope now that we \nmight be able to have yet another auction to move us back yet perhaps \nanother 3 days. But while the Secretary of the Treasury and the \nadministration appear to be doing virtually everything they can to see \nthat this country does not default, our Republican colleagues, at that \nmoment when they should cooperate and find some way with which to \nresolve this crisis, have chosen to do just the opposite.\n  On what ought to be a very simple extension of the debt, our \nRepublican colleagues have added a complete elimination of all the \nopportunities the Treasury Secretary has to manage the debt, to use \nshort-term tools, to do what every single Treasury Secretary has been \nable to do for decades. They have sought to strip him of all those \nresponsibilities and opportunities for debt management at the very time \nhe needs them the most. Can you think of anything more irresponsible \nthan that? Anything?\n  It is just outrageous that, at the time when we ought to be pulling \ntogether with a full appreciation of the magnitude of the problems we \nmay face if we go in default, what do our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle do but say we are going to make it even harder. We are \ngoing to make it even more challenging, create even more problems.\n  And then, to add insult to injury, they add a provision that we have \ndebated on the floor many, many times regarding what ought to happen on \nappeals for death row inmates; whether or not we ought to have this \nlegal term ``habeas corpus'' modified in some way. What in the world \ndoes that have to do with dealing with the default this country may \nfind itself in as early as Wednesday?\n  How is it that anyone can rationalize, anyone can explain, anyone can \nfind any reason why habeas corpus belongs on an emergency debt limit \nbill?\n  And then we have had some healthy debates on the Senate floor now for \nmonths about regulatory reform. We have had some cloture votes, and in \nevery single case Democrats have said very simply: You give us \nregulatory reform that does not endanger the public health and safety \nof Americans, and we are with you. You are going to get a vote with \nmaybe 70, 80, 90 votes. But you offer regulatory reform that endangers \nthe health and safety of Americans, and we are not with you. That issue \nhas not been resolved. We have reached a stalemate until we resolve it, \nand there have been good-faith efforts on both sides to try to resolve \nit, good-faith efforts that are going on right now.\n  So what happens? Our Republican colleagues add the entire regulatory \nreform language, all of the comprehensive issues relating to the most \ndetailed threats to public health and safety and all the questions we \nhave debated for months now on the debt limit--on the debt limit--with \nno opportunity for debate and no opportunity for amendments. It is a \ntake-it-or-leave-it deal. It is accept this or accept default.\n  Mr. President, for the life of me, I do not understand. I cannot \ncontemplate what may have motivated our Republican colleagues to do \nthat on this bill.\n  I will yield to the Senator from Nevada in just a minute, but I want \nto add the last list. In addition to that, the agencies terminated in \nthis short-term legislation include the Interstate Commerce Commission, \nthe Rural Abandoned Mine Program, Land and Conservation Fund, \nPennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, the Advisory Commission on \nIntergovernmental Relations, the Administrative Conference of the \nUnited States--all of that added on top of everything else. Yet, they \nwould like to have the American people believe that this is an \nemergency, that somehow the President is not cooperating, that somehow \nall of this has to be done in the context of a continuing resolution, \nor the debt limit, or it is just not possible.\n  Mr. President, this is just not the way to legislate. This is not \nresponsible. We know better than this. In our heart of hearts, we know \nwe have to run the country, we have to govern, and we have to do the \nthings necessary to make this country work better. And this is not it.\n  So I hope at some point before midnight tonight we could come to our \nsenses, and at some point in the next 3 hours we could say, look, let \nus save these debates for later. Let us conclude that we are going to \nagree to disagree for as long as it takes to work out the larger \nissues. Let us admit that this strategy is not going to work, and say \nthat rather than shutting down the Government, rather than bringing \nthis country to a default, we are going to strip them all, we are going \nto send a clean resolution, we are going to send a clean debt limit, we \nare going to resolve these matters at another time, and we are going to \ndo the right thing.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Is there a 10-minute limit on statements by individual \nSenators?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. We are operating in morning \nbusiness.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think the distinguished minority leader has now used in \nexcess of his 10-minute allocation?\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Who retains the floor, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader has the floor. If he \nwishes to yield for an inquiry, he has that opportunity.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. Parliamentary inquiry: Are not Senators under a 10-minute \nrule?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is correct.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I did not think the parliamentary inquiry was in order \nif I did not yield time for such an inquiry. Is that not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator yielding for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am asking a question of the leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the leader. Is it not true that we have 13 different \nappropriations bills that should pass?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Nevada is correct. Thirteen \nappropriations bills, and only five have been passed so far.\n  Mr. REID. Is not it true that the President has signed only two of \nthose?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As I understand it, he has signed two and five have \npassed.\n  Mr. REID. Is it not true that we have been waiting for conferences to \nbe completed sometime in some instances for months?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct. I would add that in all the time \n\n\n[[Page S 17001]]\nwe have been under this budget process--since 1974 --this may be the \nlatest, if not one of the latest dates that Congress has gone prior to \nthe time it has completed its work.\n  Mr. REID. I also ask this question of the leader. Is it not true that \nwhen one of the elements of the Contract With America was sent to us \nfrom the House that we in the Senate acted upon that with an amendment \nand that the Senate adopted regulatory reform? In effect, what it said \nis, if there is a regulation promulgated to have a financial impact \nover $100 million, that there would be the ability for a legislative \nveto for 45 days, and the regulation would not become effective for 45 \ndays?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct. In fact, the Senator from Nevada \nwas the author of the legislation.\n  Mr. REID. Is it not true that if a regulation was promulgated for \nless than $100 million, it would become effective immediately but that \nwe would have the opportunity to in effect veto that within 45 days?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Nevada is exactly correct. His memory \nis perfect.\n  Mr. REID. Is it not true that amendment was offered by a Republican \nSenator, Senator Nickles, and this Senator, and passed by a vote of 100 \nto nothing?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Is it not true that took place approximately 5 months ago, \nand conferees have not been appointed as a result of inactivity of the \nmajority?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. So we in effect have tried to do regulatory reform, have we \nnot, in this body, and we passed comprehensive regulatory ``reform,'' \nin some people's minds, by a vote of 100 to nothing?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is absolutely correct. We passed a line-item \nveto, a legislative veto, and we passed a number of issues relating \ndirectly to changing the regulations under which Congress must operate, \nchanging the regulations under which we deal with States, and unfunded \nmandates. We have had a series of regulatory reform measures already \npassed, unfortunately many of which have not been passed into law as a \nresult of the Republican opposition.\n  Mr. REID. And, in fact, I say to my friend, is not it also true, I \nrepeat, that we have been waiting for conferees to be appointed on the \nregulatory reform that passed this body by 100 to nothing for 5 months?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is absolutely right. There has been no \nconsideration of legislation in conference because the conferees have \nnot been appointed.\n  Mr. REID. I also say to my friend in the form of a question, is it \nnot true that habeas corpus has been debated on this floor not for \nhours, not for weeks, but for months, if we add up time over the last 3 \nor 4 years?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct. We have had countless hearings \nand extraordinary debate on the Senate floor. We have had countless \namendments offered as alternatives to legislation that passed. This has \nbeen an issue that has been hotly debated for not only weeks and months \nbut for years now in prior Congresses.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the distinguished minority leader, is \nit not true also that habeas corpus reform is not a partisan issue? Is \nthat not true?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is correct. The Senator from Nevada is correct in \nstating that there are Democrats and Republicans on both sides of the \nissue.\n  Mr. REID. In fact, I say to my friend from South Dakota, is it not \ntrue that on occasions this Senator has joined my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle for habeas corpus reform?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would have to go back and check the record, but I will \ntake the Senator's word for it.\n  Mr. REID. I would ask if you can give this Senator, or the people of \nthis country, any reason why on extending the debt limit we would have \nhabeas corpus, regulatory reform, or termination of these agencies--\nsome of which I agree to--but should we not vote those up or down?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think the Senator makes a very good point. The answer \ncan be provided in one word. The word is ``coercion.'' This is the \nRepublican effort to coerce the President to sign legislation that \notherwise he would veto; to sign legislation that he philosophically \nfinds at fault; to sign legislation that many of us on this side of the \naisle are very uncomfortable with; to sign legislation that has not \nbeen resolved in the case of regulatory reform. It is to finish \nunfinished business that ought not be finished for good reason--because \nwe have not been able to resolve our differences.\n  So they are putting it in this language in the hope--and it is only a \nhope, because the President made it very clear today when he vetoed the \nbill, it is a false hope that somehow we can resolve these issues by \nloading up a bill as critical as it is, as the debt limit and the \ncontinuing resolution are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would like to remind the Senator \nfrom South Dakota that the 10 minutes allotted to him under morning \nbusiness has expired, and in fact you have controlled the floor for \nnearly an hour. It would take unanimous consent in order to continue.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Presiding Officer. I appreciate the \nindulgence of the Senator from Virginia. I know he wishes to speak. I \nwill regain the floor at a later time.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/13/senate-section/article/S17000-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RETIREMENT OF MAJ. GEN. JERRY C. HARRISON\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, Napoleon once said that ``An army \nmarches on its stomach.'' While Napoleon was commenting on the need of \nsoldiers to have secure and dependable supply lines, combat arms \npersonnel also require a multitude of other support services to ensure \nthey have the means to accomplish their missions.\n  In the U.S. Army, a service of 495,000 men and women, one thinks of \nbranches such as quartermaster, transportation, and finance when the \nrole of ``support'' is mentioned. One support element that is largely \nunknown outside of Washington, DC, but is critical to the success and \nreadiness of our soldiers, is the Army's Legislative Liaison Office. \nFor the past 3 years, Maj. Gen. Jerry Harrison has headed this office, \nwhich represents the Army's interests on Capitol Hill.\n  Jerry Harrison's 32-year Army career began with his schooling at the \nU.S. Military Academy, and has included some of the Army's key \npostings. His assignments brought him to many billets, both here and \nabroad, and include Germany, Korea, Washington, DC, and Vietnam, where \nhis efforts in defending a firebase earned him a decoration for valor. \nHis career assignments reflect a high level of professional competence \nand include valuable command time in some very visible positions, \nperhaps the most prestigious being his tour as commander, 2d Infantry \nDivision Artillery.\n  As a product of West Point, an institution respected worldwide for \nits high standards, General Harrison had instilled upon him the \nimportance of education, and throughout his career, he sought \nadditional civilian and military educational opportunities. A \ncommissioned officer in the field artillery, he graduated from the \nfield artillery basic and advanced courses; the infantry officer \nadvanced course; the Command and General Staff College; and earned a \nmaster's degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology. He also \nreturned to his alma mater to teach in the department of mechanics.\n  Mr. President, today's warrior is an individual who is educated, fit, \nadept at many different tasks, and a patriot. Gen. Jerry Harrison \ncertainly possesses these characteristics. As the chairman of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, I am pleased to offer him my \ncongratulations on a distinguished career, and I wish him good health \nand happiness in the years ahead.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to address the Senate in my \ncapacity as chairman of the Rules Committee.\n  Earlier today the Sergeant at Arms, the Secretary of the Senate, \ntogether with the acting staff director of the Rules Committee, \naddressed the various staff leaders of the Senators. But I wish to \nplace in the Record a memorandum prepared by Secretary of the \n\n[[Page S 17002]]\nSenate and the Sergeant at Arms, and once again remind all Senators, \ntheir staffs, and others that if this impasse is not resolved tonight, \nit will be a lapse in appropriations, and therefore it will be \nnecessary to shut down nonessential Senate operations effective at \nmidnight tonight.\n  In brief, the Secretary of the Senate, at the direction of the Rules \nCommittee, has advised all Members that they will be required to \ndetermine which of each Senator's staff are necessary in that Senator's \njudgment to support the Senate's legislative and other constitutional \nactivities.\n  Further, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record the memorandum of the Secretary of the Senate detailing \nwhich departments of the Secretary's office will remain open and those \nthat will be closed. Specifically, I would like to point out that the \nOffice of Public Records will by necessity be closed; also, to include \na memorandum of the Sergeant at Arms detailing departments and offices \nunder his jurisdiction, and kindly note that the Capitol and Senate \noffice buildings will be open but there will be no Capitol guide \nservice to facilitate our visitors. Members and staff should be advised \nthat all food and beverage services in the U.S. Capitol under the \njurisdiction of the Senate and in the Russell, Hart and Dirksen \nbuildings will be suspended until further notice.\n  Lastly, I wish to emphasize that although many functions will be \nsuspended, the U.S. Senate security will be at its full operational \nlevel.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                               Office of the Sergeant at Arms,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 13, 1995.\n     To: All Senate Offices.\n     From: Howard O. Greene, Jr., Sergeant at Arms\n     Re Sergeant at Arms services during anticipated furlough\n       In the likely event of a lapse in appropriations to the \n     Legislative Branch of the Federal Government, furloughs will \n     be implemented in certain areas of the Office of Sergeant at \n     Arms (SAA). Those service areas which directly support the \n     legislative and other Constitutional activities of the Senate \n     will be fully staffed.\n       Most SAA departments will be open during this period, \n     however, some departments will operate at reduced staffing \n     levels.\n       Listed below are SAA offices that will be closed during the \n     furlough period: Capitol Guide Service; Cabinet Shop; SAA \n     Procurement Office; SAA Counsel Office; Congressional Special \n     Services, (Exception: Interpreter will be on duty); Placement \n     Office; All Drivers; Beauty and Barber Shop; Elevator \n     Operators; Employee Assistance Program.\n       Partial Staff: Appointment Desk: Half staff.

Johnston.\n     Re potential lapse in appropriations.\n\n       At the direction of the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration, I am writing to share with you some guidance \n     on the furlough that will be required in the event of a lapse \n     in appropriations to the Legislative Branch of the Federal \n     Government. Each Member and each committee chairman will be \n     required to determine which of his or her staff members are \n     essential in the event of a lapse in appropriations.\n       If there is a lapse in appropriations, it will be necessary \n     to shut down non-essential Senate operations, effective at 12 \n     a.m. November 14, 1995. In that event, all non-essential \n     staff will be placed in a furlough status until \n     appropriations are made available.\n       Essential staff includes only those employees whose primary \n     job responsibilities are directly related to or in support of \n     legislative and other Constitutional activities. Any \n     disruption in the employment of essential employees would \n     render the Senate unable to exercise its powers as specified \n     in Article I of the Constitution of the United States.\n       For your information, attached is a list of the essential \n     personnel under the Secretary of the Senate, as prepared in \n     consultation with the Senate Chief Counsel for Employment and \n     the Senate Legal Counsel.

A bill to amend section 255 of the National Housing Act to \nextend the mortgage insurance program for home equity conversion \nmortgages, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n   the home equity conversion mortgage program extension act of 1995\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I introduce The Home Equity \nConversion Mortgage Act of 1995 and express my appreciation to Senators \nMack and Bryan for their cosponsorship of this important bill. This \nlegislation would provide a 5-year extension for a much needed Federal \nHousing Administration [FHA] mortgage insurance program which is of \ngreat benefit to elderly homeowners.\n  The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage [HECM] Insurance Demonstration \nProgram offers elderly homeowners the opportunity to borrow against the \nequity in their homes. This effective program is designed to assist our \nNation's elderly who have substantial equity in their property but have \nincomes too low to meet ordinary or extraordinary living expenses. A \nsenior citizen can receive cash through this reverse mortgage in the \nfollowing four ways: A lump sum; a lifetime guaranteed monthly payment; \na line of credit to be accessed by personal checks; or a combination of \nmonthly payment and line of credit options. These mortgages are \noriginated by FHA-approved lenders, insured by the FHA and purchased by \nthe secondary mortgage market. The HECM program represents an ideal \npublic/private partnership in which needy citizens are aided without \ncost to the Federal Government.\n  The HECM program allows our Nation's elderly to draw an income from \ntheir home investment. It offers seniors aged 62 and older the \nopportunity to support themselves without having to leave the homes \nthey love. Without this program, elderly homeowners with insufficient \nincomes might be forced to sell their homes and spend their golden \nyears elsewhere. Since the program's inception, over 14,000 loans have \nbeen closed or are pending. The median age of program participants is \n76 years old. Borrowers are generally low-income and dependent on \nSocial Security benefits.\n  The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Insurance Demonstration Program \nwas authorized by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987. \nThe Federal Housing Administration's authority to insure reverse \nmortgages lapsed on October 1 of this year. The legislation which I am \nintroducing today would reauthorize this successful program and allow \nit to continue for an additional 5 years, until September 30, 2000. In \naddition, it would broaden the definition to include one- to four-\nfamily homes in which the owner resides and expand insurance authority \nto cover 50,000 reverse mortgages.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1409\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask that the following article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal May 10, 1995]\n\n                New On-Line Casinos May Thwart U.S. Laws\n\n                        (By William M. Bulkeley)\n\n       Two companies are setting up on-line betting emporiums in \n     Caribbean countries to skirt U.S. laws that bar interstate \n     gambling from home.\n       The cyberspace casinos, which will be available on the \n     internet, won't have Paul Anka, scantily clad showgirls or \n     cigar smoke. But they will offer a chance to win or lose \n     money from the comfort of the bettor's own keyboard, using \n     credit cards or money predeposited with the house.\n       The Justice Department says cyberspace casinos are illegal. \n     But the companies' offshore venues may protect them. And \n     authorities will have a tough time detecting who's actually \n     betting because many other people will be playing the same \n     games for free.\n       Internet gambling could be immensely popular, ``If \n     regulatory obstacles were put aside, gambling would be huge \n     on the Internet,'' says Adam Schoenfeld, an analyst with \n     Jupiter Communications, a New York market researcher. Jason \n     Ader, an analyst with Smith Barney, says legalized on-line \n     betting could be a $10 billion-a-year industry.\n       Antigambling activists fear that addicted gamblers and \n     children using credit cards will bankrupt themselves from \n     their PCs. Rachel Volberg, president of Gemini Research. \n     Roaring Spring, Pa., who studies problem gambling, says the \n     young, affluent males who populate the Internet are people \n     ``we know from research are probably most likely to develop \n     difficulties related to gambling.''\n       Nonetheless, Warren B. Eugene, a 34-year-old Canadian, says \n     he will open the Internet Online Offshore Electronic Casino \n     this month using computers in the tax haven of the Turks and \n     Caicos islands, Mr. Eugene, who says his business experience \n     is in video games, already has a page on the Internet's World \n     Wide Web where bettors can play blackjack with play money. \n     ``This can be a trillion-dollar world-wide business,'' he \n     says.\n       Mr. Eugene predicts there will someday be a virtual Strip \n     with dozens of different casinos offering different games, \n     different odds and varying amenities such as direct deposit \n     of winnings in offshore accounts and the acceptance of \n     virtual checks. He's offering to sell the casino software he \n     has developed to other would-be gambling tycoons for $250,000 \n     and a 15% cut of the profits.\n       Meanwhile, Kerry Rogers, a 38-year-old Las Vegas computer \n     expert, is working on WagerNet, a sports betting service that \n     plans to locate its computers in Belize. WagerNet is awaiting \n     enabling legislation there, but Mr. Rogers is optimistic. \n     ``This is a way for a country to make revenues off of \n     gambling,'' he says. Imagine the millions of dollars bet \n     world-wide on the WorldCup'' in soccer.\n       WagerNet is designed as a kind of gambler's Nasdaq, \n     matching people who bet on sporting events rather than \n     setting a line and taking bets. A bettor, who must deposit \n     $1,000, will put a proposition on the computer, and other \n     bettors can take the bet if they want. WagerNet will charge a \n     2.5% transaction fee (far less than the 10% vigorish that Mr. \n     Rogers says current sports books get), and it may bar U.S. \n     gamblers if the legal risk is too great.\n       The planned betting parlors face huge obstacles in gaining \n     consumer confidence. After all, if a bettor wins big, the \n     cyberspace casino may disappear. And bettors will have little \n     assurance that unregulated electronic roulette wheels aren't \n     rigged.\n       U.S. laws prohibit people in the gambling business from \n     transmitting by wire any wager information ``in interstate or \n     foreign commerce. ``Violations are punishable by two years in \n     prison and possible forfeiture of assets under organized \n     crime statutes. Some states, such as California, have laws \n     prohibiting individuals from placing bets by wire.\n       Mr. Eugene says that as Canadian citizen whose business is \n     in a foreign country, he isn't subject to U.S. laws, even if \n     his biggest market turns out to be U.S. gamblers. After he \n     starts the real casino, he promises to keep taking play-money \n     bets so that U.S. wiretappers won't be able to tell which \n     players are actually gambling.\n       I. Nelson Rose, a gambling law expert and law professor at \n     Whittier School of Law in Los Angeles, says he gets several \n     calls a week from people investigating the legal status of \n     on-line gambling. He says Mr. Eugene's theory may be \n     right: ``If you are a foreign national sitting in a \n     foreign country, there's a question whether the U.S. law \n     would apply to you.'' He adds that ``there may be a way to \n     do it on an Indian reservation'' as well.\n       Mr. Eugene styles himself as the Bugsy Siegel of \n     cyberspace, harking back to the mobster who helped build Las \n     Vegas into a gambling mecca. And his Electronic Casino is \n     like the early Las Vegas casinos--a big flashy sign fronting \n     a tiny drab facility. The casino's main screen, known as a \n     home page in Internet parlance, is an enticing graphic \n     display of a pirate chest full of booty. For now, only the \n     blackjack game is operating.\n       Mr. Eugene says he is negotiating with an accounting firm \n     to certify the legitimacy of his games and his bankroll. He \n     says he has a $1.5 million line of credit with a bank in St. \n     Maarten, a Dutch island in the Caribbean, but he declines to \n     name the bank. Mr. Eugene adds that casino authorities in St. \n     Maarten ``have the right to review our books. It's a new \n     area. They said `until you violate it. we like you. We trust \n     you.' ''\n       If nothing else, Mr. Eugene's Internet Casino plan shows \n     how easily small operators can establish themselves in \n     cyberspace. After he issued a news release in March, he \n     received publicity from newspapers and TV stations in the \n     U.S., England and Canada. ``I became a multinational \n     overnight,'' he says. Already, he adds, some 2,000 people \n     have preregistered their interest in gambling at the Internet \n     Casino.\n       Mr. Eugene says players will be able to wire funds to \n     individual offshore bank accounts that the casino will \n     establish or send cash through such companies as First \n     Virtual Holdings Inc., of Arlington, Va., one of several \n     companies trying to set up a secure payment system for the \n     Internet.\n\n[[Page S 17005]]\n\n       First Virtual lets people establish credit-card accounts \n     and use personal code numbers to perform transactions that \n     are confirmed by messages back and forth to the owner's \n     computer. One advantage of First Virtual is that it permits \n     very small transactions, so Internet Casino will be able to \n     operate even nickel slot machines. ``Internet gambling is a \n     very important, very interesting experiment,'' says Thomas \n     Feegel, vice president, marketing, at First Virtual.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/13/senate-section/article/S17004-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ON THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \nconcerns about the brinkmanship that has brought us to a government \nshutdown.\n  I think it is absolutely crucial that we keep our faith with Federal \nemployees. Using them as pawns in a political game by sending them home \nwithout pay is the ultimate breach of the Government's faith with these \nhard working people. This is the crowning achievement in the \nRepublicans' relentless string of attacks on Federal employees. The \nmotto of these attacks has been promises made, promises broken.\n  Well, Mr. President, my motto is that promises made should be \npromises kept. That is why Senator Sarbanes and I have introduced \nlegislation to protect Federal employee pay and benefits during a \ngovernment shutdown. Our legislation will ensure that Federal employees \nin Maryland and across the Nation will be able to make their mortgage \npayments, put food on the table, and provide for their families.\n  A shutdown of the Federal Government, no matter how short, would \ndisrupt the lives of thousands of Federal employees and their families. \nIn my state of Maryland alone, there are more than 280,000 Federal \nemployees. Sending them home would cost Maryland millions of dollars \nper day.\n  And let us take a close look at who we are talking about sending \nhome. We are talking about some of the most dedicated and hardest \nworking people in out Nation. Federal employees have devoted their \ncareers and lives to public service, and they help make America a \nbetter and safer place. They are the people that keep our Social \nSecurity system up and running; do the essential research on disease at \nthe National Institutes of Health; and help ensure public health and \nsafety. They are the people that keep Maryland and America on time with \npublic transportation.\n  Whenever the subject of deficit reduction comes up, the first people \nto take a hit are Federal employees. Over the last several years they \nhave been the target of unending attacks. Downsizing, RIF's, diet \nCOLA's, and the threat of furloughs have damaged morale at nearly every \nFederal agency.\n  At the same time, employees have been asked to do more with less. I \nam proud to say that they have accepted this challenge with \nextraordinary dedication. It is easy to see the results. Just look at \nthe excellent work that is being done at any Federal agency in \nMaryland. The crucial advancements in science at Goddard Space Flight \nCenter and the incredible research on disease at the National \nInstitutes of Health are two examples.\n  I do not want to go back to these dedicated Federal employees and \ntell them ``While you people at Goddard do the research that will bring \nus into the 21st century, and while you people at NIH launch your \nassault on deadly diseases, we are going to launch our own assault on \nyour jobs, your pensions and your benefits.''\n  These assaults must stop. We cannot continue to denigrate and \ndowngrade Federal employees and at the same time expect government to \nwork better. We cannot shut down the Government and then expect the \nsame high level of dedication from Federal employees that we have now.\n  Our Federal employees have a contract with their Government. I urge \nmy colleagues to work to ensure that this contract is honored and \nFederal jobs and benefits are not put in jeopardy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/13/senate-section/article/S17005-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17005-S17006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING THE BLACK REVOLUTIONARY WAR PATRIOTS\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, Saturday was Veterans Day, a \nday we set aside to honor those brave men and women who have risked \ntheir lives for our freedom. I want to call your attention to a group \nof soldiers who are often forgotten in Veterans Day tributes; namely \nthe 5,000 African-Americans who fought in the Revolutionary War. I also \nwant to make you aware of the efforts underway to finally honor these \nmen with a monument on The Mall. Lastly, I want to speak of a family in \nmy State who is working to make this memorial a reality.\n  Most Americans remain unaware of the black patriots who gave their \nlives for the freedom they themselves could not fully enjoy. About 20 \npercent of the soldiers who drove the British from American soil were \nAfrican-Americans. Few schoolchildren know that the first victim of the \nRevolutionary War was an African-American, Crispus Attucks, killed in \nthe Boston Massacre in 1770. Peter Salem, James Armisted, Salem Poor, \nand Prince Whipple, are just a few of the other black men who served, \nfought and died in our Nation's war for freedom and independence. Valor \nand fortitude in battle are especially awe-inspiring when one takes \ninto account the hostility and oppression that African-Americans faced \nfrom the nation for which they fought. These men have received little \nrecognition of their sacrifice for their country. Indeed, their \ncontributions have been, ``very carefully kept out of sight by orators \nand toast-drinkers,'' according to poet John Greenleaf Whittier.\n  We now have an opportunity to honor and salute the men and women \nwhose actions contributed to the birth of our Nation, a nation whose \nConstitution now embodies the very ideals of freedom these patriots \nrisked their lives for. Only in the 150 years since their deaths has \nthis Nation begun to secure and enforce the truths we holds to be self \nevident: life, liberty; and the pursuit of happiness, for all \nAmericans. The Nation owes a tremendous debt of gratitude to them for \ntheir courage to stand with little or no hope of realizing the fruit of \ntheir accomplishments.\n  In 1986 and again in 1988, Congress passed legislation authorizing \nconstruction of a monument to these men. The site selected is on The \nMall, just north of the Reflecting Pool. Since no taxpayer funds are \nbeing used for this monument, Senator Chafee and I introduced the S. \n953, the black Revolutionary War patriots commemorative coin bill. The \nbill proposes the minting of 500,000 commemorative coins, which should \nraise approximately $5 million for use in financing the monument.\n  All proceeds over and above the cost of minting the coin will go \ntoward constructions of the monument. This bill is revenue-neutral; it \nwill cost the Federal Government absolutely nothing. The funds are \nneeded to support a monument that will both honor and educate. It will \nsymbolize the struggle of all individuals who have not previously been \nrecognized.\n  Mr. President, I would now like to speak briefly about some \nconstituents of mine, the Bailey family of Waukegan, IL. Marina Bailey \nand her three daughters learned about the proposed monument 4 yeas ago, \nand they have turned a bedroom of their house into an office for their \nfundraising efforts. They launched a public awareness campaign in \nsupport of the memorial and to make the history of the black \nRevolutionary War patriots more widely known. Jamila Bailey spoke to \nneighboring schools from the time she was 16 years old. They have \nconstructed and mailed information packets to schools starting in \nIllinois, then all over the country, asking students to send funds to \nthe Patriots foundation. The Bailey family has been responsible for \nthousands of dollars raised for this memorial. Marina Bailey said that \nher dedication to this project is to promote awareness and celebration \nof our diversity and the contributions we have all made to our Nation. \n``We are a quilt,'' she said, ``We are not a sheet. All of us together \nmake up the beauty and diversity of the American people.''\n  Like the Bailey family, I want this memorial to become a reality. The \nbest way to ensure that is through swift passage of the Black \nRevolutionary War Patriots Commemorative Coin Act. As citizens who \nbenefit daily from the sacrifices made by those previously unrecognized \nsoldiers, I call upon my colleagues for their cosponsorship and help in \nexpediting the passage of S. 953. The passage of this bill will ensure \nswift construction of this memorial, so that America may finally bestow \nhonor \n\n[[Page S 17006]]\non these traditionally overlooked veterans. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/13/senate-section/article/S17005-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17006-S17007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ADMINISTRATION STUDIES ON WELFARE LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on Thursday, November 9, 1995, \nthe Office of Management and Budget released a study requested on \nOctober 24 by the Senator from New York and 11 other members of the \nconference committee on the welfare legislation. The OMB study \nconcludes that the Senate welfare bill would push 1.2 million children \ninto poverty, while the House bill would force 2.1 million children \ninto poverty.\n  Also on November 9, the Department of Health and Human Services \nreleased a separate report containing data on the number of children \nwho would be cut off from welfare benefits as a result of the time \nlimits in both bills. Under the 5-year time limit required by the House \nwelfare bill, 4.3 million children would become ineligible for Federal \nbenefits by the time of full implementation. The Senate bill would cut \noff 3.3 million children.\n  Mr. President, I ask that excerpts from both studies be printed in \nthe Congressional Record.\n  The excerpts follow:\n\n      TABLE

Mr. President, let me indicate that at 10 o'clock the \nDemocratic leader, Republican leader in the Senate, and our \ncounterparts in the House, the Speaker and I assume the majority leader \nand the minority leader, will go to the White House to meet with the \nPresident to see if there is something we can do yet this evening to \nwork out a continuing resolution.\n  If we are going to do that, we ought to be doing it in good faith and \nnot be engaged in a brawl up here on the Senate floor. I therefore \nwould hope that we could recess until the hour of 11 p.m., if that is \nsatisfactory with the distinguished Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the majority leader will yield, that is satisfactory. \nI think we need to come back and share with our colleagues whatever it \nis that may have occurred at the meeting, and so I think at least the \ntwo leaders will be coming back. But at that time we can make a \ndecision about further action.\n  Mr. DOLE. So I ask unanimous consent we stand in recess until 11 p.m.\n  There being no objection, the Senate, at 9:10 p.m., recessed until 11 \np.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by the \nPresiding Officer (Mr. Jeffords).\n\n[[Page S 17008]]\n\n\n                  APPOINTMENT BY THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we just completed our discussions down at \nthe White House. And I think it was a very frank exchange. I must say \nthat I had hoped we might be able to make more progress and come to \nsome resolution to allow the Government to function in order tomorrow, \nbut that is not going to be possible. We agreed to meet again tomorrow \nto continue our discussions and negotiations.\n  I think it was a very candid exchange. We now have a better \nunderstanding where both sides are on many of these issues. But we are \na long way from any resolution. I think the President made it very \nclear that Medicare was not something that we can agree to, under any \ncircumstances, with regard to the continuing resolution. And I think \nthe discussions had a good deal to do with the way with which we might \nachieve a balanced budget, the timeframe within which that budget could \nbe achieved, hopefully some understanding about how we might begin \nserious negotiations in achieving a balanced budget by a date certain.\n  So, I look forward to the negotiations tomorrow. I look forward to \nworking with the majority leader to try to resolve the schedule for the \nbalance of the week as we continue our work downtown. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, accurately \nreflected the meeting. It was a frank discussion. I, too, regret we \ncould not come to some agreement tonight so we could rush through a 1-\nday or a 2-day CR, but I think it would not have been possible.\n  The first meeting tomorrow will be with the chairmen and ranking \nmembers of the Budget Committees in the House and the Senate, with the \nChief of Staff, Leon Panetta, and I think also Alice Rivlin, the Budget \nDirector--I am not certain--Senator Exon and Senator Domenici on this \nside. And that will be followed, hopefully, by a meeting with the \nprincipals who were there this evening--myself and Senator Daschle on \nthis side.\n  Obviously, we have had these problems before with CR's and debt \nceilings, and we have had the Government shut down for short periods in \nthe past. I hope this will be a very short period. I am not an advocate \nof shutting down the Government. I just hope that by tomorrow afternoon \nor tomorrow evening, we will be able to say that we have reached some \nagreement and that we can pass a continuing resolution and maybe a debt \nceiling. I am not certain we can do both tomorrow.\n  I think it is fair to say we talked not only about the continuing \nresolution, we talked about the debt ceiling, we talked about \nreconciliation, some discussion of how we proceed, whether you go \nthrough a veto process first with reconciliation, whether you start \nnegotiations now on the budget package.\n  I think the President's concern primarily, and our concern, is \nkeeping the Government going while we are negotiating some of these \nvery important issues. Balanced budget is very important--very \nimportant--on this side of the aisle. I am sure it is important on the \nother side of the aisle. It is particularly important to many Members \non the House side where it is very difficult--some of us have served in \nthe House--to pass a debt ceiling and pass a continuing resolution, and \nthere are some things added to it. I do not care if we have a \nRepublican or Democrat in the White House and Republicans control the \nCongress or Democrats, continuing resolutions and debt ceilings have \nalways been vehicles for extraneous amendments. That is how the famous \nBoland amendment was adopted on a continuing resolution or debt \nextension. We have had all 13 appropriations bills put on continuing \nresolutions. So it is not unprecedented.\n  But notwithstanding, I still hope we can come together very quickly \ntomorrow, if possible, and be able to tell everybody in Government this \nwill be a 1-day affair. It may not happen. But at least I think we made \nsome progress this evening, and I thank Senator Daschle and the others \nwho attended the meeting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/13/senate-section/article/S17008-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. DOLE.
