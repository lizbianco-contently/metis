Mr. President, it is time to speak plainly. To borrow a \nphrase, President Clinton has been AWOL--absent without leadership--on \nthe drug issue. Our country is badly hurt by his abdication of \nresponsibility. This is the opinion of both liberals and conservatives, \nRepublicans and Democrats.\n  A little more than 1 year ago, President Clinton signed into law the \nViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. In doing so he \nstated that ``this is the beginning, not the end, of our effort to \nrestore safety and security to the people of our country.''\n  To commemorate the 1-year anniversary of that measure's enactment, \nthe Clinton administration held several days of media events.\n  Unfortunately, while President Clinton and his aides were celebrating \nthe year-old crime bill, HHS announced that teen drug use almost \ndoubled over the past 2 years. Just as Nero fiddled while Rome burned, \nthe Clinton administration holds media events while seemingly ignoring \nthe evidence of a worsening drug crisis.\n  Let me take you back a few years, to 1992. As a candidate for \nPresident, then Mr. Clinton talked tough on drugs, declaring that \n``President Bush hasn't fought a real war on crime and drugs * * * \n[and] I will.''\n  On the link between drugs and crime, candidate Clinton said ``We have \na national problem on our hands that requires a tough national \nresponse,'' as reported in the New York Times, March 26, 1993, \nreferring to previous Clinton statements.\n  Since the campaign, however, President Clinton has rarely mentioned \nthe drug issue in a substantive way. He has not made the drug issue a \nvisible crusade. He simply has not led this country against the scourge \nthat is killing our children.\n  Not so long ago, Nancy Reagan led the ``Just Say No'' campaign. That \nwas just one demonstration of committed leadership at the national \nlevel. Today, we hear virtually nothing from the White House. We need a \ncampaign to get the President to ``Just Say Something''--and say it \nloudly and consistently.\n  Through the 1980's and into the early 1990's we saw dramatic \nreductions in casual drug use--reductions that were won through \nincreased penalties, strong Presidential leadership, and a clear \nnational antidrug message.\n  Casual drug use dropped by more than half between 1977 and 1992 \naccording to the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse.\n  Casual cocaine use fell by 79 percent, while monthly cocaine use fell \nfrom 2.9 million users in 1988 to 1.3 million in 1992, again, from the \nNational Household Survey on Drug Abuse. Imagine if we had had a 79-\npercent reduction in teen pregnancy, or AIDS transmission. \n\n[[Page S 15070]]\n\n  The Federal drug control and treatment budget grew from $1.5 to $13 \nbillion under Presidents Reagan and Bush.\n  Beyond the substantial investment of money and materiel, the drug war \nwas fought by engaged Commanders in Chief, who used the bully pulpit to \nchange attitudes. Presidents Reagan and Bush involved themselves in \nthis effort and helped rescue much of a generation.\n  It was in the face of these gains that Mr. Clinton, then candidate \nfor President, said he would do a better job than they.\n  Yet today, after only a few short years, we are rapidly losing \nground, as illustrated by this chart.\n  I might say, rather than aggressively fighting this losing trend, the \nClinton administration, like a sports franchise on the decline, appears \ncontent to celebrate past victories with prior leadership rather than \ntrying to achieve anything of substance.\n  Over the past 2 years, almost every available indicator shows that \nour gains against drug use have either stopped or reversed.\n  This chart, ``Trends in High School Marijuana Use,'' from the most \nrecent edition of the National High School Survey reported, for the \nsecond year in a row, sizable increases in drug use among our Nation's \n8th, 10th, and 12th graders. In fact, as this chart illustrates, over \nthe past 2 years, past month use of marijuana is up 110 percent for 8th \ngraders, from 3.7 to 7.8 percent; up 95 percent for 10th graders, from \n8.1 to 15.8 percent; and up 60 percent among 12th graders, from 11.9 to \n19 percent.\n  Other surveys show similar trends. Last month, HHS released alarming \nfigures showing that marijuana use is up sharply--up 50 percent--among \nyoung people. The category of ``recent marijuana use'' was up a \nstaggering 192 percent among 14- to 15-year-olds. Among 12- to 13-year-\nolds, recent marijuana use was up 137 percent.\n  There are trends in youthful drug use between ages 12 and 17. This \ntroubling data should come as no surprise. It follows last year's \ndiscouraging survey, which, as this next chart illustrates, shows the \nnumber of youthful, past year marijuana users increased by 450,000 \nusers--up from 1.6 million in 1992 to 2.1 million in the space of just \n1 year. As the chart illustrates, in 1994, that number reached 2.9 \nmillion. In other words, nearly 1.3 million more kids are smoking pot \ntoday than were doing so in 1992. That is astounding.\n  More to the point, this sharp increase in drug use comes on the heels \nof consistent declines in drug use dating back to 1979.\n  According to substance abuse experts, many of these youthful \nmarijuana users will end up cocaine addicts. Joseph Califano, head of \nColumbia University's Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, and \nformer Secretary of HEW, estimates that 820,000 of these new youthful \nmarijuana users will eventually try cocaine. Of these 820,000 who try \ncocaine, Califano estimates that some 58,000 will end up as regular \nusers and addicts.\n  This country does not need another 58,000 cocaine addicts.\n  Prevention messages are not getting through, either. According to a \nrecent survey by Frank Luntz, teens think cigarettes are more dangerous \nthan marijuana. The May 1995 survey by Frank Luntz showed that 82 \npercent of 12- to 17-year-olds believe cigarettes are either \n``somewhat'' or ``very'' dangerous, as compared with 81 percent for \nmarijuana.\n  There are other ominous signs as well: According to a story in USA \nToday last month, a pending Government study will show an astounding \n144-percent increase in overdose deaths nationally due to \nmethamphetamines over the past 2 years.--USA Today, September 7, 1995.\n  Cocaine and heroin prices continue to fall, even as cocaine purity \nreaches record levels. Emergency room admissions for cocaine overdoses \nhave never been higher.\n  These trends are disastrous. When Senator Dole called attention to \nthese trends in a recent op ed, three Clinton Cabinet Members--Brown, \nShalala, and Reno--wrote back to say that ``teenage marijuana use * * * \nremains far below the record highs of the late 1970's and early \n1980's.''--Washington Times, October 6, 1995.\n  In other words, we should not get too upset because today's drug \nproblem is not as bad as it was at its worst point in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  Unfortunately, we are sitting on the edge of a major drug \ncatastrophe, and President Clinton's lack of visibility and leadership \nhas not helped.\n  In fact, there have been troubling signs since the earliest days of \nthe administration. In early 1993, respected columnist A.M. Rosenthal \ndescribed President Clinton's record in developing and promoting a \nstrong antidrug policy as: ``No leadership. No role. No alerting. No \npolicy.''--A.M. Rosenthal, New York Times, March 26, 1993.\n  Dr. Mitchell Rosenthal, the president of the Nation's largest \nresidential treatment organization, Phoenix House, said that developing \ndrug trends should have been ``a big signal to the President and his \nCabinet that they've got to pay serious attention to [the drug \nproblem].''--New York Times, July 16, 1993.\n  Back then, I warned this administration that ``the concept of the war \nagainst drugs is in danger of being dismantled by its relative \nsilence.''\n  I warned that certain administration policies were ``tantamount to \ndecriminalizing drugs'' and would have the effect of increasing drug \nuse. Sadly, we critics are being proven right.\n  President Clinton has abandoned many of the drug control efforts \nundertaken by his immediate predecessors. Indeed, he has even abandoned \nthe moral leadership of the bully pulpit.\n  President Clinton himself rarely speaks out against drug abuse, and \nhe offers little, if any, moral support or leadership to those fighting \nthe drug war in America or abroad.\n  For example, President Clinton has cut Federal interdiction efforts, \nwhich have helped check the flow of drugs into our cities, and States, \nto our children, and, in the past, made the drug trade a risky \nproposition. Two years ago, he ordered a massive reduction in the \ninterdiction budgets of the Defense Department, Customs Service, and \nthe Coast Guard. Cocaine seizures plummeted. U.S. Customs cocaine \nseizures in the transit zone dropped 70 percent, while Coast Guard \ncocaine seizures fell by more than 70 percent.\n  We have just learned that transit-zone interdiction results for the \nfirst 6 months of 1995 were even worse than last year. This chart \nillustrates the decline in transit-zone interdictions--down from 440 \nkilograms per day in 1992 to 205 kilograms per day in the first 6 \nmonths of 1995, even though drug pushing is up. Over the course of a \nyear, the lowered disruption rate, from these figures, in 1992 and even \n1993, means that as much as 85 additional tons of cocaine and marijuana \ncould be arriving unimpeded on American streets, and killing our kids.\n  The administration also accepted a one-third cut in resources to \nattack the cocaine trade in the source and transit countries of South \nAmerica, and disrupted cooperative efforts with source country \ngovernments when it ordered the Unite States military to stop providing \nradar tracking of drug-trafficking aircraft to Colombia and Peru.\n  The Clinton administration claimed these cuts to interdiction \nrepresented a so-called controlled shift. But the shift--in my opinion, \nand I think in the opinion of almost everybody who studies this--was \nreally a reckless abdication of responsibility.\n  Having gutted our Federal efforts to stop drugs from arriving here, \nPresident Clinton has also weakened efforts to deal effectively with \nthem once they hit our streets. Upon taking office, President Clinton \npromoted the drug czar to Cabinet level, but then slashed the drug \nczar's staff by 80 percent.\n  The President undercut law enforcement efforts initiated by his \npredecessors, allowing the DEA to lose 198 drug agents over a 2-year \nperiod. The President also proposed a fiscal year 1995 budget that \nwould have cut 621 additional drug enforcement positions from the FBI, \nthe DEA, the INS, Customs, and the Coast Guard.\n  Those cuts were blocked by congressional Republicans, and many \nDemocrats, but they should never have been proposed in the first place.\n  Under President Clinton, Federal drug prosecutions have slipped--down \nmore than 12 percent since 1992, from 25,033 in 1992 to 21,905 in 1995. \nI have asked, but the Justice Department has no coherent explanation \nfor these declines. \n\n[[Page S 15071]]\n\n  And who could forget President Clinton's Surgeon General, who \nremarked, memorably, on the need to consider drug legalization.\n  Perhaps A.M. Rosenthal put it best when he wrote in the August 4, \n1995, New York Times that: ``Mr. Clinton's leadership has sometimes \nseemed to us antidrug types as ranging from absent to lackadaisical.''\n  Mr. President, the Federal Government has a unique responsibility in \nattacking the drug trade.\n  Only the Federal Government can interdict drugs before they reach our \nstreets, make drug trafficking more difficult, operate overseas, and \nmount complex multinational investigations. Every kilogram of cocaine \nor heroin that gets through makes State and local law enforcement's job \nmore difficult and more dangerous.\n  Today, illicit drugs represent one of the greatest threats to \nAmerica's future. Drugs contribute to a wide range of devastation \naffecting all Americans, particularly our children and youth. Drugs \ndirectly contribute to violent crime and property crime.\n  The break-up of marriages and families can often be linked to drug \nuse, as can lower productivity in the workplace, poor education, and \nmyriad other societal problems.\n  In fact, if drug use returns to the levels of the 1970's in this \ncountry, our ability to control health care costs, reform welfare, \nimprove the academic performance of our school-age children, and reduce \ncrime in our housing projects will all be seriously compromised. \nIndeed, we stand little chance of success in these battles if we lose \nfurther ground in the drug war.\n  This Congress must not allow the American people to think that we \ncondone President Clinton's abdication of responsibility. We must not \nbe complicit through our silence.\n  I believe a revitalized war on drugs would include the following \nelements: First, do more in Latin America: Fighting drugs at the source \njust makes sense--we ought to be going after the beehive, not just the \nbees. Foreign programs are cost-effective. For example, our program in \nPeru cost just $16 million to run last year.\n  It was very effective in some ways. It would be much more if we put \nsome force behind it.\n  Second, we need to beef up interdiction. Interdiction programs are \nour first line of defense against smugglers. The administration should \nallow the Department of Defense to spend more than 0.3 percent of its \nbudget currently devoted to drugs. That is the fiscal year 1995 level. \nThe Coast Guard and Customs interdiction assets need to be restored as \nwell.\n  Third, we have to encourage whoever is President of the United States \nto use the bully pulpit. President Clinton is our President, and I am \nhopeful that these remarks today will encourage him to use the bully \npulpit to fight against this matter. Only the President can give the \ndrug issue the high profile it deserves. Members of Congress on both \nsides of the aisle should encourage the President to speak out on this \nissue.\n  Fourth, we need to adjust our budget priorities. This country needs \nto look more closely at our budget priorities. We should consider \nreprogramming the surplus of the super-secret National Reconnaissance \nOffice--estimated at up to $1.7 billion--into the drug war. This \nsurplus is more than the combined drug budgets of DEA--the Drug \nEnforcement Administration--and the FBI. The DEA is $801 million and \nthe FBI is $540 million, respectively, in fiscal year 1995. It is more \nthan the total that we spent on interdiction last year. The fiscal year \n1995 interdiction spending was $1.29 billion.\n  But the National Reconnaissance Office has up to $1.7 billion and it \nought to be redirected into the drug war.\n  Fifth, we ought to make drug dealers pay. The most immediate effect \nof drug dealing on our local communities is the degradation of the \ncauses in the quality of life.\n  Some States have laws forcing drug dealers to contribute to a local \ncommunity impact fund. We need to look into the possibility of doing \nthis on the Federal level.\n  Sixth, reject efforts to lower crack penalties. This May the U.S. \nSentencing Commission proposed steep reductions in proposed sentences \nfor crack cocaine dealers. It was irresponsible public policy. It had \nto be blocked. It was blocked by the full Senate on September 29. The \nSenate must remain firm to prevent unwarranted reductions in drug \npenalties.\n  Seventh, we have to fund drug treatment programs that work. The \nFederal Government permits drug addicts to get disability payments from \nSocial Security, known as SSI payments. And in doing so it undercuts \ntough but effective treatment programs like Phoenix House. Roughly \n20,000 addicts were receiving Social Security disability payments in \n1990--payments because of their drug addiction. It should surprise no \none to hear that 4 years later only 1 percent had recovered and left \nthe rolls.\n  The Social Security disability system is being reformed, but we need \nto make sure that loopholes like these do not exist in other areas.\n  These are just a few of the things that we think we should be doing. \nLater this Congress, I plan to invite Members and policy experts to \nparticipate in a national drug summit. I want the Congress to examine \npolicy options which will reverse these crushing increases in drug use \nin our society. I wish to bring national attention to bear on just how \nbad our situation has become. I want to revitalize the drug war.\n  In coming months, I will be calling upon a number of colleagues to \njoin in this effort. And by working together, I believe we will be able \nto reclaim lost ground.\n  I do not come to this issue as a beginner. I have actually seen the \nravages of drugs. I have seen them destroy families. I have seen young \npeople, with tremendous potential, who literally were geniuses, who \ncould have done anything they wanted to do in society completely gone, \ntheir minds gone because of drugs. I have seen murders and maimings and \nrapes and abuse, children abused because of drugs. I have seen drugs \nfund the Mafia and other organized crime groups in this country.\n  We have seen a proliferation of drugs on the streets in the greatest \ncity in this world, Washington, DC. It has become a garbage dump of \ndrugs and drug abuse and drug use and drug peddling. You can go down on \nsome of the streets and see them peddling the drugs. It is pathetic \nthat we allow this to continue to exist.\n  It is going to take all of us, but I am prodding the President. We \nhave been friends. I have helped him in many ways up here, and I intend \nto continue to try to help him when he is right. But I am prodding him \nhere today to get serious about this, to do something about it. Worry a \nlittle bit more about our children. Get out there out front and do the \nthings that really the President ought to be doing to let our society \nand our people know that drug abuse is a wrongful thing; that it is a \nharmful thing; that it is a life-destroying thing; that whether the \nlife continues or not, it is destroyed, and many lives actually are \ndestroyed, not just the living but people have died because of drugs \nand drug overdoses, and it is a health matter. We are paying through \nthe nose in emergency rooms across this country in uncompensated care \nbecause of this particular malady that has affected our affluent \nsociety, and we have to do something about it.\n  There is nobody in our society who should be able to do it better \nthan whoever is President of the United States. I believe with \nPresident Clinton's ability to articulate he could do a very good job, \nand it would help him with the American people if he would. So I am \nencouraging him to do this today by pointing out the deficiencies that \nexist and saying let us quit letting them exist. Let us do something \nabout it. And I hope all of us can work together in encouraging him to \ndo so.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/12/senate-section/article/S15069-6", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S 15072]]\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF SENATOR NUNN\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored to have served with our \ncolleague from Georgia, Senator Nunn. He is an outstanding statesman \nand legislator, and I am saddened by his decision to end his \ndistinguished career in the Senate.\n  I have had the privilege of serving with Senator Nunn during his \nentire 23 years in the Senate. He has been a thoughtful and skilled \nlegislator whose wisdom and leadership have made large contributions to \nthe country on a great variety of issues, especially in the area of \nnational defense.\n  Senator Nunn is widely recognized as the Senate's preeminent voice on \nmilitary issues, and that reputation is well deserved.\n  As a leading member of the Armed Services Committee throughout his \nSenate career, and as chairman of the committee for 8 years, from 1987 \nthrough 1994, he has displayed an unwavering commitment to the security \nof our country and to the men and women of our Armed Forces who provide \nit.\n  It would take hours to detail the many contributions that Senator \nNunn has made to the national security of the United States. Let me \ncite just four of them. The first, most recently, was his effective \nintervention in Haiti a year ago. President Clinton had decided that \nUnited States forces should land in Haiti. The question was whether the \nlanding would be welcomed, or opposed--would they land as friendly \npeacekeepers or hostile invaders.\n  At that critical moment in our recent history, Senator Nunn \naccompanied former President Carter and General Colin Powell on an \nextraordinary mission to Haiti to convince the dictators not to oppose \nthe United States forces. Despite huge obstacles, Senator Nunn helped \nconvince the dictators that a peaceful transition to democracy was the \nonly realistic alternative to heavy bloodshed. Our forces landed in \npeace, and a year later, the first free elections have been held in \nHaiti. Senator Nunn helped make that peaceful transition possible, and \ndeserves great credit for his role.\n  A second example was the Goldwater-Nichols legislation, enacted in \n1986, which reformed the organization of the Defense Department more \nextensively than at any time since the creation of the Department after \nWorld War II. Senator Nunn was a leading figure in the development and \nimplementation of this landmark legislation. It established the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as the principal military adviser \nto the President, and it strengthened the unified battlefield commands, \ngiving them full control of our forces in the field. The success of the \nact was clearly demonstrated in Operation Desert Storm.\n  A third example of Senator Nunn's impressive leadership on national \nsecurity issues was his successful defense of the Anti-Ballistic \nMissile Treaty. Senator Nunn understands the importance of America's \nmaintaining the best armed, best trained, and best led forces in the \nworld. But he also understands the importance of arms control to reduce \nthe likelihood of conflict. His defense of the ABM Treaty was a prime \nexample of his leadership on this all-important issue.\n  The Reagan administration sought to undermine the ABM Treaty in 1987 \nthrough a legal reinterpretation of the treaty text. Sam Nunn spent \nmany hours going over the negotiating record of the treaty, reviewing \nin detail the issues raised by the administration. After careful \ndeliberation, he concluded that the administration's case was wrong, \nand that the traditional interpretation of the treaty was correct. He \nwent to work on the floor of the Senate and masterfully defended the \ntreaty, upholding the Nation's solemn commitment to the treaty, the \ncornerstone of all nuclear arms agreements signed in the past 23 years.\n  A fourth example is Senator Nunn's understanding of the use of \ncooperation in reducing threats to national security through a program \nthat bears his name. The cooperative threat reduction program between \nthe United States and the nations of the former Soviet Union is known \nas the Nunn-Lugar program. Through these ongoing efforts, we are \nworking with Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and other Soviet successor \nnations to reduce and dismantle their nuclear weapons stockpiles and \nproduction capability, and to convert elements of their defense \nindustry to commercial uses. This program is a major example of the \nopportunities for long-term peace and prosperity that the end of the \ncold war can mean for our country and our former adversaries.\n  Many other examples of Senator Nunn's wise and conscientious \nleadership can be cited. We all know that we have the strongest and \nmost effective military forces in the world today, and that achievement \nis due in no small part to the brilliant work of Senator Nunn.\n  It has been an honor to serve with him on the Armed Services \nCommittee. We will miss him, and the Senate and the Nation will miss \nhis leadership, his statesmanship, and most of all his friendship. As \nhe made clear in his statement earlier this week, he is committed to \ncontinuing his service to Georgia and the country and the world in \nother ways in the years ahead.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing proclamation be inserted in the Record. The proclamation was \nsigned by Gov. Jim Guy Tucker and designates October 21-29, 1995, as \nWorld Population Awareness Week in the State of Arkansas. This \nproclamation is part of a worldwide effort to implement recommendations \nof the International Conference on Population and Development, held in \nCairo last year.\n  It is clear that we are facing a population crisis. We now live in a \nworld of 5.7 billion people, a population that grew by nearly 100 \nmillion last year, the largest annual increase ever recorded. \nUnemployment in many developing countries is as high as 30 percent, and \nto accommodate their growing populations, the nations of the world will \nhave to produce 500 million new jobs by the yearly 2000.\n  The world's resources cannot accommodate continuing growth at the \ncurrent rate. More than 1.7 billion people, nearly one-third of the \nworld population, lack an adequate supply of drinking water, and 26 \nbillions tons of arable topsoil vanish from the world's croplands every \nyear. At least 65 countries that depend on subsistence farming may be \nunable to feed their populations by the year 2000.\n  Time is a luxury we do not enjoy. Action is required now to ensure a \nreasonable quality of life and a stable and secure world for a child \nborn today. I applaud the action of Governor Tucker and other officials \nof government and private organizations who are working to increase \nawareness of this problem and encourage the actions necessary to \nresolve it.\n  There being no objection, the proclamation was ordered to printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    State of Arkansas, Proclamation\n\n\n          to all to whom these presents shall come--greetings\n\n       Whereas, the world population is currently 5.7 billion and \n     increasing by nearly 100 million per year, with virtually all \n     of this growth added to the poorest countries and regions--\n     those that can least afford to accommodate their current \n     populations, much less such massive infusions of human \n     numbers; and\n       Whereas, the annual increment to world population is \n     projected to exceed 86 million through the year 2015, with \n     three billion people--the equivalent of the entire world \n     population as recently as 1960--reaching their reproductive \n     years within the next generation; and\n       Whereas, the environmental and economic impacts of this \n     level of growth will almost certainly prevent inhabitant of \n     poorer countries from improving their quality of life, and at \n     the same time, have deleterious repercussions for the \n     standard of living in more affluent regions; and\n       Whereas, the 1994 International Conference on Population \n     and Development in Cario, Egypt crafted a 20-year Program of \n     Action for achieving a more equitable balance between the \n     world's population, environment and resources that was duly \n     approved by 180 nations, including the United States;\n       Now, Therefore, I, Jim Guy Tucker, Governor of the State of \n     Arkansas, do hereby proclaim October 22-29, 1995, as, World \n     Population Awareness Week, in the State of Arkansas and urge \n     all citizens of the state to support the purpose and the \n     spirit of the Cairo Program of Action, and call upon all \n     governments and private organizations to do their utmost to \n     implement that document, \n\n[[Page S 15073]]\n     particularly the goals and objectives their in aimed at providing \n     universal access to family planning information, education \n     and services, as well as the elimination of poverty, \n     illiteracy, unemployment, social disintegration, and gender \n     discrimination that have been reinforced by the 1995 United \n     Nations International Conference on Social Development, \n     endorsed by 118 world leaders in 1995, and by the 1995 United \n     Nations Fourth World Conference on Women.\n       In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused \n     the Great Seal of the State of Arkansas to be affixed at the \n     Capitol in Little Rock on this 21st day of September in the \n     year of our Lord nineteen hundred ninety-five.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/12/senate-section/article/S15072-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on that evening in 1972 when I first was \nelected to the Senate, I made a commitment to myself that I would never \nfail to see a young person, or a group of young people, who wanted to \nsee me.\n  It has proved enormously beneficial to me because I have been \ninspired by the estimated 60,000 young people with whom I have visited \nduring the nearly 23 years I have been in the Senate.\n  Most of them have been concerned about the enormity of the Federal \ndebt that Congress has run up for the coming generations to pay.\n  The young people and I almost always discuss the fact that under the \nU.S. Constitution, no President can spend a dime of Federal money that \nhas not first been authorized and appropriated by both the House and \nSenate of the United States.\n  That is why I began making these daily reports to the Senate on \nFebruary 22, 1992. I wanted to make a matter of daily record of the \nprecise size of the Federal debt which as of yesterday, Wednesday, \nOctober 11, stood at $4,968,818,321,533.20 or $18,861.72 for every man, \nwoman, and child in America on a per capita basis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/12/senate-section/article/S15073-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15073-S15074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CHINA AND HUMAN RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, a heart-rending article about China's \nforced abortion policy was published in September's Reader's Digest. \nThe article emphasized the absurdity of the U.N. Fourth Conference on \nWomen having been held in Beijing, and should be required reading for \nthose who insist that China's human rights record should be considered \nonly in the abstract--and should not interfere with full-scale \nrelations with the Communist Chinese.\n  The Reader's Digest story, ``A Question of Duty,'' relates a young \nChinese obstetrician's courageous decision to refuse to murder a baby \nborn illegally under Chinese law. For refusing to kill the baby (who \nsurvived a chemical abortion procedure) Dr. Yin Wong was banished to a \nremote Chinese province. Dr. Wong eventually escaped to the United \nStates where he hopes to be granted political asylum. But the baby Dr. \nWong fought to save was put to death under orders from the local \nChinese family planning office.\n  Mr. President, the thought of killing a baby is abhorrent, but it is \ncommonplace in Communist China. The concept that the birth of a human \nbeing can be illegal is grotesque, but in China, it is the law of the \nland--for mothers who already have one child.\n  Mr. President, I will never understand how or why the United Nations \nchose Beijing for such a high-profile human rights meeting. It was the \nU.N. Population Program [U.N.F.P.A.] that helped design China's \npopulation control program 20 years ago. This cruel experiment, which \nuses forced abortions and sterilizations to limit each family to one \nchild, has debased the value of human life and has forever discredited \nU.N.F.P.A.\n  For fiscal year 1995, the Clinton administration handed over $50 \nmillion to U.N.F.P.A., and Mr. Clinton proposed another $55 million for \nfiscal year 1996. If Senators will take the time to read Dr. Yin Wong's \nstory, they will understand why many Americans feel so strongly, as I \ndo, that further funding of the U.N. Population Program, using American \ntaxpayer's money, should be prohibited.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that ``A Question of Duty'' \nfrom the September 1995 Reader's Digest be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Reader's Digest, September 1995]\n\n  What Is A Doctor To Do When Faced With An Order to Commit Murder? A \n                            Question of Duty\n\n                           (By Dr. Yin Wong)\n\n       (The author asked that her name be changed for fear of \n     reprisals against her family.)\n       The hospital in southern China was busy in early morning of \n     December 24, 1989. As a 24-year-old specialist in obstetrics \n     and gynecology, I had performed two Caesareans and a \n     difficult forceps delivery. My supervisor had put me in \n     charge of that night's shift--a new and frightening \n     responsibility. I was exhausted and hadn't eaten for about \n     eight hours. Yet when I finally got to the doctors lounge \n     at 1 a.m., I was too excited to eat or sleep.\n       Instead, I lay in bed marveling at the three new lives I \n     had welcomed into the world. And I thought of my father. He \n     had chosen a profession that, in China, paid little more than \n     twice the wages of a street sweeper: he was a doctor. He \n     would often say, ``The most noble work a person can do is \n     savings lives.''\n       My father was a beloved figure in our province, famous for \n     his humility. He wore a workingman's clothes and carried his \n     instruments in a cheap vinyl bag with a broken zipper. His \n     reflex hammer was an ancient model with a wooden handle. He \n     refused to throw it away. ``Tools don't make a doctor,'' he \n     told me ``Knowledge and compassion do.''\n       Now at last growing drowsy, I remembered that it was \n     Christmas Eve. Like millions of Chinese, my parents were \n     Christian. I thought of the times we had celebrated this holy \n     day together: decorating a tiny tree, singing ``Silent \n     Night''--quietly, so our neighbors wouldn't report us--and \n     hearing my father whisper the story of the Christ child. I'll \n     call him on Christmas morning, I thought as I drifted off to \n     sleep.\n       I was awakened by a knock at the door. It was the midwife \n     who handled routine deliveries. ``Come!'' she shouted. ``We \n     need you to take care of something!''\n       As I rushed after her, I heard the crying of a newborn \n     baby. When I reached the delivery room, a bedraggled woman \n     was struggling to sit up in bed. ``Don't! Don't!'' she \n     shouted in a local dialect.\n       The midwife, a girl of 20 with a ponytail and bad acne, \n     began drawing iodine from a clear glass bottle through a \n     three-inch needle into a large syringe. She told me that the \n     woman's abortion had gone awry. The mother, eight months \n     pregnant, already had one child--a second was forbidden under \n     China's strict population-control law. Arrested and forced \n     into the hospital by the local Family Planning Office, the \n     mother had been injected with rivanol, an abortifacient drug. \n     ``But the baby was born alive,'' said the midwife. The cries \n     were coming from an unheated bathroom across the hall.\n       ``I asked the orderly to bury it,'' she continued. A small \n     hill nearby served as an unmarked graveyard for such \n     purposes. ``But he said it was raining too hard.''\n       Then the full import of this moment became clear to me. As \n     the obstetrician in charge, I had the duty of ensuring there \n     were no abortion survivors. That meant an injection of 20 \n     milliliters of iodine or alcohol into the soft spot of the \n     infant's head. It brings death within just minutes.\n       The midwife held the syringe out to me. I froze. I had no \n     hesitancy about performing first-trimester abortions, but \n     this was different. In the year since joining the hospital \n     staff, I have always managed to let more senior doctors \n     perform the task.\n       On the bed next to me, the child's mother looked at me with \n     pleading eyes. She knew what the needle meant. All women \n     knew. ``Have mercy!'' she cried.\n       With the mother still protesting, I went across the hall to \n     the bathroom. It was so cold I could see my breath. Next to a \n     garbage pail with the words DEAD INFANTS scrawled on the lid \n     was a black plastic garbage bag. I was moving, and cries were \n     coming from inside. Kneeling, I told the midwife to open the \n     bag.\n       I have imagined a premature new-born, hovering between life \n     and death. Instead, I found a perfect 4\\1/2\\-pound baby boy, \n     failing his tiny fists and kicking his feet. His lips were \n     purple from lack of oxygen.\n       Gently, I cradled his head in one hand and placed the \n     fingertips of the other on his soft spot. The skin there felt \n     wonderfully warm, and it pulsed each time he wailed. My heart \n     leapt. This is a life, a person, I thought. He will die on \n     this cold floor.\n       ``Doctor!'' the mother screamed from across the hall. \n     ``Doctor, stop!''\n       The midwife pressed the glass syringe into my hand. It felt \n     strangely heavy. This is just a routine procedure, I argued \n     with myself. It isn't wrong. It's the law.\n       All at once, the baby kicked. His foot caught the barrel of \n     the syringe and pushed it dangerously near his stomach. I \n     jerked it away. This is Christmas Eve! I thought. I can't \n     believe I'm doing this on Christmas Eve!\n       I touched the baby's lips with my index finger. He turned \n     his head to suckle. ``Look, he's hungry,'' I said. ``He wants \n     to live.''\n       I stood up, feeling faint. The syringe slipped from my \n     fingers and shattered on the floor, splattering brownish-\n     yellow liquid on my shoes.\n       I told the midwife to carry the baby into the delivery room \n     and get him ready to go down to Intensive Care. ``I'll ask \n     the supervisor for permission to treat him,'' I said, I felt \n     certain that the senior obstetrician, a woman in her late 50s \n     with two children, would never harm this child.\n\n[[Page S 15074]]\n\n       It was almost 2 a.m. when I knocked at the supervisor's \n     office. Her voice was groggy with sleep. Opening the door, I \n     quickly explained: ``We have a baby boy who was born alive \n     after a rivanol abortion. May I send him to IC?''\n       ``Absolutely not!'' she said from her bed. ``This is a \n     second birth!''\n       ``But he's healthy,'' I insisted. ``Could you please come \n     take a look?''\n       There was a pause, then she replied angrily, ``Why are you \n     asking me this? You know the policy!''\n       Her tone frightened me. ``I'm sorry,'' I said as I shut the \n     door.\n       In staff meetings, the supervisor had frequently reminded \n     us how important the birth-control policy was. Usually she \n     would disclose that someone in a neighboring hospital had \n     been jailed for allowing the birth of a child without a \n     government permit. But recently there had been a chilling \n     incident involving our orderly.\n       He was a taciturn, shabby man in his 50s, whose sole job \n     was to bury infants. He was paid 30 yuan apiece. Burying four \n     infants a day, on average, the orderly earned more than twice \n     the salary of a doctor. ``Why so much?'' I once asked a \n     colleague. ``Because no one else will do what he does,'' she \n     replied.\n       When I pressed for details, she told me that in cases of \n     abortion failure, the man sometimes had to bury the infants \n     alive. ``No matter what happens,'' she explained, ``the \n     birth-control policy must be obeyed.''\n       Weeks after I learned this, a midwife sent the orderly an \n     aborted fetus, which he stored temporarily beneath a \n     stairwell. While the orderly was out, the baby revived and \n     began to cry. A visiting policeman discovered the child and \n     questioned my supervisor. She told him the infant was only an \n     illegal child awaiting burial. The officer apologized for \n     interfering.\n       At the next staff meeting, the word went out: ``Don't send \n     the orderly any fetuses that might be alive. Give the \n     injection.''\n       Now, filled with foreboding, I headed back toward the \n     delivery room. A man with the weatherbeaten face of a peasant \n     grabbed my arm. ``Doctor,'' he pleaded, ``this is the son \n     we've always wanted. Please do not kill him!''\n       I continued down the hall and entered the bathroom. The \n     baby was still lying on the floor. ``Why didn't you do what I \n     instructed?'' I asked the midwife.\n       ``Who is going to pick up this baby?'' she replied. She \n     meant a baby that was not allowed to live.\n       As the midwife looked on in astonishment, I gathered up the \n     crying baby and hurried into the delivery room. I laid him in \n     an infant bed.\n       Under an ultraviolet heat lamp, with the help of oxygen \n     tubes that I taped under his nostrils, his hands and feet \n     soon turned pink. Carefully I wrapped him in a soft blanket.\n       The midwife prepared another syringe--this time with \n     alcohol--and placed it on a tray next to the newborn's bed. \n     ``Don't do this!'' the mother cried again. Grasping the bed \n     rail, she tried to haul herself over the edge. I hurried to \n     her side.\n       ``Calm down,'' I said, easing her back onto the pillow. \n     Whispering, I added, ``I don't want to harm your baby--I'm \n     trying to help.''\n       The woman began to cry. ``Dear lady,'' she said softly, ``I \n     will thank you for the rest of my life.''\n       Just then, the midwife came over with a clipboard. ``What \n     should I put on the report?'' she asked. The last entry read, \n     ``1:30--born alive.'' The chart was supposed to be updated \n     before the midwife went home.\n       ``Don't write anything,'' I answered curtly. Exasperated, \n     the midwife left.\n       I looked at the baby. His cherubic face was ringed by a \n     halo of black hair. This life is a gift from God, I thought. \n     No one has the right to take it away. The thought became so \n     insistent that I had the impression it was being said by \n     someone else. I wondered: Is this how God talks to people?\n       For the next two hours I stood vigil over the child. \n     Gradually he ceased whimpering and fell asleep.\n       Finally, I went to see the supervisor again. ``I'm sorry,'' \n     I told her, ``but I can't do this. I feel it's murder, and I \n     don't want to be a murderer.''\n       The supervisor's voice exploded: ``How can you call \n     yourself an obstetrician? Take care of the problem at once! \n     Don't bother me again!''\n       With my heart beating wildly, I returned to the delivery \n     room. The baby was still asleep, but when I touched his mouth \n     he wheeled to suckle again. ``Still hungry, little one?'' I \n     whispered. My eyes filled with tears.\n       Suddenly, I felt terribly alone. I thought of my father. \n     Would he support me? Despite the early hour, I went to the \n     pay phone in the lobby and dialed. Both parents listened at \n     one receiver as my words poured out. ``I keep hearing God's \n     voice,'' I told them. `` `This is a life,' it says. `You \n     cannot be part of a murder.' ''\n       When I finished, there was a long silence. Finally, my \n     father spoke. ``I am proud of you,'' he said.\n       ``I am, too,'' said my mother, crying softly. ``But you \n     must be careful! Don't write anything down or leave a record. \n     The Party may want to make an example of you.''\n       I understood. During the Cultural Revolution, when I was \n     eight years old, my father was arrested for saving the life \n     of an official who was considered a ``counterrevolutionary.'' \n     My father had been exiled to the countryside while my mother \n     was sent to a labor camp. My four-year-old brother and I were \n     left with neighbors. Those years had been hard. I remembered \n     my mother's stories of torture and starvation.\n       My determination wavered. Then my father spoke again. ``You \n     are a child of God, and so is this baby,'' he said simply. \n     ``Killing him would be like killing your own brother.''\n       I hung up and hurried back. The maternity ward was in \n     chaos. The delivery-room door had been locked, and the baby's \n     father was pounding on it and screaming, ``Don't kill my \n     child!''\n       I ran into the delivery room through a side door. There, \n     beside the baby's bed, my supervisor stood with a syringe, \n     feeling for the soft spot. The infant's blanket and oxygen \n     tubes had been stripped away. He was crying violently. \n     ``Don't give that injection!'' I shouted as I seized the \n     syringe.\n       ``What are you doing?'' the supervisor yelled. ``You're \n     breaking the law!''\n       Instead of fear, I felt a sense of peace. ``This child \n     committed no crime,'' I replied. ``How can you kill him?''\n       The supervisor gaped at me. Lowering her voice, she said \n     ominously, ``If you continue to disobey, you will never \n     practice medicine again.''\n       ``I would rather not be a doctor than commit murder,'' I \n     said. ``I would rather waive my right to have my own child \n     than kill this one.'' Then a thought occurred to me. ``Why \n     can't I just adopt him?''\n       ``You have completely lost your senses!'' the supervisor \n     cried. After she left, I swaddled the baby again and replaced \n     the oxygen tubes. He quieted down and his color returned.\n       At 8 a.m., the hospital administrator arrived at work and \n     was told what had happened. He summoned me to his office. \n     ``Why are you unwilling to do your duty?'' he demanded. ``Are \n     these people friends of yours? Did you take money from \n     them?''\n       ``I don't even speak their dialect!'' I said angrily. ``And \n     you can search me for money if you want.''\n       Minutes later, a senior bureaucrat from the local Family \n     Planning Office walked into the room and took a folder out of \n     an expensive attache case. He began to read the text of a \n     local directive on birth control: ``Those who obstruct Family \n     Planning officers from performing duties shall be subject to \n     punishment. . . .''\n       When he finished, he looked at me and said sharply, ``Do \n     you realize it is illegal for this baby to live?''\n       ``None of us has the right to decide that,'' I said.\n       The man grew angry. ``We are talking about government \n     policy here. You have broken the law!''\n       ``I don't feel I have.''\n       ``Very well, he said evenly. ``Let's you and I go and give \n     the injection.''\n       ``No!''\n       ``You admit, then, that you are breaking the law? If so, I \n     have the right to have you arrested right now!''\n       Desperately, I searched for an out. I had been on call more \n     than 24 hours and couldn't think clearly. I felt queasy. ``I \n     am off duty,'' I said weakly. ``My shift is over.''\n       ``Not true,'' he said. ``You haven't finished your tasks.''\n       ``Please,'' I said, Then I began to cry. My legs buckled, \n     and I fell to the floor. The last thing I remember was a \n     spreading blackness before my eyes.\n       When I came to, I was lying outside the doctors lounge. It \n     was almost noon. The baby? I leapt up and ran to the delivery \n     room.\n       The tiny bed was empty. ``Where . . . ?'' I asked the \n     midwife.\n       ``The man from Family Planning ordered us to give the \n     injection,'' she replied, averting her eyes.\n       Despite all my efforts, the little boy had been killed.\n       Over the past decade, accounts of hospital-sanctioned \n     infanticides in China have shown up in numerous publications, \n     from the Washington Post to The Wall Street Journal and \n     Amnesty International. ``Such reports are so widespread and \n     explicit that their truth can hardly be doubted,'' says John \n     S. Aird, former director of the China branch of the U.S. \n     Census Bureau. And yet, like the scattered stories of the \n     Holocaust that filtered into the media during World War II, \n     these dispatches have mostly been ignored. Yin Wong's story \n     may be the most detailed published to date.\n       ``This is the dark underside of China's `one child' \n     policy,'' says Steven W. Mosher, director of the Asian \n     Studies Center at The Claremont Institute in Claremont, \n     Calif. ``The PRC never actually orders infanticide. Yet its \n     harsh demands on local family-planning officials inevitably \n     lead to these unspeakable acts.''\n       This month, Beijing is host to the United Nations' Fourth \n     World Conference on Women, which draws hundreds of \n     population-control experts from around the world. It is \n     bitter irony that this organization has chosen to meet in a \n     country where population-control zealotry has led to what \n     must be described as crimes against humanity.\n       For interfering with China's family-planning policy, Yin \n     Wong was banished to a remote mountain area. Eventually she \n     escaped to the United States, where she has applied for \n     political asylum. Her case is pending.\n       ``I am fortunate,'' she says. ``For now I live in a country \n     where I am not forced to violate my conscience. My colleagues \n     in China are not so lucky. The worst part is how it destroys \n     their souls.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/12/senate-section/article/S15073-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15075-S15076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S 15075]]\n\n\n     COMMERCE, JUSTICE, STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED AGENCIES \n           APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 1996--OCTOBER 12, 1995\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, although the bill has already passed the \nSenate, I want to state my strong opposition to H.R. 2076, the fiscal \nyear 1996 appropriations for the Departments of Commerce, State, \nJudiciary, and related agencies.\n  Mr. President, I believe that H.R. 2076 is the epitome of the \nshortsightedness of the 104th Congress. H.R. 2076 leaves our country at \na disadvantage internationally and it significantly eliminates the past \nemphasis of fighting crime through prevention programs. I am encouraged \nthat the final Senate version of the bill is different from what \nemerged from the appropriations committee. Some of the programs that \nhave been reinstated or have had the appropriations increased are \nbeginning to make serious inroads into the problem of crime in our \ncommunities.\n  I would like to first address the programs that are important to New \nMexicans and that I hope will emerge from conference unscathed. These \nspecific programs are or have the potential of being very successful if \ngiven a chance.\n\n\n                              cops program\n\n  The first program that has proven to be successful is the Community \nOriented Policing Services program, otherwise known as COPS. In 1 year, \nsince the program's inception, New Mexico has received more than 180 \nofficers from the COPS Program. All parts of New Mexico have been \nawarded officer positions. From the Aztec Police Department in the \nnorth and Sunland Park in the south, to Quay County in the east and \nLaguna Pueblo in the west, all have felt the impact of this program.\n  The COPS Program is different from the block grant proposal that was \nin the committee version because it emphasizes the concept of community \npolicing. It gets officers out into the community preventing crimes \nrather than reacting to crimes once they have been committed.\n  Mr. President, I am encouraged that the Senate stripped out the \nlanguage that provided a $1.7 billion block grant for communities. From \nmy understanding, the block grant money could be used to hire \nsecretaries, buy a radar gun, or buy a floodlight for a local jail. The \nlaw enforcement community is against this broad approach. The sentiment \nis best summed up by Donald L. Cahill, the chairman of the national \nlegislative committee for the Fraternal Order of Police, who testified \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee in February on the block grant \ntype proposal. He stated:\n\n       This broader category opens the door to using these funds \n     for numerous purposes other than hiring police officers--such \n     as hiring prosecutors or judges, buying equipment, lighting \n     streets, or whatever. These are all worthwhile--but they \n     won't arrest a single criminal.\n\n  The bottom line is to place more officers on the street and the COPS \nProgram has proven to be successful. That is why the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, the National Sheriffs' Association, and the National Troopers' \nCoalition support the COPS Program.\n  To quote Mr. Cahill again: ``Police are the answer for today and \nprevention is the answer for tomorrow.''\n\n\n                          drug courts program\n\n  Mr. President, I am also encouraged that the Senate adopted Senator \nBiden's amendment that reinstated the drug court concept. In Las \nCruces, NM, we have a drug court that receives State funding. If given \na chance to receive Federal funding, this program could be expanded or \nused as a model for other drug courts throughout the State. This \nprogram has shown to be an innovative way to lower dramatically \nrecidivism rates among those with alcohol problems. The focused \ntreatment program includes frequent drug testing, judicial and \nprobation supervision, drug counseling, detoxification treatment, and \neducational opportunities. Participants in the program who do not \nfinish are prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\n  The Las Cruces drug court demonstrates true partnership with the \ncommunity. It works in conjunction with five other agencies from the \ncommunity: Partners for Prevention, Southwest Counseling Service, \nSouthern New Mexico Human Development, N.M. State University Criminal \nJustice Department, and Dona Ana Branch Community College. The Drug \nCourt Program specifically attacks a problem which has become national \nin scope. If this program is eliminated in conference, the Congress in \nessence is saying that it washes its hands of this matter.\n\n\n                         violence against women\n\n  I am encouraged that the Senate has retained the Violence Against \nWomen Act. By doing so, the Senate is stating that this program does \naddress an issue that has become national in scope and it is a \npriority. I am also encouraged that the Senate today overwhelmingly \nadopted an amendment by my friend and colleague from Delaware, Senator \nBiden, that restores funding for the Violence Against Women Act at the \nlevel requested by the administration.\n  If given the resources, this act has the potential to demonstrate \nthat the Federal Government can make a real difference when dealing \nwith violence against women. Through prosecution, outreach, and \neducation, the Federal Government has assumed the responsibility of a \nfull partner in this cause.\n\n\n                commerce, justice, state appropriations\n\n  I find myself unable to support the final version of the Commerce, \nJustice, State appropriations bill because when the dust finally \nsettled on the structure of the bill, it became clear that the \ninterests of the Nation were not going to be served by its passage.\n  We should not envision our attempts to achieve a balanced budget as \njust a slash and burn process. We need to bias our spending toward \nthose projects that produce real growth in our economy. Growth \ngenerates jobs, better incomes, a higher standard of living for our \ncitizens, and helps to minimize the role of Government in the economy \nby helping to empower workers and businesses to thrive in a global \ntrading environment rather than to be wards of the State. The wards of \nthe State that we are rewarding this year are those contractors winning \nthe 129 military construction projects valued at $795 million above the \nPresident's request in the Defense appropriations bill. This spending \nwas not in the national interest and is all too typical of the sloth \nand waste that has been part of our Nation's appropriations process for \nyears. Do not fool yourselves. Nothing in this process has changed.\n  What we are failing to do in the Commerce, Justice, State \nappropriations bill is to leverage the tremendous entrepreneurial \nbusiness energy in our Nation by partnering with it Federal support to \ndo the things that the private sector cannot or will not do on its own. \nThis bill guts the National Institute of Standards and Technology \n[NIST] which sets standards and develops measurement systems for \nmachine tools as well as componentry in our most advanced high-\ntechnology industries. It has been NIST that has overseen the important \nMalcolm Baldrige Award which has helped encourage and inspire American \nindustry to reach higher levels of performance and quality. The \nManufacturing Extension Program and Advanced Technology Program [ATP] \nare both cut back in this bill, particularly ATP which is practically \nshut down. It is these programs that have helped us move technologies \nprimarily caught in national laboratories and our defense technology \nbase out into the commercial sector. While Japan is redoubling its \nefforts and investing heavily in miniaturization and subatomic level \nprocessing, the United States cannot afford to forego efforts in \nlinking our private sector and our national laboratories.\n  Other programs that are critical to the economic security of the \nNation and either are eliminated or drastically cut back are the \nInternational Trade Administration; Bureau of Export Administration; as \nalready mentioned, NIST; the Economic Development Agency; the National \nTelecommunications and Information Administration; and the Minority \nBusiness Development Agency.\n  I am not opposed to restructuring what our Government does, and I am \nnot opposed either to scaling back Government. I am, however, committed \nto economic growth and think that we must set tough standards by which \nto measure the need for and role of Government in our economic \nactivities. There is such a role. The invisible hand that so often we \nhear about is only \n\n[[Page S 15076]]\nthere to strangle us if we do not understand what the invisible hand \nresponds to and what it does not.\n  As I have mentioned before on the floor of this Chamber, I would \nrecommend that those who frequently call on the ghost of Adam Smith and \nsubscribe to the prescriptions of the invisible hand pull from their \nshelves a copy of ``Wealth of Nations.'' Dust it off and give it \nanother good read. Smith clearly outlines the role of Government, a \nperspective with which I would agree.\n  He states that first, the State has a ``night watchman function,'' to \nsee to the safety and security of its citizens. He argues that the \nState must educate its labor force--something that we do poorly in this \nNation. He continues that the State must build the infrastructure on \nwhich commerce depends; that it must build roads, canals, bridges; and \nin the modern context, airports, the national information \ninfrastructure, basic research laboratories, and export assistance \noffices. The Government must pay for itself and must therefore tax and \ncharge for its services. And the Government must support development of \nthose technologies that are not at first easily commercializable--in \nhis day, shipbuilding, and in ours, nuclear energy. Adam Smith himself \noutlines these as the indispensable functions of Government, of \nminimalist Government, and leaves the rest to be fixed by the market.\n  Those of us who are tasked with the responsibilities of writing \nbudgets and voting on them cannot neglect the indispensable roles that \nGovernment does have. But I believe that the theologies driving recent \nRepublican budgets have neglected these roles. And we must revisit this \neffort knowing that while we must cut our budget deficit, we must also \npromote high-end economic growth which creates high wage jobs and a \nbetter standard of living for our citizens. And enmeshed as we are in a \nglobal economy, we have to export more and erase the chronic deficits \nthat represent real job-leakage from our economy.\n  I look forward to voting in favor of a Commerce, Justice, State \nappropriations bill that cuts back unproductive investments that the \ngovernment makes in favor of those that address the welfare of our \nNation, now and into the future. But I am afraid that this bill does \nnot help to secure the welfare of our citizens.\n  In closing Mr. President, I am disappointed at this legislation as it \nwas presented to the Senate. I am happy that we have been able to make \nsome changes to the more misguided portions of the bill and I am also \nglad that the managers have agreed to accept amendments I intended to \noffer to the bill. However, I cannot support a bill that takes our \nNation back in time and dismantles programs upon which we should be \nbasing our future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/12/senate-section/article/S15075-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15076-S15077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NEEDED: IMMIGRATION REFORM WHICH PROTECTS FAMILIES AND U.S. WORKERS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in the coming weeks, the full Senate will \nbe engaged in the important issue of reforming the immigration laws. \nOur principal goal is to provide the additional authority needed to \ncombat illegal immigration. Initial progress is being made as a result \nof increases in resources and personnel of the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service to deal with this ongoing crisis that is so \nharmful to the country, but much needs to be done.\n  It would be a mistake, however, to allow the Nation's concerns about \nillegal immigration to create an unjustified and unwarranted backlash \nin Congress over legal immigration.\n  Legal immigrants come to America within the limits prescribed in the \nimmigration laws. They join their families, roll up their sleeves, and \ncontribute to U.S. communities. There is every reason to believe that \ntoday's new Americans will build an even stronger America for the next \ngeneration just as our immigrant predecessors did for us.\n  It is especially important, therefore, that any reforms of the laws \ngoverning legal immigration must protect families and U.S. workers.\n  Most Americans agree that U.S. citizens should have the right to \nbring spouses, children, and other close family members to this country \nto be with them here if they wish to do so. Yet, there are those who \nwould deny American citizens the privilege to reunite their families in \nAmerica.\n  Proposals currently before Congress would make it illegal for an \nAmerican citizen to bring a parent who is under age 65. It would be \nillegal for Americans to bring in their adult children. And it would be \nillegal to bring in a brother or sister.\n  In each of these cases, under current law, the U.S. citizen must \nagree to sponsor their relatives--to provide for them if they fall on \nhard times. And we must take additional steps to ensure that U.S. \ncitizens fulfill their sponsorship obligations and be prepared to take \nlegal action against them when they fail to care for their immigrant \nrelatives.\n  Clearly, some reforms may be desirable in the numbers admitted each \nyear. But we should not deny U.S. citizens the privilege of family \nreunification--whether it involves their parents, their adult children, \nor their brothers and sisters.\n  In the case of brothers and sisters, large numbers of Americans have \nalready paid millions of dollars in fees to the Federal Government to \nhave their siblings join them in America. Yet, not only are there those \nwho would eliminate this immigration for the future, they would even \ndeny any possibility of family reunification here for those Americans \nwho have paid hard-earned dollars to the Government and waited \npatiently for their brothers and sisters to come.\n  In addition to protecting families, our laws governing legal \nimmigration must also protect U.S. workers. When immigrants come here \nat the request of an employer to fill a job vacancy, and not for family \nreunification, we must make certain that they do not displace a U.S. \nworker from that job. And we must ensure that employers do not underpay \nimmigrants and undercut the wages of American workers.\n  Our immigration laws have enabled dedicated workers to come here to \ncontribute their skills and ingenuity to American businesses. At times, \nthey have made the difference between the success and failure of an \nenterprise and have saved American jobs in the process.\n  Nevertheless, in many respects, the laws and procedures governing \nimmigration for employment fail to protect U.S. workers adequately. \nAlthough U.S. employers are required to attempt to recruit U.S. workers \nbefore turning to immigrants, this process results in the hire of an \nAmerican worker less than one-half of 1 percent of the time. Clearly, \nthe current recruitment requirement does not work and is widely \nignored.\n  I am particularly concerned that the laws permitting temporary \nforeign workers to come to this country have not kept pace with changes \nin the labor market. U.S. companies are resorting increasingly to \ntemporary hires, rather than permanent employees, and are contracting \nout functions which they previously performed in-house with permanent \nstaff. The growth of temporary and part-time employees in the labor \nmarket means that temporary foreign workers are now in direct \ncompetition with this new class of American worker.\n  Lax immigration standards on temporary foreign workers--so-called \nnonimmigrants--have enabled computer consulting firms, health care \nproviders, and too many others to turn to temporary foreign workers. As \nsome U.S. companies lay off U.S. workers from their permanent payrolls, \nthey are hiring temporary foreign workers to take their places.\n  This practice cannot be permitted to continue. I join with the \nchairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, Senator Simpson, in seeking \nreforms of this aspect of our immigration laws. Clearly, when employers \ncannot find a qualified U.S. worker, the immigration laws should fill \nthe gap. But these laws must not be a pretext for hiring cut-rate \nforeign labor at the expense of U.S. workers.\n  The immigration issue is about our roots as Americans. It is also \nabout how we see our future. We all agree that we must control illegal \nimmigration. But very different considerations apply to legal \nimmigrants. In the process of enacting immigration reform, we must \nremember and honor the many benefits which legal immigrants have \n\n[[Page S 15077]]\nbrought to our Nation. The reforms we enact must crack down on illegal \nimmigrants, but they must also protect U.S. workers and the right of \nAmerican citizens to reunite with their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/12/senate-section/article/S15076-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of H.R. 927, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 927) to seek international sanctions against \n     the Castro Government in Cuba, to plan for support of a \n     transition Government leading to a democratically elected \n     Government in Cuba, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Dole amendment No. 2898, in the nature of a substitute.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am about 6 minutes late in reaching the \nSenate floor because of my responsibility of presiding this morning \nover the Foreign Relations Committee, at which our former Senator \nSasser from Tennessee appeared as President Clinton's nominee to serve \nas U.S. Ambassador to Communist China.\n  It was good to see so many people from Tennessee, including Senator \nSasser's attractive family. I listened with great interest to his \ntestimony.\n  Mr. President, we now resume consideration of the Libertad bill \ninvolving the question of whether the United States will continue to \ntolerate a Communist tyrant 90 miles off our shore, the tyrant being, \nof course, Fidel Castro.\n  We have a lot of friendly activity around this place from time to \ntime, bipartisan some of it, but much of it intensely partisan. But \nafter all is said and done, most of the times those who participate in \npartisan exchanges leave the Senate Chamber with friendships intact. \nThat is what I so often do with the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut [Mr. Dodd].\n  Senator Dodd is an interesting gentleman. He is the son of a \ndistinguished U.S. Senator whom I knew. And I think it is fair to say--\nand I know that Chris Dodd, the present Senator, would acknowledge the \nfact--that he and his father differed very sharply in their \nphilosophical views, their views about foreign policy, and so forth. \nThat is certainly the case with respect to the pending legislation, the \nso-called Helms-Burton bill.\n  This Libertad bill has already been passed by the House. Yesterday, \nthe distinguished majority leader, Mr. Dole, made the judgment that it \nwas time for the Senate to act on the Senate version of the bill. They \nare almost identical. But Senator Dole realized that the Senate would \nhave to confront another filibuster by our Democrat friends.\n  Now, our friends across the aisle here have filibustered just about \neverything that has come up this year. A filibuster is not unusual \nbecause it is done by both sides. As a matter of fact, I must confess \nonce or twice at least in my years in the Senate I have raised \nquestions at some length about various pieces of legislation.\n  But as I listened to Senator Chris Dodd yesterday while he spoke at \nsome length about the pending Cuban Libertad bill, I frankly could not \ntell which bill he was talking about. He certainly was not talking \nabout the bill pending at that time, which in fact is pending now, the \nLibertad Act. He was talking about some imaginary bill that was totally \nunrecognizable to me. I decided it was mostly tongue-in-cheek on his \npart. But it is hard to tell.\n  Anyway, Mr. President, I thought about it last night as I was driving \nhome, and again this morning. I wish that Senator Dodd were here now. \nHe may presently be, because he, like me, is a member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, and he attended the Sasser hearing this morning.\n  But, as I listened to Senator Dodd's oratory talking about a \nnonexistent bill, I made the judgment that I would like to join him in \nopposing the bill that he was condemning--a fictional bill that does \nnot exist, a bill that has nothing to do with the pending legislation \nwhich the clerk has just reported.\n  That said, let us talk about what is before the Senate, the pending \nCuban Libertad bill. It goes by various names. The Senate version is \nknown as the Dole-Helms Libertad Act.\n  When I first introduced my version early this year--with Congressman \nBurton offering very similar legislation in the House, it became the \nHelms-Burton bill.\n  I don't care whose name is attached to it or who gets the credit for \nit; I believe that the U.S. Government and the American people had \nbetter make clear that we are not going to kowtow to Fidel Castro, a \nCommunist who has murdered literally thousands of his own people, a \ntyrant who has imprisoned his political enemies for as long as 30 \nyears.\n  And yet there are some voices in this country, and in this Senate, \nwho say, well, we need to get along with Fidel Castro and we need to \ntrade with Castro. Well, that reminds me of the distinguished Prime \nMinister of England, Neville Chamberlain, who went over to Munich to \nmeet with Adolph Hitler. Chamberlain returned to London exuberant. \nBoasting, in effect: ``We can do business with this fellow Hitler. We \ncan have peace in our time.'' And the press in England, the London \nTimes and all the rest, put Lord Chamberlain all over their front \npages, praising Chamberlain to the skies.\n  But there was one patriot who dared to stand up to be counted, who \nsaid: ``Wait a minute. I will not be a party to this.'' That voice was \nWinston Churchill, and as Paul Harvey says, now you know the rest of \nthe story.\n  Neither the British nor anybody else had peace in their time. Adolph \nHitler was a bloody tyrant. World War II put an end to Hitler and \nWinston Churchill led the free world to victory over tyranny. Winston \nChurchill has gone down in history as a hero. Neville Chamberlain is \nall but forgotten.\n  But what is before this body, Mr. President--let us call it the Dole-\nHelms Libertad Act--is simply a proposal to perfect and improve a bill \nthat passed the House of Representatives by a margin of 294 to 130 \nearlier this year.\n  So what is now before the Senate is a bill that has been improved to \nreflect the legitimate concerns of the Clinton administration and \nothers who support the pending Libertad Act.\n  Now, let me try to focus in on some of the details of the pending \nbill. Title I of the Dole-Helms Libertad Act is designed to be the next \nlogical step in building on the Cuban Democracy Act.\n  The Cuban Democracy Act was passed by Congress and signed into law in \n1992. It was intended to strengthen the U.S. embargo against Castro. It \nwas intended to seek, aggressively, international sanctions against \nFidel Castro's repressive regime, and it was intended to support \ndirectly the Cuban people who were being brutalized by Fidel Castro and \nhis henchmen.\n  Mr. President, some of the provisions of the Dole-Helms substitute:\n  First, to authorize the President, whoever he may be, to furnish \nassistance to support democracy-building efforts and to assist victims \nof political repression and to facilitate visits of international human \nrights monitors;\n  Second, to prohibit loans, credits or other financing for \ntransactions involving U.S. property that has been confiscated by the \nCastro thugs;\n  Third, condition any U.S. aid that may be contemplated to any \nrepublics that belonged to the former Soviet Union. Such conditions \nwill be based on whether these former republics are now subsidizing the \nCastro economy or are benefiting from Cuban intelligence facilities \ndirected against the United States. The Dole-Helms bill authorizes the \nPresident to implement a fully reciprocal exchange of news bureaus \nbetween the United States and Cuba. \n\n[[Page S 15078]]\nSome of these sections already speak to actions the President has \nalready taken. Nothing in the pending bill--nothing--prevents the \nexercise of lawful Presidential authority. What it does is place the \nCongress of the United States--the House of Representatives and this \nSenate--on record as being concerned with the direction of certain \nexecutive branch activities.\n  Now let us get to what is identified as the spending Dole-Helms bill. \nTitle III of the substitute is the most misunderstood part of the bill, \nand it is the most important section.\n  What title III does, Mr. President, is protect the interests of U.S. \nnationals whose property was wrongfully confiscated by Fidel Castro and \nhis henchmen. It does this by making persons or entities that knowingly \nand intentionally exploit stolen properties--United States properties, \nthat is--in Cuba liable for damages in United States district court.\n  The intent, of course, is to deter third country nationals from \nseeking to profit from wrongfully confiscated properties--and to deny \nFidel Castro what he needs most to survive: hard cash.\n  Title III specifically establishes the private civil right of \naction--that is, a right to sue in U.S. courts--for any U.S. national \nhaving ownership of a claim to commercial property confiscated by \nCastro against a person or entity who is knowingly benefiting from the \nuse of such confiscated property. In other words, making profit off \nstolen goods. That is the simple term.\n  The intent of this provision is to create a deterrence so that \nforeign investors do not unjustly benefit from American property \nconfiscated by Fidel Castro and his henchmen.\n  But there are a number of conditions that an American claimant must \nsatisfy before he can even get into court. The Libertad Act now pending \nprovides a 6-month period between this provision's enactment and the \nability of a claimant to use the remedy. It requires an affirmative \nduty to notify a potential defendant about the claim to the confiscated \nproperty, and it provides treble damages only after an additional \nnotice has been given.\n  It requires that the claim meet a minimum amount in controversy, a \nminimum amount of $50,000 exclusive of court costs. It requires service \nof process in accordance with existing laws and rules, including that \nany actions brought against a State entity must be in accordance with \nthe Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. That was the reason I was puzzled \nby some of the things Senator Dodd was saying yesterday, and I am sorry \nhe is not here to discuss them with me.\n  Finally, it provides that certified claimants who use this right of \naction are not denied U.S. Government espousal if they do not receive \nfull compensation, but it reduces any responsibility to espouse by the \namount of any recovery, and it discharges the United States from \nresponsibility with respect to the certified claim if the claimant \nreceives equal or greater compensation through this right of action.\n  Now then, I think it is essential to make it clear what title III \ndoes not do. It does not require, nor does not authorize, the United \nStates Government to espouse the claims of a naturalized person in any \nsettlement with a future Cuban Government. All sorts of legalistic \nmeanderings have insinuated that this bill does that. Strike it, it \ndoes not do that.\n  Title III is the most important part, in my judgment, of the Libertad \nAct because, in addition to protecting our own citizens' property \nrights, it will deny the Castro Government access to the taking of \nforeign hard cash that Castro has been using to prop up his tottering \nregime, and to continue his enslavement of the Cuban people.\n\n  Oh, yes, I can understand that these thieves in the night, who \noperate in the dark shadows of international commerce, are upset that \nour action might end the free ride that they have been enjoying while \npocketing a great deal of blood money. But it is time for simple \njustice; it is a moral duty and responsibility that we do this.\n  We become a part of what we condone, Mr. President. If we further \ncondone Fidel Castro, we are a part of Fidel Castro's tyranny. And I do \nnot intend to be a part of that. It is time that we serve notice on our \nprincipal trading partners that they should be ashamed of themselves--\nashamed of themselves--for having anything to do with such activity by \nany of their own nationals, or to stand idly by without speaking out \nwhen it is done by others.\n  They have a moral duty. We have a moral duty, and that is what this \nbill is all about.\n  What it does not do, contrary to what the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut was implying yesterday, is, it does not adversely affect, \nin any way, the rights of any certified American claimants. Not one.\n  What it does not do is create an open door for voluminous Federal \nlitigation. It will not happen. Henny Penny can quiet down, the skies \nare not going to fall. What it also does not do is create new burdens \nfor this or any future Cuban Government. The target is international \ntraffickers, and the remedy has been designed to achieve that goal.\n  Once again, despite insinuations, suggestions, allegations, whatever, \nthat no certified claimants support this bill, the fact is that \ncountless hundreds of them do indeed support the Libertad Act--for \nexample, Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive, Chrysler, Consolidated \nDevelopment Corp., and many others.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, what the Libertad Act also does not do is \nburden the executive branch of our own Government, in a time of \ntransition, from fashioning effective agreements with a Cuban \ntransition government. It should enhance the ability of the President \nof the United States to fashion effective remedies, discouraging \ntrafficking in property owned by U.S. citizens.\n  Now, lest it escape the understanding of anybody, let us be clear \nabout how Castro and his cronies acquired these ``confiscated'' \nproperties. He stole them. He stole them from their rightful owners, \nand now that he is desperate for hard currency to sustain his regime, \nCastro is offering foreign investors a subjugated labor force. He is \noffering foreign investors a low-cost use of this property, the same \nstolen properties that belong to American citizens.\n  If there ever was unjust enrichment at the expense of U.S. citizens, \nthis is it, and it has to stop. We must, in my judgment, as a \nresponsible U.S. Senate, vote to throttle Fidel Castro. That is why the \nLibertad Act is more important than ever before.\n  Since the introduction of the Libertad Act, the news media have \nreported on numerous occasions that foreign investments in Cuba are \nslowing down because of concerns that the bill will be enacted. The \nMiami Herald reported in June of this year, ``One Canadian firm called \noff plans to expand its involvement in Cuba, and other investors have \nslowed down their plans to avoid committing any cash before the fate of \nHelms-Burton is decided.''\n  In July of this year, 3 months ago, the National Law Journal \nreported: ``The chilling specter of lawyers enforcing the embargo has \nled more than one foreign investor to conclude that investing in Cuba \nmay not be worth the risk of having their U.S. assets attacked by \ncompanies that once did business on the island.''\n  Many foreign investors are leaving Cuba because Castro continues to \nconfiscate property. A German investor wrote an op-ed piece in USA \nToday in September, saying ``My trust in the Cuban marketplace has been \nseverely shattered, and I want to issue a warning to eager potential \ninvestors from the United States: In Cuba, you have to learn to live \nwith out-of-control communism. I have learned my lesson.''\n  Mr. President, this German investor was taken by Castro's security \nagents to their headquarters and was later put on a plane back to \nGermany. Cuban officials confiscated much of his belongings.\n  Now, that is the way the Castro regime operates; that is the way it \nhas always operated. It used to be that Americans stood united about \nthis Communist threat 90 miles off our shore. But now we are changing, \nala Neville Chamberlain, who went over to Munich and consulted with \nAdolf Hitler and came back and said, ``We can have peace in our time. \nWe can do business with Adolf Hitler.'' But nobody could do business \nwith Adolf Hitler, and we should not be doing business with Fidel \nCastro. They are two peas in the same pod. \n\n[[Page S 15079]]\n\n  The Libertad Act is certainly worth the support of every Senator. \nEvery Senator will not support it; but I ask support for this bill, as \ndoes Senator Dole, because it is the right thing to do for America. I \nask support for the bill because it is the right thing to do for the \nCuban people. Ask the Cubans how they feel about it. The ones still in \nCuba, the ones who are in exile in this country and elsewhere.\n  I have received countless letters of support, Mr. President, from \nCubans still in Cuba, pleading for this Senate to enact the Libertad \nbill into law. Their hope for freedom is at stake. These people are \nsupporting this bill, fully aware that for having done so, they are \nrisking persecution by Fidel Castro.\n  As far as I am concerned, they are the heroes of the Libertad Act. I \nthink Senators ought to bear that in mind when the time comes, if it \ncomes, to vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise with all due respect to my good \nfriend, the Senator from North Carolina, whom I have worked with over \nmany, many years. And certainly in the days of his chairmanship of the \nAgriculture Committee, we had many good times working together.\n  However, I oppose this bill for many reasons. I was in the service of \nthe United States Navy at the time that Fidel Castro assumed control of \nCuba and have done everything since that time to try to bring about a \nchange in that Government.\n  I have a strong difference of opinion on the approach which is \nimportant for this Nation to take at this time to bring about the \nchange of government there.\n  For over 30 years, we have maintained an embargo against Cuba with a \nstated purpose of bringing about the demise of the totalitarian regime. \nHowever, our embargo has not brought about the political and democratic \nchange legitimately desired by the Cuban people.\n  I support the Cuban people in their desire to do that. It is just a \nquestion of how you do it. It is not a question of the goal here. It is \na question of how we reach that goal. It harms a majority of the Cuban \npeople without affecting the ruling elite, and the Cuban Government is \na major impediment to the United States exerting positive pressure for \nchange in Cuba.\n  Further, Cuba today poses no strategic or political threat to our \nNation. We ask ourselves, then, will the provisions of this bill hasten \nthe change we all desire? I think the answer is clearly no.\n  I believe the provisions of this bill are, in fact, harmful to U.S. \ninterests. Many of our closest allies--Canada, Great Britain, and \nMexico--vehemently oppose the extraterritorial provisions in this bill \nas infringing on their sovereignty. They oppose this bill even though \nthey share our unstinting commitment to bring democratic change to \nCuba.\n  The bill would have little impact on non-United States investment in \ntrade in Cuba, which is growing despite our embargo.\n  Mr. President, the provisions of this bill regarding property \nconfiscations set a dangerous precedent, moving far beyond any existing \nlaw we have had in the history of this Nation. Under this bill, \nclaimants could sue individual companies or government entities--\nforeign as well as domestic--regardless of whether the claimants were \nUnited States nationals at the time of the alleged confiscation. This \nbill attempts to confer retroactive rights of suit upon individuals and \ncompanies that were not U.S. nationals at the time their Cuban \nproperties were taken.\n  The ramifications of this in all other situations similar around this \nworld are staggering. This bill would confer a right to sue upon a \nspecific national-origin group, which has never been done before. The \nUnited States has never conferred such rights on any such group.\n  The group that we refer to if this is opened up would be those that \nlost their property in China and Vietnam, Korea or anywhere else, who \nnow came to this country--that is, those who fled the nations and came \nhere, Vietnamese, too--and now have become United States citizens could \ngo back as United States citizens to make claims. This has never \nhappened before.\n  This bill would dilute the certified claims. We will talk here about \na pot of money, if there ever is one. And what it would do is dilute by \nso much those legitimate claims under existing law, it would be totally \nunfair to the legitimate rights of the U.S. citizens at the time.\n  It would swamp the U.S. courts with thousands upon thousands of \nlawsuits, causing an explosion of litigation, costing programs billions \nof dollars. This possibility alone virtually ensures that the measure \nwould be completely unwieldy. Citizens could have a hard time bringing \nany other matters before the courts.\n  This measure could also wreak havoc with some of our most important \nallies and trading partners by exposing their nationals to a flurry of \nlawsuits in U.S. courts.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is that this bill does nothing for \nour efforts to promote a democratic Cuba. It does nothing for U.S. \neconomic interests. Most importantly, it does nothing but create a \npotential benefit for a small group of people at potentially great cost \nto the American taxpayers.\n  Therefore, I must say I vehemently oppose this bill as being contrary \nto the interests of the United States and the citizens of the United \nStates. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, our Nation has passed into a new period \nin our history, out of the cold war and into a time that will be \nentirely different than what we experienced during the cold war. \nChildren studying history will look in textbooks and see clearly the \ndemarcation between that period of the cold war and what we are now \nbeginning to experience. They will see the breaking point, when the \nBerlin Wall fell, when the Soviet Union collapsed, when economic \nstrength rather than military might began to define a country's real \nposition in the world.\n  It seems that just about everyone knows that history is dragging our \ncountry forward, that we need to adjust to new circumstances. And \neveryone seems to know this but those who are, in fact, making \ndecisions in this area that this bill deals with.\n  The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, or the Helms-Burton \nbill, sends us not forward into this new era, but rather back about 30 \nyears. Our Nation's foreign policy is rife with anachronisms, and I \ncannot personally be supportive of helping to reinforce and to entrench \nour foreign policy in these outmoded and outdated policies.\n  The issue we are discussing today is not whether the United States \nsupports a peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba. Everybody here \nwants to see that occur. That goal is not in question. The means of \ngetting there is what is in question. I feel that the provisions of the \nHelms-Burton bill will stall rather than help our efforts to get to a \ndemocratic regime in Cuba.\n  About a week ago, the President of the United States announced a plan \nthat received much bipartisan praise. The President promised to more \nvigorously enforce unlicensed travel to Cuba, but to broaden support \nfor cultural and intellectual in a way that the \n\n[[Page S 15080]]\npeople of Cuba could encounter more frequently and broadly the benefits \nof democracy that are at work here in the United States. The President \nstated that he would license nongovernmental organizations to operate \nin Cuba, to provide information, to provide on a relief basis, when \nneeded, the necessary infrastructure to help guide Cuba and its people \ntoward democracy in the future.\n  The President also noted that Cuban-Americans with relatives still in \nCuba will be permitted to visit Cuba to tend a family crises, and that \nthese automatic one-time-per-year licenses to visit would not be \nstymied by the current delays and management problems that frustrate \nAmerican citizens from getting to Cuba when family emergencies exist.\n  The President is also instructing that Western Union be licensed to \nhandle wire transfers of funds to families in need on that island.\n  But do any of these proposed actions by the President strengthen \nCastro's hand? In my view, they do not. What these provisions do is \nhelp bond the people of Cuba to the people of the United States. For 34 \nyears, we have tried to bring Fidel Castro down with heavy-handed \ntactics. One would think that during such a long period of time we \nmight have figured out that our policy has not been successful.\n  We need a new direction that must involve building bridges with the \nCuban people. They have in them the beginning of a policy that will \nbring democracy to Cuba. This bill does not help in that process. I do \nthink that the President's plan is an important step in the right \ndirection. The Helms-Burton legislation which we are now dealing with \non the Senate floor would injure and alienate ordinary Cubans; it would \nweaken Cuba's civil society and retard the fledgling efforts to move \ntoward democratization in that country, and the unprecedented effort to \nimpose United States policies on other countries would make it more \ndifficult for the United States Government to cooperate with its allies \nin fashioning a joint approach toward Cuba.\n  We cannot endlessly bully our allies around the world on issues \nrelated to trade, except when the most severe national interests of our \nNation are at stake. We have had 34 years of stalemate with regard to \nCuba. Finally, things seem to be indicating some transition is \noccurring.\n  Now is not the time to do battle with Europe and with Asia over our \nrelations with Cuba. Now is the time to develop strategies to help this \nnation as it does move into a new order.\n  Mr. President, I must also mention the serious concern I have with \ntitle III of the bill which creates the right for United States persons \nwho were not United States citizens at the time of property \nexpropriation to sue in United States Federal courts persons who \ntraffic in United States properties in Cuba.\n  This provision will provide an unfunded mandate on our Federal \ncourts. It will lead to a flood of new lawsuits, costing U.S. taxpayers \nhundreds of millions of dollars in court expenses. Furthermore, the \n$50,000 threshold that this bill contemplates in such cases means that \nwe are primarily addressing the needs of relatively wealthy Cubans and \nneglecting those who were victimized but, in fact, were less well off.\n  If we are to make decisions of this sort, we should respond to the \ncrimes committed and not to the particular wealth of the individuals \nwho were harmed. Nevertheless, to handle this matter in American courts \nwould certainly impede current U.S. efforts to resolve outstanding \nproperty claims disputes. It would impede economic reform efforts by a \ntransition government in Cuba, and it would overburden our already \noverburdened Federal courts.\n  In the Inter-American Dialog it was recently reported that used only \nas an instrument of pressure the embargo that we currently have against \nCuba is not effective in promoting reform. It may well have the \nopposite result of stiffening resistance to change. Constructive use of \nthe embargo requires that the United States open an active dialog with \nthe Cuban Government to foster Cuba's democratization and encourage a \nrange of political and economic reforms.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to add one last caution, as others \nhave stated here on the floor, with regard to this legislation. This \nbill was not reported out of the Foreign Affairs Committee. It did not \ngo through a markup.\n  This bill is handling matters that are very consequential for our \nrelations with that nation. In such consequential matters we clearly \nneed to scrutinize what we are doing, act with caution.\n  I believe we need to follow the normal practice which exists here in \nthe Senate and has for many years. That is, to allow committees to work \non legislation, allow committees to revise legislation before that \nlegislation is brought to the full Senate for passage or defeat.\n  I urge my colleagues not to support this bill as it now stands. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before he departs the floor, let me commend \nour colleague from New Mexico for a very thoughtful and eloquent \nstatement regarding the pending legislation before the Senate.\n  I particularly want to highlight his comments with regard to title \nIII of this bill. I mentioned this last evening, Mr. President, but I \nwill reiterate the point that the Senator from New Mexico has raised \nthis afternoon. I urge my colleagues to focus their attention on this \nparticular section.\n  Under existing law there are some 6,000 claimants--legitimate \nclaimants--under law that has existed for four decades in this country, \nthat says in order to be a bona fide claimant where there has been an \nexpropriation of property in a foreign country and noncompensation for \nthat property, then those people have a right to go to the U.S. claims \ncourt.\n  The U.S. Government acts as their agent, in effect. It is not just \naccess to the court. We then ask our Government to pursue these matters \non behalf of U.S. citizens.\n  This law now expands the universe of claimants from the 6,000 who \nexist and who were U.S. citizens at the time the expropriation took \nplace to an estimated 430,000 claimants, because the law now says even \nthough you were not a U.S. citizen at the time of the expropriation, if \nyou became one later then you have the right to use the U.S. courts to \npursue those claims.\n  We are carving out an exception--even if my colleagues want to do \nthat, we are carving out an exception--just in the case of Cuba. There \nare 37 other nations, Mr. President, where we have expropriation \nmatters pending. If we extended that same right to other nationals now \nin our country, U.S. citizens, you would absolutely overwhelm the U.S. \ncourts.\n  The average cost to process a claim is $4,500. Just in this case, if \nthe estimates are correct, in excess of 400,000 claims, it will cost \nthe U.S. taxpayers millions and millions of dollars.\n  If for no other reason--put aside what the bill may or may not do to \nthe government of Fidel Castro--the first question all of us must ask \nis what are we doing to ourselves? If you analyze this bill in the \ncontext of what we are doing to ourselves someone ought to be willing \nto provide some appropriations here and expand the courts and the \npersonnel in order to handle this tremendous tidal wave of matters that \nwill come before them.\n  I point out, Mr. President, the 6,000 claimants have expressed their \nstrident opposition to this bill for the legitimate reason that they \nfeel their rightful claims will be overwhelmed as a result of the \nincreased numbers who will be seeking to have their claims adjudicated \nby the U.S. claims court.\n  I want to compliment my colleague from New Mexico for raising that \nparticular point in this bill.\n  I also suggest that we are finding ourselves more and more isolated \non this question. It is not a debate about whether or not we want \nchange in Cuba. I do not believe there is any dissension in this body \non that issue at all.\n  The question is whether or not in our response, our emotional \nresponse to Cuba, that we are thinking carefully and prudently and \nwisely in seeking the kind of cooperation and support you need to have \nif you are going to be effective in those desires.\n  There are 58 countries doing business in Cuba today whether we like \nit or not. In fact, it is expanding, not contracting. If you are going \nto be effective in bringing together the kind of economic pressures you \nhave to have \n\n[[Page S 15081]]\nsome cooperation internationally. That is not the only reason to do \nthese things.\n  There was a vote in the United Nations on Cuba. Only one other \ncountry joined us--one other country joined the United States, and that \nwas Israel. The irony is Israel does business--businesses do business \nin Cuba. It puts us in a very awkward untenable position of not only \nharming ourselves but also having no impact whatever on Cuba itself.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at this legislation no matter how \nstrongly you may feel. I understand those feelings, about what the \nCuban Government has done to the people of Cuba since 1959. We need to \nbe thoughtful about how we are approaching the problem. We are doing \nbusiness in the People's Republic of China. We just granted diplomatic \nstatus to Vietnam. Here we are now going to say that it is all right to \ndo things there to try and effectuate change, but here we are creating \na different standard altogether.\n  Again, my compliments to our colleague from New Mexico. I thank him \nfor his comments and urge my colleagues in the coming hour to take a \ngood hard look at this bill and ask yourself the question, whether or \nnot this legislation is in the best interests of our country. What does \nit do to those legitimate claimants who are counting on these courts to \nprocess those claims so they can be compensated for the expropriation \nthat has occurred?\n  Mr. SIMON. Would my colleague yield?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SIMON. I just walked on to the floor, I confess, and heard \nSenator Dodd speaking.\n  When he asked the question, what are we doing to ourselves --that is \nreally the fundamental question. What is our self-interest?\n  It so happens earlier today a woman asked me why have we not been in \nVietnam getting business? She says the French--she is in an agriculture \nimplement business--the French and Japanese and others are in there \ngetting the business that we should have been getting.\n  Well, the answer is we should have been there but we have been \nresponding to the national passion rather than the national interest. \nWe have to ask, what is in our own best interest.\n  Passing this kind of legislation may bring cheers from certain \nquarters. It does not help the United States of America, and it does \nnot help people in Cuba who want freedom.\n  I commend my colleagues for standing up on this. We have to send a \nmessage to the rest of the world that we are going to work with the \nrest of the world, including governments we do not like.\n  I do not like Castro's government. In the area of human rights their \nrecord is miserable. But I have to say, so is the record of China. We \nare working with China. We are cuddling up to China a little more than \nI like, frankly.\n  But I do think if China wants to buy a Ford tractor from the United \nStates, we should sell them a Ford tractor.\n  I think of our relations with Cuba back when there was a Soviet \nUnion. If Moscow and Castro got together and said how can we design \nU.S. policy to keep Castro in power, they could not have designed a \nbetter policy than the one we follow. We have isolated Castro and we \nhave made him a hero among his people for standing up to the big bully, \nthe United States.\n  This legislation is not in our national interests. I commend my \ncolleague.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just commend both my colleagues, \nthe Senator from Illinois and the Senator from Connecticut. They have \nspoken out on this issue before. Of course, the Senator from \nConnecticut is the ranking member on the subcommittee which has \njurisdiction in this area and does an excellent job in providing \nleadership to us on these issues.\n  I do think our policy with regard to Cuba is an anachronism today. \nThis legislation would further entrench that same policy and further \nharden that policy in a way that I think would result in delaying \ndemocracy coming to Cuba. I think that is clearly the end result.\n  The reference to China reminded me of a cartoon which I enjoyed \nseveral years ago. President Reagan was visiting China, and one of the \ncartoonists had a picture of him on the Great Wall of China speaking to \nChou En-Lai at the time, saying, ``This wall is terrific. If this does \nnot keep the Commies out, I don't know what will.''\n  That, I think, points up the absurdity of a policy. That is a \nCommunist government in China. It has been a Communist government. We \ndo business with them. We need to do business with them. We need to \nrecognize that they are a real part of this world. Clearly, we have \nsuch a contrary policy when it comes to Cuba it needs to be rethought.\n  This legislation needs to be defeated and certainly we have a chance \nto do so at this point. I think the President is acting judiciously and \nproperly in beginning to plant some seeds which will encourage \ndemocracy to come to that island. That is all that can be done at this \npoint. I think that is an important step forward, and we should not \ninterfere with it. We should not do anything to support this Helms-\nBurton legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I believe the majority leader announced that \nat the conclusion of my remarks the Senate would stand in recess until \n1:45. I ask the Chair, is that not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me briefly say that we are going to be on this matter, \napparently. I, last night, spoke for an hour or so. The Presiding \nOfficer spoke on this issue last evening. Several have.\n  My hope would be, unless other Members are going to speak on this \nissue, we might have an opportunity to talk about some other issues. We \nhave a major problem emerging on the home front here in the next \nseveral weeks and that is this so-called reconciliation bill that deals \nwith Medicaid, Medicare, and taxes. It looks as if we are only going to \nhave about 20 hours to debate a domestic issue of far more importance \nto most people in this country than a policy dealing with Cuba. So I \nhope we might--if Members are not going to address this issue, since we \nare apparently not going to vote on this matter for some time here--we \nmight at least have the opportunity to talk about some of these other \nissues.\n  I know in my State people are far more interested in what is going to \nhappen to their Medicare and what is going to happen with Medicaid and \nthe tax breaks that are being proposed to be paid for by the cuts in \nMedicare. It is a matter of deep, deep concern. We will have had no \nhearings on those issues; not a single hour of hearings on that. At \nleast we had hearings on Cuba, on this issue, going back a number of \nweeks ago. We had no markup of the bill on this particular legislation \nwe are going to be discussing. And of course there will be a markup but \nno hearings on the bill that will be affecting Medicare and Medicaid.\n  So I am somewhat mystified we would spend this much time on this \nissue and yet leave Medicare and Medicaid to a status of insignificance \nby comparison, in terms of the amount of time allocated for discussing \nit. I think that is wrong. I think it is tragic. I think the American \npeople will respond accordingly.\n  So my hope is we might at least offer Members the opportunity, if not \nto discuss particularly this matter, to use the time to talk about some \nof these other issues. Obviously, that is a matter for those who \ncontrol the floor to make a decision on, whether or not they will allow \nthat to occur. I hope that will be the case.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/12/senate-section/article/S15079-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senate is stuck in a filibuster of the \nCuba Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1995. Unfortunately, some \nhave decided to make this a partisan issue. The White House has \nunleashed a lobbying barrage. This should not be a partisan issue. The \nHouse passed similar legislation with strong bipartisan support. In \nfact, 67 Democrats joined Republicans in that effort, including \nMinority Leader Richard Gephardt. There are Democratic cosponsors of \nthe pending legislation--Senators Graham of Florida, Lieberman, \nHollings, Robb, and Reid. I have no doubt that more Democratic Senators \nwould support the bill if we could get to a vote. I hope the minority \nwill allow us to vote.\n  The legislation before us addresses many of the concerns raised by \nthe administration regarding the House version. At least 10 substantive \nchanges to address administration concerns have been made in the \npending Dole-Helms amendment. This bill will have to go to conference, \nwhere the administration will have ample opportunity to air additional \nconcerns. I do not know if the White House or Democratic Senators are \naware of the changes that have been made in this bill. But I hope they \nwill take a look at the 10 changes.\n  What I believe the Senate should do is speak on the issue of bringing \ndemocratic change to Cuba.\n  Fidel Castro is watching closely what we do today. I know the last \nthing any Member wants to do is send Castro a signal of approval for \nhis refusal to change. But we should be clear--many of the opponents of \nthis legislation have always opposed the embargo on Cuba, and have \nalways wanted sanction on Castro lifted. That is not President \nClinton's stated policy, and it is not a policy that would receive more \nthan a few votes in this body.\n  There are legitimate concerns about the legislation. That is why \nChairman Helms has made so many substantive changes in the legislation. \nVirtually all the issues raised by the White House in the statement of \nadministration policy have already been addressed. I ask unanimous \nconsent that an analysis of the administration's concerns and the \nmodifications in the pending amendment be printed in the Record after \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the winds of freedom have been blowing \nthroughout our hemisphere. Dictators have fallen, political prisoners \nhave been freed, and democracies have flourished. Only one country has \nbucked the democratic tide: Castro's Cuba. Only one country continues \nto repress its own people in the name of the failed dream of communism: \nCastro's Cuba.\n  No one should believe that Castro will change willingly. No one \nshould believe that Castro will respond to eased pressure. After 30 \nyears of totalitarian rule and support for terrorism, it is not the \nUnited States that should change its policy--it is Cuba that should \nchange. And Cuba will only change if the United States, the leader of \nthe free world, keeps the pressure on Fidel Castro. I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the filibuster of this bill, and support \ndemocratic change in Cuba.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  Responses to the ``Statement of Administration Policy'' on the Dole-\n                      Helms Substitute to H.R. 927\n\n       1. ``The bill would encroach upon the President's exclusive \n     authority under the Constitution to conduct foreign affairs, \n     or otherwise unduly limit the President's flexibility. . . . \n     Mandatory provisions should be replaced with precatory \n     language in the following sections: . . .\n       Section (b) [Diplomatic Efforts: The Secretary of State \n     shall ensure that U.S. diplomatic personnel abroad understand \n     and urge cooperation with the embargo]:\n       The Dole-Helms substitute states that the Secretary of \n     State ``should'' ensure that U.S. personnel are communicating \n     support for the embargo to their foreign counterparts.\n       Section 110(b) [Withholding of foreign assistance from \n     countries supporting nuclear plant in Cuba]:\n       The Dole-Helms substitute contains no similar provision.\n       Section 111 [The SAP mistakenly refers to a Section 112, \n     which does not exist in H.R. 927] [Expulsion of criminals \n     from Cuba]:\n       The Dole-Helms substitute contains no similar provision.\n       Section 201 [Policy toward transition and democratic \n     governments in Cuba]:\n       The Dole-Helms substitute contains seven policy statements: \n     That it is U.S. policy (1) to support the Cuban people's \n     self-determination, (2) to facilitate a peaceful transition, \n     (3) to be impartial toward any individual selected by the \n     Cubans for their future government, (4) to enter into \n     negotiations with a democratic government on Guantanamo, (5) \n     to consider the restoration of diplomatic relations and \n     support Cuba's reintegration into the inter-American system \n     after a transition government comes to power, (6) to remove \n     the embargo once the President determines that a democratic \n     government exists in Cuba, and (7) to pursue a mutually \n     beneficial trade relationship with a democratic Cuba.\n       It is difficult to see how any of these policy statements \n     infringe on, or limit, the President's foreign affairs \n     authority.\n       Section 202(e) [The President shall take the necessary \n     steps to obtain International support to transition and \n     democratic governments in Cuba]:\n       The Dole-Helms substitute (substitute section 202(c)) \n     states that ``the President is encouraged to take the \n     necessary steps'' to obtain international support.\n       Sections 203(c)(1) and 203(c)(3) [transmittal of a \n     presidential determination to Congress that a transition and \n     democratically elected government, respectively, are in power \n     in Cuba]:\n       Under Title II, implementation of the assistance plan to \n     either a transition or democratic government in Cuba in \n     triggered by a presidential determination, transmitted to \n     Congress, that such a government has come into existence.\n       In foreign aid authorization and appropriations bills, \n     Congress routinely requires a presidential determination, \n     transmitted to Congress, before it provides for the release \n     of any assistance. The provisions in the Dole-Helms \n     substitute are consistent with existing practice.\n       In sum, every concern raised by the Administration about \n     H.R. 927 infringing on the President's foreign affairs powers \n     is either addressed by the Dole-Helms substitute or conforms \n     to existing practice.\n       ``The effectiveness of civil penalties as a tool for \n     improving embargo enforcement is greatly limited by the \n     exemption in section 102(d). . . . Section 102(d) should be \n     amended to address this shortcoming.''\n       The Dole-Helms substitute agrees that civil penalties would \n     be an effective tool in enforcing the embargo. Section 103(d) \n     of the substitute contains the language favored by the \n     Administration.\n       ``Section 103 [prohibition on indirect financing to Cuba] \n     should be amended to make the prohibition of certain \n     financing transactions subject to the discretion of the \n     President.''\n       The Dole-Helms substitute provision on indirect financing \n     (section 104 of the substitute) gives the President the \n     authority to suspend the prohibition upon the determination \n     that a transition government is in power in Cuba. The House \n     bill only allows the President to terminate the \n     prohibition when a democratic government is in power in \n     Cuba.\n       The substitute also provides that the prohibition shall not \n     apply to financing by the owner of the property or the \n     property claim for activities permitted under existing \n     Treasury regulations. This exception is not in the House \n     bill.\n       4. ``Section 104(b), which would require withholding \n     payments to International Financial Institutions, could place \n     the U.S. in violation of international commitments and \n     undermine their effective functioning. This section should be \n     deleted.''\n       U.S. opposition to Castro's membership in international \n     financial institutions does not violate our obligations. \n     Charter obligations apply to member nations in their \n     relations with the international financial institution and \n     its relations with other IFI member states, not to those \n     nations which are not member-states. Cuba is not a member \n     state and thus is not eligible for any type of IFI loan or \n     other assistance.\n       The objective of the LIBERTAD bill is to deny Castro access \n     to IFI financing, while signaling clear support for Cuban \n     membership in the international financial community once a \n     transition to democracy is underway.\n       The LIBERTAD's provisions (substitute section 105) are \n     consistent with U.S. obligations and with precedent for \n     opposing and withholding contributions to international \n     financial institutions:\n       Under Section 29 of the Inter-American Development Bank \n     Act, no funds are authorized for a U.S. contribution to the \n     Inter-American Development Bank for assistance to ``non-\n     member countries'' such as Cuba.\n       In 1979, Congress cut the U.S. contribution to the \n     International Development Association (IDA) by $20 million in \n     order to show disapproval of a $60 million IDA loan to \n     Vietnam. At that time, the U.S. contributed one-third of \n     IDA's funds and the $20 million withheld represented the U.S. \n     share of the Vietnam loan.\n       In 1960, Castro withdrew Cuba's membership from the \n     international financial community; Cuba was not evicted from \n     membership. At that time, Castro said there was no reason for \n     Cuba to belong to the World Bank ``since the economic policy \n     of that institution is far from being effective in regard to \n     the development and expansion of the Cuban economy.'' \n     Castro's hostile views haven't changed toward the \n     international financial institutions. This past March, Castro \n     denounced the ``irrationality of the system'' when referring \n     to the IMF and the World Bank.\n     \n[[Page S 15083]]\n\n       5. ``Section 106 [Assistance by the independent states of \n     the former Soviet Union for the Cuban government] would \n     undermine important U.S. support for reform in Russia.\n       For former Soviet states receiving bilateral U.S. \n     assistance, the Dole-Helms substitute signals Congress' \n     disapproval of those countries maintaining a military \n     presence in Cuba, using Cuba as a base from which to conduct \n     espionage activities targeted at the United States, or \n     providing trade to Cuba on terms that the market would not \n     provide (i.e., ``nonmarket-based trade'').\n       In November 1994, Russia publicly announced that it \n     provides Cuba with $200 million in credits for the use of \n     intelligence facilities in Cuba.\n       The Administration claims to share these concerns.\n       The substitute recognizes that the U.S. has interests in \n     former Soviet states that go beyond their relations with \n     Cuba. As such, it exempts from its restrictions funding for \n     Nunn-Lugar denuclearization programs, humanitarian \n     assistance, political reform programs, and free-market \n     development.\n       The prohibition may be waived by the President if he \n     determines that aid is in the national security interests of \n     the United States and that Russia has assured the President \n     that it is not sharing intelligence data collected from \n     facilities in Cuba with the Cuban Government.\n       The provision on nonmarket-based trade states that economic \n     relations between former Soviet states and Cuba should be on \n     commercial terms, not on subsidized terms. This section was \n     originally adopted by the House Foreign Affairs Committee and \n     approved by a Democratically-controlled House of \n     Representatives, and accepted by the Administration, in 1993.\n       6. ``Section 110(b) [withholding of foreign assistance from \n     countries supporting nuclear plant in Cuba] is cast so \n     broadly as to have a profoundly adverse affect on a wide \n     range of U.S. Government activities.''\n       The Dole-Helms substitute contains no similar provision.\n       7. ``Section 202(b)(2)(iii), which would bar transactions \n     related to family travel and remittances from relatives of \n     Cubans in the United States until a transition government is \n     in power, is too inflexible and should be deleted.''\n       This provision is not in the Dole-Helms substitute.\n       The substitute contains ``sense of the Congress'' language \n     (section 111) outlining that any resumption of family travel \n     and remittances should be done in response to positive steps \n     by Castro, including allowing Cubans to operate small \n     businesses and freeing political prisoners.\n       On October 6, the President announced a policy that allows \n     for limited family travel and remittances. The Dole-Helms \n     substitute does not contradict or negate that policy.\n       8. ``Sections 205 and 206 would establish overly-rigid \n     requirements for transition and democratic governments in \n     Cuba that could leave the United States on the sidelines . . \n     . The criteria should be `factor to be considered' rather \n     than requirements.''\n       The only specific requirements for a transition government \n     in the Dole-Helms substitute are that such a government has \n     (1) legalized political activity, (2) released all political \n     prisoners and allowed for access to Cuban prisons by \n     international human rights organizations, (3) dissolved the \n     state security/police apparatus, (4) agreed to hold elections \n     within two years of taking power, and (5) has committed \n     publicly, and is taking steps, to resolve American property \n     claims (substitute sections 205 and 207).\n       The substitute contains a list of additional factors that \n     the President is asked to take into account when determining \n     whether a transition or democratic government is in power in \n     Cuba. Except for the requirements outlined above, these are \n     not ``requirements'' that have to be fulfilled before aid can \n     go to a transition or democratic government.\n       The President can waive the property conditions (in \n     substitute section 207) if he determines that it is in the \n     vital national interest of the United States to aid either a \n     transition or democratic government.\n       By outlining factors to be considered rather than specific \n     requirements and by providing waiver authority, the \n     substitute acknowledges that the President needs flexibility \n     in making determinations as to Cuba's political evolution.\n       9. ``By failing to provide stand-alone authority for \n     assistance to a transition or democratic government in Cuba, \n     Title II signals a lack of U.S. resolve to support a \n     transition to democracy in Cuba.''\n       Title II of the Dole-Helms substitute contains \n     unprecedented legislative language written with the express \n     purpose of encouraging a democratic transition in Cuba. The \n     substitute mandates the development of a plan by the United \n     States to respond to a transition process in Cuba. The plan \n     is to include an assessment of the types of assistance that \n     would be required and the mechanisms by which that assistance \n     would be delivered.\n       The substitute outlines general areas that should be the \n     focus of U.S. assistance, including aid to meet the \n     humanitarian needs of the Cuban people, as well as assistance \n     to revise the Cuban economy through free-market development. \n     (The substitute's premise is that traditional foreign aid is \n     not the solution to Cuba's economic problems, but that \n     private, free-market economic activities are the key to the \n     island's recovery.)\n       The substitute language does not prohibit the President \n     from submitting and Congress acting on, a support package \n     prior to a change of government in Cuba. It does, however, \n     limit disbursement of any aid to or through the Cuban \n     government until such time as either a transition or \n     democratic government is in power in Cuba.\n       The substitute does not diminish or otherwise affect the \n     President's existing authorities to reprogram and disburse \n     funds to respond to situations he deems require an emergency \n     response.\n       10. ``Title III, which would create a private cause of \n     action for U.S. nationals to sue foreigners who invest in \n     property located entirely outside the United States, should \n     be deleted.''\n       The ``right of action'' provision allows U.S. nationals \n     with confiscated properties in Cuba and who have not been \n     compensated for that property to sue those who continue to \n     exploit their confiscated property six months after the \n     bill's enactment.\n       The property may be located outside the United States, but \n     the holder of legal title to the property is a U.S. citizen. \n     it is well established in both international law and U.S. \n     jurisprudence that domestic courts may reach actions abroad \n     that directly affect our nation. An example is the ability of \n     U.S. courts to have jurisdiction over antitrust conspiracies \n     abroad.\n       Knowing and intentional torts committed on the property of \n     American citizens, even when the property is situated \n     overseas, is sufficient basis for U.S. court jurisdiction.\n       This right of action is against the ``tort'' of \n     unauthorized, unlawful ``conversion'' of property--\n     essentially the act of ``fencing'' stolen goods.\n       Castro's confiscations and continuing exploitation of \n     properties confiscated from American citizens has a direct \n     impact on the United States.\n       ``Applying U.S. law extra-territorially in this fashion \n     would create friction with our allies . . . ''\n       The remedy sought is a domestic one; the right of action \n     does not seek to be enforced abroad. It is restricted to the \n     jurisdiction of U.S. Courts and those who can be \n     constitutionally reached by our courts.\n       The LIBERTAD bill has stirred opposition from those foreign \n     entities benefitting from Castro's illegal confiscations at \n     the expense of the rightful American owner. The bills' intent \n     is not to create tensions with allies, but to serve as a \n     disincentive to would-be investors in properties in Cuba \n     confiscated from U.S. nationals.\n       If a foreign entity is not investing in, or benefitting \n     from, property confiscated by the Castro government from a \n     U.S. national, then there is no liability under the LIBERTAD \n     bill.\n       ``. . . would be difficult to defend under international \n     law . . . ''\n       It is well established in international law that a nation's \n     domestic courts may reach actions abroad when those actions \n     directly affect that nation.\n       ``and would create a precedent that would increase \n     litigation risks for U.S. companies abroad.''\n       The right of action is specifically for properties in Cuba. \n     Any other country that seeks to extend this right of action \n     to its citizens would be expected to satisfy the same \n     criteria that are included in the LIBERTAD bill.\n       Castro's economic exploitation of wrongfully confiscated \n     properties if unchallenged could establish an international \n     precedent that such exploitation, when the legal owner has \n     not been compensated, is appropriate and meets with the \n     approval of the international community, including the United \n     States.\n       To the extent that this legislation sends the message that \n     ``fencing'' stolen property carries a cost, it improves the \n     climate for international investment and establishes an \n     incentive for states to resolve confiscation claims.\n       ``It would also diminish the prospects for settlement of \n     the claims of the nearly 6,000 U.S. nationals whose claims \n     have been certified by the Foreign Claims Settlement \n     Commission.''\n       To the contrary, the cause of action should encourage the \n     settlement of claims by providing a disincentive to foreign \n     entities discouraging the sale of American-owned property to \n     foreign-owned businesses whose occupation of the property \n     can only be considered a further complication in an era of \n     transition.\n       Castro, by encouraging joint ventures and the possibility \n     of ownership in confiscated properties, is encumbering the \n     property by granting rights to that property. To the extent \n     that the right of action serves as a disincentive to would-be \n     investors, it keeps confiscated properties from being subject \n     to further ownership claims.\n       ``Because U.S. as well as foreign persons may be sued under \n     section 302, this provision could create a major legal \n     barrier to the participation of U.S. businesses in the \n     rebuilding of Cuba once a transition begins.''\n       The LIBERTAD bill places the United States firmly behind a \n     democratic transition in Cuba. It does not put in place \n     impediments to rebuilding of a free and independent Cuba nor \n     to U.S. business participation in a post-Castro Cuba.\n       Once a transition is underway in Cuba, the rightful owners \n     of Cuban property will likely be able to assert their claims \n     in Cuba as any new government will be on notice that good \n     relations with the U.S. include respect for property rights.\n       11. ``Title IV, which would require the Federal Government \n     to exclude from the United States \n\n[[Page S 15084]]\n     any person who has confiscated, or ``traffics'' in, property to which a \n     U.S. citizen has a claim, should be deleted.''\n       The Dole-Helms substitute contains no similar provision.\n       12. Pay-As-You-Go Scoring: ``H.R. 927 would affect \n     receipts; . . . OMB has not yet been able to estimate the \n     paygo effect of receipts from filing fees for such lawsuits. \n     (However, discretionary costs to the Government from lawsuits \n     could be significant and could place a heavy burden on the \n     court system.)''\n       CBO estimates that implementation of the Dole-Helms \n     substitute would cost about $7 million over the next five \n     years. As for the pay-as-you-go effect, CBO ``estimates that \n     additional receipts would not be significant, at least \n     through 1998. These impacts on the federal budget all stem \n     from title III.''\n       CBO estimates that ``the federal court system would incur \n     about $2 million in additional costs to address cases that \n     actually go to trial. . . . However, [because of the $50,000 \n     threshold], CBO expects the number of additional claims would \n     be quite small and that additional costs to process these \n     claims would not be significant.'' [CBO Letter to Senator \n     Helms, July 31, 1995]\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to thank Chairman Helms for his \ngraciousness. I told him I was not intending to speak on the Cuba bill \nbut on other items basically dealing with budget priorities, and since \nhe did not have any other speakers he agreed because under the rules he \ncan object at this point in time due to the Pastore rule. So I just \nwanted to thank him for that graciousness.\n\n\n                         BUDGET RECONCILIATION\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think it is very important, since we \nonly have 20 hours of debate on the Budget Reconciliation Act, that we \ntake as much time as we can find on the Senate floor to talk about what \nwe believe the future of this country is going to look like once the \nCongress acts on the budget. I think it is fair to say that the far-\nreaching impact of the budget bill that has been passed by the \nRepublican Congress is not quite understood because it is very \ncomplicated, because there are charges and there are countercharges, \nbut I think at this moment we have to look at what we are facing before \nit is too late--before it is too late.\n  The budget bill that is coming out of these various committees--and \nit seems to me that there is no compromise at this point--is so radical \nin my view, is so harmful in my view, is so extreme in my view, that \nreasonable Americans of all political persuasions must know the facts. \nAll too often we are told by politicians: Gee, this is very \ncomplicated. Trust me; gee, it is hard to understand this. Trust me; \ngee, it is all politics and everyone will say one thing and another \nthing. Just trust me.\n  I say it is time for the American people to learn the facts, to \nunderstand the numbers, and to understand what faces them, if these \npriorities move forward, if this budget bill moves forward, and if \nthere is no compromise between Republicans and Democrats, which I \nearnestly hope for and I will earnestly work toward.\n  So this is where we stand. In the Republican budget bill they are \ngoing to cut $270 billion out of Medicare. Now, I said it once and I am \ngoing to say it again, they want to cut $270 billion in the next 7 \nyears out of Medicare. And I know if I had a Republican colleague on \nthe floor, they could say, ``Senator Boxer, not true. We're just going \nto reduce the rate of growth of Medicare by $270 billion. Medicare will \nstill grow, but we're just going to reduce the rate of growth.''\n  And I have to tell you, that kind of rationale simply will not fly \nwith people who listen and understand. Why do I say that? Why is it \nthat we have to spend more on Medicare? It is very simple. We are \nliving longer. This is good. This is important--the advances that we \nare making in the medical field, the fact that prevention has taken \nhold. We know now about how important it is to do our exercise, to have \na high-fiber diet, to have a low-fat diet. And, yes, it is difficult to \nteach our young about that. But those of us over a certain age get the \nmessage. We kind of like to stay around. We want to see our children \nand our grandchildren. We want to be here with the wisdom of our years.\n  And so we are beginning to live longer thanks to medicine, thanks to \nprevention, thanks to education. This is good. So, of course, more \npeople are going on Medicare each and every year. We should celebrate \nthat. And that is why we need more money, because more people are going \non Medicare. And that means we have to make some adjustments. Of course \nwe do. And I will talk about that later to make sure that the money is \nthere for all of us who live those golden years.\n  Why else do we need more money in Medicare? We are not only living \nlonger, we have better technology in the medical field, and we want to \ngive that to our grandmas and grandpas so they can have the benefit of \nthis medical technology. And, of course, we then have to make sure we \nare not wasting money in Medicare. There is a lot of room for \nimprovement. We must do what we can. And we will.\n  But this, my friends, this number, makes no sense at all. It is not \nnecessary. There is not one health expert that tells us we must cut \n$270 billion out of Medicare. Absolutely not. I will tell you later \nwhat we must cut out of Medicare, but this number, my friends, is not \nit. This is a killer. This is a killer. This will kill the program. And \nI always thought we honored our elderly, and I always thought this was \na 30-year-old program that was worth preserving because it works for \nour seniors.\n  Is it perfect? No. Can we make it better? Yes. Do we need to cut $270 \nbillion out of it? Absolutely not.\n  But now I am going to show you another number and tell you why the \nRepublicans are cutting $270 billion out of Medicare. It is really \npretty simple when you understand. Guess what? They need $245 billion \nfor a tax cut which will benefit the wealthiest people in America, and \nthey cannot find it in all the other programs. They looked. They will \nnot touch defense.\n  As a matter of fact, they have increased defense by billions more \nthan the admirals and generals asked us to do. They could not find it \nthere, and they have cut to the bone education, environment, you name \nit, public transit, dollars to prevent crime. So they had to go to \nMedicare because they had to find $245 billion for a tax cut.\n  My friend from North Dakota, who you will hear from, has offered a \nseries of amendments that said, look, let us give a tax cut but let us \nlimit it to the middle class if we are going to have one. And that went \ndown here on a party-line vote. They will not limit the breaks of this \ntax cut to those in the middle class. They will give people who earn \nover $350,000 a year $20,000 a year back. And I ask you, is that fair? \nIs that fair when we are asking our senior citizens to be party to the \ndestruction of Medicare, when we are asking our college students, as \nthey are, to pay more for their student loans? Is it fair that they are \ncutting environmental protection by one-third?\n  They have to find the money for this $245 billion tax cut. I hope the \nAmerican people will notice the symmetry between what they need to find \nfor their tax cut, mostly for the wealthy, and this $270 billion they \nwill cut from Medicare.\n  That is the answer. My friends, this is a funnel approach. I call the \nRepublican Medicare plan a funnel plan. It funnels the money from \nsenior citizens directly into the pockets of the wealthiest among us.\n  I have absolutely every admiration for those in America who have done \nwell. They have taken advantage of the American dream. They have worked \nhard. But I do not think those good people want these kinds of \npriorities. I have spoken with many of them. I have talked to them, and \nthey are embarrassed about it. They say, ``Don't give me any tax cut \nuntil you balance the budget. And don't kill off Medicare, because my \nmom likes it and my dad needs it.'' But oh, no, it is in the contract, \nthe contract for America or with America or on America. I forget what \nit is called. It is in the contract. And therefore, there is no backing \noff. There is no compromising, and I only hope that changes.\n  It will change if the American people wake up and understand this \nRepublican Medicare plan is a funnel plan. The funnel goes from the \nsenior citizens directly into the pockets of the \n\n[[Page S 15085]]\nwealthy of America. And guess what? The senior citizens, the average \nsenior citizens, earn under $25,000 a year and pay more than $3,000 a \nyear in out-of-pocket expenses for their medical care already.\n  Oh, the AMA jumped on board. I think it is important to note that the \nAMA, the American Medical Association, stood back from the Republican \nplan until they got a promise that their fees would be OK. They are \ngoing to be OK. They are going to be OK. So they jumped on. Remember, \nthe American Medical Association and 97 percent of Republicans opposed \nMedicare when it was started in 1965.\n  This is no shock or surprise. A group that never supported Medicare \nin the first place jumps on board and plans to demolish it, \nunnecessarily so, to cut $270 billion to give $245 billion to the \nwealthiest among us.\n  Now, the Republicans say, ``You Democrats, you won't face up to the \nfact that Medicare is in trouble.'' This is what they say. They run \nads, ``Congressman that and Senator that, Democrats don't understand \nit.'' We understand it because we are the ones who acted responsibly \nsince 1970 when the trustees started telling us each and every year we \nhad to make adjustments.\n  For example, in 1970 they said, ``We're going to be insolvent in \n1972. We have to fix the problem.'' We fixed it. Almost every year, \nexcept a couple times, we were told the Medicare fund had to be made \nsolvent, and every single year we always made it solvent, no problem. \nAs a matter of fact, we just acted in the last Congress to make it \nsolvent. We could not get any Republican help on that. We voted it in \nin the Democratic Congress.\n  So they tell you that this is a once-in-a-lifetime problem, and we \nbetter act. This has happened year after year after year. The trustees \ntold us the fund was going to be insolvent. Why? Why? Because people \nare getting older and medical technology is getting better, and, yes, \nwe have to adjust the fund.\n  So do not be taken in with the argument that Medicare is in desperate \ntrouble and we must cut $270 billion from it. It is not so. It is not \nso.\n  How much do we have to cut from Medicare to make it work? We have \ndone it all the time. We fixed the fund continually throughout these \nyears. What is it going to take? We have a number. We know what it is, \nand that number is $89 billion. That is what we have to find to cut out \nof Medicare to make it safe, to make it solvent and whole to the year \n2006, and then, Mr. President, I say to my friends, we will be doing \nwhat we should be doing.\n  So I guess what I need to sum up with is this: I represent more \nsenior citizens than anyone else in the Senate, except for the senior \nSenator from California, Senator Feinstein. Why? Because we have 32 \nmillion people in our State and they are worried. And they are worried. \nThe average woman over 65 in this country who is on Social Security \nlives on $8,500 a year, and she is already spending $3,000 out of \npocket on her medical care. Is this the way we honor our seniors? Is \nthis the kind of legacy we want to leave?\n  And if this is not bad enough, you should see their Medicaid plan. \nTwo-thirds of our seniors in nursing homes are on Medicaid. Two-thirds \nof our seniors. And do you know what the Republicans have voted to do? \nThey have voted to decimate that program. The hospitals in my State and \nevery other State are up in arms, the Governors are up in arms--\nRepublican Governors are up in arms--because on top of these Medicare \ncuts that I showed you, there is $182 billion of Medicaid cuts, and \nwhile they are at it, they have repealed the national standards for \nnursing homes.\n  We are going to go back to the dark ages, to the secret tortures of \nbed sores and sexual abuse and beatings and druggings. Why do you think \nwe have national standards? We did not pass it here for fun. We passed \nit because of the outrageous things we knew were going on in nursing \nhomes. And do you know what we said? The seniors are a national \npriority, and we are not going to leave it up to 50 different States.\n  We have standards for airplanes. We do not leave it up to 50 \ndifferent States. We have standards for drugs, because we do not want \nour people poisoned. We do not leave it up to 50 different States. Why \non Earth in God's name would we say that we should cancel nursing home \nstandards and leave it up to the States when we know the problems we \nhave and the agonies that our families went through before we had \nnational standards?\n  Now, look, I am for change as much as anybody else, but I am for good \nchange, I am for positive change, I am for reasonable change. I am not \njust for change to say I have changed the world.\n  The House Speaker says he came to bring a revolution--a revolution. \nMaybe there are some places in our society where we need to have a \nrevolution. I could think of a couple, but I have to tell you, not in \nthe nursing homes of this country do we want to bring a revolution and \ncancel all the standards and have the secret horrors of the past \nreappear.\n  I will tell you, Senator Mikulski said she will chain herself to her \ndesk if they try to repeal the spousal impoverishment laws. She can add \nme to her chain, because I am not leaving this floor if we cancel \nnursing home standards, and I am not leaving this floor if we now say \nto the grandpas who put their wives into nursing homes, ``We're going \nafter your house, sir, we're going after your car, and you're not going \nto be able to earn any money, sir. We're taking it all.'' And once they \nget through with that, they are going to go after the kids.\n  That is not a revolution of which I want to be part. That is a \nrevolution of which to be ashamed. That is a revolution that goes back \nto the dark days of the past. It is like the orphanages. We are going \nto go back to orphanages, going to go back to secret tortures of \nnursing homes. What kind of vision is that for our Nation? We must do \nbetter than that.\n  So, yes, we need to act. We can take $89 billion out of Medicare and \nsolve the problem, but we do not have to cut out $270 billion to funnel \ninto a tax cut for the wealthiest among us. We must not go after \nMedicaid and destroy the program and have a situation where our moms \nand dads and grandmas and grandpas are in deep, deep trouble, one is \nthrown into a nursing home, the other is thrown into the poor house. We \nmust do better than that, I say to my friends, and we can if we sit \ndown across the table and work together.\n  I am from one State that will really bear the brunt of these changes. \nI am willing to sit with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nfrom night to the next morning to the next night to the next morning \nuntil we reach a compromise.\n  Back off of that tax cut, limit it to the middle class, and then we \nwill have some dollars that we can offset these cruel and outrageous \ncuts. Back off your plans to destroy education and environmental \nprotection. If they back off their tax cuts, we can do it, and I hope \nwe can come together and do it.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that this \nextreme revolution is rolled back today before it hurts our people. I \nyield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the debate on sanctions against Castro's \nCuba is an important one. But so is the issue for which I rise today.\n  It had been my understanding--and the understanding of most term-\nlimits advocates--that the Senate would be devoting all of today and \nFriday to the issue of term limits for Members of Congress.\n  But that is not the case--the debate and vote have been delayed. I \nbelieve this delay to be a mistake, and today I look to establish a \nrecord of support for term limits through a simply-worded sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution.\n  This amendment will state a single, simple idea--that the Senate \nshould pass term limits. It is an important \n\n[[Page S 15086]]\nsignal that the Senate is a new and different body than it was just 10 \nmonths ago.\n  The results will not be binding, but they will be revealing. This \nvote will show the American people, who supports term limits and who \ndoes not. That is important, for identifying support now is vital to \nachieving victory later.\n  Last fall, the American people sent a message as strong as it was \nclear: They said they wanted politicians to seek fundamental change in \nthe way that Washington works and the way that Washington looks. And \nthey entrusted Republicans to initiate those changes.\n  No issue is more symbolic of changing Washington than term limits--\nthey are the foundation of the people's agenda. That is why efforts to \nagain delay the first-ever vote on term limits are so disturbing.\n  The delay on term limits sends the wrong message at the wrong time. \nWith Ross Perot experiencing yet another political rebirth; with trust \nfor Congress at another all-time low; with voter anger at record highs; \nwhat the American people want to see are real efforts at reform. This \nattempted delay signals the admission of defeat before a fight. That is \nnot the kind of message we should be sending.\n\n  The American people are expressing serious reservations about our \nability to get things done. We must show them that we have not given \nup.\n  The American people want us to fight on term limits. As you can see, \nAmericans in 23 States have fought for term limits. Those States can be \nseen on the map behind me in red. States with more than 100 million \npeople have voted on and passed term limits, surely 100 U.S. Senators \ncan find the time to register their views on this issue.\n  Why are term limits so important? Because they are our last, best \nhope to change a fundamentally corrupt system. In this reform, the \nAmerican people see the possibility of reining in congressional power \nby restoring competitive elections--franking, fundraising, and so \nforth; reinstituting congressional accountability--turnover, and so \nforth; reinvigorating a Congress that's lost touch--new ideas, new \npeople, and so forth.\n  Unfortunately, the people's clear will is in direct conflict with the \nNational Government's rulings.\n  A year ago, the Clinton administration argued before the Supreme \nCourt that term limits were unconstitutional.\n  On May 23, in U.S. Term Limits versus Thornton, the Supreme Court \nagreed with the Clinton administration and denied the people of America \nthe right to limit congressional terms.\n  To all of the voters in the States highlighted in red behind me, the \nClinton administration and the Court said, ``Tough luck, we know \nbetter.''\n  Our Nation's executive and judicial branches have spoken--they oppose \nterm limits. The only hope left is our legislative branch--this \nCongress. And for this Congress, the only option the Court left was a \ndaunting one--a constitutional amendment requiring two-thirds \nratification by Congress.\n\n  Mr. President, amending the Constitution is never easy, and following \nthe House's rejection of term limits and the Supreme Court's ruling on \nthem, many are saying that the fight is over--that it may be a good \npolitical issue for the 1996 election, but a deadend for this Congress.\n  In fact, many of them have come to me and said ``John, we appreciate \nwhat you've done, but we have given up on the Congress.''\n  Well, let me just say something to all the advocates across the \ncountry whose cause is my concern. I will continue to fight--fight to \nensure that the 228 names listed behind me, including mine, are once \nagain subjected to the will of the people; fight for this idea that has \nbecome an ideal; and fight to ensure that this Congress will not only \nvote on term limits, but pass a resolution restoring the American \npeople's right to limit congressional terms.\n  Mr. President, Lincoln said, ``Let us have faith that right makes \nmight, and in that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we \nunderstand it.'' Today, the will of the American people stands in \ndirect contrast to the will of the executive and judicial branches of \nour Government. But I know that they too believe that right makes might \nand that they are depending on us to dare to do our duty.\n  I know that this is an issue that makes some of my fellow Senators \nuncomfortable. One need only look at the endless delay in consideration \nof term limits to confirm this suspicion. This, however, is an issue of \nenormous importance to the American people. They will hold us \naccountable--they will remember.\n  I made a promise during my campaign last year. A promise that I would \npursue certain issues with determination and discipline. Term limits on \nMembers of Congress was one of those issues. And I intend to fulfill my \npromise.\n  And so today, I offer a simple sense-of-the-Senate resolution. At \nissue here is whether the Senate will ``pass a constitutional amendment \nlimiting congressional terms.'' And while the amendment is not binding, \nMr. President, it will be revealing.\n  For an overwhelming majority of Americans want term limits. We shall \nnow see how many in the U.S. Senate share their desire.\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2915.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

Thank you for this opportunity. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I came forward to speak on something else, \nbut I am curious and interested on the term-limit issue. The question \nbeing proposed: Should there be term limits? There are term limits in \nthis country. The term limits are 6 years for a U.S. Senator and 2 \nyears for a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  Should someone be elected to the House who becomes, from their \nexperience, a slothful, indolent oaf of some sort, voters very quickly \nin 2 years in the House and 6 years in the Senate can send them into \ncomplete and immediate retirement.\n  There are term limits. I think the question the Senator is proposing \nis what kind of term limits should exist.\n  I respectfully say I do not spend a lot of time speaking about this \nsubject, but the retirement of Sam Nunn in the Senate this week ought \nto remind all of us of something important once again. It is important \nto remember that you can put a half dozen new people in a basket in \nthis Chamber who have been around 6 months, 9 months, \n\n[[Page S 15087]]\nor a year--that would include myself when I came--and you would not \nhave the experience Sam Nunn gained during the final 12 of his 24 years \nin the U.S. Senate in dealing with international and defense issues.\n  That is a debate we will have at some later point. I think it does \nnot favor this country to suggest somehow that we should have \nprohibited this country from the service given by Calhoun, Clay, \nWebster, and, yes, Goldwater and Humphrey and Dole and others. These \nare people who spent a lot of time serving the public interests, \namassing a great deal of experience and served this country well.\n  I do not spend a minute worrying or thinking about term limits. That \nis up to the American people. If they choose to change the Constitution \nto limit their choice in a different way, they have every right to do \nthat, and will do that if that is their pleasure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/12/senate-section/article/S15085-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     KEEP BLOCK GRANT MONEY AT HOME\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I came to the floor to speak about another \nsubject. I was here when Senator Boxer from California spoke on \nMedicare and Medicaid, and I shall not do that except to say this: I am \nintending at some point to gather together the legislation that we are \nblock granting back to all the Governors in the States. We are doing \nthis under the presumption that somehow the Governors are able to \ndiscern better how to spend all this money--Medicaid, a whole range of \nareas, tens of billions of dollars that will be sent back to the States \nthrough block grants.\n  They will send back less money but block grant it with fewer strings. \nThe presumption is that the money will go from the taxpayers to the \nFederal Government; we send it to the Governors, saying, ``go ahead and \nspend it.''\n  My theory is, why put miles on all this money? Why send a tax dollar \nfrom Bismarck, ND, to Washington, DC, only to send it back to the \nGovernor of North Dakota? Why do you want to send it from California to \nWashington to send it back to the Governor? Why not keep it at home? \nWant to block grant? Why collect it and have it run through Washington? \nThat is like passing an ice cube around. Why lose money? Why not say to \nthe Governors, ``Look, if you want to do this, God love you, God please \nyou, you do it. You raise the money. You tax the folks in your State, \nand you spend it.''\n  I tell you, that is the best way to have lack of accountability of \nFederal funds quickly. That is, for the Federal Government to tax the \ncitizens, get the money and give it to another level of government \nsomeplace else and say, ``By the way, here is the pot of money. We tied \nit with a bow. No strings attached. You go ahead and spend it as you \nwish.'' Do you want to have horror stories, in 3 years, 5 years, 10 \nyears, about how the taxpayers' money is spent? You just move free \nmoney around and have Governors spending money they did not raise.\n\n  I am going to offer some legislation here that says whatever it is \nyou are block granting, let us take all of that and reduce the Federal \ntaxes by that amount and say to the Governors: You do it. Raise your \nown money and spend your own money. It is a far more effective and far \nmore efficient way to do business. That is for another day. But I \nintend to do that because I do not believe that block grants of the \ntype we are talking about serve the taxpayers' interests. Let them do \nit at home. Let them raise the money at home and let them also decide \nhow to spend the money at home.\n  Mr. President, I understand another Senator wishes to speak on the \nlegislation that is on the floor. Because of that, so Senator Kassebaum \nhas the opportunity, I would like to take just about 5 or 8 minutes, \nand I will not extend beyond that, so I can finish. I was intending to \nspeak longer, but I will shorten it so the Senator has an opportunity \nto speak on the bill.\n  Will that be acceptable to the Senator from Kansas?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, that is fine. I will be happy to wait.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/12/senate-section/article/S15087-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15087-S15088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE TRADE DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, actually I was here before the Senator \nfrom Ohio rose, but I was waiting to speak on the issue of the \nPresident of Mexico visiting Washington, DC, and the news reports about \nthat. I want to talk just a bit about it, because here is what is \nhappening.\n  President Zedillo, of Mexico, visits Washington, DC. There is a state \ndinner at the White House for the President. I am sure the President of \nMexico is a wonderful person. He and President Clinton are talking \nabout trade between our two countries; they are dining together and \ntalking about our mutual interests.\n  Then we have press stories. This is yesterday's press story. It says, \nMexico, in fact, has made a $700 million payment toward the $12.5 \nbillion debt that it owes this country from the loans we gave Mexico. \nIn fact, they made the $700 million payment early, and is that not a \nwonderful thing, that Mexico paid early?\n  That is a nice thing. I am pleased about that. But I would like to \nask a question of both President Clinton and the President of Mexico. \nAnd I will ask a question, because President Clinton and senior trade \nofficials in the administration say that NAFTA, the trade agreement \nwith Mexico, ``has created 340,000 jobs in the United States.'' This \nsays, ``The senior U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said \nNAFTA, the trade agreement with Mexico, has created 340,000 jobs in the \nUnited States.''\n  I can understand why this person did not want to be identified. I can \nunderstand why somebody who puts out this kind of nonsense does not \nwant to be identified. But let me remind those who have dinner together \nand talk about the United States-Mexico relationship, that the year \nbefore we had a free trade agreement with Mexico we had nearly a $2 \nbillion trade surplus. In fact, the year before that it was a nearly $6 \nbillion trade surplus with Mexico. When we had NAFTA up for \nconsideration here in the U.S. Senate, the surplus was nearly a $2 \nbillion.\n  Guess what? This year that nearly $2 billion surplus with Mexico is \ngoing to go to a $15 billion--some estimates say $18 billion--trade \ndeficit. We pass NAFTA with Mexico, we have a $2 billion trade surplus, \nand 2 years later we have a $15 to $18 billion trade deficit with \nMexico. Then we are told this creates jobs. Are people drinking from \nthe wrong jug someplace? You create jobs when you have an $18 billion \ndeficit? Of course you do not create jobs. You lose jobs.\n  Here is what we lost. The promise by these economists who flail their \narms around was that we would have 220,000 new jobs if we just pass \nNAFTA--exactly the opposite has happened. We have lost about 220,000 \njobs as a result of that trade agreement. So, I say to President \nClinton and President Zedillo and others, that when we talk about these \ntrade relationships, let us get the facts straight.\n  Why does it matter? It matters because this relates to jobs, \nopportunity, and growth in our country. It is not just Mexico. It is \nJapan. It is China. It is a whole series of problems we have in trade. \nWe have a $65 billion trade deficit with Japan. It is an outrage. \nAmerican jobs are moving overseas wholesale. American corporations, as \nall of us know, have decided we are going to allow our marketplace to \nbe a sponge for Japanese goods and Chinese goods and, yes, Mexican \ngoods.\n  When these American companies produce to sell elsewhere, they decide \nto produce in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh and China and Indonesia. Why? \nBecause you can hire cheap labor in those places. So an American \ncompany shuts down an American plant, moves the jobs overseas, produces \nsomething for pennies an hour--often hiring kids to do it--and then \nships the product back to Pittsburgh or Fargo or Denver, and says, \n``Isn't this wonderful? Our profits are up.''\n  Yes, your profits are up--and our jobs are gone. Then we measure all \nthis. The Nation's leaders measure all this with a thing called gross \ndomestic product, GDP.\n  It has been a big year for GDP, I tell all these economists. Do you \nknow why its been a big year for GDP? Because we have had all these \nhurricanes. Do you know, when you have hurricanes, the GDP increases? I \nbet nobody knows that. Only those folks in the Federal Reserve Board, \nwith thick glasses, who live in concrete bunkers and count all the \nbeans know that. They know you \n\n[[Page S 15088]]\ncount economic growth by hurricanes. Hurricane Andrew--remember the one \nthat leveled Florida--guess what? All the economists counted that as \none-half of 1 percent of economic growth for our country in that year.\n  Why? Because these economists do not count the damage. They just \ncount the repair. Car accidents are progress; heart attacks, a big \ndeal, at least for economists who count the gross domestic product.\n  My point is this. Take a look at our economic strategy for trade, and \nhow it relates to jobs leaving America. Take a look at our economic \nstrategy, how we measure economic progress, how we measure growth with \nthe GDP that does not care whether people are better off, a GDP that \ndoes not care whether America's standard of living has increased, and \nthen you understand--you have to understand--that we need to change \ngears in this country.\n  We need to change the way we think. We need to care about whether an \neconomic strategy works for real people. We need fundamental change in \nthe way we piece together an economic strategy that creates jobs, \nexpanded economic opportunity and growth.\n  Frankly, our trade strategy is wrong. It is bankrupting this country. \nOur economic strategy measures the wrong things, and we are not even \ndiscussing the right topics. How many people in this Chamber, at a time \nwhen this country has the largest trade deficit in the history of \ncivilization--I repeat, the largest in history--how many people have \ncome to the floor of the Senate in the last 6 months to talk about the \ntrade deficit?\n  The trade deficit is bigger than the fiscal policy budget deficit. \nThere are not three people, four people who come to the floor to talk \nabout it. Those who do are called xenophobic isolationist stooges \nbecause either you are a free-trader or one of the nuts who does not \nunderstand.\n  If this country needs to turn its attention to what is fair trade and \nhow we recapture economic opportunity, good jobs that pay decent \nincomes here at home, responsibility and accountability for \ncorporations. Corporations are the artificial people in our society. \nWhat is the responsibility of corporations who access our marketplace \nbut move jobs elsewhere? What is their responsibility in any sense of \neconomic nationalism, to care about what happens to our country?\n  I promised I would be brief, but I will come later and have printed \nin the Record the first 6 months' trade information in our country that \nshows the largest merchandise trade deficit in the history of this \ncountry. Yes, with Mexico, just as an example, it is in electrical \nequipment and machinery. It is in vehicles, automobiles. It is in \noptical, photographic, cinematography, measuring, and so on. It is in \nhigh-tech goods. It is exactly the opposite of what we were promised. \nIt is the opposite of what we were told was going to happen with \nMexico.\n  They said Mexico is going to produce the low-skilled goods and ship \nthat in. That is not what happened. That is not where the deficit is. \nThe deficit is in precisely the kind of goods that are produced through \nwell-paying jobs. They were in this country but have since left because \nwe have created a strategy that says, ``It is all right, you just take \nyour jobs and go elsewhere. It is just fine with us.''\n  It is not fine with me. We need to care something about this \ncountry's marketplace and working people and its standard of living. \nOur present economic strategy does not do that. With all due respect to \nthis President, whom I support, in my judgment --and he has done some \nwork on trade--the fact is, our trade strategy is wrong. They are wrong \nabout NAFTA and they are wrong about the consequences with Mexico.\n  With all due respect to a lot of folks on the other side of the aisle \nwho have never seen a free-trade agreement they did not love to death \nand want to pass quickly, and with all due respect to those folks who \nare going to try to drag out something called fast track and put it on \nthe floor of the Senate and the House in the reconciliation bill--you \nare dead wrong.\n  You do this country a disservice when you take something that is \nfundamentally undemocratic and use it as a vehicle to try to pole vault \ntrade agreements through this kind of a Chamber. These are trade \nagreements that, in my judgment, erode this country's economic base.\n  I will come back at another time and speak at some greater length \nabout what is the remedy for all this. However, I hope one day, one way \nor another, enough of us will become a critical mass to say these \nthings matter. We need to say that these things are hurting our \ncountry, and are issues we must deal with aggressively to put America \nback on track.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from North \nDakota limiting his remarks. It is a subject, and an important subject \nthat he cares a great deal about.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/12/senate-section/article/S15087-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15088-S15091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CUBAN LIBERTY AND DEMOCRATIC SOLIDARITY [LIBERTAD] ACT OF 1995\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I would like to speak on the subject \nof the legislation before us at this time, which is the Cuban Liberty \nand Democratic Solidarity Act, and to say that all of us on both sides \nof the aisle share I believe the same objective--to craft a United \nStates policy toward Cuba that will most effectively encourage a \ndemocratic transition in that last stronghold of authoritarian rule in \nour hemisphere. The question before us today is whether this \nlegislation is the best means of advancing that goal.\n  If I may speak for just a moment about some of the concerns that I \nhave, in the past, I have argued for a policy of strengthened \nengagement with the Cuban people. I believe we should take steps to \nencourage the free exchange of ideas within Cuba and increase news \ncoverage of the island, to support dissident organizations and \nhumanitarian groups in Cuba, and to help lay the groundwork for support \nof a post Castro government.\n\n  These objectives are widely shared. Some of the initiatives announced \nlast week by President Clinton would move us in that direction. \nSimilarly, chapters I and II of the legislation before us take a \nsimilar approach.\n  I want to commend the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nSenator Helms, the majority leader, Senator Dole, and other colleagues \non both sides of the aisle--this is not a partisan issue on this \nlegislation--for their hard work on these sections of the bill.\n  But to my mind, Mr. President, this legislation still raises very \ndifficult issues, primarily in chapter III of the act before us. That \nsection establishes a cause of action in United States Federal courts \nagainst any person or organization, foreign or domestic, who acquires \nproperty in Cuba against which a United States national has an \nexpropriation claim.\n  In part, this approach is designed to help United States nationals to \nrecover damages for the expropriation of their property in Cuba, and \nthat is certainly understandable. Since they cannot recover from the \nCastro regime, this legislation would let them go after deep-pocket \ncompanies that have acquired property that Castro expropriated.\n  At the same time, this approach has, in my judgment, a broader \nforeign-policy consequence--to discourage foreign investment in Cuba. \nIt seeks to do so by discouraging companies from acquiring certain \nexpropriated property because of the uncertainty of what litigation may \nbe involved. It is interesting that this legislation would allow any \nUnited States citizen who meets its criteria to seek relief through our \nFederal courts--even if the person is recently naturalized and was a \nCuban citizen at the time the Cuban Government expropriated his \nproperty or her property.\n  I believe many questions about this approach remain unanswered, and \nperhaps they can be answered. But I want to raise them now with issues \nthat are troubling to me, and I have been very appreciative of Senator \nHelms and Senator Helms' staff who have offered to try to help me \nunderstand the questions that I have.\n  What precedent are we setting for use of our Federal courts? I am not \nconvinced that Congress would be wise to decide that our Federal courts \nshould be used as a tool to advance our foreign policy interests. If we \nuse courts to advance our policy objectives in Cuba \n\n[[Page S 15089]]\ntoday, will we be tempted tomorrow to use the courts to advance our \ninterests in China? In Eastern Europe? In Africa? And what if policy \nobjectives that are current today change tomorrow, as they often do in \nthe fluid field of diplomacy and international politics? Will we then \nchange the cause of action we have established in our legal system? \nWhat effect will that have on the certainty of the law and the \ndistinction between law and diplomacy?\n  What will be the practical effect on our court system? Estimates of \nthe number of lawsuits that would be filed under this legislation vary \nwidely, from less than a dozen to tens of thousands.\n  It is protective, not retrospective. And I understand that. But it \ncould go from less than a dozen to perhaps thousands of cases.\n  We really do not know. At a time when our courts already are \noverburdened, it seems to me we should conduct a thorough and \nthoughtful assessment of what would be required if this legislation \nwere to become law.\n  Will this approach make us, rather than Castro, the focus of the \ninternational Cuban debate? In this bill, we are considering extending \nthe reach of our courts for political purposes, and many of our \nfriends--countries that have businesses that could find themselves \nhauled into U.S. court under this legislation--have serious concerns \nabout this approach. At a time when we want to marshall our friends to \nour side in opposition to the Castro regime, we may discover that we \nhave instead driven a wedge between us.\n  Will this approach spawn a backlash against our companies abroad? \nMany U.S. companies worry that if we choose to use U.S. courts as a \nchannel to pressure foreign companies to advance political objectives, \nother countries will do the same. We may well find our companies \noperating abroad dragged into foreign courts as part of broader policy \ndisputes that do not even involve the United States. I believe we \nshould think very carefully about the precedent we may be setting.\n  Mr. President, I commend the majority leader and the chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee for their leadership in bringing this \nimportant debate before the Senate. But I do think there are serious \nquestions that relate both to our foreign policy and to our judicial \nsystem about which we must think very carefully. I know these matters \nhave been discussed at length--certainly people on both sides have made \nstrong arguments to me about their position. The Foreign Relations \nCommittee did conduct a hearing on some of the issues related to this \nsubject. But I am troubled that neither the Foreign Relations Committee \nnor the Judiciary Committee has given this complex legislation the \ncareful review that it deserves, regarding the judicial structure as \nlaid out in the legislation before us.\n\n  Perhaps I am too conservative in my approach to this matter. But it \nseems to me that we should be hesitant to take steps that may \npotentially politicize our courts, may put at risk our businesses \nabroad, and may detract from our efforts to marshall international \nsupport for ending the Castro regime, which is what we are all \ndedicated to addressing here in the U.S. Senate. The Senate should \nthink and act very carefully before taking this precedent-setting step \nin my judgment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2915\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, there has been introduced by the Senator \nfrom Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nregarding the consideration of a constitutional amendment to limit \ncongressional terms. His amendment would take the position that it is \nthe sense of the Senate that the Senate should pass prior to the end of \nthe first session of the 104th Congress a constitutional amendment \nlimiting the number of terms Members of Congress can serve.\n  I would like to address that sense-of-the-Senate resolution for a \nmoment. In the first place, I want to commend Senator Ashcroft once \nagain. He is one of the leaders. We are original cosponsors of the \nconstitutional amendment provision that came out of the Judiciary \nCommittee with regard to term limits.\n  So he and I have joined hands together, along with so many the \nothers, especially some of the newer Members of Congress, to fight \nstrongly for term limits. It has been very high on our agenda for some \ntime.\n  I must respectfully disagree with him on this matter of tactics. It \nseems to me that we would be better served if we would wait until we \nare positioned to have a better chance of winning. It is just that \nsimple. Good friends and good colleagues, even agreeing on the same \nissue, can disagree on tactics, and we do that. I would like to explain \nfor a moment my reasoning.\n  I suppose we are making progress because for about 200 years, the \nCongress, the U.S. Senate, went without even getting a vote on term \nlimits for a constitutional amendment. Now we are debating among \nourselves as to when the best time for the vote is. So I really think \nthat is progress.\n  Ten of the freshmen Members of the U.S. Senate, so many others who \nhave been here for a longer period of time, decided early on in this \nsession that it was going to be a top priority for us.\n  We came into the U.S. Congress with a little different view. We \nthought that service in the U.S. Congress should not necessarily be a \ncareer, but that it should be an interruption to a career. We thought \nit was good for people coming to Congress to have done other things, \nand that they would do some other things in their life later on. This \nwas based on the proposition, not that newer faces were necessarily \nbetter than faces that had been around for a while, but that in the \nlong run we would have a better chance of doing the things we are going \nto have to do in this Nation. Members would make the tough decisions, \nif we had more citizen legislators who came in being able to take \nrisks, and not having their entire livelihood and their entire fate \nwrapped up in the next election.\n  Career politicians, in my opinion, are somewhat averse to taking \nrisks. In order to provide the leadership, this country is going to \nneed to get us over the hurdles we are now facing. Goodness knows we \nare right in the middle of taking those hurdles right now. We are going \nto have to have people who are not dependent on the last public opinion \npoll, but who seriously have talked to the people. And, after having \ntalked with the people who sent them up here, they will have to decide \nthey are going to do some things in different ways and exercise some \nleadership.\n  That is the thinking we have and are firmly committed to. So I \nintroduced a bill in the Judiciary Committee for a constitutional \namendment. Other people have introduced other bills. It is pretty clear \nnow, after the Supreme Court decision, that term limits will have to be \nvoted on as a constitutional amendment. That is a rather high hurdle, \nbut we are committed to that. I believe we will ultimately succeed in \nthat.\n  Senator Ashcroft joined with me, and for the first time, really, I \nthink in the history of the Senate we passed such a bill out of the \nJudiciary Committee and onto the floor of the Senate. So we feel pretty \ngood about that.\n  But right now, as I say, we are in the position of taking different \nviews as to where we go from here. I would feel much more comfortable, \nfrankly, to take the floor of the Senate to debate the policy, and I \ncannot wait until we get into a situation where we can spend a few days \ndebating that policy. There may be a few people in the Chamber who \ndisagree with my position on this as we consider it.\n  But right now we are talking about tactics. We are in the middle \nright now, as everyone in this Nation who pays any attention at all \nknows, of some of the toughest budget negotiations probably in the \nhistory of this body. People are talking about train wrecks. People are \nasking, who is going to blink first? The Government is going to shut \ndown; we are going to exceed the debt limitation. All kinds of terrible \nthings are going to happen. And reporters are rushing from one end of \nPennsylvania Avenue to the other end to get briefings almost hourly as \nto what the positions are going to be and who is going to relent and \nwho is going to be willing to compromise and all of that.\n  This is important stuff because it is the very crux of the agenda of \nmost of those of us who support term limits so \n\n[[Page S 15090]]\navidly. Many of us who support term limits also came to town with the \ncommitment to balance the budget for the first time in decades in this \ncountry, to keep from bankrupting the next generation which we are \nsurely on the road to, committed to saving Medicare, committed to major \nreform in welfare, committed to tax cuts for the American people.\n  Those are the things on which the last election was run. Those are \nthe things I think the American people are for. Reasonable people can \ndisagree with all or part of that agenda, but that is the agenda, that \nis what is before us now.\n  So, finally, after winning these elections and coming to town and \ngetting our feet under us and having the budget process work its will \ndown to this point, we are in the middle of it. And it is a great day \nfor the Senate because I think those of us who are for those measures \nwill prevail.\n  But, regardless, they are on the table, they are being debated for \nthe first time in a long time, and they are important to the future of \nthis country. We have been talking about reforming welfare for years \nand years. We have not done anything. Everybody is for a balanced \nbudget. This is the first time in decades we really have a chance to \nmake the first downpayment toward that end.\n  These are important matters. My feeling is that in the midst of that, \nit would be better to wait until we have a better opportunity to focus \non the issue of term limits. I think too often we get spread too thin \non so many of these issues. Some might say we are doing it for these \nlast few days, maybe the next few days, because we all know what the \nreal battles are going to be about here in the next couple weeks and \nthey have nothing to do with what is being debated here today.\n  So the question becomes, would it be better to rush to a vote now in \nthe midst of all this and take a few hours and have a vote on term \nlimits? And those of us who are for term limits would get as much time \nas we could and come in and make an argument and have a quick vote and \nwe would lose, and then we would go on about our business, which is the \nprimary business of this country right now. Or whether it would be \nbetter to wait until the first of the year when we will have more time, \nwe will be able to generate more attention and give these groups and \nthese citizens out in this country who are so interested in this issue \nan opportunity to do their work and focus their attention on these \ncongressional districts and these States that are vitally important.\n  I think the answer is the latter. Reasonable people can disagree. \nSome people can say, well, we ought to make folks vote on it now; we \nknow we are going to lose; make folks vote on it so we can go to their \nStates later on and say they voted against it and put the pressure on \nthem to change their votes. Others say let us wait because if a person \nis not likely for the issue, it might be better for the person to vote \nwith us later on.\n  Reasonable people can disagree. I think it is the latter. I do not \nmind fighting a good cause and going down in flames if that is the way \nit has to be. But I prefer to fight a good cause and win. And if we \nwill not shoot ourselves in the foot, as so many of us who have been \npushing so strongly the last few months have the tendency to do in both \nHouses of Congress, we can ultimately have a victory in this area.\n  On October 3, I wrote a letter to the majority leader, Senator Dole, \nbriefly outlining this position and my feeling that it would be better \nto put the vote off until we could focus on it because we would have a \nbetter chance of winning. I was not alone. There were 10 freshman \nSenators. We did not solicit the signatures of anyone except in the \nfreshman class, and not all were present when we passed the letter, as \na matter of fact, but 10 of us signed the letter to the majority leader \nfor this purpose. We may be right; we may be wrong tactically, but \nthose who share our opinion that it would be better to wait until the \nfirst of the year include Americans Back in Charge, which is an avid \npro term limits organization and doing a lot of good work, the \nChristian Coalition, the American Conservative Union, the Seniors \nCoalition, the Council for Government Reform, and Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste.\n  Now, all of those groups which constitute the term limits coalition \nshare our view, or we, the 10 freshman Members, and I would daresay \nothers who are pro term limits in this body, share their view that it \nwould be better to wait, instead of rushing to judgment on this thing, \nuntil we have an opportunity to have a real battle, a real debate, and \nenough time to generate the support necessary to get the job done.\n  Unfortunately, now the issue has gotten into Presidential politics. \nAs the majority leader knows, I have endorsed someone else in the \nPresidential race, but I must say this. It is unfair and unfortunate \nthat the majority leader is being attacked as in some way being weak on \nterm limits or deciding unilaterally that he does not want to have a \nvote on it.\n  The majority leader committed early on to having a vote on this \nmatter, and we went to him and asked him, based on our understanding of \nwhat would be the best tactics and our understanding of what would be \nthe best strategy, to wait until we had a chance to have a real shot at \nvictory.\n  And the majority leader acceded to that. And we appreciate that. I am \nnot running for President. I am trying to get term limits passed. I do \nnot have any dogs in that particular fight in that regard. I am \ninterested in the best approach to pass term limits. This is what I \nthink ultimately will be the best strategy to get term limits passed.\n  They can fight about the rest of it among themselves. But I think we \nought to be fair and make sure we are not leaving the wrong impression \nwith regard to who is doing what and what the motivations are and \naccusing people of dragging their feet on term limits when just the \ncontrary is true. Therefore I respectfully oppose the sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Chair recognizes the \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I know there is some difference of opinion \napparently on this side, maybe on the other side too, on when we will \nhave a vote on term limits. I am just trying to accommodate what I \nthought was a consensus. Apparently it was not a consensus.\n  Now what I want to do is get consent to have a cloture vote tonight \nat 8:30. We will have a vote on the sense-of-the-Senate resolution, I \nassume, as soon as something comes up that we can offer the sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution. But whether or not we are going to have a vote \non term limits this year depends whether it passes or not.\n  I am sorry that the freshmen I thought were all in agreement are not \nnow in agreement. But in any event, what we need to resolve is that we \nhave a cloture vote tonight at 8:30 on the pending business, which is \nthe Cuban Freedom of Democracy Act. As I understand it there is no \nobjection unless the Senator from Missouri objects. We have got a \nnumber of people who want to leave. I think 10 Senators are leaving on \na task force that I suggested to go to Bosnia. And we have got five \nSenators coming back at about 8:30. And it is a very important cloture \nvote. I do not think we will get cloture the first time around.\n  We think it is a very important vote. We would like to get consent to \ndo that. I can assure the Senator from Missouri he will have an \nopportunity to vote. But the Democrats cannot agree if we can have the \nvote prior to the cloture vote on Tuesday. I will not make a Federal \ncase out of that. The Senator can get his vote almost any time.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Reserving the right to object, I suggest the absence of \na quorum for a time of discussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I know that the Senator from West Virginia \nwishes to speak. I am just going to take a moment to agree with the \ncomments from the Senator from Tennessee a moment ago expressed about \nhaving the vote on \n\n[[Page S 15091]]\nthe term limits resolution. Most of us who support term limits want to \nhave that vote at a time when we have the best opportunity to win it. \nAnd the reason that we sent a letter to the majority leader asking him \nto hold the vote until sometime in the future when we thought we had \nthat support or might have that support was precisely because we wanted \nto have the vote scheduled when we thought we could win it.\n  There will be more time for the supporters to mobilize support in the \ninterim period of time. And I just wanted to express my appreciation to \nthe majority leader for acceding to the wishes of the majority of those \nof us who would prefer to have the vote later.\n  I also want to say however there has not been any greater advocate \nfrom term limits than the Senator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, and \nthat if he wishes to have a vote on the sense-of-the-Senate resolution, \nI naturally would support that. But I just wanted to make it very clear \nthat the only reason that the majority leader would defer the vote on \nthe term-limits proposal itself is because those of us who support it \nhave requested that he do so. I appreciate the willingness of the \nmajority leader to accommodate us in that regard.\n  I appreciate, Mr. President, the opportunity to speak here for this \nmoment. I would suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Arizona withhold?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/12/senate-section/article/S15088-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15091-S15092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FORGETTING THE DISABLED\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I have just been made aware of \nsomething which I think is unprecedented as far as I can remember, in \nwhich case and in any event is very shocking. I want my colleagues to \nbe aware of it, that an attempt is now in the process, or may have \nalready been made and accomplished by the Republican leadership, to \ndrop language from an amendment that was passed overwhelmingly in the \nSenate Finance Committee in its formal and official public markup. I am \nnot sure if this is a violation of Senate rules or of Senate Finance \nCommittee rules but it is a violation of any kind of reasonable \npractice.\n  Let me say this again because it is just to me an unbelievable \nsituation. I said that correctly. As I speak, Republican leadership \nstaff is telling reporters--is telling reporters--that language that \nwas voted on, voted on and passed by the vote of 17 to 3, a recorded \nvote, is going to be dropped.\n  Now, there is no doubt about what happened. For one, I was among the \ncommittee that was there. Second, I am a coauthor of the amendment that \nwas involved. And there is also a transcript of the proceedings of the \nSenate Finance Committee markup. And there was a rollcall vote. \nSeventeen Republicans and Democrats voted for the Chafee-Rockefeller \namendment in committee.\n  Now, this amendment stemmed out of the whole question of what are we \ngoing to do with pregnant women, and children and the disabled with \nrespect to turning over all of Medicaid to the States. And there were \nthose of us who felt that pregnant women and children and the disabled \nought to be--that guarantee ought to continue because that is so \nfundamental in American life. So poor children, pregnant women and the \ndisabled, that is what the members of the Finance Committee voted for.\n  Now, again, some say that this is going to be dropped. No new debate. \nNo new hearing. No new vote. Unprecedented. Just a closed door. A \ndealing with a closed door. And the disabled get dropped.\n  Now, I do not know where I am. Is this the U.S. Senate or is this the \ntwilight zone? We are looking through a looking glass of some sort. \nWhen votes do not count and history is not history and what was done \nwas not actually done, this is more than a wonderland, it is positively \nOrwellian.\n  I do not know whether I participated, therefore, in some kind of a \nshow markup. Was this just a game we were playing? It was a formal \nsession, called to session by Chairman Roth. It lasted for 3 days. This \noccurred, I believe, on the last day. But you go to a show markup and \nthen the real results are done later.\n  Now, there were some deals that were cut behind doors over on the \nHouse side the other day, yesterday, which we were informed about last \nnight, some of us, which were pretty shocking. But this is the Senate. \nAnd the committee process, which I respect, which I am a part of, is \nmade a sham. And forget the rules, forget the procedures, forget the \nrecord.\n  Now, I am just going to go to two things and I will be finished on \nit. This was an amendment offered by Senator Chafee and myself.\n  Let me just read the purpose. ``To guarantee health care coverage''--\nthis is what was handed out to each Senate Finance Committee member \nbefore the discussion of the vote--``To guarantee health care coverage \nto low-income pregnant women and children''--that happens to be \nchildren through the age of 12--``and to individuals with \ndisabilities,'' verbal emphasis I add.\n  The words are already there in the description. ``At the appropriate \nplace, insert language,'' et cetera, ``coverage for pregnant women and \nchildren aged 12 and under, living in families below 100 percent of the \nFederal poverty level and to individuals with disabilities,'' verbal \nemphasis I supply.\n  The record itself in this discussion, one Senator is saying, ``What \nit would do would be to guarantee health care coverage to low-income \npregnant women and children and individuals with disabilities,'' in \nexplaining the amendment before the Finance Committee members before \nthe vote.\n\n  And then shortly thereafter, the same Senator says, ``That language \nbe inserted which guarantees coverage''--this is in the debate now--\n``to pregnant women and children, age 12 and under, living in families \nbelow 100 percent of the poverty level and individuals with \ndisabilities.''\n  Very clear to members of the Finance Committee.\n  Then on the next page, the same Senator indicating, ``So we make a \nlittle improvement over the current thing, plus individuals with \ndisabilities.''\n  Then later on in the debate, and there was some debate over this, the \nsame Senator: ``And I also would point out to everyone here that we are \ndealing with the disabled as well.''\n  This was the statement that was made immediately prior to the vote. \n``We are dealing with the low-income pregnant women and children and \nthe disabled, as I mentioned before. So I would like to have a vote,'' \nthe Senator said.\n  Another Senator said, ``Mr. Chairman, all time has expired on both \nsides.''\n  The chairman said, ``We are trying to proceed. I congratulate the \ndistinguished Senator,'' et cetera, et cetera, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The clerk: ``Mr. Dole.''\n  The chairman: ``Aye by proxy,'' and he was represented.\n  ``Mr. Packwood.''\n  No by proxy.\n  ``Mr. Chafee.''\n  Aye by proxy.\n  ``Mr. Grassley,'' and so on it went.\n  So here we have the amendment, here we have the committee transcript \nof the hearing itself and now, if the disabled are dropped after they \nwere included in the amendment, voted for in the amendment and the \namendment was approved by 17 of the 20 members of the Finance \nCommittee, then how can anybody ever trust anything that goes on in \nthis body? How can anybody trust anything that goes on in the Finance \nCommittee? How can anybody trust anything that goes on as between the \ntwo parties within this Chamber?\n  It is an outrageous situation, Mr. President. It is one which is \ngrossly unfair. It is manipulative of due process, of proper voting \nand, in fact, of consensus on the Finance Committee.\n  There are a lot of disabled folks out there. For them to get dropped \nin some kind of a back-room deal before this bill comes to the Senate, \nI want to put my colleagues on notice, it is going to be a very \ninteresting discussion.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. \n\n[[Page S 15092]]\n\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have listened to some of the debate on \nthe Cuba resolution and, in a way, I almost think I am watching the \nU.S. Senate scripted by Monty Python. You would think that we have \nthese two huge megacountries at war with each other, trying to see \nwhich one can get some kind of an advantage over the other. But the \nsituation as it is involves the most powerful nation in history and an \nimpoverished little island. I do not hold any brief for Mr. Castro and \nhis brand of communism, nor do I hold any brief for the mistakes he has \nmade in his country that have caused suffering among his own people.\n  But when you hear in this debate suggestions that somehow United \nStates security is at risk if we do not continue to punish Mr. Castro \nand the people of Cuba, that is ridiculous, Mr. President. It is a bit \nlike the argument we heard about a decade ago that if the Soviet Union \nwere able to have their supporters in Nicaragua, the next thing you \nknow, they would be marching on Galveston, TX. It ignores the reality \nof the situation and ignores the fact that if they were foolish enough \nto do that, they would not get very far. The Texas National Guard is \nstronger than any Central American military force.\n  Here we have a situation where some are saying we should not even \ngive Fidel Castro a visa to go to the United Nations, as if the United \nStates would turn its back on its own treaty and legal obligations in \nthat regard. Maybe at some point we should acknowledge the reality. The \nreality is that you have an aging Communist leader, whom time and \nhistory and economic realities have left behind, who must realize that \nhimself, and who will not live forever--as none of us do--but a man who \nposes no threat to the United States ideologically, militarily, \neconomically, or in any other way. But you have an awful lot of people \non that little island who do not have medical needs met, nutritional \nneeds met, and so many of their economic needs certainly are not met.\n  We have the rest of the world looking at the United States and \nsaying, ``What are they afraid of?'' Our neighbor to the north, Canada, \na country with whom we share the longest unguarded frontier in the \nworld, has regular relations with Cuba. I can drive an hour from my \nhome in Vermont to the airport in Montreal and get on a plane to Cuba. \nThey are not threatened by it. But here, in the most powerful nation on \nEarth, I cannot do that. I would have to have all kinds of special \nexemptions made and State Department authorization, and on and on and \non. You know, at some point, somebody is going to say that we are \nafraid of our own shadow. I do not think we are. We are too good and \ntoo powerful a nation for that.\n  Let us pay attention to the real foreign policy concerns of our \ncountry. Let us ask ourselves, should we not be spending far more time \nin reasserting the leadership we have not given NATO over the past 3, \n4, or 5 years? Let us ask whether we should be doing more to support \nthe emerging democracies of the world. Let us ask what we are doing to \nexpand our markets abroad like the Japanese, Europeans, and others do, \nat a time when we have huge balance-of-payment deficits, which started \nabout 8 years ago. Let us not continue this absurd obsession with the \naging leader of a tiny little island that poses no threat to the United \nStates.\n  It demeans what we stand for, and it impedes the development of \ncloser relations between our two countries. It is by strengthening \nthose ties, by enabling Americans to travel freely to Cuba and Cubans \nto come here, that we will eventually see democracy in Cuba, not by \ncontinuing to isolate Cuba as if the Cold War had never ended and the \nSoviet Union were still trying to put its missiles there. The times \nhave changed, and it is time we changed with the times.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/12/senate-section/article/S15092-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15092-S15093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  BIPARTISAN BUDGET SUMMIT NEEDED NOW\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this morning's headline reports that budget \nnegotiations between the President and the Republican congressional \nleaders have broken down. Instead of working together, the leaders are \nslinging partisan arrows of blame at each other in today's papers. I \nthink, because of that, it is all the more reason to have a bipartisan \nsummit on the budget.\n  In fact, this is the third time in the last 2 months and the fourth \ntime this year that I have called for a summit meeting between \ncongressional leaders and the President to resolve their budget \ndifferences.\n  In my earlier speeches, my main concern has been to avoid the costly \nand unnecessary Government shutdown that some have predicted in the \nbeginning of the fiscal year last week. Fortunately, the President and \nthe Congress have avoided this disaster. We agreed to a continuing \nresolution that funds the Government for the next 6 weeks. I applaud \nthe bipartisan cooperation displayed to reach this continuing \nresolution.\n  But I fear that the President and the Republican congressional \nleadership are now playing a more serious game of chicken--a high-\nstakes game over raising the debt limit.\n  The Government is fast approaching the $4.9 trillion ceiling of \nFederal borrowing imposed by Congress in 1993. For the Government to \nkeep paying its bills, Congress has to increase the debt limit. I think \nthe deadline is about a month away on November 15, when the Government \nneeds to borrow to meet $25 billion in interest payments, payments due \nthousands of individuals, businesses, financial institutions, and \npension funds that own Treasury securities.\n  The Republican leaders are now threatening to use the debt limit as a \nclub to beat the President into submission over the budget. Already, \n165 Republican Members of the House of Representatives have pledged to \nrefuse to vote for raising the debt limit, unless the President agrees \nto what they say should be the budget. In 21 years here, I have not \nseen an action so irresponsible by either Democrats or Republicans. The \nSpeaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, is not helping by going along with \nthe ultimatum and saying, ``I am with them. I do not intend to schedule \nthe debt limit if they are not met.'' It sounds almost like a child in \na sandbox \n\n[[Page S 15093]]\nthrowing a tantrum, instead of somebody who leads a great institution \nand is a leader of a great national political party.\n  The Speaker says he will use this hard-line approach no matter what, \ndeclaring, ``I do not care what the price is.'' Treasury Secretary \nRubin responded that the President will not be blackmailed by the use \nof the debt limit as a negotiating level.\n\n  Well, I am one Vermonter who feels that issuing ultimatums is dumb \nand counterproductive. Raising the debt limit should not be a partisan \nissue. It is just too important.\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan got it right when he said: \n``The issue of default should not be on the table. To default for the \nfirst time in the history of this Nation is not something anyone should \ntake in a tranquil manner.''\n  In fact, such a default would have serious consequences, indeed.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, reflecting some of the \nfeelings as Republican Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board recently \nwarned:\n\n       Defaulting on payments have much graver economic \n     consequences than failing to enact discretionary \n     appropriations by the start of the fiscal year * * *  even a \n     temporary default--that is, a few days' delay in the \n     Government's ability to meet its obligations--could have \n     serious repercussions in the financial markets. Those \n     repercussions include a permanent increase in Federal \n     borrowing costs * * *.\n  It is foolish to risk increasing our Federal borrowing costs through \na default.\n  Unfortunately, the United States carries close to a $4.9 trillion \ndebt burden and over 16 percent of our annual budget goes to interest \npayments on the Federal debt.\n  Interestingly enough, some of the same people who say that we will \nnot honor this debt today are some of the same Members of Congress who \nstrongly supported the President of their own party who, during the \n1980's, tripled the national debt.\n  One analyst estimated that if the Government's interest rate had been \njust a 0.01 percentage point higher than the last year, the \nGovernment's annual borrowing costs would have increased by $211 \nmillion. Those same people say they want a balanced budget are willing \nto throw away a chance to balance the budget by permanently jacking up \nthe Government's interest costs.\n  That repercussion of default goes a lot further than just the \nGovernment's borrowing costs. It may make some nice political points \nback home to say, ``We do not care; we will just shut down the \nGovernment, that mean, nasty old government. We do not need it \nanyway.''\n  Well, they ought to also tell some of their constituents, if they are \na homeowner looking for a mortgage, their mortgage rates will go up. If \nthey are consumers shopping for a new car, the costs of that new car \nwill go up. If they are a small business that wanted to expand, wanted \nto increase their inventory, wanted to increase their equipment, they \nwill pay more for the money to do that.\n  To crush the dreams of millions of Americans over this silly game of \npolitical poker is totally irresponsible. Some have even suggested that \nthe Treasury Department play games with Government trust funds--\nincluding the Social Security trust fund, the Medicare trust fund--in \norder to postpone default. I believe that also is irresponsible.\n  Every day Treasury collects billions of dollars for these public \ntrust funds for the payroll taxes. They invest the fund surpluses to \npay beneficiaries later on. This year, the Social Security trust fund \nwill run a surplus of $481 billion. The Medicare trust fund will run a \nsurplus of $147 billion. Tapping into these funds allows the Treasury \nto avoid default, but cashing in the surpluses is morally and fiscally \nwrong.\n  We made a commitment to the American people to keep these funds in \ntrust for future generations. Divesting the funds ignores the long-term \ninvestment needs to provide the baby-boom generation with Social \nSecurity and Medicare benefits in the years to come.\n  The Republican leadership and the President need to get together. The \nconsequences of a Government default are just too serious to be held \nhostage by partisan politics. To protect our public trust funds, to \nkeep the Government's and private sector's costs down, and maintain \nAmerica's creditworthiness, we need a bipartisan budget summit now to \navoid a debt limit crisis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/12/senate-section/article/S15092-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CELEBRATING THE ``NEW'' OLD NORTH END\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Burlington Vermont's Old North End does not \nlook like the kind of community most people, even most Vermonters, \nenvision when they think of Vermont. It is one of the State's most \neconomically depressed neighborhoods, in a city which is the closet \nthing to urban you will find in Vermont. But the character of \nVermonters, is as evident in the Old North End as it is in every corner \nof Vermont.\n  One year ago the resident's of the Old North End requested \ndesignation as an enterprise community under President Clinton's new \nenterprise zone initiative. The State and city government, businesses, \nschools, nonprofit groups, and residents sat down together and came up \nwith a plan to rebuild the Old North End.\n  I have never seen so many people, from such different backgrounds \nwork so hard to fulfill their dream. That hard work paid off.\n  This weekend Vermont's only enterprise community celebrates the \nbeginning of its revitalization and the launching of 70 strategies for \nrenewal. I am honored to have been asked to participate in that \ncelebration.\n  Today, the dream of a new Old North End is well on its way to \nbecoming a reality. The foundations have already been built with the \ndedication and commitment of a great many people who have shown all of \nthe best qualities Vermont has to offer. Congratulations are in order \nfor every one of them. Let the celebration begin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/12/senate-section/article/S15093-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15093-S15094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ON MEDICAID\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, far too often, in Washington, the human \nside of Federal programs are forgotten. This year's debate has been \nmore concerned with the bottom line and tax cuts than how best to serve \nthe people. In a recent column in the Burlington Free Press, Barbara \nLeitenberg put a face on what is at stake in the Medicaid debate. I ask \nunanimous consent that Ms. Leitenberg's article be printed in the \nRecord for my Senate colleagues to read.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Sept. 4, 1995]\n\n                   Seniors Fear Holes in Medicaid Net\n\n                        (By Barbara Lettenberg)\n\n       ``It's not a Contract with America; it's a contract with \n     death,'' says Lyman Deavitt, 65, of Burlington, his blue eyes \n     flashing in anger. ``I'd like to meet Newt Gingrich one-on-\n     one.''\n       Deavitt is especially worried about congressional proposals \n     to limit the growth of Medicaid, the ultimate safety net for \n     health-care costs.\n       He suffers from insulin-dependent diabetes and resulting \n     neuropathy in both legs, two hard-to-treat ancurysms, blood \n     vessel and bowel blockages, cataracts, and infections in his \n     one remaining kidney.\n       Because of surgery for cancer of the bladder, he must use a \n     device that siphons his urine directly from his kidney to a \n     pouch outside his body.\n       ``I have no way to pay for these things,'' says Deavitt. \n     ``All I have is $704 a month from Social Security. You can \n     understand why I get on a rampage about those jerks in \n     Washington.''\n       Medicaid is a federal/state program, started in 1965, which \n     provides medical and long-term care for people with very low \n     incomes. In Vermont, that means no more than $683 per month. \n     $741 in Chittenden County. A single person must have no more \n     than $2,000 in resources; a married couple, no more than \n     $3,000.\n       More than 82,000 Vermonters participate in Medicaid: Almost \n     45,000 are under 18; 28,000 are 18-64; and 9,500 are 65 and \n     older. Medicaid pays for physician and hospital care, and \n     some home health and personal care. It is the payer of last \n     resort for care in nursing homes. Medicaid also has special \n     programs in which people who do not quite meet its strict \n     income and resource eligibility rules can get benefits when \n     they face extraordinary health-care bills.\n       In its Budget Resolution, passed in June, Congress proposes \n     to cut $182 billion from Medicaid by the year 2002. This \n     would be done by limiting the rate of increase from about 10 \n     percent a year to just below 5 percent. Although Medicaid \n     will still grow at this lower rate, programs will have to be \n     cut because the lower rate does not account for general and \n     medical care inflation and the growth in the eligible \n     population.\n\n[[Page S 15094]]\n\n       Some 7,100 Vermonters would be cut from the Medicaid rolls \n     between 1996 and 2002 if these changes are approved, says the \n     national Long Term Care Campaign in its study, ``Some Cuts \n     Never Heal.''\n       Lyman Deavitt was born in Fletcher, one of nine children: \n     five boys and four girls. He attended a one-room schoolhouse \n     and ``just missed graduating from high school in Johnson.'' \n     When he was a young man, his family moved to Essex Junction.\n       After a series of jobs at the Park Cafe and the old \n     Oakledge Manor in Burlington and after five years working in \n     Boston, he became credit manager at Flanders Lumber Co. in \n     Essex Junction. He stayed there 15 years until his bout with \n     cancer in 1981 and successive disabilities made him unable to \n     work.\n       ``I tried to go back to work at Flanders after my cancer \n     surgery,'' says Deavitt, ``but I could only manage about \n     three hours a day, and they had to let me go. Then I had to \n     spend all of my money on medical care. I was put on \n     disability in 1984.''\n       Deavitt's mother taught him to crochet after his cancer \n     surgery, and he spends a great deal of his time making \n     afghans. The latest one is going to be raffled off at the \n     senior high-rise on St. Paul Street, with the proceeds going \n     to the Burlington Visiting Nurse Association.\n       If his benefits from Medicaid are reduced, couldn't Deavitt \n     get help from his family? He has a married daughter in \n     Florida and a grown grandson. ``There's no way my daughter \n     can help,'' says Deavitt. ``She's very ill. My parents and my \n     brothers are dead. Two of my sisters have no money, like me. \n     The other two are married, and I couldn't ask them. I'd \n     rather be put out on the street. That's what's happening: The \n     politicians are forcing people to live on the street.\n       ``It's terrifying for me to hear all this talk about cuts \n     in Medicaid,'' says Deavitt. ``If they want to start cutting \n     programs, they should leave the elderly out, the people with \n     disabilities, the children. Why don't they stop the space \n     program instead? To me, this is a bad setup.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/12/senate-section/article/S15093-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN AGAINST LANDMINES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier today, Save the Children, the \nWomen's Commission for Refugee Women and Children, and others joined \ntogether to launch a national campaign to ban the production, use, and \ntransfer of antipersonnel landmines.\n  They spoke of a 2-week conference that has just ended--actually, more \nthan a conference, a gathering of nations--in Vienna, Austria, to reach \nagreement on ways to stop the killing and maiming of civilians by these \nindiscriminate weapons.\n  At that conference in Vienna, officials from governments from around \nthe world, including our own, made speeches about how terrible \nlandmines are. Many of them spoke of the fact that there are 100 \nmillion unexploded landmines in over 60 countries, and every day, every \n22 minutes, somebody--often a child--is killed or maimed by these \nlandmines. That is 72 people every day of every week of the year. They \nwent on to say how much they all wanted to get rid of them, but. They \neach had an exception or loophole so their landmines, or their manner \nof using them, would not be affected.\n  President Clinton gave a stirring speech at the United Nations last \nyear, where he called for the eventual elimination of antipersonnel \nlandmines. That was an historic milestone. But in Vienna last week, the \nUnited States lagged behind several countries, including several of our \nNATO allies. While Belgium outlawed landmines and Austria renounced \ntheir use and France announced that it would no longer produce them, \nthe United States continued to resist these kinds of dramatic steps.\n  At least the U.S. Senate, a body that can and should be the \nconscience of the Nation, voted by a two-thirds majority to impose a 1-\nyear moratorium on the use of antipersonnel landmines and to continue \nour moratorium on the export of landmines.\n  We here in the U.S. Senate took a leadership position that has been \napplauded around the world. Editorials around the world have said how \nfar reaching we were. A number of countries have even gone farther.\n  Why did Belgium, a country that sends people for peacekeeping \nmissions all the time, ban the use of antipersonnel landmines by its \nown forces? Because when Belgium sends peacekeepers, even after the \nfighting has stopped and the guns have been withdrawn, there is one \nkiller that remains behind--the millions of antipersonnel landmines, \neach one waiting for a peacekeeper or a nurse or a missionary to step \non a pile of leaves or some grass or a road or walk by a watering hole \nand suddenly lose their leg or their arm or their life. The same \nhappens when a child picks up a shiny object thinking it is a toy and \nloses his or her hands or face or eyes or life. That happens every few \nminutes in the 60-odd countries that are infested with unexploded \nlandmines.\n  Mr. President, much could be done if the United States had the \ncourage to adopt as its official policy the moratorium passed by the \nU.S. Senate, Republicans and Democrats, some of the most conservative \nand some of the most liberal. It was a vote that spanned the political \nspectrum. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer who voted for \nthat.\n  It is no denigration of any of us that we have differences in \npolitical philosophy. We come from different parts of the country and \ndifferent parties. But we approach this issue with the same \nhumanitarian sense.\n  This is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. The \ndistinguished Presiding Officer knows from his past experience in the \npast administration--he knows how volunteers from this country, \ncarrying out the highest ideals of this country, volunteers in the \nPeace Corps, go to countries like Ethiopia, and Nicaragua, and perhaps \neven Bosnia someday. What is one of the biggest dangers they face? It \nis not malaria, it is not dysentery, although those diseases are there. \nIt is that when they go into a village to help somebody plant a new \nvariety of corn or wheat or help build an irrigation system or teach a \ngroup of children how to play baseball, they may not come back alive \nbecause of landmines, probably left there by people who were fighting \nyears ago. But the landmines remain.\n  I hope our country will take more of a lead, that we will start \ncatching up with some of our NATO allies and others who have \nexperienced firsthand the devastation these insidious weapons cause.\n  I expect we are going to send troops to Bosnia, to fulfill our \ncommitments to NATO. At a meeting of the bipartisan congressional \nleadership with the President and his Cabinet the other day I said, \n``If we do send Americans into Bosnia, into the former Yugoslavia, Mr. \nPresident, I hope you will do one thing. I hope you will tell the \nAmerican people that this is not a risk-free operation. That even if \nthere is a cease-fire, even if there is a cease-fire that holds, the \nmen and women we send in there will face one very grave danger--from \nlandmines. Some estimate over 1.5 million landmines are strewn in \nBosnia alone.'' I learned today that there are another 2 million in \nCroatia.\n  We need to tell the American people that their sons and daughters may \nnot be shot by one of the warring sides in the former Yugoslavia, but \nthey may be injured or killed tragically by a landmine left behind. And \nit is quite possible we will not even know which side put it there.\n  These are the Saturday night specials of civil wars and guerrilla \nwarfare.\n  So, I applaud those who came together today to renew a national \ndebate on banning landmines. I thank my colleagues here in the Senate \nwho joined to vote for a moratorium on their use. I commend the \nPresident for the position he has taken, as far as it has gone. I \ncommend the Secretary of State, UN Ambassador Albright and others who \nhave also, but I urge the administration to redouble its efforts. Only \nstrong leadership, by the world's only superpower, will suffice.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

Mr. President, I rise in support of the substitute \nCuban \n\n[[Page S 15095]]\nLiberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of which I was privileged to be \nan original cosponsor, and intend, if I am not, to be a cosponsor of \nthe substitute.\n  Mr. President, for decades we in America faced down Fidel Castro's \nthreats to our security, and his efforts to spread communism in our \nhemisphere. The worldwide struggle against communism is over, and \ndemocracy and market economies have won. It may be too easy in that \nglobal context to simply take Castro and his continued power in Cuba as \na curiosity--a harmless relic of a bygone age. But it is much more than \nthat.\n  His continued governance of Cuba represents the continuation of \ndictatorship and denial of human rights to the people of Cuba. The \nvaliant struggle of the Cuban people to liberate themselves from the \nyoke of Castro's Communist regime goes on. We in our turn owe it to \nthem, and to our principles, to remain steadfast in support of their \nstruggle. The Cuban Democracy Act of 1992, of which I was a cosponsor, \nestablished a policy, now carried out by the Clinton administration, \nwhich is to maintain pressure on the Castro regime for peaceful \ndemocratic and market reform.\n  Mr. President, it is pleasing to note that we are seeing progress as \na result of that policy. Without Soviet aid, the Cuban economy \ncontinues to deteriorate. With freedom and democracy growing throughout \nthe Western Hemisphere, Castro cannot long silence the voices of the \nCuban people in an era marked by a growing wave of self-determination \nand democracy. The Cuban people will not long be stifled in their \ndesire to realize for themselves the better life that millions and \nmillions more people around the world have achieved within the last \ndecade. So by any reasonable calculus, by any rational predictor of the \ncourse of history, the days of the Castro regime are numbered.\n  The question that the substitute before us poses is should we now \nrelent and allow the Cuban economy to expand? Should we give Castro \nthereby a new lease on life? Should we leave the Cuban people to suffer \nlonger under what remains as an oppressive regime? Or instead, should \nwe increase our economic pressure on Cuba which is working? Should we \nrenew our commitment to a peaceful transition to democracy and \npolitical and economic freedom?\n  That is the choice we now face. And my answer to the question is to \nchoose the latter course; to increase the economic pressure, and to \nstrongly renew our commitment to a peaceful transition for the Cuban \npeople to economic opportunity and political freedom.\n  The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act builds on the Cuban \nDemocracy Act of 1992. It is a continuation and a strengthening of a \npolicy that is working. This bill extends the economic sanctions to \nkeep economic pressure on the regime in Cuba. At the same time, it \nextends a message of hope to the Cuban people by establishing a basis \nfor United States assistance to the democratic Cuba of the future.\n  Mr. President, the triumph of freedom over communism--the worldwide \ntriumph of freedom over communism--cannot be considered complete while \nthe people of Cuba, our neighbors, remain oppressed by a dictator on \ntheir island in our hemisphere.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote for this substitute. Changes have \nbeen made which I think improve the measure from the original \nintroduced, and which I hope will broaden the base of those in both \nparties who can support this proposal.\n  Tonight, if that is when the vote on cloture occurs, I intend to vote \nfor cloture. And I urge my colleagues of both parties to do likewise.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is really a very gratifying time for \nme to speak on this subject because it goes back to the time of my \nfirst year in the Senate, 1975.\n  I was put on the space committee by the Democratic steering \ncommittee. I did not request to be put on that committee and I did not \nwant to be on it. We did not have much of anything to do.\n  And so after I had been here for a few months, I went to the chairman \nof the committee, Ted Moss, who was the senior Senator from Utah at the \ntime, and I said, ``Ted, I don't mind telling you I'm bored around \nhere. I have been Governor, and there is a lot of action in the \nGovernor's office. There is none here for a freshman with no clout.''\n  I said I had been reading a theory that has been publicized by two \nchemists at the University of California-Irvine, named Rowland and \nMolina. ``They have this theory they say they have worked out in a lab \nthat shows''--and at that time this was how simple the idea was to me--\n``that the hair sprays we use on our hair in the bathroom in the \nmorning over a period of about 15 years waft their way into the \nstratosphere and they destroy a three-celled molecule called ozone, and \nthat the ozone layer is what protects us from the ultraviolet rays of \nthe Sun. It seems like an intriguing theory to me, very possibly true, \nand I would like to be able to chair just some ad hoc hearings and have \npeople come in from around the country to testify for or against the \nRowland and Molina theory.''\n  Senator Moss said that was fine, I could do that, but I needed to get \na Republican colleague to help me. So I recruited my good friend from \nNew Mexico, Senator Domenici, who had not been here much longer than I \nhad. I asked him: ``Will you join me and we will hold hearings. We will \nget some atmospheric scientists from around the country to come in and \ntestify.'' He said he would be glad to.\n  So we did. We held nine hearings. We had Dr. Elroy from Harvard, who \nwas considered the premier atmospheric scientist in America. We had Dr. \nRobert Otten, who was the author of the greenhouse theory. And then \nfinally we had Dr. Sherwood Rowland, who, along with Dr. Mario Molina, \ndeveloped the theory of ozone depletion.\n  You can imagine how much publicity it got. Senators do not go to a \nhearing unless there are a lot of television cameras with their red \nlights on, and there were no television cameras interested in ozone \ndepletion. So we were pretty lonely holding these hearings. And when it \nwas over, I suggested that we offer a bill or an amendment in this \nChamber at the earliest possible time to ban or to phase-out the \nproduction of what we call CFC's, chlorofluorocarbons, at the earliest \npossible time.\n  Senator Domenici did not think the hearings were conclusive enough to \ndo that, and I could understand that because there were a lot of people \nin the country who were very reticent about accepting this theory.\n  Well, I heard that my colleague, Senator Packwood, who was on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee at the time, had an interest in \nit, so I went to see Senator Packwood. I told him about the hearings. I \nsaid I thought he and I ought to team up and see if we could not stop \nthe manufacture of these so-called chlorofluorocarbons and he said he \nthought that it was a great idea. So we spent several hours talking \nabout it. And then we offered the amendment.\n\n  And when it came time to vote, Mr. President, that hallway directly \nin front of me was so full of chemical industry lobbyists you could not \nget in here to vote. At that time this was a $2 billion-a-year \nindustry. When I saw that, I did not think we had much chance anyway; \nbut when I saw that crowd out in the hallway, I knew we did not have a \nchance.\n  I think we got 32, possibly 35 votes. And believe you me, that was \nthe most \n\n[[Page S 15096]]\nliberal Senate I have ever seen. I shudder to think how many votes we \nwould get under a similar situation today.\n  But the arguments abounded on this floor that this is not conclusive; \nthere is not enough evidence to disrupt this industry. And we were only \ntrying to phase it out; we were not trying to kill it all at one time. \nAnd all those industry arguments made about how this was even a \nconspiracy of the Soviet Union KGB, a disinformation attack by the \nSoviet KGB to sow seeds of discord in the United States.\n  My argument was simply this: If it takes 15 years for these \nchlorofluorocarbons to work their way into the stratosphere, even if we \nbanned all CFC's at that moment, it would be 15 years before we would \nbegin to reverse the damage that had already been done.\n  And I said, ``This is the time, if there ever was a time, to err on \nthe side of caution.'' These comments are not self-serving. I actually \nsaid those things on the floor of the Senate. I said them to everybody \nI could find to say them to, that I thought our committee hearings had \nproduced enough evidence that the ozone depletion theory was real, that \nwe ought to err on the side of caution and no great damage would be \ndone if we were wrong.\n  Mr. President, we were not wrong. We were dead right. And the \nNational Academy of Sciences started their studies. And in 1985, thanks \nto a slightly separate theory by Paul Crutzen, who was also honored \nyesterday, of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Mainz, Germany we \ndiscovered the hole in the ozone layer developing over Antarctica. And \nit created such a stir in this Nation that we had the big 1987 Montreal \nProtocol. We agreed to phase out the manufacture of all \nchlorofluorocarbons--and, incidentally, the principal one being Freon \ngas in your refrigerators and automobile air conditioners--that we \nwould phase out the manufacture of all of those by this year, 1995, and \nhopefully we are going to.\n  So, Mr. President, I really came to the floor to say, No. 1, I told \nyou so--and that will get you about a half of one vote to say, ``I told \nyou so''--but more importantly than anything else, to extend my \nprofound and sincere thanks and congratulations to Mario Molina, who \nwas just a postdoctoral fellow working under ``Sherry'' Sherwood \nRowland. Everyone calls him Sherry. Yesterday they were awarded the \nNobel prize for chemistry, along with Dr. Crutzen, the three of them.\n  I cannot tell you how gratifying it is to me that the Nobel committee \nhas chosen two people I feel that I have known all of my public life. \nAs I say, I just came here this afternoon to publicly say on the Senate \nfloor this Nation owes those two men a deep debt of gratitude. I am \nmost grateful that we have people like that in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I might first make a parliamentary inquiry, Mr. \nPresident. Is there a consent order about voting today?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a consent order under which a vote on \ncloture will take place at 8:30 p.m.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On the pending matter?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could I precede that with a remark to my good friend, \nSenator Bumpers, after which I will go on in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to Senator Bumpers, I did not get here in time to \nlisten to all of his remarks, but I vividly recall that we served on a \nlittle subcommittee. I was on that subcommittee, I might share with my \nfriend and the Chair, because freshmen Senators then did not get very \ngood assignments. And so one of my assignments was to the Public Works \nCommittee, now Environment and Public Works. And that was a top \nassignment then because the senior Senator from New Mexico, who was a \nDemocrat, was also on that committee, and he was second from the top.\n  I was not only on the Republican side, but I was the last and \nbrandnew person. And then they gave me a seat on Space, which was being \nphased out. And it is in one of those subcommittees under the rubric of \nspace that the Senator and I held hearings on this very strange \nphenomenon from whence came the Nobel awardees because of their \nresearch. I think that little subcommittee was the first to hold a \nhearing.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am not sure I understood the breadth at that point, \nbut clearly while there are not answers on all of it, there are some \nvery significant answers, and we have done a great deal in the United \nStates against tough odds in reference to the combinations that are \noccurring out there, some of which we were causing with what we used.\n  I compliment the Senator on the remarks and compliment the awardees. \nI do not know them as well as the Senator does. I think it is rather a \nsensational award, and people ought to continue to do work like that if \nthere are going to be Nobel awards for them for that kind of exciting \nwork.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/12/senate-section/article/S15095-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15096-S15097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO RACHEL SCHLESINGER\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and my wife Nancy \nand my family, I would like to speak a few moments about Rachel \nSchlesinger, who died this past Tuesday. For the most part, when we \nhear the word ``Schlesinger'' around here, we think of Rachel's \nhusband, Jim Schlesinger, who has held some very high Cabinet posts \nwith both Democratic and Republican Presidents. But I do not want to \nspeak about him today.\n  I want to just take a few minutes in my way to speak about Rachel \nSchlesinger, who died this past Tuesday. There are going to be a lot of \neulogies for Rachel because there are so many of us who were touched in \nsome special way by this remarkable woman. Let me add a few personal \nthoughts and sentiments about her.\n  Rachel, in my opinion, personified what one committed individual can \ndo for those who are less fortunate, those who need special help, and \nthose who cannot always fend for themselves. She was a gentle and \nunassuming lady. Those of us who saw her in action knew that behind her \nquiet exterior was a person of great strength and dedication to issues \nof importance to her and, in many instances, to her family.\n  Years before the issue of mental illness became as well understood as \nit is today, Rachel Schlesinger was speaking out and advocating for \nmore research about this disease.\n  She testified in behalf of the mentally ill. She offered her support \nto those small, but valiant, organizations who worked so hard to share \nthe message of this dread disease, which we now call mental illness or \nmental disease.\n  My wife reminded me how amazed she was that just a few months ago, \nwhile suffering her own health battles, she attended a meeting of the \nNational Alliance of the Mentally Ill and was as gracious and friendly \nas ever, while suffering immensely from the disease that would finally \ncause her demise.\n  Rachel always believed more could and should be done to find a cure \nfor mental illness, be it schizophrenia, manic depression, bipolar \nillness, or any of the dread illnesses that we choose now to call \nmental illness or mental disease.\n  She was a strong influential and outspoken communicator about this \nissue. We appreciate deeply all of her help, her selfless energies in \nbehalf of this cause.\n  Another example of Rachel Schlesinger's great heart was her concern \nfor the homeless. We remember that she handed out sandwiches from a \nfood wagon. She was one who took time from her own busy schedule to \nlend a hand to those in need. Today, people say, and we learn this from \nour young generation, ``If you're going to talk the talk, you better \nwalk the walk.'' Well, Rachel was one of those who really did, she \nwalked the walk.\n  Let me also mention one other facet of her life that so many people \nclose to her admired, and that was her love of music. As a musician \nherself, Rachel \n\n[[Page S 15097]]\nsaw music as a private expression of oneself as well as something that \nshould be nurtured for the community and by the community.\n  Literally up until a few days before she died, she was a driving \nforce in fundraising for the Arlington Symphony Orchestra. She had \nfounded and for many years she had managed the highly acclaimed \nArlington ``Pops'' concerts. She opened up her home on countless \noccasions for the orchestra's donor activities. No work or effort was \ntoo much to ensure that it survived.\n  She believed, quite simply, that music was a love that could be \nshared with others. She could be found wherever and whenever help was \nneeded, and her devotion and great spirit will be forever remembered \nand missed by all those who benefited from and shared her deep love and \npassion of this beautiful music that she became so attached to.\n  Mr. President, some will comment in the days ahead about Rachel \nSchlesinger's full life, her exciting ventures in far places of the \nEarth, her wonderful family of eight children and her devoted husband \nwho respected and admired her so deeply. All of these comments will be \nheartfelt and true. I would just like to close with the thoughts that \nRachel was a very special person to those of us who were touched by \nher, by her enthusiasm and her personal commitment to so many good \ncauses and important issues.\n  I share my wife Nancy's simple but heartfelt summation: ``Rachel was, \nmost of all, a caring person.''\n  To her family and many friends, Nancy and I join you in our thoughts \nand our prayers and joy in having known a remarkable and wonderful \nlady, Rachel Schlesinger.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n1976, the agriculture appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     1976) making appropriations for Agriculture, Rural \n     Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \n     Agencies programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     1996, and for other purposes, having met, after full and free \n     conference, have agreed to recommend and do recommend to \n     their respective Houses this report, signed by all of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of September 28, 1995.)\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to report to the Senate that \nwe successfully concluded the conference with the House on September 28 \non the Agriculture appropriations bill. We worked out our differences. \nThe other body has adopted the conference agreement, and it is now \nbefore the Senate. I urge the Senate to adopt it.\n  This bill appropriates funds for the Department of Agriculture, the \nCommodities Futures Trading Commission, the Food and Drug \nAdministration and related agencies for the fiscal year that began \nOctober 1.\n  The funding level in the bill is $63.2 billion. This represents a \nreduction in spending of $5.8 billion from last year's level. It is \nless than the President's requested level of funding for these programs \nfor the next year. It is actually a smaller amount than we agreed to \nwhen this bill was before the Senate. It is $631 million less than the \ntotal appropriated by the Senate-passed bill, but it is $615 million \nmore than the level recommended in the House bill. I am pleased to \nreport that the discretionary spending level is $13.3 billion in budget \nauthority and $13.6 billion in outlays and that these amounts are \nwithin the subcommittee's discretionary spending allocations.\n  There are things that can be said about the fact that we do not have \nenough funds to provide levels of support that we would like for many \nareas under the jurisdiction of this committee, but this is a time of \nconstraint, it is a time when we are trying to reduce the overall costs \nof Government, insist upon new efficiencies in the operation of \nGovernment agencies, and this bill is, therefore, consistent with our \noverall budgetary goals and policy goals.\n  The committee of conference on this bill considered 160 amendments in \ndisagreement between the two Houses. It was our desire to complete \nconference on this bill before the start of the new fiscal year and we \ndid that. I would like to thank all members of the conference committee \nfor their support and cooperation in this effort. I believe this \nconference report reflects a mutually satisfactory resolution of the \ndifferences between the two Houses, and does so in a manner which \nreflects the funding requirements of the many programs and activities \ncovered by the bill within the limited resources available.\n  Approximately $39.8 billion, close to 63 percent of the total new \nbudget authority provided by this bill, is for domestic food programs \nadministered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Excluding the Food \nStamp Program reserve, this represents an increase of $1.5 billion \nabove the fiscal year 1995 level for these programs, which include food \nstamps; commodity assistance; the special Supplemental Food Program for \nWomen, Infants, and Children [WIC]; and the school lunch and breakfast \nprograms.\n  The $260 million increase above fiscal year 1995 for the Women, \nInfants, and Children [WIC] Program, as recommended in both the House \nand Senate bills, remains the single largest discretionary program \nfunding increase provided by this bill.\n  The conference agreement accepts the House bill proposal to \nconsolidate funding for commodity food assistance programs and provides \n$166 million for this purpose. It also provides the House recommended \nlevel of $65 million, $32 million above the fiscal year 1995 level, for \nthe Food Donations Program on Indian reservations; and maintains the \nfiscal year 1995 level of $150 million, as proposed by the House, for \nthe Elderly Feeding Program.\n  The House bill recommended no fiscal year 1996 funding for a Food \nStamp Program reserve. The Senate bill provided $1 billion for this \npurpose. The conferees have resolved this difference by agreeing to \nprovide a $500 million Food Stamp Program reserve. Although this \nreserve has not been required for a period of years, this amount will \nassure that sufficient funds are available to cover benefits in the \nevent of an economic downturn or unforeseen event resulting in \nincreased program participation levels.\n  With respect to rural development programs, the Senate-passed bill \nconsolidated funding for seven rural development loan and grant \nprograms, while the House bill consolidated funding for three \nprograms--water and waste disposal grants and loans and solid waste \nmanagement grants. The conferees have adopted the House bill position \nand have provided a total of $487.9 million for this consolidated \naccount. The conferees also have provided $2.9 billion in total rural \nhousing loan authorizations, $415 million more than the House and $42 \nmillion less than the Senate bill levels.\n  I am also pleased to report that the Senate bill's higher levels for \nfarm operating and ownership loans were retained by the conferees. Loan \nauthorizations totaling $2.45 billion are provided for these important \nfarmer assistance programs.\n  For discretionary conservation programs, the conferees have provided \ntotal funding of $857.7 million. The conference agreement also retains \nthe Senate recommendation providing for the enrollment of an additional \n100,000 acres in the Wetlands Reserve Program, the same as the fiscal \nyear 1995 level.\n  In addition, this conference agreement provides $53.6 million for the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission. It retains a number of Senate \nbill provisions, including the provision regarding poultry labeling \nregulations issued by the USDA, a provision which limits eligibility \nfor the market promotion program, and a provision prohibiting the use \nof FDA funds for the Board of Tea Exports.\n\n[[Page S 15098]]\n\n  Mr. President, I realize that sacrifices are required of everyone if \nwe are to reduce the Federal budget deficit. However, I regret that the \nresources required to be allocated in this bill to maintain essential \nfood assistance benefits continues to reduce the remaining portion of \nthe bill allocated to those programs so essential to agriculture and to \nrural America. These are beneficial programs. They help America's \nfarmers to be competitive both here and abroad; they provide essential \nservices to people in rural towns and communities across this Nation; \nthey work to conserve and protect our Nation's natural resources.\n  Mr. President, Senate approval of this conference agreement is the \nremaining step required to send this appropriations bill to the \nPresident for signature into law.\n  I am proud of the work that the committee has done, both in \ndeveloping the bill to present to the Senate and in conference. I hope \nthe Senate will approve it.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi for his generous comments and his leadership for making \npossible the presentation of the conference agreement for the fiscal \nyear 1996 appropriations bill for the Department of Agriculture, the \nFood and Drug Administration, and related agencies. This has been a \nvery difficult year, but we have been able to reach an agreement with \nthe House which has resulted in this conference report and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  This conference report contains $63.2 billion in new budget authority \nwhich is $630.5 million below the bill passed by the Senate earlier \nthis year and nearly $5.8 billion below the amount contained in the \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 1995. I must point out to my \ncolleagues that these reductions have not been taken lightly nor will \nthey be lightly received. For far too long, this subcommittee has seen \na dwindling of resources available to us to make the increasingly \ndifficult choices of budget priorities. The programs under the \njurisdiction of this subcommittee are often overlooked or misunderstood \nin their importance to our Nation as a whole and to the specific groups \nthese programs are designed to serve. They do deserve our attention and \nthey deserve our support. I only wish the allocation provided this \nsubcommittee would have allowed us to do more.\n  The programs funded by this bill are programs that touch upon the \nlives of nearly every American. These programs range from school lunch \nand nutrition education for our Nation's children to promoting and \nenriching the research capacity on the land grant campuses across the \ncountry. These programs will enhance soil and water conservation, as \nwell as promote the export of U.S. products, and provide humanitarian \nassistance in areas of deprivation. Included in this bill are programs \ndesigned to provide housing to the poor, a better business climate for \ncompanies seeking to locate in rural areas, and better habitat for our \nNation's wildlife. The funding included in this bill will protect the \ncapacity of our Nation to produce an abundant and safe food supply for \nour people an many around the world.\n  This conference report contains more than $700 million for the \nAgricultural Research Service and $850 million for activities of the \nCooperative State Research and Extension Services. This combined \ninvestment of more than $1.5 billion in research and extension will be \nan important contribution to improve the quality and efficiencies of \nour Nation's productive capacity and make us more competitive in world \nmarkets.\n  Also provided is nearly $545 million for the Food Safety and \nInspection Service. This amount is slightly above the amount provided \nby the House, but somewhat below the Senate figure. The Government's \nrole in food safety is at a critical juncture as we move away from the \norganoleptic method toward a more effective microbiological inspection \nsystem based on sound science. The importance of the work of this \nagency must not be underestimated and I am concerned that higher levels \nof funding may be necessary during the transition of moving toward the \nupdated system. Everyone has a stake in this challenge, including the \nproducer, the processor, the marketer, and ultimately the consumer \nwhose reliance on the integrity of this agency's mission must be \nwithout question.\n  In the area of conservation, this conference report provides $630 \nmillion for the Natural Resource Conservation Service's Conservation \nOperation account to provide technical assistance and guidance to \nimprove water quality, check soil erosion, and better protect our \nnatural resource base. One hundred million dollars is provided to \nprovide watershed and flood prevention services and $77 million is \nincluded to enroll an additional 100,000 acres in the Wetlands Reserve \nProgram.\n\n  One of the areas in which the Senate was at strong disagreement with \nthe House was that of rural development. To a large extent, the \nconference agreement more closely resembles the more acceptable funding \nlevels contained in the Senate provisions. The section 502 rural \nhousing program level was maintained at the Senate figure of $2.7 \nbillion, an increase of $450 million above the House level. The water \nand wastewater programs provided through the Rural Utilities Assistance \nProgram are included with nearly $500 million in new budget authority, \nan amount more than $50 million higher than that proposed by the House. \nAlso, additional funds may be available for these programs if carryover \nfunds in the WIC Program exceed $100 million.\n  I do not know if carryover funds in WIC will exceed this amount. WIC \nis an extremely important program as well, and I hope that the WIC \nProgram will be able to expand in a manner to utilize all available \nfunds. However, if the carryover in this account continues to grow as \nit has in the past, I can think of no better use of these funds than to \nprovide safe water and sanitary conditions to households which, in many \ncases, may be WIC recipient households as well.\n  In the area of nutrition, nearly $8 million in child nutrition \nprograms is provided, $27.6 billion for the Food Stamp Program, and \nmore than $3.7 billion for the WIC Program, an increase of $260 million \nabove last year's level. The amount included in the conference report \nfor domestic food programs exceeds that of all other programs combined, \nas it has in recent years. The conference report provides $39.8 billion \nin domestic food programs which is 63 percent of the total amount \nprovided in this Act.\n  The conference report also provides $125 million for the Foreign \nAgricultural Service to promote the export of U.S. commodities \nincluding an increase for the foreign market development program. The \nmarket promotion program is included at the fiscal year 1995 level but \nwith an amendment similar to the Senate provision prohibiting the \nallocation of Federal funds to large companies for branded advertising. \nDuring these times of fiscal constraint when funding is being reduced \nfor rural housing, water and sewer programs, and many other services \ncrucial for human welfare, it is incredible that we have been providing \nFederal grants to companies--many of which have advertising budgets of \ntheir own totalling millions of dollars--to advertise their products. \nThe conference agreement contains a limitation on this program that is \na first step in bringing some sanity to this program and helping \nrestore taxpayer confidence in our ability to manage their hard earned \ntax dollars.\n  Mr. President, there are many other important items contained in this \nconference report that I will not take time to mention here. As I \nstated earlier, the programs in this act are vitally important to all \nAmericans and I only wish our allocation had been more generous in \norder for us to provide greater assistance in areas that will otherwise \nsuffer this coming year. I understand there has been some concern that \nsavings were achieved from limitations on mandatory programs and, as \nformer chairman of an authorizing committee, I empathize with those \nthat may feel we should not have realized those savings. I can only \nrespond by restating that this has been a most difficult year and \nsavings from mandatory programs were only achieved when absolutely \nnecessary and in areas where it was understood to cause the least harm. \nI honestly hope that the allocation process for fiscal year 1997 will \nnot result in \n\n[[Page S 15099]]\nthe same pressures on our subcommittee as we have seen again this year. \nI must also honestly admit that I do not hold out much hope that such \nimprovement is likely.\n  In closing, I want to say again what a pleasure it has been to work \nwith my good friend and colleague from Mississippi, Senator Cochran. He \nhas, once again, proved that he has an excellent knowledge of the \nprograms held under the jurisdiction of this subcommittee and that he \nis extremely fair and thoughtful in the deliberations culminating in \nthe presentation of this conference report.\n  Mr. President, let me say that this has been a very difficult, \ndifficult year for all of us in trying to start honestly toward a \nbalanced budget by the year 2002. It has been especially difficult for \nsome of us who are totally committed to the viability of America's \nagricultural system.\n  I had been out of town and I read a 2-week old Newsweek magazine last \nnight. The article referred to the anger of the middle class. The \narticle contained interviews of several people who expressed their \nviews about Congress, with the usual statements: ``Those clowns will \nnever balance the budget.'' ``The place is totally controlled by \nlobbyists.'' ``I've lost faith in our country and our Government.''\n  In all honesty, I relate and understand their anger and hostility. \nBut I also want to say that I wish I could visit personally with each \none of those people who made those remarks about what is going on here.\n  I would like to point out to them that this budget in this \nagriculture bill is almost $6 billion--$6 billion--less than last year.\n  The presiding Senator at this very moment, the chairman of the \nInterior Subcommittee on Appropriations, has just gone through the same \nkind of cuts in his subcommittee, and they are painful and they \nalienate still more people who lose some of their benefits, because it \nhas been a draconian time here.\n  So I want to just say this bill, in my opinion, protects the things \nthat really must be protected. It cuts where we feel we can afford to \ncut and, at the same time, provide, as best we can, for a viable \nagricultural economy in the country.\n  Mr. President, let me close by saying, despite the trauma of trying \nto craft a bill with these terrible, really, big cuts, it has been made \nmuch easier by working with my good friend, Senator Cochran, from \nMississippi, whose knowledge of agricultural programs and, \nparticularly, those programs in the agricultural appropriations bill, \nis legendary. He has been as careful as he could be about the interests \nof various Senators, but he has also been very realistic with them in \ntelling them the so-called good old days are gone. You cannot \naccommodate all the requests here, all the interests. And considering \nthe amount of money we had to spend, he has done an absolutely superb \njob.\n  Let me make one other comment because it goes without saying that I \nhave always been unalterably opposed to the idea of term limitations. I \nlistened to some of that debate last night. I felt like I was virtually \nthe only one in the country that is opposed to term limits. The \nAmerican people may favor term limits, but when you do, you lose the \ninstitutional memory, the unbelievable knowledge of people like Senator \nCochran in areas like this. When you lose that, and the integrity and \ndedication of people like that, you lose something that takes a long \ntime to rebuild.\n  So it was an honor for me, as ranking member on this committee, to \nwork with him. I think we have come up with a bill that does everything \nwe could possibly do within the limits and the amount of money we had.\n  I strongly recommend passage of this bill.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am deeply grateful for the kind and \ngenerous remarks of my good friend and colleague from Arkansas. His \nsupport, assistance, and leadership in developing this bill and help in \nmanaging it on the floor of the Senate were greatly appreciated and \nvery important to the final work product that was turned out by the \nSenate.\n  I hope that Senators will support the conference report, as \nrecommended by both managers and both sides of the aisle. When this \nbill passed the Senate, it passed on a record vote, with only three \ndissenting votes. I think that is a strong statement of support that \nexisted for the passage of our bill, and I am glad to say that much of \nthe compromise that was necessary reflected many of the recommendations \nthe Senate made during the conference. But it was a give and take and a \nvery fair conference in every sense of the word.\n  I would like to make one further clarification with respect to the \nconference agreement on this bill. The statement of managers \naccompanying the conference report inadvertently fails to explain the \nconference committee's agreement regarding Agricultural Research \nService laboratories proposed for closure in the President's fiscal \nyear 1996 budget. The conference agreement provides funding to maintain \nthe El Reno, OK; Sidney, MT; Clemson, SC, and Miami, FL, ARS \nlaboratories. The other locations not transferred to non-Federal \nownership, as proposed by both the House and Senate, are to be \nmaintained as ARS worksites. The Houma facility is to be used as a work \nsite of the ARS Center in New Orleans, LA.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I was wondering if my colleague would take a moment to \nreiterate and confirm what is my understanding of the conference \ncommittee's actions concerning the Department of Agriculture's fresh \npoultry labeling rule. I understand that, by including the Senate-\npassed bill provision in the conference report, the conferees intended \nto prevent the final rule which was promulgated on August 25, 1995, \nfrom taking effect, and also to prevent USDA from using any funds to \nimplement or enforce this regulation as promulgated. Is that my \ncolleague's understanding as well?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I appreciate the distinguished Senator from Arkansas \nraising this question. I would say to my friend that this is my \nunderstanding of the effect of the conference committee's action as \nwell. As you may recall, the regulation as promulgated did not reflect \nthe Department's findings in scientific research. It included a \nmisleading label for those products not qualifying to be labeled \n``fresh'' or ``frozen.'' I would also remind my colleague that the \nDepartment's final regulation did not include any temperature variance \nfor products. Therefore, the language of this act makes it clear that \nthe rule as published on August 25 shall never go into effect unless \nthe conditions of this statutory language is met. The burden is now \nupon USDA to submit a regulation to the appropriate committees for \napproval which resolves these critical issues in a satisfactory manner. \nI thank my colleague for his inquiry.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I would be grateful if Senator Brown would, for a \nmoment, engage in a colloquy with me to discuss the intent of his \namendment on bypass flows. This issue is very complicated. I would like \nto assure that we are clear on what facilities would be affected. \nAdditionally, the Department of Agriculture is concerned that the \namendment does not allow, among other things, its Office of General \nCounsel to defend litigation concerning administrative decisions of the \nUSDA officials.\n  Mr. BROWN. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss further the intent \nof my amendment to the agriculture appropriations bill.\n  The provision I am speaking of is section 732 of the general \nprovisions title in the conference report dealing with a water issue. \nAfter meetings with Secretary Glickman and his staff, we have come to \nan understanding regarding what this provision does. This amendment \ndoes not apply to new facilities. Further, the amendment would not \napply to authorizations to expand facilities or their operations. This \namendment only applies where the operators of facilities are applying \nfor authorizations to continue operating in the same manner as they \nhave been operating.\n  This amendment neither addresses the ability of the Department of \nAgriculture to assert administrative or judicial claims to water or \nwater rights, nor defending proper administrative decisions of USDA \nofficials.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I appreciate the clarification.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to support the conference report \naccompanying the Agriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 1996.\n  The conference report provides $62.6 billion in new budget authority \n[BA] \n\n[[Page S 15100]]\nand $45.6 billion in new outlays to fund most of the programs of the \nDepartment of Agriculture and other related agencies.\n  All of the funding in this bill is nondefense spending.\n  When outlays for prior-year appropriations and other adjustments are \ntaken into account, the final bill totals $63.2 billion in BA and $52.7 \nbillion in outlays for fiscal year 1996.\n  The subcommittee is at its 602(b) allocation for both budget \nauthority and outlays.\n  The Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee 602(b) allocation \ntotals $63.2 billion in budget authority [BA] and $52.8 billion in \noutlays. Within this amount, $13.3 billion in BA and $13.6 billion in \noutlays is for discretionary spending.\n  For discretionary spending in the conference report, the bill is \nessentially at the subcommittee's 602(b) allocation for both BA and \noutlays.\n  The bill is $1.6 billion in BA and $1.1 billion in outlays below the \nPresident's budget request for these programs. It is essentially at the \nHouse-passed bill level in BA and $26.5 million below the House bill in \noutlays. The conference report is $405.7 million BA and $759.4 million \nin outlays below the 1995 level.\n  The conference report includes mandatory savings of $389 million in \nBA and $249 million in outlays which are used to offset discretionary \nspending. Some of the savings duplicate those in the reconciliation \nbill.\n  The Congress is currently working on an omnibus budget reconciliation \nbill that seeks to achieve a balanced Federal budget by the year 2002. \nCongress must work to minimize the double counting of mandatory savings \nin the appropriations bills and the reconciliation bill in order to \nreach a balanced Federal budget.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the final bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      AGRICULTURE SUBCOMMITTEE--SPENDING TOTALS--CONFERENCE REPORT      \n               [Fiscal year 1996, in millions of dollars]               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      Budget            \n                                                    authority   Outlays \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed......................................  .........      3,751\n  H.R. 1976, conference report....................     13,310      9,814\n  Scorekeeping adjustment.........................  .........  .........\n                                                   ---------------------\n    Subtotal nondefense discretionary.............     13,310     13,566\n                                                   =====================\nMandatory:                                                              \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed......................................        501      3,337\n  H.R. 1976, conference report....................     49,277     35,791\n  Adjustment to conform mandatory programs with                         \n   Budget:                                                              \n    Resolution assumptions........................         64         49\n                                                   ---------------------\n      Subtotal mandatory..........................     49,842     39,177\n                                                   =====================\n      Adjusted bill total.........................     63,152     52,743\n                                                   =====================\nSenate Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n  Defense discretionary...........................  .........  .........\n  Nondefense discretionary........................     13,310     13,608\n  Violent crime reduction trust fund..............  .........  .........\n  Mandatory.......................................     49,842     39,177\n                                                   ---------------------\n    Total allocation..............................     63,152     52,785\n                                                   =====================\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate                                  \n Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                        \n  Defense discretionary...........................  .........  .........\n  Nondefense discretionary........................  .........        -42\n  Violent crime reduction trust fund..............  .........  .........\n  Mandatory.......................................  .........  .........\n                                                   ---------------------\n    Total allocation..............................  .........        -42\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I want to express my great disappointment \nwith a key provision of the conference report for H.R. 1976, the fiscal \nyear 1996 Agricultural appropriations bill. I deeply regret that \nimportant funding for the tribally controlled community colleges in the \nUnited States was largely cut from the bill.\n  During the Senate debate on H.R. 1976, I was successful in offering \nan amendment which provided $4 million in extension and academic \nimprovement funds to our nations tribal colleges. I was greatly \nassisted by Senators Bingaman, Conrad, Domenici, and Inouye all joined \nme in this worthy effort.\n  While a relatively small amount compared to the over $1 billion that \nwill be spent at other universities throughout the United States, this \n$4 million appropriation would have been a great boost to our long-\nneglected tribal colleges. They receive virtually no State or local \nfunding, and are in desperate need of Federal assistance.\n  This conference report represents an unhealthy dose of the status quo \nin this regard. There are hundreds of millions of dollars for large \nState universities, and a few token dollars metered out to Indian \ncolleges and universities.\n  Of course, the students educated at these tribal colleges, over \n20,000 nationwide, are striving to build a future for themselves after \ngrowing up in the poorest communities in America. The level of poverty \nthat faces native Americans would astound most of their fellow \ncitizens.\n  The funds that I and a group of my concerned colleagues were seeking \nfor tribal colleges were fully authorized in 1994 by legislation which \ngave partial ``land grant status to tribal colleges and institutions. \nThis designation was long overdue, for tribal colleges reside in \nlargely rural areas, and Indian reservations are comprised of tens of \nmillions of acres of agricultural land. Agricultural programs at tribal \ncolleges would be a solid investment in Indian students and their \ncommunities.\n  For over a century the U.S. Department of Agriculture has provided \nlarge amounts of funding to State land grant colleges and historically \nblack colleges. These funds support agricultural research, education, \nand extension services. It is time we recognized the vital mission of \nAmerica's tribal colleges as well. This conference report was a prime \nopportunity to do so, yet we have faltered again.\n  Deleting the $2.55 million that the Senate version of H.R. 1976 \ncontained for extension programs at tribal colleges was unfair and \nunnecessary. It is yet another example of how little attention or \nconcern is often given to the needs of native Americans by this body. \nAt a time when several universities in the United States will receive \nover $20 million each from the Department of Agriculture--and others \nhave received as much as $40 million in a single year--the managers of \nthis bill cut the extremely modest amount provided to tribal colleges.\n  Let me make it quite clear that there was no reason for these funds \nto be revoked, except perhaps for the Senate to maintain its record of \nconsistent inattentiveness to the plight of many native Americans. I \noppose the conference report for this unnecessary and harmful deletion \nof funds. I will renew my efforts to assist our Nation's tribal \ncolleges and Indian students at each appropriate opportunity in the \nupcoming year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/12/senate-section/article/S15097-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15100-S15102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CUBAN LIBERTY AND DEMOCRATIC SOLIDARITY [LIBERTAD] ACT OF 1995\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2898\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, am I correct that the pending business is \nthe amendment offered by Senator Dole as a substitute to H.R. 927?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, it is my purpose today to reiterate my support as an \noriginal cosponsor of legislation introduced by Senator Helms, now the \nsubstitute amendment offered by Senator Dole, to the Cuban Liberty and \nDemocratic Solidarity Act.\n  I was the Senate sponsor in 1992 of the Cuban Democracy Act.\n  This legislation reiterated the policy of the United States relative \nto the \n\n[[Page S 15101]]\nCastro regime in Cuba and emphasized that the United States had no ill \nfeeling for the people of Cuba, in fact, that the United States \ncitizens shared in the pain of the people of Cuba and desired to reach \nout to them in ways that would ease that pain while facilitating a \ntransition from their authoritarian regime.\n  The Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 was a continuation of the spirit of \nbipartisanship which has characterized United States policy toward Cuba \nsince the emergence of the dictator, Fidel Castro. Through Democratic \nand Republican Presidents and Congresses we have had a consistent \npolicy of political and economic isolation of the Castro regime. And \nparticularly since the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the \nsignificant subsidy which the Soviet Union had supplied to the Cuban \nregime, we have had a bipartisan policy of reaching out directly to the \npeople of Cuba.\n  The adoption of the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 sent a clear and \nconcerted message of common purpose with the people of Cuba. The Cuban \nDemocracy Act helped force an economic crisis for Castro's government, \na crisis which has reached the point that he has now begun to \ncontemplate economic reforms. There is some evidence that he is \nbeginning to ease some of the restrictions which he holds on the Cuban \npeople.\n  Unfortunately, it has not resulted in any movement toward \nliberalization of his political regime in terms of steps toward \ndemocratic government, nor has it resulted in any significant \nimprovement in human rights. In fact, in areas such as the treatment of \nhuman rights activists, the treatment of journalists, in just the past \nfew months, the Castro regime seems to have increased its attempts to \ncontrol its people.\n  This legislation that is before us today continues the two-track \npolicy of restraint on the regime through the embargo, isolation, \neconomically and politically, of the Castro regime and, on the second \ntrack, an effort to reach out to the Cuban people. This legislation \nstrengthens the embargo and at the same time indicates our continued \nadmiration and desire to see the day when freedom and democracy will be \navailable to the Cuban people.\n  This legislation increases the pressure on the Cuban Government by \ntightening the embargo. It prohibits the Cuban Government from \nprofiting from confiscated property. This legislation has already \ndeterred the flow of foreign capital to the Castro regime as investors \nwho are anxious to enter into business partnerships with the Castro \ngovernment have been closely monitoring this legislation awaiting \naction by the United States.\n  For the Cuban people, this bill reaches out to demonstrate our common \npurpose. As an example, in the area of strengthening radio and \ntelevision Marti, this legislation will facilitate the exchange of \ninformation from the United States to the Cuban people with the aim of \nfostering dialog and stimulating activism at the grassroots level.\n  The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act builds an apparatus \nfor the peaceful transition of a post-Castro Cuba to a free, democratic \nsociety. By conditioning United States assistance to Cuba's commitment \nto change, this legislation helps prevent another dictator from \nascending to power in Cuba.\n  President Clinton's recent actions, actions of just last week, were \nconsistent with the purposes of the Cuban Democracy Act and consistent \nwith the purposes of the bill before us today. The President's actions \nfollowed on the two-track approach. It stepped up the enforcement of \nthe embargo by strengthening the Office of Foreign Asset Control both \nhere in Washington and, as the Cuban Democracy Act provided, the Office \nof Foreign Asset Control in Miami. These offices monitor and enforce \nthe embargo.\n  As part of the effort to foster democracy at the grassroots level, \nPresident Clinton has taken the following actions: He has allowed \nUnited States nongovernmental organizations, such as Freedom House, to \nwork in Cuba to promote human rights and democratic actions; he has \npermitted transfer of communications equipment to Cuban nongovernmental \norganizations so that they will have an opportunity to communicate \namong themselves and with the rest of the free world, exchange of news \nbureaus, authorizing the issuance of licenses for United States news \nbureaus in Cuba; and permitted travel on a case-by-case basis for \nhumanitarian, religious, and educational purposes. All of those \ninitiatives are part of the effort to demonstrate to the Cuban people \nour common resolve.\n  This legislation is a continuation of a consistent, bipartisan Cuban \npolicy and a bold step toward the goal of a democratic, free Cuba. This \nvote is a measure of our resolve not to aid or abet the government of \nFidel Castro. We are unwavering in our commitment to freedom and \ndemocracy in the Western Hemisphere. We are anxious for the day when \nthis last holdout of authoritarianism within our own hemisphere is \neliminated.\n  Congress has a great opportunity to send a message, to send a message \nto Fidel Castro and to the rest of the world, that the United States \nstands firm in its conviction against totalitarian regimes. We all \nawait with hope the day that a free and independent Cuba will have a \nnormal and friendly relationship with the United States. Until that \nday, we must firmly let Fidel Castro know that we are not interested in \ncontributing to his oppressive rule and remain vigilant to the threat \nthat he poses.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I stand this afternoon in support of the \nCuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1995. This is the next \nstep in a long road leading toward releasing Castro's dictatorial ties \nthat have bound the people of Cuba for so many years.\n  This legislation includes a number of provisions which would \nstrengthen international sanctions against the Castro government in \nCuba, develop a plan to support a transition government leading to a \ndemocratically elected government in Cuba, and enact provisions \naddressing the unauthorized use of United States citizen-owned property \nconfiscated by the Castro government.\n  I agree with the intent of this legislation, which is to help bring \nfreedom and democracy to Cuba. Mr. President, Libertad is a \ncomprehensive bill designed to increase the pressure on Fidel Castro \nand bring about fundamental political and economic reforms. This is not \na case of Americans forcing a solution on Cuba. Instead, it is Cubans \nwho are crying for this assistance to which we are responding.\n  It is my understanding that 47 dissident leaders who are currently \ninside Cuba have, at great personal risk, publicly endorsed the Helms \nbill. This support came in a letter sent to the chairman from Havana \nand organized by dissident leader Elizardo Sampedro Marin of the \nDemocratic Solidarity Party.\n  The letter reiterates the need to not only maintain but strengthen \nthe current embargo, and the letter states:\n\n       The economic embargo maintained by subsequent \n     administrations has begun to make its effects felt not \n     against the people, but against those who cling to power. \n     Those effects are felt after the downfall of the socialist \n     camp, which forced the Havana regime to improvise economic \n     moves, waiting for the miracle to pull them out of a very \n     difficult situation.\n\n  Mr. President, those who are inside fighting for freedom and \ndemocracy in Cuba support the efforts of this legislation and see it as \nthe best path toward democracy for Cuba. In addition, we should address \nCastro's needs for hard currency to continue to prop up his \ndictatorship.\n  It is my understanding that a number of press reports indicate that \nthe mere existence of this legislation and pending passage have had an \nimpact on Castro's efforts to generate that hard currency. His efforts \nto tempt foreign investors into Cuba by auctioning off properties that \nwere illegally confiscated without compensation from Americans must be \ncurtailed.\n  To assist the Cuban people to regain their freedom and prosperity is \nthe first goal of this legislation.\n  The second is to strengthen international sanctions against Cuba. The \n\n\n[[Page S 15102]]\nthird is, this bill should provide for the national security of the \nUnited States. Fourth is, to encourage free and fair elections in Cuba. \nFifth is, to provide a policy framework for United States support to \nthe Cuban people during a transition to democracy. Sixth is, to protect \nAmerican nationals against confiscatory taking and unauthorized use of \ntheir confiscated property.\n\n  Mr. President, there has been a great deal of debate on title III of \nthis bill, and, certainly, I have had my own concerns as well. However, \nI appreciate the efforts of the chairman. He has worked hard at \noffering this bill and clarifying the intent of the legislation to \nensure that certified claimants have priority in all events to assets \nof the Cuban Government in settling property claims.\n  In closing, I just add that we must not lose sight of the overall \nintent of this legislation. Embracing Fidel Castro at this time is not \ngoing to lead to freedom and democracy in Cuba. Therefore, I hope my \ncolleagues will support this very important piece of legislation that \nChairman Helms and the committee have labored long and hard at \nproviding.\n  Would the Senator from North Carolina entertain a question?\n  Mr. HELMS. I would be glad to respond to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Some of my constituents have raised questions as to \nwhether this legislation will unleash a wave of thousands of lawsuits \ntying up our courts and establishing, in effect, a new Cuban claims \nprogram for Cuban-Americans to the detriment of certified claimants. \nAre these fears, in any way, justified?\n  Mr. HELMS. I am very glad the Senator asked that question because it \nappears that there has been organized fearmongering regarding this \nlegislation by a few who, are not content to wait until it is lawful \nfor Americans to deal with a free and independent Cuba. Instead, these \npeople seem intent on cutting their own early deal with the evil \ndictator, Castro, at the expense of the Cuban people. I have previously \nsaid that I am expecting to hear soon that the Libertad bill is the \ncause of the common cold.\n  There is nothing in this bill which disadvantages certified American \nclaimants; on the contrary, there is much that enhances their status. \nAnd there is nothing in this bill that will result in a wave of \nlawsuits that will burden our courts.\n  In the first instance, this bill particularly recognizes and \nrestricts the U.S. Government's espousal responsibilities to certified \nclaimants. The Libertad bill also specifically ties the President's \nauthority to provide foreign assistance or to support international \ncredit to a new government in Cuba to that government's public \ncommitment and initiation of a process to respond positively to the \ncertified claimants' property claims.\n  The bill advantages certified claimants by restricting the right of \naction--the right to sue foreigners for compensation--to require that \nrecoveries from traffickers will reduce the amount recovering claimants \ncan otherwise obtain from the U.S. Government's espousal. And it is not \na possible to obtain default judgments against the current government \nin Cuba under this bill, thus assuring that additional claims will not \nburden the new government.\n  Title III also protects the settlement amount of all certified claims \nby denying a claim to, participation in, or interest in any settlement \nproceeds by: First, those who were not eligible to file under the \nInternational Claims Settlement Act of 1949 but did not do so; second, \nthose who were not eligible to file under the International Claims \nSettlement Act; or third, any Cuban national, including the Cuban \nGovernment. Such an exclusive provision does not now exist. The \nLibertad bill will make it clear, in a statute, who can receive the \nbenefits of any settlement of certified property claims with the Cuban \nGovernment. In short, it is the bill's intent that certified claimants \nhave priority to assets of the Cuban Government in settling property \nclaims.\n  The President is authorized to suspend the right of action when a \ntransition government comes to power, and he is already authorized \nunder existing law to terminate any lawsuits then underway. Thus, this \nstatute will not impede the President's authority to negotiate with a \ntransition Cuban Government.\n  The right of action is itself an important weapon for certified \nclaimants to assure their property will still be intact when freedom \ncomes.\n  Let me point out some other reasons why the Libertad will not result \nin a flood of litigation. The bill provides a 180-day grace period, \nbeginning on the bill's date of enactment, for traffickers to stop \ntheir violation of our citizen's property rights. There is an \nadditional 30-day notice required before exemplary additional damages \ncan be sought. Furthermore, the jurisdictional requirements mandate \nthat the plaintiff must be a U.S. citizen with a claim to commercial \nproperty valued in excess of $50,000 that is being unjustly exploited \nby a third party. The bill requires that the defendant must be properly \nfound within the jurisdiction of U.S. courts. The bill denies the use \nof the right of action when a property claim has been traded or \ntransferred into U.S. jurisdiction after the bill's enactment.\n  As I have previously stated, it also discourages suits against the \npresent government in Cuba and requires that the defendant be proven to \nhave knowingly and intentionally trafficked in the property after the \n6-month period following the bill's enactment. The Congressional Budget \nOffice has estimated that only a few cases would qualify under these \nstringent requirements.\n  The point of these requirements is to ensure that only commercially \nsignificant cases are filed and adjudicated. I hope you will agree that \nwe have accomplished our goal and that this will reassure your \nconstituents that they have been falsely informed regarding what this \nbill does.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to begin some comments on \nthe upcoming reconciliation bill. The Republican reconciliation bill \nsimply, in my view, puts the question to this body: Whose side are you \non? I think that is the basic question. Are you on the side of middle-\nclass Americans? I think that is the defining precept. Or are you on \nthe side of our senior citizens, middle-class families who are trying \nto send their children to college, and lower income working families? \nOr are you on the side of the wealthy and the special interests?\n  The Republican reconciliation bill is a bonanza for the well-off and \nthe powerful, while senior citizens, students, and working-class \nfamilies get stuck footing the bills.\n  In my view, this is plain wrong. While the Republicans lay down for \nthe wealthy and the special interests, Democrats stand up for the \nmiddle-class, working Americans who are struggling to hang on and to \nbuild a better life for their children.\n  The Senate will soon consider the biggest reductions in the history \nof the Medicare program--reductions in services, that is. Regrettably, \nthe Senate will not have much time to consider these severe cutbacks \nthoroughly or thoughtfully. The debate on the reconciliation bill is \nlimited to a total of 20 hours. That is quite incredible when you think \nabout it, because reconciliation bill language is kind of arcane for \nmost of our citizens. So, simply put, it is how we balance the books, \nhow we reconcile income with expense. It is a question that families \ndeal with and a question that businesses deal with. And here we have \nvirtually the whole budget for the fiscal year for the Federal \nGovernment, and we are going to deal with this in 20 hours--quite \nincredible. But those are the rules and we have to play by them.\n  Therefore, I want to take this chance to join with other colleagues \non this day to talk about what we see as the faults in the \nreconciliation bill, before \n\n[[Page S 15103]]\nwe consider it under such strict time restrictions.\n  Mr. President, the Republican budget is built around a false premise. \nThe Republicans argue that in order to save Medicare, we have to \ndestroy its fundamental mission. This is simply not true. But our \nfriends on the other side continue to perpetuate this myth. They have \ntheir propaganda machinery operating at full speed. They say they are \nsaving Medicare, that they are throwing out a life raft. I have to ask \nthe question: For whom? Who is the life raft for?\n  The answer comes back very clearly. It is for the well-heeled. It is \nprimarily based on the House bill, and we are talking about a $20,000 \ntax break for a $350,000 income earner.\n  I think it is time to call our people and tell them the truth. The \nfirst unbelievable statement that Republicans are making is that we \nneed $270 billion to save Medicare. That is the life raft they pretend \nto throw out. It is simply untrue.\n  The Republicans are using this $270 billion to finance their $245 \nbillion tax break for the rich folk. We see it here in graphic form on \nthis chart. But we do not see it in the kind of graphics that the \naverage family is going to see it in when they have to pay the bill. It \nis no coincidence that the Medicare cuts are $270 billion and the tax \nbreaks for the well-off are $245 billion. These figures are remarkably \nsimilar because one is being used to finance the other. They are taking \nfrom our senior citizens, who paid the bills over the years, signed the \ncontract with their country, weathered the storms in the post-World War \nII years, and they are giving it back to the wealthy and special \ninterests.\n  Mr. President, the second Republican claim is that we need to cut \n$270 billion to make Medicare solvent. That is not true. The chief \nHealth and Human Services Medicare actuary has stated that we only need \n$89 billion in savings to make Medicare solvent until the end of the \nyear 2006.\n  The next chart simply lays out the arithmetic. Here $270 billion in \nGOP-proposed cuts--cuts in growth, cuts, period; $89 billion in savings \nneeded for the trust fund, and that leaves a net sum of $181 billion, a \nlot of money. Where does that money go? Well, it goes to finance the \ntax breaks for the upper-income people.\n  Mr. President, the third inaccuracy I want to discuss is the \nRepublicans' fallacious portrayal of their $135 billion in Medicare \npart B cuts. The $135 billion in Medicare part B cuts include increased \npremiums and deductibles for our senior citizens. Those are taxes, in \nno uncertain terms. But these increases are not being used to save \nMedicare. I want to repeat that the Medicare part B cuts are not being \nused to make Medicare part A, the trust fund, solvent. They are two \ndistinctly, separate pots of money.\n  Our friends, the Republicans, are going around the country claiming \nthat these increases in Medicare part B are being used to save the \nsystem. But, once again, it is very clear that that is not the mission. \nThey are being used to finance the tax breaks for the rich.\n  Mr. President, Medicare is not just a health insurance program. \nMedicare is a commitment that we made to our citizens. It is 30 years \nold now. It is a promise for those that if they worked hard during \ntheir lives, paid the premium, that one's medical needs would be taken \ncare of when retirement comes.\n  In the coming weeks, the American people need to hear the truth about \nMedicare, because the Republicans are going to try to ram through their \nMedicare cuts, the tax breaks for the wealthy, while they increase \ntaxes on the elderly.\n  We are going to try and tell the truth. We will tell them their \nMedicare program is being used as a slush fund for tax breaks for those \nat the top of the income ladder.\n  When Americans understand the facts, Mr. President, I do not think \nthey will like what they see.\n  In confirmation of my statement--I think it sits fairly in front of \nthe American people--I refer today to a story that appeared in the New \nYork Times. It says ``Doctors' Group Says GOP Agreed to Deal on \nMedicare.''\n  Well, if there is any doubt about whether it is the special and the \npowerful that are getting the better part of this deal at the expense \nof the elderly and the disabled and others who will have to find ways \nto pay for programs that they have already paid for, then one simply \nhas to see or hear what is being said in this article:\n\n       Just hours after endorsing the House Republican plan to \n     revamp Medicare, officers of the American Medical Association \n     said today that they had received a commitment from the House \n     Republicans not to reduce Medicare payments to doctors \n     treating elderly patients.\n\n  I add what is not being said is they did agree to increase the costs \nfor the senior citizens, to put a tax on the elderly so that they could \nfind the funds not to reduce the Medicare payments.\n  And then Mr. Kirk Johnson, senior vice president, says: ``It's wrong \nto suggest that the AMA endorsement was contingent upon billions of \ndollars.''\n  ``There isn't a precise figure. We don't know the amount.'' Well, we \nknow what the mission is; we may not know the specific amount.\n  It goes on to say, ``The House Ways and Means Committee approved the \nbill today by a party-line vote of 22-14.'' They identify \nRepresentative Bill Thomas, a California Republican who is chairman of \nthe Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, who said the concession to \ndoctors would cost no more than $400 million over 7 years.\n  That is a nice, round figure. Still an awful lot of money. An aide to \nSpeaker Newt Gingrich said, ``If the doctors are for sale, they come \nreal cheap.'' Four-hundred million dollars over 7 years, it is not a \nlot of money; it is only a lot if your income is $25,000 a year, like \n75 percent of our senior citizens in this country, or $10,000, like it \nis for 35 percent of our senior citizens, or it is for 25 percent of \nour senior citizens who live on nothing more than their Social \nSecurity.\n  I guarantee if they see $400 million and ask where it is going that \nthey will think twice about how they feel about being stuck with the \nbill as the programs are being cut in front of their faces.\n  The article goes on:\n\n       Lawmakers and lobbyists scramble today to explain events \n     leading to the association's endorsement of the Republican \n     plan . . . their accounts, though incomplete, open a \n     revealing window on the normally secret negotiations.\n\n  Boy, the public has to hear that--secret negotiations between \ncongressional leaders and the high-powered lobby.\n\n       Mr. Gingrich met AMA leaders on Tuesday and beamed as they \n     announced their support for his handiwork.\n\n  I am reading from the reporter's story.\n  ``Mr. Thomas,'' formally identified chairman of the Ways and Means \nSubcommittee on Health, ``confirmed that the doctors would be protected \nagainst any reduction in Medicare fees in the next 7 years. Under \ncurrent law, and under the House Republicans' original proposals, fees \nfor many doctors would have declined.''\n  I do not hear anybody saying that they are guaranteeing that fees for \nthe elderly nor fees for the impoverished Medicaid will not go up. They \nare saying, let them pay. Let them pay. Let their fees increase over \n$3,000 a person over the next 7 years for elderly people who qualify \nfor Medicare. I assume that is true for the disabled as well.\n  Let the copayments increase. Let the deductibles increase. Charge \nthem the taxes. Even though they paid the bill, even though the \nagreement was made, let them pay.\n  When the American people understand the facts, Mr. President, and \nthat is the mission, I do not think they will like what they see. They \nwill ask the right questions. I only hope that they get honest answers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article in the New York Times be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Doctors' Group Says G.O.P. Agreed To Deal on Medicare\n\n                            (By Robert Pear)\n\n       Washington, Oct. 11--Just hours after endorsing the House \n     Republican plan to revamp Medicare, officers of the American \n     Medical Association said today that they had received a \n     commitment from House Republicans not to reduce Medicare \n     payments to doctors treating elderly patients. But the \n     organization said that it was not for sale and insisted that \n     there was no quid pro quo.\n       ``It's wrong to suggest that the A.M.A. endorsement was \n     contingent on billions of dollars,'' said Kirk B. Johnson, \n     senior vice \n\n[[Page S 15104]]\n     president of the association. ``There isn't a precise figure. We don't \n     know the amount.''\n       In any event, he said, the money is less important than the \n     overall policy embodied in the Republican bill, which would \n     slow the growth of Medicare and open the program to all sorts \n     of private health plans, including those organized by \n     doctors. The House Ways and Means Committee approved the bill \n     today by a party-line vote of 22 to 14. [Page A20.]\n       Representative Bill Thomas, a California Republican who is \n     chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said \n     the concession to doctors would cost no more than $400 \n     million over seven years.\n       An aide to Speaker Newt Gingrich said, ``If the doctors are \n     for sale, they come real cheap.''\n       Lawmakers and lobbyists scrambled today to explain events \n     leading to the association's endorsement of the Republican \n     plan, which is fiercely opposed by Democrats and some \n     consumer groups. Their accounts, though incomplete, opened a \n     revealing window on the normally secret negotiations between \n     Congressional leaders and a high-powered lobby.\n       Mr. Gingrich met A.M.A. leaders on Tuesday and beamed as \n     they announced their support for his handiwork.\n       Mr. Thomas, who attended the meeting, confirmed that the \n     doctors would be protected against any reduction in \n     Medicare fees in the next seven years. Under current law, \n     and under the House Republicans' original proposals, fees \n     for many doctors would have declined.\n       The association denied that it had sold its endorsement for \n     monetary gain. In a telephone interview from his office in \n     Chicago, Mr. Johnson said, ``We got assurances that there \n     would not be absolute rollbacks or reductions physician \n     fees.'' But he said the endorsement was not predicated on \n     those assurances.\n       The cost of the concessions was a subject of dispute. Mr. \n     Thomas said: ``How much is it going to cost us to make the \n     adjustment? Two or three hundred million dollars. I don't \n     know the exact amount.''\n       But independent health policy experts and budget analysts \n     said that the Republicans' assurance to the doctors, if taken \n     literally, could increase Medicare spending by a few billion \n     dollars, beyond the amounts that would be spent under current \n     law in the next seven years. The experts said they could not \n     easily reconcile the Republicans' promise to the doctors with \n     the large savings the House Republicans still expect to \n     achieve.\n       The Republicans plan to cut projected spending on Medicare \n     by $270 billion, or 14 percent, over the next seven years, \n     and they still intend to get $26 billion of that amount by \n     limiting payments to doctors. The Senate version of the \n     legislation would cut only $22.6 billion from projected \n     spending on doctors' services, and leaders of the A.M.A. said \n     they thought they had received a commitment from some House \n     Republicans to move toward the Senate position on this issue.\n       The A.M.A. apparently assumes that doctors will control the \n     growth of physician services much better than the \n     Congressional Budget Office expects. The budget office \n     assumes that the volume of such services under Medicare will \n     increase by an average of almost 10 percent a year through \n     2002.\n       Mr. Gingrich has been wooing other groups, like the \n     American Hospital Association and the American Association of \n     Retired Persons, in hope of winning their support for the \n     Republican Medicare plan. But they are demanding more than \n     the Republicans can afford to provide. Hospitals are hit much \n     harder than the doctors and are responsible for more of the \n     savings.\n       Democrats had a field day criticizing the agreement between \n     Mr. Gingrich and the A.M.A.\n       President Clinton's press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, \n     said, ``It appears that the doctors have won at the \n     expense of elderly patients.'' Representative Henry A. \n     Waxman, Democrat of California, said, ``The A.M.A. has \n     taken an extremely narrow view of the interests of \n     doctors.''\n       But Mr. Gingrich dismissed the criticism as ``tawdry \n     nonsense'' and called the Democrats hypocritical. ``When the \n     Democrats offer to spend more money on something, which by \n     the way will go to doctors and hospitals, that's good'' in \n     their eyes, he said. ``But if it's a Republican idea to send \n     money to doctors and hospitals, then that's a bad idea.''\n       On Medicare, Mr. Gingrich said, the Democrats ``don't have \n     a plan, they have no solution, they have no ideas, and all \n     they do is complain.''\n       Cathy Hurwit, legislative director of Citizen Action, a \n     consumer group, said the Republicans ``have sought to buy off \n     special interests like the A.M.A. by including provisions \n     that put the financial interests of doctors ahead of the \n     medical needs of their patients.''\n       Mr. Thomas vehemently denied that Republicans had bought \n     the doctors' endorsement. He said leaders of the association \n     were already in ``philosophical agreement'' with much of the \n     bill, including new limits on medical malpractice lawsuits \n     and changes in the law regarding fraud and abuse in the \n     Medicare program. In addition, he said, doctors like the bill \n     because it would allow them to ``control their destiny'' by \n     forming their own health plans to serve Medicare patients.\n       But just last week the association expressed concern about \n     the bill's stringent limits on Medicare payments to doctors. \n     On Oct. 3, James H. Stacey, a spokesman for the association, \n     said the House bill would reduce Medicare fees for some \n     doctors, and as a result, he said, they might be less willing \n     to participate in the program, which serves 37 million \n     people.\n       The doctors' arithmetic was correct, but they violated a \n     cardinal rule of political etiquette by going public with \n     their concerns while House Republicans were trying to \n     negotiate with them behind the scenes. Republican leaders \n     chided them, but their faux pas might have paid off.\n       Medicare uses a fee schedule to pay doctors, and the fees \n     are updated each year to reflect increased costs and other \n     factors.\n       Mr. Thomas said: ``The doctors came to us and demonstrated \n     that within the medical profession and between specialties, \n     there were certain instances of an actual negative factor \n     between years, rather than just a slowing of the growth. We \n     examined their materials and came to the conclusion that they \n     were right.''\n       Mr. Thomas described the latest changes as ``a fine-tuning, \n     a rather minor adjustment.'' As a result, he said, ``there \n     will be no year in which a medical specialty gets less money \n     than the year before.''\n       Under the Medicare fee schedule, every physician service, \n     from a routine office visit to a coronary bypass operation, \n     is assigned a numerical value, and this number is multiplied \n     by a fixed amount of money, called a dollar conversion \n     factor, to determine how much the doctor is paid for the \n     service. Under current law and under the original House \n     Republican bill, the conversion factor would have declined in \n     the next seven years.\n       Mr. Johnson of the A.M.A. said today that House Republican \n     leaders had promised to ``work with us to prevent the \n     conversion factor from declining.'' An increase in the \n     conversion factor increases total Medicare costs, and a \n     reduction lowers the cost, assuming no change in the volume \n     of doctors' services.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

I suppose if we had a \nsignificant list of legislative items to be considered--a backed up \nlegislative schedule--and we needed to get on with a number of bills \nbefore the end of the week or the end of next week, I could understand \nperhaps expediting consideration of this particular bill in an effort \nto accommodate that agenda. But that is not the case either. So \nregardless of how one may feel about the importance of this issue, \nabout the substantive provisions incorporated in the bill, I would urge \nmy colleagues to think carefully about whether or not this is the \nprocedure to which we should subscribe.\n  Frankly, I do not think it is. I do not think we ought to be rushed \ninto passing this bill. I do not think we ought to be forced to come to \nclosure on this legislation prior to the time we have had ample \nopportunity to consider some of the complicated issues involved. I \npersonally think there is a lot of merit to some aspects of what the \nsponsors of the bill are attempting to do. Still, I have some very \ngrave concerns about some of the provisions, especially title 3 as it \nis written. Of course, addressing such concerns is the whole purpose \nbehind good debate and the opportunity Senators should have to offer \namendments.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture at this early stage \nin the deliberative process. It is important that we be given the \nopportunity to deliberate in a fair and open way to accommodate the \nrights of every Senator, whether he or she be Democrat or \n\n[[Page S 15105]]\nRepublican, so I urge my colleagues to vote no on tonight's cloture \nmotion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/12/senate-section/article/S15104-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15105-S15106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          OFFSETTING TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wish to call attention, as other \ncolleagues have done today, to the work just accomplished by the Ways \nand Means and Energy and Commerce Committees in the House of \nRepresentatives. Unfortunately, the legislation these committees \nproduced is every bit as disastrous as we anticipated it would be, and \nI am concerned not only about the quality of the bill they passed but \nthe process they used to consider this legislation.\n  The plan they passed heaps tremendous additional costs on seniors \nacross this country. And, in particular, it squeezes dry rural America. \nI have no doubt whatsoever that it will close hospitals and clinics in \nmany parts of this country including South Dakota, and I believe that \nit decimates medical research and innovation, all in the name of saving \nthe trust fund.\n  Yet, as we have attempted to explain over the course of this debate, \nwhat was done in the Ways and Means and Commerce Committees over the \nlast several days has nothing to do with saving the trust fund. The \nactuaries in Health and Human Services have reconfirmed just as late as \nlast week that we only need $89 billion to save the trust fund. Yet, \nover half of the savings in the Republican plan comes from part B of \nthe Medicare program, which has nothing to do with the trust fund. Of \nthe $270 billion reduction in Medicare spending, over half of the \nsavings comes from part B.\n  The new costs that are going to be imposed on seniors, cuts in \nbenefits, increases in premiums, increases in deductibles, have \nabsolutely nothing to do with the trust fund. The Republicans decided \nto cut $270 billion from Medicare before they even saw the trustees' \nreport. In fact, Republicans actually repealed the law, passed in 1993, \nthat dedicated new revenue to help shore up the trust fund.\n  That is why actuaries in the Health Care Financing Administration say \nthat even with $270 billion in cuts that the Republicans call for, the \ntrust fund is solvent only to the year 2006, the same solvency date as \none gets from cutting $89 billion from Medicare. That is amazing to me. \nDespite the fact that the HCFA actuaries confirm that the $89 billion \nin Medicare cuts that Democrats have advocated in our Medicare \nalternative accomplishes exactly the same thing in terms of trust fund \nsolvency as the $270 billion, Republicans are still determined to cut \nhuge amounts from Medicare.\n  And so, Mr. President, we have a very clear choice--$89 billion in \nMedicare cuts, presented by the Democrats as a way to address Medicare \nsolvency with real long-term improvements in the infrastructure of the \nprogram, following the recommendations of the Health and Human Services \nactuaries, versus $270 billion in cuts, which achieves exactly the same \nlevel of solvency. This choice certainly raises a question about what \nthe additional $181 billion in Medicare cuts contained in the \nRepublican plan will truly be used for.\n  I think it is as clear as the charts that have been shown on the \nfloor this afternoon. We know what the additional $181 billion is going \nto be used for. We know that we have to come up with $245 billion in \noffsets for the Republican tax cut. That is really at the heart of this \nwhole debate.\n  Republicans are meeting this afternoon here in the Senate to come up \nwith a package of tax cuts, largely dedicated to those who do not need \ntax relief, in an effort to complete this reconciliation package.\n  We know they need $245 billion to offset this tax cut, and there is \nno secret as to where that money is going to come from. It will come \nfrom Medicare. It will come from Medicaid. It will come from increases \nin the cost to working families who will lose benefits from the cut in \nthe earned-income tax credit. It will come from the education budget, \nand it will come from agriculture. The American people need to \nunderstand where the money for the Republican tax cut is coming from.\n  What is so tragic is that money for the tax cut is coming from people \nwho cannot afford to give it in the first place--impoverished families \nwho have a spouse in a nursing home who will have to sell their farms, \nsell their homes, sell their businesses in order to ensure that that \nfamily member can stay in the nursing home where he or she has been \nresiding. That is just plain wrong. That kind of transfer is not in our \nbest interest and we have got to defeat it when we have the opportunity \nto do so in the weeks ahead.\n  The process by which Republicans are trying to pass this bill is as \nproblematic as the substance of the legislation. I want to address that \nissue for just a moment. As we have made clear over the last several \nweeks, there have been no hearings, there has been no consultation or \nreal effort to reach out to Democrats to try to accommodate our \nconcerns, no analysis provided, no explanation of how seniors, \nhospitals, or families are affected, and no legislative language until \nafter the committee vote was taken.\n  That fact has not been widely reported. There have been votes taken \nin committee, but no legislative language. Generally when we go through \na markup, we take the bills page by page and attempt, as best we can, \nto modify the legislation through the amendment process in order to \naccommodate the concerns raised by Senators. None of that happened \nbecause nobody had legislative language or sufficient detail to be able \nto determine how best to amend the bill. In other words, we have had no \nhearings, no analysis, no explanation, and no legislative language \nbefore a vote was taken on major legislation to radically alter \nimportant programs upon which seniors and families depend.\n  But we do know how some of the decisions about this legislation were \nmade. It has been widely reported that the AMA lined up outside the \nSpeaker's office just yesterday and made a decision to cut a deal with \nthe Speaker, and as a result they walked away with the assurance that \nthey would not have to contribute to the Medicare reductions to the \nextent seniors and other providers would have to.\n  In other words, doctors now, because they were able to cut their own \ndeal with the Speaker, are not going to be required to contribute to \nthis process to the degree that it was originally proposed. Yet, we \nalso know that the Republicans are holding fast to their determination \nto cut Medicare by $270 billion. So someone else, seniors or other \nproviders, will have to be hit even harder to make up the additional \nrevenue.\n  I thought it was all the more revealing when the board chair of the \nAMA on the 27th of September made reference to these deals and \nindicated--and I quote--``The bright lights of public scrutiny can only \nhurt, not help, delicate discussions.'' The translation is, ``Bright \nlights and public scrutiny are counterproductive to good deals.'' We \nare not going to cut a deal if there is public scrutiny and bright \nlights.\n  That is not the way this democracy should work. Backroom deals may \nhelp doctors, backroom deals may spare them sacrifice; but backroom \ndeals away from the light of day can only hurt seniors and cannot do \nanything to give us the opportunity that we should have had in the \nfirst place through hearings, through a legislative process, through a \nmarkup with legislative language, to carefully consider important \nlegislation.\n  Seniors and their families were not invited into the Speaker's \nbackroom. Rural hospitals were not invited into the Speaker's backroom. \nWe really still do not know what kind of a deal was cut. That is all \nthe more reason many of us are very concerned about backroom deals. We \nstill, a couple days after the fact, do not know exactly what kind of a \ndeal was cut with the physicians.\n  We are also very concerned about budget gimmicks like lockboxes that \nsupposedly lock in savings from a certain program so they are dedicated \nonly for certain purposes. This is a budget gimmick. We all know all \nprogram cuts and all tax decreases come from the same budget. We know \nin the end they will be able to transfer cuts in benefits to cuts in \ntaxes. Medicare savings will still go to tax breaks for those who do \nnot need it.\n  We also know that the Republican budget expenditure limit target is a \ngimmick that will cut more and more in subsequent years from Medicare, \nand take more and more out of the pockets of seniors.\n  Seniors know that this legislation means double deductibles, \nincreases in \n\n[[Page S 15106]]\npremiums, increases in the eligibility age for Medicare and the \nelimination of important senior protections that have long been part of \nthis program.\n  Mr. President, this legislation presents seniors with a series of bad \nchoices--and bad choices are no choices at all. And these bad choices \nare created in the name of benefits and tax breaks to those who do not \nneed them. We can do better than this. We can do better than backroom \ndeals. We need to open up this legislative process, allow the light of \nday to shine on our decisionmaking, allow the details of this bill to \nbe examined and carefully considered as it must ultimately be, if this \nlegislation is going to become law. We can do better. And I hope we \nbegin sooner rather than later.\n  I yield the floor and I note the absence of--I withhold for just a \nmoment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/12/senate-section/article/S15105-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15106-S15113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECESS UNTIL 7:30 P.M.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nstand in recess until 7:30 this evening, and that when the Senate \nreconvenes, the time between 7:30 and 8:30 be equally divided in the \nusual form.\n  There being no objection, at 6:38 p.m., the Senate recessed until \n7:29 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by \nthe Presiding Officer (Mr. Bennett).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair, in his capacity as a Senator from \nUtah, suggests the absence of a quorum. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to address the vote for cloture on \nthe Dole-Helms amendment to the Sanctions Act.\n  I will be voting for cloture because I wish to see this process move \nalong. This bill has been pending all year, and it is time we addressed \nit and moved on. In voting for cloture, however, I want to make clear \nthat I do not support this legislation. I think it is a mistake, and I \ndo not believe it will achieve the intended results.\n  First, this bill will impose trade sanctions on many of our closest \nallies and trading partners throughout the world. That is not going to \nhelp the people of Cuba in any way, but it is going to hurt American \ncompanies doing business around the world.\n  Second, the bill creates an unprecedented right of action for legal \nclaims of former property owners in Cuba. Not only will that impose a \nsevere burden on our court system, it will do so without, in anyway \nhelping the people who need it most--families and small property owners \nwho lost their homes and businesses to the Castro regime. This new \nright of action will also put us into conflict with some companies \nheadquartered in some of our closest allies who are now operating \nplants in Cuba.\n  As a result of both of these problems, the United States will find \nitself under immediate attack in the World Trade Organization.\n  This legislation will only add to the already overwhelming misery of \nthe Cuban people. I don't want to do that, and I know none of my \ncolleagues do either. Certainly, we all want to see an end to the \nCastro regime--a cold war relic whose time has passed. I believe, \nhowever, that Castro's days are numbered. Communism has fallen around \nthe world, and it will fall in Cuba as well. We should let it fall of \nits own weight, and then be there to assist the Cuban people in \ndeveloping and nurturing a new democratic successor. This bill will not \nachieve that goal--in fact, it will move in the other direction. I urge \nSenators to oppose it.\n  Mr. PELL. I would like to speak for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. PELL. Thank you.\n  As I have stated on previous occasions, my usual practice is to \nalways vote for cloture as a matter of principle. Indeed, in my more \nthan 34 years in the Senate, I have cast over 330 votes in favor of \ncloture and have only voted otherwise very rarely.\n  The vote tonight is one of those rare occasions, because I feel so \nstrongly about the issue at hand. I believe the best American policy in \nCuba will be one of openness and regular relations. My several visits \nto that island over the years have only fortified my belief that the \nCommunist regime there will wither under the light of expanded contact \nwith the United States.\n  Having in other periods of life lived under communism, I know that \nwhen exposed to freedom and the market economy it dies of its own \nineptitude.\n  The bill before us has just the opposite effect, and extended debate \nis warranted to make the case against it. So I shall be casting my \nvote, with some reluctance, against cloture.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that material I have here be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n\n     Legal Considerations Regarding Title III of the Libertad Bill\n\n       The U.S. Government has long condemned as a violation of \n     international law the confiscation by the Cuban Government of \n     properties taken from U.S. nationals without compensation, \n     and has taken steps to ensure future satisfaction of those \n     claims consistent with international law. Congress recognized \n     the key role of international law in this respect. Title V of \n     the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949, as amended, \n     pursuant to which the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission \n     (FCSC) certified the claims against Cuba of 5,911 U.S. \n     nationals, accordingly applies to claims ``arising out of \n     violations of international law.''\n       The State Department, however, opposes the creation of a \n     civil remedy of the type included in Title III of the ``Cuban \n     Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1995'' \n     (the ``LIBERTAD bill'') currently under consideration by the \n     Congress. The LIBERTAD bill would be very difficult to defend \n     under international law, harm U.S. businesses exposed to \n     copy-cat legislation in other countries, create friction with \n     our allies, fail to provide an effective remedy for U.S. \n     claimants and seriously damage the interests of FCSC \n     certified claimants. It would do so by making U.S. law \n     applicable to, and U.S. courts forums in which to adjudicate \n     claims for, properties located in Cuba as to which there is \n     no United States connection other than the current \n     nationality of the owner of a claim to the property. \n     Specifically, the LIBERTAD bill would create a civil damages \n     remedy against those who, in the language of the bill, \n     ``traffic'' in property of a U.S. national. The bill defines \n     so-called ``trafficking'' as including, among other things, \n     the sale, purchase, possession, use, or ownership of property \n     the claim to which is owned by a person who is now a U.S. \n     national.\n       The civil remedy created by the LIBERTAD bill would \n     represent an unprecedented extra-territorial application of \n     U.S. law that flies in the face of important U.S. interests. \n     Under international law and established state practice, there \n     are widely-accepted limits on the jurisdictional authority of \n     a state to ``prescribe,'' i.e., to make its law applicable to \n     the conduct of persons, as well as to the interests of \n     persons in things. In certain circumstances a state may apply \n     its law to extra-territorial conduct and property interests. \n     For example, a state may do so in limited circumstances when \n     the conduct has or is intended to have a ``substantial \n     effect'' within its territory. The Senate version of the bill \n     appears to imply that so-called ``trafficking'' in \n     confiscated property has a ``substantial effect'' within the \n     United States. Some have explicitly defended the LIBERTAD \n     bill on this ground.\n       Asserting jurisdiction over property located in a foreign \n     country and expropriated in violation of international law \n     would not readily meet the international law requirement of \n     prescription because it is difficult to imagine how \n     subsequent ``trafficking'' in such property has a \n     ``substantial effect'' within the territory of the United \n     States. It is well established that under international law \n     ``trafficking'' in these confiscated properties cannot affect \n     Cuba's legal obligation to compensate U.S. claimants for \n     their losses. The actual effects of an illegal expropriation \n     of property are experienced at the time of the taking itself, \n     not at any subsequent point. An argument that subsequent use \n     or transfer of expropriated property may interfere with the \n     prospects for the return of the property would be hard to \n     characterize as a ``substantial effect'' under international \n     law. Under international law, the obligation with respect to \n     the property is owed by the expropriating state, which may \n     satisfy that obligation through the payment of appropriate \n     compensation in lieu of restitution.\n       As a general rule, even when conduct has a ``substantial \n     effect'' in the territory of a state, international law also \n     requires a state to apply its laws to extra-territorial \n     conduct only when doing so would be reasonable in view of \n     certain customary factors. Very serious questions would arise \n     in defending the reasonableness under international law of \n     many lawsuits permitted by Title III of the LIBERTAD bill. \n     The customary factors for judging the reasonableness of \n     extra-territorial assertions of jurisdiction measure \n     primarily connections between the regulating \n\n[[Page S 15107]]\n     state, on one hand, and the person and conduct being regulated, on the \n     other. Title III would cover acts of foreign entities and \n     non-U.S. nationals abroad involving real or immovable \n     property located in another country with no direct connection \n     to the United States other than the current nationality of \n     the person who holds an expropriation claim to that property. \n     Moreover, the actual conduct for which liability is created--\n     private transactions involving the property--violates no \n     established principle of international law. Another customary \n     measure of reasonableness is the extent to which the exercise \n     of jurisdiction fits with international practice. The \n     principles behind Title III are not consistent with the \n     traditions of the international system and other states have \n     not adopted similar laws.\n       International law also requires a state assessing the \n     reasonableness of an exercise of prescriptive jurisdiction to \n     balance its interest against those of other states, and \n     refrain from asserting jurisdiction when the interests of \n     other states are greater. It would be very problematic to \n     argue that U.S. interests in discouraging ``trafficking'' \n     outweigh those of the state in which the property is \n     located, be it Cuba or elsewhere, International law \n     recognizes as compelling a state's interests in regulating \n     property present within its own borders. The United States \n     guards jealously this right as an essential attribute of \n     sovereignty. In contrast, discouraging transactions \n     relating to formerly expropriated property has little \n     basis in state practice.\n       That international law limits the United States' exercise \n     of extra-territorial prescriptive jurisdiction does not imply \n     that U.S. courts must condone property expropriations in \n     cases validly within the jurisdiction of the United States. \n     Our courts may refuse to give affect to an expropriation \n     where either (i) the expropriation violated international law \n     and the property is present in the United States or (ii) in \n     certain cases, the property has a legal nexus to a cause of \n     action created by a permissible exercise of prescriptive \n     jurisdiction. In fact, generally speaking, our laws prohibit \n     our courts from applying the ``Act of State'' doctrine with \n     respect to disputes about properties expropriated in \n     violation of international law. If applied the doctrine might \n     otherwise shield the conduct of the foreign state from \n     scrutiny. Indeed, in a number of important cases the \n     Department of State has actively and affirmatively supported \n     these propositions in cases before U.S. courts to the benefit \n     of U.S. claimants, including with respect to claims against \n     Cuba. The difficulty with Title III of the LIBERTAD bill \n     stems not from its willingness to disaffirm expropriations \n     that violate international law, but from its potentially \n     indefensible exercise of extra-territorial prescriptive \n     jurisdiction.\n       Some supporters of the LIBERTAD bill have advanced \n     seriously flawed arguments in defending the extra-territorial \n     exercise of jurisdiction contemplated by Title III. Some have \n     defended Title III on the deeply mistaken assumption that \n     international law recognizes the wrongful nature of so-called \n     ``trafficking'' in confiscated property. No support in state \n     practice exists for this proposition, particularly with \n     regard to property either held by a party other than the \n     confiscator or not confiscated in violation of international \n     claims law (if, for example, the original owners were \n     nationals of Cuba at the time of loss.) Many of the suits \n     allowed by Title III would involve ``trafficking'' in \n     properties of this type, where an internationally wrongful \n     act would seem extremely difficult to establish.\n       Regrettably, the support in international state practice \n     offered by some for viewing so-called ``trafficking'' as \n     wrongful has generally confused a state's power to assert \n     jurisdiction over conduct with the ``Act of State'' doctrine, \n     discussed previously. The unwillingness of our courts to give \n     effect to foreign state expropriations violative of \n     international law in matters over which they have valid \n     jurisdiction under international law, however, does not imply \n     that international law recognizes as wrongful any subsequent \n     entanglement with the property. Others have suggested that \n     general acceptance of domestic laws relating to conversion of \n     ill-gotten property makes ``trafficking'' wrongful under \n     international law. This argument is extremely unpersuasive as \n     many universally accepted domestic laws, including for \n     example most criminal laws, have no international law status. \n     So-called ``trafficking'' has no readily identifiable \n     international law status. International law does condemn a \n     state's confiscation of property belonging to a foreign \n     national without the payment of prompt, adequate and \n     effective compensation. In such circumstances the U.S. \n     Government has been largely successful in assuring that U.S. \n     claimants obtain appropriate compensation, precisely because \n     of the protection afforded by international law.\n       Some supporters have maintained incorrectly, in addition, \n     that Title III is similar to prior extra-territorial \n     exercises of jurisdiction by the United States over torts \n     committed outside the United States. The Alien Tort Statute \n     (ATS) and the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991 (TVPA) \n     have been cited as examples in this context. The assertion is \n     plainly false and the LIBERTAD bill differs significantly \n     from the examples cited. While the ATS and TVPA do empower \n     U.S. courts to adjudicate certain tortious acts committed \n     outside the United States, they do so only with respect to \n     acts that violate international law. The ATS covers only \n     torts ``committed in violation of the law of nations or a \n     treaty of the United States.'' Similarly, the TVPA creates \n     liability for certain conduct violating fundamental \n     international norms of human rights (i.e. torture and extra-\n     judicial killing). In contrast, as explained previously, \n     supporters of the LIBERTAD bill have failed to identify any \n     basis in international law permitting the use of U.S. courts \n     for the adjudication of suits regarding extra-territorial \n     ``trafficking.''\n       Title III of the LIBERTAD bill also deviates substantially \n     from accepted principles of law related to the immunity of \n     foreign sovereign states, as well as their agencies and \n     instrumentalities. Although much of the discussion of the \n     bill has focussed on suits against certain foreign \n     corporations and individuals, in its current form the Senate \n     version of the bill would allow a suit to be brought against \n     ``any person or entity, including any agency or \n     instrumentality of a foreign state in the conduct of \n     commercial activity'' that ``traffics'' in confiscated \n     property. Since ``trafficking'' is defined to include such \n     things as possessing, managing, obtaining control of, or \n     using property, it would appear at a minimum that Title III \n     authorizes suits against many Cuban or other foreign \n     governmental agencies or instrumentalities. To the extent \n     Title III provides for such suits, they would be highly \n     problematic and difficult to defend.\n       The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), enacted in \n     1976 after careful deliberation, is consistent with \n     international law principles of foreign sovereign immunity. \n     To the extent the LIBERTAD bill would permit suits against \n     agencies and instrumentalities of foreign governments it \n     would go far beyond current exemptions in the FSIA. The \n     LIBERTAD bill, unlike the FSIA, would not require the agency \n     or instrumentality to be ``engaged in commercial activity in \n     the United States.'' Moreover, the LIBERTAD bill contemplates \n     suits against agencies or instrumentalities of foreign states \n     for any conduct that constitutes so-called ``trafficking''; \n     as defined in the LIBERTAD bill this notion is broader than \n     owning or operating property, the FSIA standard.\n       Similarly, to the extent the provisions of the LIBERTAD \n     bill permitting suits against ``entities'' is construed to \n     authorize suits against foreign governments as well, it would \n     go well beyond current exemptions in the FSIA and under \n     international law for claims involving rights in property. \n     Under the FSIA, a foreign state (as distinguished from its \n     agencies and instrumentalities) is not immune only when the \n     ``property or any property exchanged for such property is \n     present in the United States in connection with a commercial \n     activity carried on in the United States by the foreign \n     state.'' The LIBERTAD bill would appear not to impose those \n     requirements. In addition, suits against ``entities'' would \n     in these circumstances include those brought against foreign \n     governments other than Cuba that may have acquired \n     confiscated property in violation of no principle of \n     international claims law. These potential expansions of the \n     exceptions from the immunity of foreign states, as well as \n     their agencies and instrumentalities, from the jurisdiction \n     of U.S. courts and their implications for U.S. liability in \n     other countries represent matters of great concern.\n       Some have suggested that even though the creation of a \n     cause of action such as that contemplated in Title III of the \n     LIBERTAD bill is not currently defensible under international \n     law, the United States should enact these provisions of the \n     bill to promote the development of new international law \n     principles in this area. Suggestions of this sort in this \n     context rest on a dubious premise of how state practice \n     contributes to international law. While the practice of \n     states represents a source of international law, state \n     practice makes law only when it is widespread, consistent and \n     followed out of a sense of legal obligation. The enactment of \n     Title III in the face of serious questions about its \n     consistency with international law, and without the support \n     of the international community, would not contribute \n     positively to international law relating to the expropriation \n     of property.\n       In addition to being very difficult to defend under \n     international law, enactment of Title III would also \n     undermine a number of important U.S. interests connected to \n     these significant international law concerns. General \n     acceptance of the principles reflected in Title III would \n     harm U.S. business interests around the world. At present and \n     in general, the laws of the country in which the property \n     lies govern the rights to that property, particularly with \n     respect to real property. United States businesses investing \n     all over the world benefit from their ability to rely on \n     local law concerning ownership and control of property. Under \n     the precedent that would be set by Title III, a U.S. business \n     investing in property abroad could find itself hailed into \n     court in any other country whose nationals have an unresolved \n     claim to that property. Such a precedent could increase \n     uncertainties for U.S. companies throughout the world. \n     Perversely, Title III would hurt U.S. businesses most \n     directly in Cuba. U.S. businesses seeking to rebuild a free \n     Cuba once a transition to democracy begins will find \n     themselves easy targets of Title III suits, as U.S. \n     corporations generally are subject to the jurisdiction of our \n     courts.\n       Congress should expect that the enactment of Title III of \n     the LIBERTAD bill, with its broad extra-territorial \n     application of U.S. law, significant departures from \n     established claims practice and possible contravention \n\n[[Page S 15108]]\n     of international law, will create serious disputes with our closest \n     allies, many of whom have already voiced their objections. \n     The United States must expect the friction created by Title \n     III to hurt efforts to obtain support in pressing for change \n     in Cuba. Moreover, once the transition to democracy does \n     begin, Title III will greatly hamper economic reforms and \n     slow economic recovery as it will cloud further title to \n     confiscated property.\n       Perhaps most importantly, Title III of the LIBERTAD bill \n     would not benefit U.S. claimants. The private right of action \n     created by Title III, furthermore, would likely prove \n     ineffective to U.S. claimants. Past experience suggests that \n     countries objecting to the extra-territorial application of \n     U.S. law reflected in Title III, most likely some of our \n     closest allies and trading partners, could be expected to \n     take legal steps under their own laws to block adjudication \n     or enforcement of civil suits instituted against their \n     nationals. Moreover, many foreign entities subject to suit \n     would deem U.S. jurisdiction illegitimate and fail to appear \n     in our courts. Title III would in those circumstances merely \n     produce unenforceable default judgements. In addition, some \n     commentators have estimated potential law suits to number in \n     the hundreds of thousands, so the LIBERTAD bill would also \n     clog our courts and result in enormous administrative costs \n     to the United States. As the lawsuits created under Title III \n     might not result in any increase in or acceleration of \n     compensation for U.S. claimants, these costs would be \n     unjustifiable.\n       In so far as it departs from widely accepted international \n     claims law, Title III of the LIBERTAD bill undermines widely-\n     established principles vital to the United States' ability to \n     assure that foreign governments fulfill their international \n     obligations for economic injury to U.S. nationals. In doing \n     so, Title III hurts all U.S. citizens with claims against \n     another government. With respect to claims against Cuba \n     specifically, the cause of action contemplated in Title III \n     of the LIBERTAD bill will hamper the ability of the U.S. \n     Government to obtain meaningful compensation for certified \n     claimants. Consistent with our longstanding and successful \n     claims practice, at an appropriate time when a transition to \n     democracy begins in Cuba, the United States will seek to \n     conclude a claims settlement agreement with the Cuban \n     government covering certified claimants, or possibly create \n     some other mechanism to assure satisfaction of their claims. \n     If Title III is enacted into law and U.S. claimants have an \n     opportunity, at least on paper, to receive compensation for \n     claimed properties from third party ``traffickers,'' the \n     Cuban Government may simply refuse to address the claims on \n     the grounds that the claimants must pursue alternative \n     remedies in U.S. courts. Yet, as indicated previously the \n     prospects for broad recoveries in this manner are very poor.\n       Even if Cuba accepts its international law responsibilities \n     with respect to U.S. claims, the United States can expect \n     that a large quantity of private suits would profoundly \n     complicate claim-related negotiations, as well as subsequent \n     claims payment procedures. Cuba might easily demand that the \n     United States demonstrate that each person holding an \n     interest in any of the nearly 6,000 certified claims, and \n     possibly the tens of thousands of uncertified claims, has not \n     already received compensation via a lawsuit or private \n     settlement. As the United States will not have records of \n     private suits, let alone non-public out of court settlements, \n     doing so would be extremely difficult. In addition, dealing \n     with unpaid judgments in this context would likely prove \n     particularly difficult.\n       Finally, the Castro regime has already used, and if enacted \n     into law would continue to use, the civil cause of action \n     contemplated by Title III of the LIBERTAD bill to play on the \n     fears of ordinary citizens that their homes or work places \n     would be seized by Cuban-Americans if the regime falls. The \n     United States must make it clear to the Cuban people that \n     U.S. policy toward Cuban property claims reflects established \n     international law and practice, and that the future \n     transition and democratic governments of the Cuban people \n     will decide how best to resolve outstanding property claims \n     consistent with international law.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                             Executive Office     \n                                                 of the President,\n\n\n                              Office of Management and Budget,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 20, 1995.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n       (This statement has been coordinated by OMB with the \n     concerned agencies.)\n\n\n h.r. 927--cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act--(burton (r) in \n                           and 43 cosponsors)\n\n       The Administration supports the central objective of H.R. \n     927, i.e., to promote a peaceful transition to democracy in \n     Cuba. However, H.R. 927 contains a number of seriously \n     objectionable provisions that would not advance U.S. \n     interests in Cuba and would damage other U.S. interests. \n     Therefore, the President's senior advisers would recommend \n     that H.R. 927 be vetoed unless the following provisions are \n     deleted or amended:\n       The bill would encroach upon the President's exclusive \n     authority under the Constitution to conduct foreign affairs, \n     or otherwise unduly limit the President's flexibility, by \n     purporting to require the President or the Executive branch \n     to pursue certain courses of action regarding Cuba. Mandatory \n     provisions should be replaced with precatory language in the \n     following sections: 102(b); 104(a); 110(b); 112, 201; 202(e); \n     203(c)(1); and 203(c)(3).\n       The exemption in section 102(d) from civil penalty \n     authority for activities related to research, education and \n     certain other purposes, and the burdensome requirement for an \n     agency hearing for civil penalties in other cases, greatly \n     limits the effectiveness of civil penalties as a tool for \n     improving embargo enforcement. Section 102(d) should be \n     amended to address this shortcoming.\n       Section 103 should be amended to make the prohibition of \n     certain financing transactions subject to the discretion of \n     the President.\n       Section 104(a) should be amended to urge U.S. opposition to \n     Cuban membership or participation in International Financial \n     Institutions (IFIs) only until a transition government is in \n     power to enable the IFIs to support a rapid transition to \n     democracy in Cuba. Section 104(b), which would require \n     withholding U.S. payments to IFIs, could place the U.S. in \n     violation of international commitments and undermine their \n     effective functioning. This section should be deleted.\n       Sections 106 and 110(b), which would deny foreign \n     assistance to countries, if they, or in the case of section \n     110(b), private entities in these countries, provide \n     certain support to Cuba, should be deleted. Section 106 \n     would undermine important U.S. support for reform in \n     Russia. Section 110(b) is cast so broadly as to have a \n     profoundly adverse affect on a wide range of U.S. \n     Government activities.\n       Section 202(b)(2)(iii), which would bar transactions \n     related to family travel and remittances from relatives of \n     Cubans in the United States until a transition government is \n     in power, is too inflexible and should be deleted.\n       Sections 205 and 206 would establish overly-rigid \n     requirements for transition and democratic governments in \n     Cuba that could leave the United States on the sidelines, \n     unable to support clearly positive developments in Cuba when \n     such support might be essential. The criteria should be \n     ``factors to be considered'' rather than requirements.\n       By failing to provide stand-alone authority for assistance \n     to a transition or democratic government in Cuba, Title II \n     signals a lack of U.S. resolve to support a transition to \n     democracy in Cuba.\n       Title III, which create a private cause of action for U.S. \n     nationals to sue foreigners who invest in property located \n     entirely outside the United States, should be deleted. \n     Applying U.S. law extra-territorially in this fashion would \n     create friction with our allies, be difficult to defend under \n     international law, and would create a precedent that would \n     increase litigation risks for U.S. companies abroad. It would \n     also diminish the prospects of settlement of the claims of \n     the nearly 6,000 U.S. nationals whose claims have been \n     certified by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission. \n     Because U.S. as well as foreign persons may be sued under \n     section 302, this provision could create a major legal \n     barrier to the participation of U.S. businesses in the \n     rebuilding of Cuba once a transition begins.\n       Title IV, which would require the Federal Government to \n     exclude from the United States any person who has \n     confiscated, or ``traffics'' in, property to which a U.S. \n     citizen has a claim, should be deleted. It would apply not \n     only to Cuba, but world-wide, and would apply to foreign \n     nationals who are not themselves responsible for any illegal \n     expropriation of property, and thus would create friction \n     with our allies. It would require the State Department to \n     make difficult and burdensome determinations about property \n     claims and investment in property abroad which are outside \n     the Department's traditional area of expertise.\n\n\n                         pay-as-you-go scoring\n\n       H.R. 927 would affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to \n     the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring \n     estimate is that receipts would be insignificant. Final \n     scoring of this proposal may deviate from this estimate.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                        The Secretary of State\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Newt Gingrich,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: I am deeply concerned about H.R. 927, the \n     Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, which the House \n     is scheduled to consider this week. The Department of State \n     believes that in its current form this legislation would \n     damage prospects for a peaceful transition in Cuba and \n     jeopardize a number of key U.S. interests around the world. \n     For these reasons, I would recommend that the President veto \n     the bill if passed by the Congress in its current form.\n       As you know, we share with the sponsors of the bill the \n     goal of promoting a peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba. \n     We have pursued that goal by maintaining a tough, \n     comprehensive economic embargo against the Cuban government \n     while reaching out to the Cuban people through licensing \n     private humanitarian aid and improved telecommunications. \n     This policy, guided by the Cuban Democracy Act, has helped to \n     force the limited but positive economic changes that are \n     taking place in Cuba.\n       We believe that H.R. 927 would actual damage prospects for \n     a peaceful transition. We have consistently objected to the \n     overly rigid list of more than a dozen ``requirements'' for \n     determining when a transition or a democratic government is \n     in power. These inflexible standards for responding to what \n\n[[Page S 15109]]\n     may be a rapidly evolving situation could leave the United States on \n     the sidelines during a transition. Moreover, by failing to \n     provide clear authority to assist even a transition or \n     democratic government that meets the bill's certification \n     requirements, the legislation fails to signal to the Cuban \n     people that the United States is prepared to assist them once \n     the inevitable transition to democracy in Cuba begins.\n       In addition to damaging prospects for a rapid, peaceful \n     transition to democracy, H.R. 927 would jeopardize other key \n     U.S. interests around the globe. For example, it would \n     interfere with U.S. assistance to Russia and other nations of \n     the former Soviet Union. Other provisions would condition \n     assistance to any country if it -- or even a private entity \n     in its territory -- participates in the completion of a \n     nuclear power plant in Cuba. This kind of rigid conditioning \n     of assistance can have far-reaching consequences and may \n     interfere with our ability to advance the national interest.\n       While we are firmly committed to seeking the resolution of \n     U.S. property claims by a future Cuban government, the right \n     created by the bill to sue in U.S. courts persons who buy or \n     invest in expropriated U.S. properties in Cuba, \n     (``traffickers'') is a misguided attempt to address this \n     problem. Encumbering property in Cuba with litigation in U.S. \n     courts is likely to impede our own efforts to negotiate a \n     successful resolution of U.S.-citizen claims against Cuba and \n     could hamper economic reform efforts by a transitional \n     government in Cuba. U.S. citizens and corporations with \n     certified claims have publicly opposed these provisions. In \n     addition, these provisions would create tensions in our \n     relations with our allies who do not agree with the premises \n     underlying such a cause of action. This stance would be hard \n     to defend under international law. Furthermore, we know that \n     this provision is already being used by the Castro regime to \n     play on the fears of ordinary citizens that their homes and \n     work places would be seized by Cuban-Americans if the regime \n     were to fall.\n       Title III will also ultimately prove harmful to U.S. \n     business. First, it sets a precedent that, if followed by \n     other countries, would increase litigation risks for U.S. \n     companies abroad. Second, it will create a barrier to \n     participation by U.S. businesses in the Cuban market once the \n     transition to democracy begins. Because the lawsuits \n     contemplated by the bill may be brought against the United \n     States as well as foreign companies and are not terminated \n     until the rigid requirements for a democratic Cuban \n     government are satisfied, the bill erects an enormous legal \n     hurdle to participation by U.S. business in the rebuilding of \n     a free and independent Cuba.\n       Finally, the provisions of the bill that would deny visas \n     to ``traffickers'' in expropriated property, which are global \n     in scope and not limited to Cuba, will create enormous \n     frictions with our allies and be both burdensome and \n     difficult to administer.\n       In sum, the Department of State believes that while the \n     goals of H.R. 927 are laudable, its specific provisions are \n     objectionable and in some cases contrary to broader U.S. \n     interests, even to the goal of establishing democracy and a \n     free market in the country with active U.S. involvement. \n     Given these considerations, the Department of State can not \n     support the bill and, if it were presented to the President, \n     would urge a veto.\n           Sincerely,\n     Warren Christopher.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                         Joint Corporate Committee\n\n\n                                              on Cuban Claims,\n\n                                   Stamford, CT, October 10, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: I recently wrote to urge you to oppose Title \n     III of legislation, the ``Cuban Liberty and Democratic \n     Solidarity Act,'' that purports to protect the property \n     rights of U.S. nationals against the confiscatory takings by \n     the Castro regime. At that time, Senator Helms was planning \n     to attach this legislation as an amendment to the then-\n     pending Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill. It is my \n     understanding that this legislation now may be brought to the \n     Senate floor as a free-standing bill as early as Wednesday of \n     this week. I am writing once again to urge you to oppose this \n     legislation insofar as it contains Title III in its present \n     form because it poses the most serious threat to the property \n     rights of U.S. certified claimants since the Castro regime's \n     unlawful expropriations more than three decades ago.\n       In the rush to pass this legislation and thereby \n     demonstrate our firm resolve against Fidel Castro, the far-\n     reaching domestic consequences of this legislation have \n     received far too little attention. In my letter of September \n     20th, I wrote of the irreparable harm certified claimants \n     would suffer if Title III of this legislation is passed. For \n     the first time ever and contrary to international law, this \n     legislation would permit a specified national origin group, \n     Cuban-Americans, who were not U.S. citizens at the time their \n     property was confiscated, to file Title III lawsuits against \n     the Government of Cuba for the property losses they suffered \n     as Cuban nationals. Indeed, this legislation even permits \n     Cuban exiles abroad to file lawsuits in U.S. federal courts \n     if they establish a corporation in the United States for the \n     purpose of pursuing any claim they may have against Cuba. The \n     creation of a new right to sue is never an inconsequential \n     matter yet the careful scrutiny such a provision deserves has \n     been disturbingly lacking to date.\n       We can reasonably expect plaintiffs' attorneys to exploit \n     this newly created lawsuit right to the fullest extent \n     possible, creating a tide of litigation that will all but \n     sweep away the value of the claims currently held by U.S. \n     certified claimants. Each time one of those lawsuits is \n     reduced to a final judgment against Cuba, the injury to U.S. \n     certified claimants increases. Ultimately, the cumulative \n     weight of those judgments will extinguish any possibility the \n     certified claimants ever had of being compensated. A \n     virtually bankrupt Cuba cannot be expected to compensate the \n     U.S. certified claimants, who hold claims valued today at \n     nearly $6 billion, when it is also facing the prospect of \n     satisfying potentially tens of billions of dollars in federal \n     court judgments held by Cuban-Americans, whose claims have \n     been valued as high as $94 billion.\n       Our already overburdened federal courts will have to deal \n     with the daunting task of adjudicating some 300,000 to \n     430,000 lawsuits, according to one estimate that has never \n     been refuted. (And that does not even take into account the \n     number of additional claims that we can anticipate will be \n     brought on equal protection grounds by Vietnamese-Americans, \n     Polish-Americans, Chinese-Americans and other national origin \n     groups.) Indeed, a litigation explosion appears to be exactly \n     what the bill's sponsors intend: They hope to enlist an army \n     of lawyers to launch a barrage of federal court lawsuits \n     against Cuba in order to hopelessly entangle the island in \n     lawsuits. In so doing, title to property in Cuba will be \n     clouded for years to come, thus ensuring that every effort at \n     privatization or market-oriented economic reform will be \n     doomed to failure. In a classic case of overkill, however, \n     this endless litigation will not only encumber the current \n     regime, but will impose an onerous burden on a future \n     democratic government that will make normalization of \n     relations with the United States virtually impossible.\n       Faced with this prospect, the president, as an exercise of \n     executive prerogative in the conduct of foreign affairs, may \n     elect to dismiss those federal court judgments pending \n     against a friendly government in Cuba. However, dismissing \n     those lawsuits may not turn out to be such a simple matter \n     because the U.S. Government may very well find itself liable \n     for tens of billions of dollars in property takings claims to \n     this large class of citizens who were non-U.S. nationals at \n     the time they lost properties in Cuba. In short, if Title III \n     is enacted, we will be left either with the prospect of \n     protracted litigation against Cuba, which will indefinitely \n     delay normalization of relations with a post-Castro Cuban \n     government, or enormous liability to possibly hundreds of \n     thousands of Cuban-Americans should those federal court \n     judgments be dismissed as an incident of normalization.\n       Amazingly, the Senate is poised to vote on this legislation \n     without the benefit of the Judiciary Committee's views on \n     these and other critical issues that fall within its purview. \n     The Judiciary Committee has held no hearings on Title III, \n     has not reviewed it, nor has it, or the Foreign Relations \n     Committee for that mater, issued any reports on it. It is \n     astonishing that we may be so casually headed toward putting \n     our government, and ultimately U.S. taxpayers, on the line \n     for tens of billions of dollars worth of Cuban-American \n     claims in a foreign land. The only conclusion that can be \n     drawn is that this legislation is being rushed to a vote \n     before these serious issues can be thoroughly considered by \n     the Senate through its normal procedures. Given the profound \n     domestic implications of this legislation beyond the obvious \n     and immediate injury to U.S. certified claimants, I urge you \n     to oppose Title III of this legislation if for no other \n     reason than to ensure that these concerns receive the careful \n     deliberation they warrant.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 David W. Wallace,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           National Council of the\n\n\n                                Churches of Christ in the USA,\n\n                                               September 19, 1995.\n       Dear Representative: I write on behalf of the National \n     Council of Churches of Christ in the USA (NCC) to urge your \n     opposition to the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity \n     bill, H.R. 927, which is scheduled to be considered on the \n     House floor this week. We believe strongly that contrary to \n     its stated objectives, the bill is likely to provoke a \n     negative response that will harm efforts to achieve peaceful \n     social, economic, and political change in Cuba.\n       The National Council of Churches and many of its member \n     denominations have maintained a decades-long relationship of \n     pastoral accompaniment with the Protestant churches of Cuba. \n     Through Church World Service (CWS)--our relief, refugee, and \n     development program--the NCC has assisted for more than \n     thirty years in the resettlement in the U.S. of Cuban asylum \n     seekers and refugees. Over the past four years CWS has \n     carried out regular shipments of humanitarian assistance that \n     is administered through the Cuban Ecumenical Council for use \n     in nursing homes and childrens' hospitals.\n       On numerous occasions the NCC has called on the U.S. and \n     Cuban governments to engage in dialogue aimed at resolving \n     the long-standing conflict between our countries. In \n     particular, we have urged measures that would foster greater \n     communication and understanding between people in the U.S. \n     and \n\n[[Page S 15110]]\n     Cuba, which we view as key to achieving a more normal relationship.\n       Our deep concerns about the Cuban Liberty and Democratic \n     Solidarity Act include the following:\n       1. By incorporating in U.S. policy recognition of property \n     claims of Cubans who became U.S. citizens subsequent to the \n     expropriation of their property, and by subjecting to \n     sanctions anyone who ``traffics'' in such property, the bill \n     is likely to strengthen hard-liners within the Cuban \n     government and fuel renewed anti-U.S. sentiment among the \n     Cuban population. This provision is likely to be interpreted \n     within Cuba as a move to return to the economic and social \n     situation that existed there prior to the 1959 revolution. \n     There is little or no support for such a move within Cuba, \n     even among the most vehement critics of the current regime.\n       2. The bill specifies conditions for the expansion of U.S. \n     assistance that are likely to undermine diplomatic efforts to \n     achieve a peaceful resolution of the conflict between the \n     U.S. and Cuba. By linking broader U.S. assistance to Cuba to \n     a highly specific set of conditions, the bill reduces \n     significantly the diplomatic tools available to the \n     Administration. At the same time, the bill fails to broaden \n     humanitarian or exchange programs that foster stronger \n     people-to-people relationships.\n       3. The bill reinforces regulations promulgated in August \n     1994 that restrict travel and shipment of goods to family \n     members. These new restrictions have led to serious delays in \n     efforts to secure licenses for travel to Cuba. The ability to \n     travel to Cuba on short notice is particularly important to \n     the pastoral accompaniment of the Protestant churches during \n     this difficult period of transition. [Oscar: other problems \n     resulting from the new regulations?]\n       The NCC believes that a new approach to U.S.-Cuban \n     relations is long overdue. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic \n     Solidarity Act represents a further deepening of an \n     anachronistic policy in serious need of change. I strongly \n     urge you to oppose H.R. 927 and to support efforts to bring \n     about more normal relations between the U.S. and Cuba.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Joan Brown Campbell,\n     General Secretary.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                             Mansfield & Muse,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 20, 1995.\n     Senator W. Cohen,\n      United States Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Re ``The Cuba Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act''\n       Dear Senator: My client Amstar, along with thousands of \n     other U.S. citizen holders of claims certified against Cuba \n     in the 1960's by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, \n     will suffer devastating economic injury if Title III of \n     Senator Helm's bill (formerly S. 381) is passed as an \n     amendment to the Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill. It \n     is for this reason that I am writing.\n       It is absolutely false that Title III has been revised in \n     ways that make it no longer violative of both international \n     law and the rights and interests of U.S. citizens holding \n     claims certified against Cuba pursuant to the 1964 Cuba \n     Claims Act. As you know, Title III allows lawsuits to be \n     brought in the federal courts against Cuba and private \n     individuals either living in or doing business in that \n     country with respect to properties taken from their owners \n     for the most part thirty-five years ago. Damages are \n     recoverable against Cuba and others foreseeable the current \n     value of those properties. Contrary to international law, it \n     makes no difference under Title III whether a litigant was a \n     U.S. citizen at the time the property in Cuba was taken. \n     Indeed Title III is specifically designed to give \n     subsequently naturalized Cuban Americans statutory lawsuit \n     rights against Cuba of a type that we as a nation have never \n     been before given anyone else--even those who were U.S. \n     citizens at the time of their foreign property losses.\n       Title III of Senator Helm's amendment will produce the \n     following consequences if enacted in its present form:\n       Our federal courts will be deluged in Cuba-related \n     litigation. On August 28, 1995 the National Law Journal \n     (attached) reported that 300,000-430,000 lawsuits are to be \n     expected from Cuban Americans if Title III is enacted. \n     According to judicial impact analysts at the Administrative \n     Office of the U.S. Courts each of these suits will average \n     $4,500 in costs, whether they go to trial or not. Therefore \n     the administrative costs to the courts alone of Title III \n     will reach nearly $2 billion.\n       If we enact Title III those 5,911 claimants certified under \n     the 1964 Cuban Claims Act will see their prospects of \n     recovering compensation from an impoverished Cuba diluted to \n     virtually nothing in a sea of Cuban American claims (To put \n     this matter into context, the Department of State has \n     estimated Cuban American property claims at nearly $95 \n     billion). It is critical that it be understood that a claim \n     certified by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission \n     constitutes a property interest. If Congress enacts Title III \n     with the foreseeable effect of destroying the value of the $6 \n     billion (according to State Department figures) in claims \n     held by American citizens, it should expect to indemnify \n     those citizens someday, under the Fifth Amendment's ``takings \n     clause'', to the full amount of their economic injury. If \n     Title III is made law, the American taxpayer will quite \n     probably someday demand an explanation as to how on earth he \n     or she has been forced to step into the shoes of the Cuban \n     government and compensate U.S. companies and individuals for \n     their property losses in Cuba over thirty-five years ago.\n       If we violate international law and long-standing U.S. \n     adherence to that law by enacting Title III and conferring \n     retroactive rights upon non-U.S. nationals at time of foreign \n     property losses, history tells us that we will not be \n     permitted to stop with Cuban Americans. The equal protection \n     provisions of the Constitution will not tolerate limiting the \n     conferral of such an important benefit as a federal right of \n     action on only one of our many national origin groups whose \n     members have suffered past foreign property losses if, as \n     will surely happen, a former South Vietnamese army officer \n     who is now a U.S. citizen sues in order to gain the same \n     right accorded Cuban Americans to recover damages for \n     property expropriations he suffered, who, if Title III is \n     enacted is prepared to say he should not have such a night? \n     On what principled basis would such a night be denied him if \n     given by Congress to Cuban Americans? What about Chinese \n     Americans, Hungarian Americans, Iranian Americans, Greek \n     Americans, Palestinian Americans, Russian Americans, Polish \n     Americans? Are we going to claim surprise when the courts \n     tell us that the equal protection of laws requirement of the \n     Constitution mandates that each of these national-origin \n     groups receive the same right of action against their former \n     governments that we are proposing to give Cuban Americans by \n     virtue of Title III? How many such suits might we then expect \n     from these others national-origin groups and at what cost to \n     both the national treasury and our relations with the many \n     countries that will end up being sued in our federal courts? \n     It must also be kept in mind that U.S. companies that have \n     invested in various countries where our naturalized citizens \n     have property claims (e.g. Vietnam) will be held liable for \n     so-called ``trafficking'' in those claimed properties if \n     Title III is enacted and extended constitutionally to \n     other national-origin groups.\n       The multitude of lawsuits that will be filed pursuant to \n     Title III will over time be converted to final judgments \n     against Cuba, and as such will constitute a running sore \n     problem for the United States. Title III lawsuits are \n     explicitly made nondismissible. The fact of hundreds of \n     thousands of Cuban American judgment creditors against Cuba \n     will make it impossible for us to normalize relations with a \n     friendly government in that country. Aircraft and ships would \n     be seized. Cuban assets in the U.S. banking system would be \n     attached, goods produced in Cuba would be executed upon when \n     they arrive in U.S. ports--all in pursuit of recovery of \n     billions of dollars in federal court awards. The population \n     of Cuba (the majority of whom were not even born when the \n     properties of the Cuban American judgment creditors were \n     taken) will be indentured for decades to come to the \n     judgments entered against their country on our federal court \n     dockets. How is such a state of affairs conducive to a \n     reconciliation between Cubans on the island and the Cuban \n     community of the United States?\n       The alternative to the permanent estrangement Title III \n     lawsuits will produce between Cuba and the United States \n     would of course be for a U.S. president to dismiss the \n     judgments entered against Cuba. Notwithstanding the \n     prohibition against such executive branch action contained in \n     Title III, it is probable that the courts will ultimately \n     uphold the dismissals as a legitimate exercise of the \n     presidential prerogative to conduct foreign affairs.\\2\\ What \n     then?\n     \\2\\ See, Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U.S. 654 (1981).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The creation of a cause of action by Congress is obviously \n     not a trivial matter. Hundreds of thousands of Cuban \n     Americans will quite properly avail themselves of the right \n     of action to be given them by Title III. These cases will \n     proceed inexorably to final judgments. (There are really no \n     defenses available to Cuba under Title III. It is a strict \n     liability statute). As final federal court judgments they \n     will carry the faith and credit of the United States \n     government, with all the rights and remedies of execution set \n     out in our laws. What will be the consequence of the \n     president extinguishing these judgments and their concomitant \n     rights of execution?\n       Again, as in the case of certified claimants, a federal \n     court judgment is a property interest protected by the \n     Constitution. If that interest is extinguished by \n     presidential order, the Fifth Amendment ``takings clause'' \n     with its duty of full compensation will be triggered. If \n     Title III is enacted it should be with full knowledge that \n     Congress may someday be asked by the public to explain how \n     the American people came ultimately to be liable for tens of \n     billions of dollars of damages in recompense to a group of \n     non-U.S. nationals at the time they lost properties in \n     Cuba.\\3\\ In a period of heightened concern for potential \n     governmental liability under the takings clause of the Fifth \n     Amendment, \n\n[[Page S 15111]]\n\n     Title III should be approached with the greatest caution and \n     seen for the liability time bomb it is.\n     \\3\\ See, Dames & Moore v. Regan, supra, at 688: ``Though we \n     conclude that the President has settled petitioner's claims \n     against Iran, we do not suggest that the settlement has \n     terminated petitioner's possible taking claim against the \n     United States.'' (Emphasis added). Justice Powell, concurring \n     in part and dissenting in part, had this to say: ``The \n     Government must pay just compensation when it furthers the \n     nation's foreign policy goals by using as `bargaining chips' \n     claims lawfully held by a relatively few persons and subject \n     to the jurisdiction of our courts.'' Id. at 691.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       A troubling aspect of Title III is its contemptuous \n     disregard of international law. As a nation we and our \n     citizens benefit from international law in a myriad of forms, \n     such as overseas investment and intellectual property \n     protection, the safety of our diplomats and sovereignty over \n     our marine resources. Many other examples of the benefits to \n     the United States of an international rule of law could be \n     given. How can we in the future demand compliance with \n     international law by other nations if we are prepared to \n     violate that very law by enacting Title III? The proponents \n     of this legislation have never satisfactorily answered that \n     fundamental question.\n       To conclude, certain proponents of Title III from outside \n     the Senate have engaged in a campaign to minimize its \n     significance. Boiled down, their message is that a vote for \n     Title III is an inconsequential thing. For example, they will \n     say that a litigant cannot or will not sue Cuba itself, but \n     rather any actions are limited to ``third party traffickers'' \n     in confiscated properties. Let there be no mistake on this \n     point. Title III is an unprecedented federal court claims \n     program against the nation of Cuba. Section 302 of Title III \n     is plain and unambiguous in its meaning. It is the \n     inescapable consequences of that meaning that the Senate must \n     address.\n                                         Joint Corporate Committee\n\n\n                                              on Cuban Claims,\n\n                                               September 20, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: The Joint Corporate Committee on Cuban Claims \n     represents more than thirty U.S. corporations with certified \n     claims against the Government of Cuba stemming from the \n     Castro regime's unlawful confiscation of U.S. property \n     without just compensation. Our member corporations hold more \n     than one-half of the $1.6 billion in outstanding certified \n     corporate claims. On behalf of the Joint Corporate Committee, \n     I am writing to urge you to oppose Title III of legislation \n     Sen. Helms will offer as an amendment to the Foreign \n     Operations Appropriations Bill because it poses the most \n     serious threat to the property rights of the certified \n     claimants since the Castro regime's confiscations more than \n     thirty years ago.\n       The centerpiece of the Helms legislation is Title III, \n     which creates a right of action that for the first time will \n     allow U.S. citizens--regardless of whether they were U.S. \n     citizens at the time their property was confiscated in Cuba--\n     to file lawsuits in U.S. courts against persons or entities \n     that ``traffic'' in that property, including the Government \n     of Cuba. In effect, this provision creates within the federal \n     court system a separate Cuban claims program available to \n     Cuban-Americans who were not U.S. nationals as of the date of \n     their injury. This unprecedented conferral of retroactive \n     rights upon naturalized citizens is not only contrary to \n     international law, but raises serious implications with \n     respect to the Cuban Government's ability to satisfy the \n     certified claims.\n       Allowing Cuban-Americans to make potentially tens if not \n     hundreds of thousands of claims against Cuba in our federal \n     courts may prevent the U.S. certified claimants from ever \n     receiving the compensation due them under international legal \n     standards. After all, Cuba hardly has the means to compensate \n     simultaneously both the certified claimants and hundreds of \n     thousands of Cuban-Americans, who collectively hold claims \n     valued as high as $94 billion, according to a State \n     Department estimate. In addition, this avalanche of lawsuits \n     undoubtedly will cloud title to property in Cuba for years, \n     thereby lessening the prospects for restitutionary approaches \n     in satisfaction of some of the certified claims.\n       Apart from the injury to the interests of U.S. certified \n     claimants, we can reasonably anticipate that this \n     legislation, by opening our courts to such an expansive new \n     class of claimants, will unleash a veritable explosion of \n     litigation that will place an enormous if not overwhelming \n     burden on our courts. Moreover, the legislation even would \n     allow Cuban exiles abroad to avail themselves of this lawsuit \n     right simply by forming a corporation in the United States, \n     transferring any claim they may have against Cuba into that \n     U.S. corporate entity, and bringing suit in U.S. federal \n     courts. In addition, other similarly situated U.S. nationals \n     of various ethnic origins who have suffered property losses \n     under similar circumstances can be expected to pursue this \n     lawsuit right on equal protection grounds. While it is \n     difficult to predict with any precision the number of \n     lawsuits that will be filed under this legislation, it is not \n     unreasonable to conclude that they will number in the \n     hundreds of thousands.\n       Finally, we must consider the impact of this lawsuit right \n     on the ability of a post-Castro Cuban government to \n     successfully implement market-oriented reforms. There can be \n     little doubt that the multitude of unresolved legal \n     proceedings engendered by this legislation will all but \n     preclude such reform, which must be the foundation of a free \n     and prosperous Cuba. Even should the President, as an \n     incident of normalizing relations with a democratic Cuban \n     government, ultimately extinguish these claims, if history is \n     a guide, our government could assume tremendous liability to \n     this newly created class of claimants.\n       In light of the pernicious implications of this legislation \n     for the legal rights of certified claimants, an already \n     overburdened court system, the claims settlement process and \n     the orderly disposition of claims, and the post-Castro \n     investment environment, we urge you to oppose the Helms \n     amendment insofar as it contains Title III in its present \n     form.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 David W. Wallace,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Statement of David W. Wallace, Chairman, Joint Corporate Committee on \nCuban Claims on S. 381, the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act \n                                of 1995\n\n (Submitted to the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere and Peace Corps \nAffairs, the Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate, June \n                               14, 1995)\n\n       Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, I appreciate \n     the opportunity to submit this statement expressing the views \n     of the Joint Corporate Committee on Cuban Claims with respect \n     to S. 381, the ``Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity \n     (LIBERTAD) Act of 1995.''\n       The Joint Corporate Committee on Cuban Claims, of which I \n     serve as Chairman, represents more than thirty U.S. \n     corporations with certified claims against the Government of \n     Cuba stemming from the Castro regime's unlawful confiscation \n     of U.S. property without just compensation. Our member \n     corporations hold more than one-half of the $1.6 billion in \n     outstanding certified corporate claims. Since its formation \n     in 1975, the Committee has vigorously supported the \n     proposition that before our government takes any steps to \n     resume normal trade and diplomatic relations with Cuba, the \n     Government of Cuba must provide adequate compensation for the \n     U.S. properties it unlawfully seized.\n       Although I am submitting this statement in my capacity as \n     Chairman of the Joint Corporate Committee, I would like to \n     note parenthetically that I also serve as Chairman and Chief \n     Executive Officer of Lone Star Industries, Inc. Lone Star is \n     a certified claim holder whose cement plant at Mariel was \n     seized by the Cuban Government in 1960. Lone Star's claim is \n     valued at $24.9 million plus 6 percent interest since the \n     date of seizure.\n       On behalf of our Committee, I want to commend the \n     significant contribution you have made to the debate on U.S.-\n     Cuba policy by focusing renewed attention on the Castro \n     regime's unlawful expropriation of U.S. property--an issue \n     that all too often gets lost in the debate over the wisdom of \n     the embargo policy. Recognizing the important role that trade \n     and investment by U.S. businesses will have in Cuba's \n     economic reconstruction and its eventual return to the \n     international community, evidence of concrete steps by the \n     Government of Cuba towards the satisfactory resolution of the \n     property claims issue must be an essential condition for the \n     resumption of economic and diplomatic ties between our \n     nations.\n       I think it is important to recall the essential reason for \n     which the U.S. government first imposed a partial trade \n     embargo against Cuba in 1960, followed by the suspension of \n     diplomatic relations in 1961 and the imposition of a total \n     trade embargo in 1962. These actions were taken in direct \n     response to the Castro regime's expropriation of properties \n     held by American citizens and companies without payment of \n     prompt, adequate and effective compensation as required under \n     U.S. and international law. This illegal confiscation of \n     private assets was the largest uncompensated taking of \n     American property in the history of our country, affecting \n     scores of individual companies and investors in Cuban \n     enterprises.\n       These citizens and companies whose property was confiscated \n     have a legal right recognized in long-established \n     international law to receive adequate compensation or the \n     return of their property. Indeed, Cuba's Constitution of 1940 \n     and even the decrees issued by the Castro regime since it \n     came to power in 1959 recognized the principle of \n     compensation for confiscated properties. Pursuant to Title V \n     of the International Claims Settlement Act, the claims of \n     U.S. citizens and corporations against the Cuban government \n     have been adjudicated and certified by the Foreign Claims \n     Settlement Commission of the United States. Yet to this day, \n     these certified claims remain unsatisfied.\n       It is our position that lifting the embargo prior to \n     resolution of the claims issue would be unwise as a matter of \n     policy and damaging to our settlement negotiations posture. \n     First, it would set a bad precedent by signaling a \n     willingness on the part of our nation to tolerate Cuba's \n     failure to abide by precepts of international law. Other \n     foreign nations, consequently, may draw the conclusion that \n     unlawful seizures of property can occur without consequence, \n     thereby leading to future unlawful confiscations of American \n     properties without compensation. Second, lifting the embargo \n     would remove the best leverage we have in compelling the \n     Cuban government to address the claims of U.S. nationals and \n     would place our negotiators at a terrible disadvantage in \n     seeking just compensation and restitution. We depend on our \n     government to protect the rights of its citizens when they \n     are harmed by the unlawful actions of a foreign agent. The \n     Joint Corporate Committee greatly appreciates the steadfast \n     support our State Department has provided over the years on \n     the claims issue. However, we recognize that the powerful \n     tool of sanctions will be crucial to the Department's ability \n     ultimately to effect a just resolution of this issue.\n\n[[Page S 15112]]\n\n       Apart from the need to redress the legitimate grievances of \n     U.S. claimants, we also should not overlook the contribution \n     these citizens and companies made to the economy of pre-\n     revolutionary Cuba, helping to make it one of the top ranking \n     Latin American countries in terms of living standards and \n     economic growth. Many of these companies and individuals look \n     forward to returning to Cuba to work with its people to help \n     rebuild the nation and invest in its future. As was the case \n     in pre-revolutionary Cuba, the ability of the Cuban \n     government to attract foreign investment once again will be \n     key to the success of any national policy of economic \n     revitalization.\n       However, unless and until potential investors can be \n     assured of their right to own property free from the threat \n     of confiscation without compensation, many U.S. companies \n     simply will not be willing to take the risk of doing business \n     with Cuba. It is only by fairly and reasonably addressing the \n     claims issue that the Cuban Government can demonstrate to the \n     satisfaction of the business community its recognition of and \n     respect for property rights.\n       We are pleased that S. 381 does not waver from the core \n     principle, firmly embodied in U.S. law, which requires the \n     adequate resolution of the certified claims before trade and \n     diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuban governments \n     are normalized. However, we are concerned with provisions of \n     Section 207 of the revised bill that condition the resumption \n     of U.S. assistance to Cuba on the adoption of steps leading \n     to the satisfaction of claims of both the certified claimants \n     and Cuban-American citizens who were not U.S. nationals at \n     the time their property was confiscated. Notwithstanding the \n     modifying provisions which accord priority to the settlement \n     of the certified claims and give the President authority to \n     resume aid upon a showing that the Cuban Government has taken \n     sufficient steps to satisfy the certified claims, this \n     dramatic expansion of the claimant pool, as a practical \n     matter, would necessarily impinge upon the property interests \n     of the certified claimants.\n       Even though the claimants who were not U.S. nationals at \n     the time of the property loss would not enjoy the espousal \n     rights that the certified claimants enjoy, the recognition of \n     a second tier of claimants by the U.S. Government at a \n     minimum would necessarily color, and likely make more \n     complicated, any settlement negotiations with Cuba to the \n     detriment of the certified claimants.\n       Moreover, the fact that the legislation gives priority for \n     the settlement of certified property claims is of little \n     consequence within the context of such a vastly expanded pool \n     of claimants that seemingly defies a prompt, adequate and \n     effective settlement of claims. In addition, once this second \n     tier of claimants is recognized, it would be exceedingly \n     difficult politically for the President to exercise his \n     waiver authority. Finally, this dramatic expansion of the \n     claimant pool would serve as a significant disincentive for a \n     post-Castro Cuban Government to enter into meaningful \n     settlement negotiations with the United States given the \n     sheer enormity of the outstanding claims and the practical \n     impossibility of satisfying all those claims.\n       In short, while we are sympathetic to the position of those \n     individuals and entities who were not U.S. nationals at the \n     time their property was seized, we believe that U.S. \n     Government recognition and representation of this group of \n     claimants--even falling short of espousal of their claims \n     with a post-Castro Government in Cuba--would harm the \n     interests of the already certified claimants. We believe that \n     the recognition of a second tier of claimants will delay and \n     complicate the settlement of certified claims, and may \n     undermine the prospects for serious settlement negotiations \n     with the Cuban Government.\n       It is our view, based on well-established principles of \n     international law, that individuals and entities who were \n     Cuban nationals at the time their property was confiscated \n     must seek resolution of their claims in Cuban courts under \n     Cuban law under a future Cuban Government whereby the \n     respective property rights of former and current Cuban \n     nationals may be fairly determined. In taking that position, \n     we categorically reject any notion that a naturalized \n     American has any lesser degree of right than a native-born \n     American. That objectionable and irrelevant notion serves \n     only to cloud the real issue here, and that is simply the \n     question of what rights are pertinent to a non-national as of \n     the date of injury. Simply put, international law does not \n     confer retroactive rights upon naturalized citizens.\n       Many of the same objections noted above also apply to \n     Section 302 of the revised bill, which allows U.S. nationals, \n     including hundreds of thousands of naturalized Cuban-\n     Americans, to file suit in U.S. courts against persons or \n     entities that traffic in expropriated property. We believe \n     this unrestricted provision also will adversely affect the \n     rights of certified claimants. By effectively moving claims \n     settlement out of the venue of the Foreign Claims Settlement \n     Commission and into the federal judiciary, this provision can \n     be expected to invite hundreds of thousands of commercial and \n     residential property lawsuits. Apart from the enormous, if \n     not overwhelming, burden these lawsuits will place on our \n     courts, this provision raises serious implications with \n     respect to the Cuban Government's ability to satisfy \n     certified claims.\n       First, allowing Cuba to become liable by way of federal \n     court judgments for monetary damages on a non-dismissible \n     basis necessarily will reduce whatever monetary means Cuba \n     might have to satisfy the certified claims. Second, this \n     expected multiplicity of lawsuits undoubtedly will cloud \n     title to property in Cuba for years, thereby lessening the \n     prospects for restitutionary approaches in satisfaction of \n     some of these claims. Moreover, under this provision, the \n     President would have no power to dismiss these suits as an \n     incident of normalizing relations with a democratically \n     elected government in Cuba once they are commenced. \n     Consequently, the foreign investment that will be crucial to \n     Cuba's successful implementation of market-oriented reforms \n     will be all but precluded by these unresolved legal \n     proceedings.\n       In conclusion, we want to commend you for your efforts in \n     raising the profile of the property claims issue and focusing \n     attention on the importance of resolving these claims to the \n     full restoration of democracy and free enterprise in Cuba. We \n     also recognize and appreciate the effort you have made to \n     modify this legislation in response to the concerns expressed \n     by the certified claimant community; however, we hope that \n     you will further consider our continuing concerns regarding \n     the implications of this legislation for the legal rights of \n     certified claimants, an already overburdened court system, \n     the claims settlement process and the orderly disposition of \n     claims, and the post-Castro investment environment.\n\n  Mr. PELL. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me first of all commend my dear friend \nand distinguished colleague from Rhode Island. As all of my colleagues \nare aware, our friend from Rhode Island has announced he will not be \nseeking reelection almost a year from now. He has been a wonderful U.S. \nSenator over these many years representing his State and always keeping \nin mind the national interest.\n  He has had a longstanding view on cloture, and it has to be a very \nunique set of circumstances that would cause someone with more than 30 \nyears of having maintained a very strong philosophical position--much \nto the chagrin, I might point out, of his colleagues from time to time \nwho have wanted his vote or not wanted his vote on a particular \nmatter--to take this position. So, I respect immensely his decision.\n  Mr. President, we are going to vote in a couple minutes on this \nmatter. We have had a good opportunity to talk about it over the last \nday or so. I just want to reiterate, if I could, the underlying concern \nI have about this bill and why I think that cloture should not be \ninvoked.\n  True of all matters that we consider in this body, but particularly \nwhen it comes to matters affecting the international relations of this \nNation, the first test ought to be whether or not what we are going to \ndo is in the best interests of our country; and, secondly, whether or \nnot it is going to help or hinder, depending upon the purpose of the \nlegislation, the country involved.\n  Before we even get to the second question, the first question must be \nanswered positively. And my concern about this bill that is before us \nis that, in the first instance, it is not in the self-interest of this \ncountry to adopt this bill for the reason that it creates unprecedented \nnew opportunities for a group of people that we have never provided \naccess to the U.S. courts to on claims matters involving the \nexpropriation of property where there has been a lack of compensation.\n  As my colleagues no doubt are aware, under U.S. claims court rules \nfor the last four decades, more than four decades, in order to sue in a \nU.S. claims court, you must have been a U.S. citizen that was doing \nbusiness or had property in the country where there is an expropriation \nof property at the time. As has been pointed out in the case of Cuba, \nthere were some 6,000 individuals or corporations that held that status \nin 1959 when the expropriations took place across the board.\n  What we are doing with this bill, and why I ask my colleagues to read \nit, look at it, is for the first time in more than four decades we are \nnow saying, in addition to that group, anyone who was a national of \nCuba but who subsequently became a U.S. citizen, or even went to some \nother country, can now file in the U.S. claims court for compensation \nunder the expropriation actions.\n  That is unprecedented. There are some 37 other countries in the world \n\n\n[[Page S 15113]]\nthat have matters of expropriation of properties pending. Were we to \napply the same standard we are going to apply, or could apply with this \nlegislation, it would open up in the case of Americans of Polish \nancestry, Vietnamese, Chinese, German--the countries, 37 in number--\nthen one could only begin to imagine the kind of overwhelming amount of \nwork that would fall on our United States courts.\n  It is estimated that each claims action costs some $4,500 to process. \nJust with the passage of this legislation, we will expand the workload \nof that court from 6,000 cases, legitimate cases of expropriation, to \nsome 430,000 cases. That is what we have been told is the estimate of \nthe claims. Who is going to pay for that, and what happens to the \nclaimants who have a consistent legitimate right? Yet, that is what we \nare doing with this bill.\n  So regardless of how one feels about the government in Cuba, how \nangry they may be, I just beseech my colleagues to read title III of \nthis bill and then ask themselves whether or not this is something we \nought to be doing to ourselves.\n  This is an unfunded mandate, in effect, for the claims that come \nbefore the court. There is another reason, in my view, why it should be \nrejected. We never voted on it in committee, never had a single vote. \nThe bill is brought to the floor by the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee who chairs the committee which has jurisdiction.\n  I hope we do not invoke cloture and that the bill be sent back for \nfurther work so it comes back with the kind of provisions in title III \nthat are not, I think, so threatening and dangerous to the country.\n  Mr. President, I heard the gavel come down. Is there a time \nlimitation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has been divided and the time on the \nDemocratic side has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that my colleague be able to \nrespond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was only going to ask a question of the \nSenator from Connecticut. I am not on the relevant committee. My \nunderstanding was this was not subject to a committee markup, and this \nlegislation came to the floor without a markup; is that correct?\n  Mr. DODD. That is correct. Again, I can understand someone who was in \nthe minority trying to pull that, but if you are in the majority and \nthe chair of the committee and bring a bill out that you did not have a \nmarkup on in your own committee, I do not understand the precedent for \nthat, it seems to me.\n  We had hearings on this issue, in fairness to the chairman of the \ncommittee. There are hearings we had about the situation in Cuba, but \nno markup of this legislation at all.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This is not an unimportant issue, I agree with the \nSenator. Since I am not involved in this committee's actions, it seems \nto me that the approach that would best serve the search for the right \npolicy would be an approach where you have a committee process, where \nthey mark up the bill, debate the bill during markup, write the best \nbill and then bring it to the floor. This appears not to be the regular \norder to get the legislation to the floor. I appreciate the Senator's \nresponse.\n  Mr. DODD. Just for the benefit of my colleagues, I point out, as I \nmentioned earlier, this expands the definition of who is a U.S. \nclaimant to include ``any Cuban national presently a United States \ncitizen regardless of citizenship at the time of the expropriation, as \nwell as any person who incorporates himself or herself as a business \nentity under U.S. law prior to this bill becoming law.''\n  That is, you do not have to be a U.S. citizen today, you can be a \nforeign national, but if you incorporate yourself as any person, then \nyou can bring an action in U.S. claims court. That is unprecedented, as \nfar as the law has stood for the past 4 decades.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, there will be a vote momentarily. That will \nbe the last vote of the day. It could be the last vote of the week, \ndepending on whether or not we get to appoint conferees to S. 652, the \ntelecommunications bill, tomorrow. I understand there may be an \ninstruction on the other side. If there is an instruction, that could \nrequire a vote tomorrow. And we hope to appoint conferees to welfare \nreform, H.R. 4. The President has asked about expediting that. Others \nhave asked about expediting that. We are prepared to appoint conferees. \nWe hope we can do that tomorrow.\n  As to Monday, I hope to have an announcement tomorrow whether or not \nwe will be in session at all on Monday, and if we are in session, what \nwe will be about, because as I understand, there is going to be a \nmassive traffic jam on Monday. They tell me thousands of buses are \ngoing to be in town, so it might not be possible to get to the Capitol, \nor, if you get here, it might not be possible to get anywhere else.\n  I will try to accommodate my colleagues and make that announcement as \nearly as I can tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/12/senate-section/article/S15106-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, October 9- to 13 has been recognized as \nNational School Lunch Week. It is therefore appropriate to congratulate \nthose who work to elevate child welfare and nutrition concerns on the \nnational policy agenda, as it is increasingly apparent that investments \nin child nutrition programs today will pay rich dividends in terms of \nthe future health and productivity of our Nation.\n  The National School Lunch Program was signed into law in 1946, not as \nan act of charity, but as a matter of national security. Shocking \nnumbers of young men had failed their physicals in World War II as a \nresult of preventable, nutrition-related illnesses. The National School \nLunch Act was designed to provide access to necessary nutrition for \nsome of our Nation's most vulnerable children.\n  Next June, we will be celebrating the 50th anniversary of this \nextremely successful program. Over the years I have enjoyed working \nwith the members of the South Dakota School Food Service Association, \nand we agree on the importance of child nutrition and the value of the \nschool meals program. I look forward to our continued work in this \narea.\n  Last year Congress passed legislation that reauthorized and improved \nseveral important nutrition programs under the National School Lunch \nAct and the Child Nutrition Act. I was pleased to be a cosponsor of \nthis legislation. At my urging, as part of that legislation, Congress \ndirected the Department of Agriculture to bring schools into compliance \nwith specified dietary guidelines by the 1996-97 school year rather \nthan the 1998-99 school year, as originally stipulated by USDA. Among \nother recommendations, these guidelines establish a 30-percent limit on \ndaily dietary fat, and a 10-percent limit on saturated fat.\n  In June 1995, USDA updated Federal regulations to require schools \nmeals to meet the dietary guidelines and conform to the legislation. \nThe school meals initiative for healthy children is a significant \nreform of the program's 49 year history. In support of this policy, \nUSDA also launched Team Nutrition, which provides training and \ntechnical assistance, as well as nutrition education to schools as they \nstrive to incorporate the new nutrition standards into their school \nmeals. Team Nutrition's goal is to improve the health and education of \nchildren through innovative public and private partnerships.\n  I'm particularly pleased to recognize a South Dakota school which is \nleading the way in implementing healthier school meals. Rosholt \nElementary School in Rosholt, SD, near my hometown of Aberdeen, is the \nfirst Team Nutrition school in South Dakota. Rosholt Elementary will \nserve as a model as they begin implementation of the healthy school \nmeals policy. Compliance with the dietary guidelines will have a real \nimpact on the health of children who participate in the school meals \nprogram, and I commend the Rosholt school and community on its \ncommitment to the health status of its students.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/12/senate-section/article/S15114-4", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15114-S15115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:46 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nappoints Mr. Borski as a conferee in the committee of conference on the \ndisagreeing votes of the two Houses on the amendments of the House to \nthe bill (S. 440) to amend title 23, United States Code, to provide for \nthe designation of the National Highway System, and for other purposes; \nto fill the vacancy resulting from the resignation from the House of \nRepresentatives of Mr. Mineta.\n  The message also announced that the Speaker appoints Mr. Oberstar as \na conferee in the committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of \nthe two Houses on the amendments of the House to the bill (S. 395) to \nauthorize and direct the Secretary of Energy to sell the Alaska Power \nAdministration, and to authorize the export of Alaska North Slope crude \noil, and for other purposes; to fill the vacancy resulting from the \nresignation from the House of Representatives of Mr. Mineta.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  At 1:05 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House agrees \nto the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing votes \nof the two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n1976) making appropriations for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food \nand Drug Administration, and related agencies programs for the fiscal \nyear ending September 30, 1996, and for other purposes;\n  The message also announced that the Speaker appoints the following \nMember as an additional conferee in the conference on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill \n(H.R. 4) to restore the American family, reduce illegitimacy, control \nwelfare spending, and reduce welfare dependence: Mr. Tanner.\n  The message further announced that the House has agreed to the \nfollowing concurrent resolution, without amendment:\n\n\n[[Page S 15115]]\n\n       S.

A bill for the relief of Saeed Rezai; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n                       private relief legislation\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce private relief \nlegislation on behalf of my constituents, Mr. Saeed Rezai, and his \nwife, Mrs. Julie Rezai.\n  As my colleagues are aware, those immigration cases that warrant \nprivate legislation are extremely rare. In fact, it has been nearly 6 \nyears since I last introduced a bill to grant such relief. Indeed, I \nhad hoped that this case would not require congressional intervention. \nUnfortunately, it is clear that private legislation is the only means \nremaining to ensure a thorough and comprehensive Justice Department \nreview of a number of specific unresolved questions in Mr. Rezai's \ncase.\n  I wish to take a moment, Mr. President, to provide something by way \nof background to this somewhat complicated case and to explain the \nurgency of this legislation. Mr. Rezai first came to the United States \nin 1986. On June 15, 1991, he married his current wife, Julie, who is a \nU.S. citizen. Shortly thereafter, she filed an immigrant visa petition \non behalf of her husband. Approval of this petition has been blocked, \nhowever, by the application of Sec. 204(c) of the Immigration and \nNationality Act. Section 204(c) precludes the approval of a visa \npetition for anyone who entered, or conspired to enter, into a \nfraudulent marriage. The Immigration and Naturalization Service [INS] \napplied this provision in Mr. Rezai's case because his previous \nmarriage ended in divorce before the conditions on his residence were \nlifted. In deportation proceedings following the divorce, the judge was \nvery careful to mention that there was no proof of false testimony by \nMr. Rezai, and he granted voluntary departure rather than ordering \ndeportation because, in his words, Mr. Rezai ``may be eligible for a \nvisa in the future.''\n  Despite these comments by the immigration judge, the INS has refused \nto approve Mrs. Rezai's petition. An appeal of this decision is \ncurrently pending before the Board of Immigration Appeals [BIA]. In the \nmeantime, Mr. Rezai appealed the initial termination of his lawful \npermanent resident status in 1990 and the denial of his application for \nasylum and withholding of deportation. In August of this year, the \nTenth Circuit Court of Appeals denied this appeal and granted him 90 \ndays in which to leave the country voluntarily or be deported. Under \ncurrent law, there is no provision to postpone Mr. Rezai's deportation \npending the BIA's ruling on the current immigrant visa petition filed \nby his wife.\n  Mr. President, there is no doubt that deportation would be the source \nof extraordinary hardship to both Mr. and Mrs. Rezai. Throughout all \nthe proceedings of the past 4 years, no one including the INS, has \nquestioned the validity of their current marriage. In fact, the many \nfriends and acquaintances I have heard from have emphatically asserted \nthat their marriage is as strong as any they have seen. Given the \nprevailing political and cultural climate in Iran, I would not expect \nthat Mrs. Rezai will choose to make her home there. Mr. Rezai's \ndeportation will thus cause either the destruction of their legitimate \nmarriage or the forced removal of a U.S. citizen and her husband to a \ncountry unfamiliar to either of them, and in which they have neither \nfriends nor family.\n  It should also be noted that Mr. Rezai has been present in the United \nStates for nearly a decade. During this time he has assimilated to \nAmerican culture and has become a contributing member of his community. \nHe has been placed in a responsible position of employment as the \nsecurity field supervisor at Westminster College where he has gained \nthe respect and admiration of both his peers and his superiors. In \nfact, I have received a letter from the interim president of \nWestminster College, signed by close to 150 of Mr. Rezai's associates, \nattesting to his many contributions to the college and the community. \nThis is just one of the many, many letters and phone calls I have \nreceived from members of our community. Mr. Rezai's forced departure in \nlight of these considerations would both unduly limit his own \nopportunities and deprive the community of his continued contributions.\n  Finally, Mr. Rezai's deportation would be a particular hardship to \nhis wife given the fact that she was diagnosed earlier this year with \nmultiple sclerosis [MS]. She was severely ill for some time and was \ntaking a number of medications for her condition. Although Mrs. Rezai's \nhealth since the initial diagnosis of MS has improved, her physician \nhas stated that severe symptoms may return at any time and that rapid \ndeterioration could ensue as a result of the stress being placed upon \nher by her husband's immigration proceedings.\n  Mr. President, I firmly believe that we must think twice before \nenforcing an action that will result in such severe consequences as the \ndestruction of Mr. and Mrs. Rezai's marriage and the endangering of \nMrs. Rezai's already fragile health. At a minimum, the outstanding \nquestions regarding the propriety of the denial of Mr. Rezai's current \nimmigrant visa petition need to be addressed. The legislation I am \nintroducing today will ensure that the necessary information is \ngathered to address these questions, that the Justice Department will \nconduct a comprehensive review of Mr. Rezai's case in light of this \ninformation and that Mr. Rezai's deportation will be stayed pending the \noutcome of this review.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DOLE (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Warner, Mr. Heflin, \n        Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Burns, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \n        Coverdell, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Brown, and Mr. \n        Stevens):\n  S. 1315. A bill to designate the Federal Triangle Project under \nconstruction at 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, Northwest, in the \nDistrict of Columbia, as the ``Ronald Reagan Building and International \nTrade Center''; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n     the ronald reagan building and international trade center act\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, earlier today, I was joined by a number of \nmy Senate colleagues, and by Congresswoman Andrea Seastrand of \nCalifornia in announcing the introduction of legislation to designate \nthe Federal Triangle project as the ``Ronald Reagan Building and \nInternational Trade Center.''\n  Like most who work in Washington, I have enjoyed watching the monthly \nprogress made on the construction of what, upon its completion in 1997, \nwill be an important addition to this city's architectural landscape.\n  And in my view, Congresswoman Andrea Seastrand had come up with \nexactly the right name for the project.\n  President Reagan always believed that Government and the private \nsector should be partners and not adversaries. And the Federal Triangle \nproject--authorized during the Reagan administration--was constructed \nin that spirit.\n  As Senator Moynihan, who is a cosponsor of this legislation, was the \ndriving force behind congressional approval of the project. And he \npointed out on the Senate floor in 1987 that the project's construction \ninvolved no appropriated Federal funds.\n  Rather, money was borrowed from the Federal Financing Bank, and will \nbe repaid with revenues derived from leasing office space. It is \nanticipated \n\n[[Page S 15120]]\nthat after 30 years, the Federal Government will own the building \noutright.\n  It is also fitting to name a building that will house an \ninternational trade center after President Reagan, because no one stood \nstronger for free and fair trade than he did.\n  While naming a building can certainly not repay the debt America owes \nto Ronald Reagan, it is a fitting tribute to a man who transformed this \ncity, this country, and the entire world.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1315\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION.\n\n       The Federal Triangle Project under construction at 14th \n     Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, Northwest, in the District of \n     Columbia, shall be known and designated as the ``Ronald \n     Reagan Building and International Trade Center''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     or other record of the United States to the building referred \n     to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a reference to the \n     ``Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center''.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KEMPTHORNE (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Reid, \n        Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Dole, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Warner, Mr. Smith, Mr. \n        Faircloth, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Thomas, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Jeffords, \n        Mr. Hatch, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Burns, Mr. Craig, Mr. \n        Bennett, Mr. Exon, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Hatfield, and Mr. \n        Lautenberg):\n  S. 1316. A bill to reauthorize and amend title XIV of the Public \nHealth Service Act (commonly known as the ``Safe Drinking Water Act''), \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n                  the safer drinking water act of 1995\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, just over a decade ago, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency developed a research plan to improve \nour understanding about cryptosporidium, a tiny disease-carrying \nmicrobe that can show up in our drinking water supply. Not much \nhappened with that study plan and cryptosporidium was not regulated by \nthe agency. Unfortunately, the failure to carry out the research \nnecessary to support a regulation led to a failure in public health \nprotection. In the past several years, we have witnessed outbreaks of \ncryptosporidiosis, which we believe to have been water-borne, in Las \nVegas, San Francisco, and Milwaukee. While not terribly harmful to most \nAmericans, the microbe can prove fatal for those with weakened immune \nsystem.\n  This tragedy could and should have been avoided. But the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency is not solely responsible for this \nfailure of public health protection. The truth is that the current safe \ndrinking law discourages the Environmental Protection Agency from \nconcentrating its resources on regulating contaminants posing the \nhighest health risks like cryptosporidium, a microbe scientists have \nknown about since the 1970's. Instead of concentrating government \nresources on microbes causing acute and immediate health effects, the \nSafe Drinking Water Act requires EPA to regulate a long list of \ncontaminants, regardless of whether or not they pose a threat to public \nhealth, regardless of whether they actually occur in drinking water, \nand oftentimes at the expense of regulating contaminants that pose a \nmore serious and immediate health threat.\n  After a 2\\1/2\\-year effort to reauthorize the present drinking water \nstatute, I and my colleagues on the committee have come to the \nconclusion that we need a better, safer, smarter Safe Drinking Water \nAct. Congress must write a better law that ensures that the water \nAmericans drink is safe, makes wiser use of government resources, \ncorrects the mistakes and unintended consequences of existing law, and \nanticipates and addresses future drinking water concerns.\n  Congress must write a law that gives EPA flexibility to set a \ndrinking water standard based on peer reviewed science and the benefits \nand risks associated with contaminants. Congress must also commit the \ndollars to carry out the needed research to help identify those \ncontaminants that pose the most serious health concern. Congress must \ninsist on having a public record to educate the American public about \nthe risks they face from a particular contaminant, and the costs to \nregulate it. Congress must also allow States and local governments to \nbe full and independent partners in the development, implementation, \nand enforcement of drinking water regulations.\n  Guided by these goals, supported by Republican and Democratic State \nand local officials who work every day to provide safe drinking water \nto their own families, friends, and neighbors, today I introduce \nlegislation to renew and improve the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  I am joined in introducing this bill by Senator Chafee, the chairman \nof the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee; Senator Baucus, \nthe ranking member of that committee; Senator Reid, the ranking member \nof the Senate Subcommittee on Drinking Water, Fisheries and Wildlife; \nand Senator Kerrey, who has been instrumental in negotiations last year \nand this year to bring sense into this particular public health \nstatute. For 9 long months we have labored to produce a bill that we \nthink will improve public health protection and is, at the same time, \nresponsive to the need of States and communities across the country to \nbe able to target scarce resources to high priority health risks, and \nnot on trivial risks.\n  This legislation combines the best provisions of the bill the Senate \npassed last year with improvements suggested by those responsible for \nproviding safe drinking water. The bill protects public health better \nthan current law, and it will not roll back or weaken existing \nstandards and public health protection.\n  I would like to touch on some of the highlights of the bill:\n  First, the bill authorizes the commitment of Federal resources to \nassure that the Nation's drinking water supply is safe and makes sure \nthat the money is targeted to our most serious problems. One billion \ndollars is authorized annually for a drinking water State revolving \nloan fund, which itself will be matched by the States with another 20 \npercent. The committee recognizes that many communities are financially \nstrapped and cannot afford to install treatment to ensure safe water \nsupplies. This money will help fund compliance with drinking water \nstandards, with special forgiveness provisions for disadvantaged \ncommunities.\n  The bill also authorizes roughly $53 million for health effects \nresearch, especially research into the health effects of \ncryptosporidium, disinfectants and disinfection byproducts, arsenic, \nand related research on sensitive population groups, like children, \nelderly, pregnant women, and those with serious illnesses. As I \nreviewed our progress towards improving the quality of the Nation's \ndrinking water, I was especially dismayed to learn how poor our \nresearch efforts have been. Poor research means poor standards, and \neither poor health protection or over-protection at an unnecessarily \nburdensome cost. Therefore, we have included in the bill a 10 percent \nset-aside of the top of the State revolving loan fund that the \nadministrator may use to support essential health effects research.\n  Third, the bill requires EPA to use the best available peer-reviewed \nscience in identifying and regulating contaminants. It repeals the \nrequirement that the agency regulate 25 new contaminants every 3 years, \nand sets up a process that will ensure that EPA has the authority and \nthe resources to regulate those contaminants that pose the greatest \nrisk, instead of doing those that pose a trivial risk. Furthermore, to \nhelp the agency set priorities, it is required to address only those \ncontaminants that actually occur in drinking water, or have a \nsubstantial likelihood of doing so.\n  Fourth, the bill makes modifications to the current method for \nsetting drinking water standards. Today, the administrator is always \nrequired to set a standard at the level that is technologically \nfeasible. In some instances, this does not make sense: The costs can be \nexcessively high in relation to the health benefits. Under this bill, \nwe \n\n[[Page S 15121]]\nallow the administrator to set a standard at a different level when it \nmakes sense to do so.\n  In preparation for setting every new standard, the administrator will \nconduct a full analysis of the health risk reduction benefits that can \nbe achieved from a maximum contaminant level that is technologically \nfeasible, and other levels that might be appropriate to consider on the \nbasis of risk, or benefit-cost. That analysis will be published for \npublic comment and then becomes the basis for making a decision about \nwhether the technologically feasible level is justified, or whether \nsome other level is appropriate.\n  If the technologically feasible level is not justified, looking at \ncosts to those public water systems serving over 10,000 people and the \ncosts to those systems that are not likely to get a variance, the \nadministrator may propose a maximum contaminant level that is \njustified. If justified, however, the administrator will be required to \npromulgate a standard that is as close to the health goal as is \nfeasible.\n  Fifth, the bill establishes new deadlines for the issuance of some \nvery important contaminants. These deadlines are consistent with the \nEPA's desire to have flexibility to focus on higher priority \ncontaminants, and, where necessary, allows the administrator time to \ncarry out critical research to support the standard setting process. \nThe bill also preserves the negotiated rulemaking for disinfectants and \ndisinfection byproducts, which includes cryptosporidium, and its makes \nclear that the administrator has the authority to consider and balance \nthe risks between the disinfection byproducts and microbial \ncontaminants.\n  Sixth, the bill provides new authority for the administrator to \nregulate contaminants on an interim basis where there is an urgent \npublic health concern.\n  Seventh, the bill strengthens the existing partnership between the \nFederal Government and State government in the administration and \nimplementation of the Safe Drinking Water Act. It preserves the strong \nrole for the Federal Government in developing drinking water standards \nand supporting State primacy, but allows States the flexibility to \ntailor Federal monitoring and other requirements to meet the needs in \ntheir States. While the bill makes a few changes in enforcement \nprovisions, the bill retains the current law's emphasis on compliance-\noriented strategies to encourage better compliance among public water \nsystems, rather than formal, punitive enforcement actions.\n  Eighth, the bill establishes a new process by which States may grant \nvariances to small systems, those serving under 10,000, that are unable \nto comply with Federal drinking water requirements. As part of \nreceiving a variance, a public water system will be required to install \nappropriate affordable technology that will result in an overall \nimprovement in drinking water quality during the period of the \nvariance. Rather than adjusting the overall national standard to a \nlevel that is affordable for the smallest of systems, the committee \nchose to help these same systems through a new variance provision. The \nvariances must adequately protect public health, and citizens can \npetition EPA to overturn a variance granted by a State if that \nstatutory requirement is not met.\n  Ninth, the bill helps small water systems, usually in rural areas, \nprovide safe and affordable drinking water to their communities. \nTechnical assistance, State revolving loan funds, a requirement that \nEPA identify treatment technologies affordable for small systems, and a \nnew emphasis on helping systems to develop the financial, managerial, \nand technical capacity to meet Federal drinking water requirements, \nwill do much to encourage the States and EPA to redirect time and \nattention to the problems and concerns of these smallest water systems.\n  Finally, I believe the bill looks toward the future, anticipates the \ndrinking water needs and concerns of the 21st century, and establishes \na framework to address these issues. In particular, the bill provides \nfor voluntary, locally-driven, incentive based partnerships to provide \nfor the protection of source water. It is crafted to avoid Federal \ninvolvement in local land-use planning issues and to allow real source \nwater quality problems to be addressed in a cooperative, non-\nadversarial process. We have seen great success with local watershed \nplanning initiatives, and I believe empowering local communities to \naddress source water concerns is the right way to go.\n  Also, the bill recognizes that many public water systems are having \ntrouble meeting Federal requirements. The reasons are many. Sometimes \nit is a lack of an adequately trained operator for the treatment \nsystem, or a lack of skill in capital planning, or an inadequate rate-\nbase to support the costs of compliance. Sometimes the problem is a \nresult of the rapid pace at which new Federal regulations were being \npromulgated and the difficulties in understanding, financing, and \nimplementing them.\n  Whatever the reason, the bill includes a new section that asks the \nStates to develop a strategy for helping public water systems meet the \ndemands being made of them, to have the legal authority to prevent new \nwater systems from starting that don't have the financial, technical, \nand managerial capacity to meet Federal requirements, and to report on \nthose systems that have a significant history of noncompliance. States \nretain authority over training and certification of public water system \noperators, but the bill will increase the number of trained and \ncertified operators.\n  Like source water protection, the capacity development strategy \ndepends largely on nonregulatory, noncommand, and control approaches to \naddressing a long-term problem. As such, I believe they will break new \nground in terms of the Federal-State partnership, and in terms of \nbuilding local community resources to address drinking water problems.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join Senators Chafee, Kerrey, \nBaucus, Reid, Inhofe, Warner, Faircloth, McConnell, Smith, Thomas, \nJeffords, Simpson, Burns, Domenici, Craig, Exon, and I in sponsoring \nthis bill. It has the strong support of State and local officials and \nwater treatment experts. The National Governors Association, the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, the National Conference of State Legislators, the \nLeague of Cities, the National Association of Counties, the American \nWater Works Association, the Association of Metropolitan Water \nAgencies, the Rural Water Association and the Association of State \nDrinking Water Administrators have united together to support this \nbill.\n  These endorsements are important. Congress ought to listen to those \ndirectly responsible for implementing the Drinking Water Act. I have \nnever met a single mayor, Governor, or public water official who would \ndo anything to threaten public health. Not only do their own families \ndrink the water they provide, they know that failure to provide safe \nwater will have repercussions.\n  In 9 months of discussions with these State and local leaders, two \nmessages emerged. Their first message was that we must recognize the \ntremendous progress this country has made in providing Americans with \nsafe drinking water. The United States is numbered among those \ncountries of the world that enjoy the safest drinking water. Nowhere \nelse can 243 million people turn on their taps and drink the water with \nconfidence and without fear. We ought to be grateful for that, and \nproud of America's leadership in assuring that our drinking water is \nsafe and in helping other countries to do the same for their people.\n  It has not always been that way. There was a time when our \ngrandparents and great grandparents regularly and routinely died of \ncholera and typhoid contracted through the water they drank. Their \njournals are filled with the sorrows of untimely deaths that swept \nthrough whole communities. In the United States today, that pain and \nsuffering rarely occurs.\n  But when it does happen, it points out the flaws of the current law, \nand why it must be reformed. And that leads to the second message from \nState and local leaders.\n\n  State and local governments are overwhelmed by the new and changing \nadministrative requirements imposed by the Federal Government, the \nrigidity with which they are applied, the lack of financial resources \nto do the job, and the micromanagement from Federal agencies. While \nmany States, including Idaho, have fought difficult \n\n[[Page S 15122]]\nbattles to impose fees to cover drinking water program costs in their \nStates, they see the Federal Government constantly increasing their \nwork load and the administrative requirements. At the same time, the \nFederal financial commitment to the drinking water program, in relation \nto other environmental programs, is falling.\n  The irony is that Federal water policy leaders agree with their State \nand local partners. President Clinton's former Deputy EPA Administrator \nRobert Sussman bluntly sums up the issue:\n\n       Safe Drinking Water Act implementation has harmed the \n     agency's credibility by becoming a potent symbol of the \n     rigidity and costliness of federal mandates on local \n     governments and the overprotectiveness of the EPA standard-\n     setting process. Reforms in both laws should strive for \n     maintaining environmental protection while achieving more \n     flexibility in priority setting, lower compliance costs, and \n     greater state and local involvement in decision making.\n\n  Congress' own watchdog, the General Accounting Office agrees with Mr. \nSussman. To quote from two recent reports:\n\n       States often defer or eliminate important elements of their \n     drinking water programs in order to devote resources to \n     developing and implementing a growing list of regulations. \n     ``For example, 12 drinking water officials from 16 states \n     noted that they were spending more resources on developing \n     new programs and regulations, as required by the 1986 SDWA \n     amendments, than on conducting vital water system inspections \n     (sanitary surveys) or compliance reviews. These managers \n     expressed concern that, as a result, compliance rates as well \n     as water quality could be suffering.\n       94% of the state drinking water program officials say that \n     mandatory implementation of new program requirements within \n     federally mandated time frames has caused fiscal stress in \n     their state programs and has caused some state programs to \n     discontinue or reduce activities they consider to be more \n     environmentally significant.\n\n  Senators who need further confirmation need only consult water \ntreatment experts in their States. In my own State, McCall, ID, \npopulation 2,000, must invest in a new wastewater treatment plant, a \nnew filtration system and make improvements in its infrastructure to \ndeliver drinking water. As one community leader told me the other day, \n``We've seen a 500 percent increase in our sewer rates, and we're \nstruggling. If we have to go back and raise rates again, or float a \nbond, or whatever it takes to finance compliance with Federal \nrequirements, we need to know that what we're being asked to do makes \nsense in terms of public health protection.''\n  Or, as another public utility official told me, every week he meets \nwith residents struggling to afford present utility rates. ``When I sit \nacross from a woman with her three small children, trying to find ways \nto accommodate her limited budget so that she can cover other family \nnecessities, I want to know that when I have to raise rates, I can tell \nher that it is really necessary to keep her kids from getting sick \nthrough the water they drink.''\n  It is getting harder and harder to convince citizens that Federal \ndrinking water regulations make sense. The current law's inflexibility \nand needless rigidity emphasizes quantity of regulation over quality of \nregulation. By law EPA must regulate a specific list of 83 \ncontaminants, plus an additional 25 contaminants every 3 years, \nregardless of whether those contaminants occur in drinking water or \npose a threat to public health. EPA is absolutely precluded from \nconcentrating its resources on those contaminants in drinking water \nthat present the highest health risk. If it wants to do that, EPA has \nto persuade Federal judges and plaintiffs to let them extend their \ndeadlines on lesser priority contaminants. So long as current law \nremains in place, it does not matter what we as Members of Congress \nthink. It does not matter what the administrator thinks, nor what the \nmayor of Milwaukee and his residents think.\n  Furthermore, under current law, it does not matter whether the \nFederal standard for a particular contaminant is appropriate. It does \nnot allow EPA the time or the money to write regulations based on good, \npeer-reviewed science and good risk assessments, and EPA must always \nwrite the standard based on what is technologically feasible, without \nconsidering the benefits and risks of regulating to that strict level. \nAs a result, EPA's credibility as a protector of public health is \ntarnished. Where the science and the costs do not justify the standard, \nEPA is forced either to manipulate the process to get a reasonable \nresult, to avoid regulating until it has better information, or to \nregulate strictly.\n  These are the problems the legislation being introduced today wants \nto solve. As I said earlier, this bill takes the best provisions of the \nbill the Senate passed last year and builds on them. It is a good bill \nthat will improve public health protection. I ask unanimous consent \nthat a section-by-section explanation of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  In conclusion, recent outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis, the experience \nof our State and local partners, and the responsibility to provide safe \ndrinking water into the 21st century require us to write a better, \nsafer, smarter Safe Drinking Water Act. I look forward to working with \nall those who share this goal to achieve this goal.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSafe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1995--Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n\n         section 1. short title; table of contents; references\n\n       The bill is entitled the ``Safe Drinking Water Act \n     Amendments of 1995''.\n\n\n                          section 2. findings\n\n       The Congress finds: that a substantial number of public \n     water systems are having difficulty meeting the requirements \n     of the Safe Drinking Water Act because of technical and \n     financial limitations and need greater assistance; that \n     modifications in administration of the program could promote \n     a more productive partnership with the States; that the \n     quality of the science supporting drinking water standards \n     needs improvement; and that risk assessment and benefit-cost \n     analysis are important and useful tools to improve the \n     efficiency and effectiveness of drinking water regulations.\n\n\n                 section 3. state revolving loan funds\n\n       The bill establishes a new State Revolving Loan Fund (SRF) \n     program. The Federal Government will provide capitalization \n     grants to State-run SRFs. States will use these funds, along \n     with their own contributions, to make grants and loans to \n     public water systems to facilitate compliance with the Safe \n     Drinking Water Act. The bill includes an authorization of $1 \n     billion per year through 2003 for capitalization grants.\n       The Administrator may enter into an agreement with a State \n     to provide capitalization grants for a Revolving Loan Fund, \n     if the State establishes a loan fund and agrees to \n     conditions, including providing a 20% State match, use of \n     loans in compliance with an intended use plan, and proper \n     financial management.\n       All of the States already operate SRFs for wastewater \n     treatment construction under the Clean Water Act. A State may \n     consolidate management of the new drinking water SRF with its \n     existing clean water loan fund, provided that accounting for \n     drinking water loans and repayments remains separate. A \n     Governor of a State may transfer up to 50 percent of the \n     funds provided to the drinking water loan fund each year to \n     the loan fund authorized under the Clean Water Act. An equal \n     amount may be taken from the clean water fund in a State and \n     transferred to the drinking water fund. The authority to \n     establish priorities for loans and grants to public water \n     systems is to remain with the State agency implementing the \n     drinking water program.\n       In fiscal years 1994 through 1997, funds are allocated \n     among the States based on a grant formula used to allocate \n     funds for Public Water System Supervision (PWSS) grants, a \n     long-standing grant program that provides funds to the States \n     to support administration and enforcement of the existing \n     law. After fiscal year 1998, funds are to be allocated \n     according to a new formula developed by the Administrator \n     based on a survey of drinking water needs in each State. This \n     needs assessment is already underway.\n       In addition to the allocation for States, 1.5% of the \n     Federal grant funds are reserved for Indian tribes and 0.5% \n     of the funds are reserved for territories. Indian tribes, \n     territories, and the District of Columbia may receive direct \n     grants rather than loans.\n       Each State is authorized to reserve up to 2 percent of its \n     grant or $300,000, whichever is greater, to provide technical \n     assistance to small water systems. Assistance may include \n     financial management, planning and design, source water \n     protection programs, system restructuring, and other measures \n     for capacity development or water treatment.\n       Projects eligible to receive loan and grant assistance are \n     capital expenditures for: compliance with national primary \n     drinking water regulations; upgrading of drinking water \n     treatment systems; replacement of private wells where they \n     present a significant health threat; and restructuring of \n     systems and the development of alternative sources of water \n     supply.\n       Drinking water systems eligible for assistance are \n     community water systems (whether publicly or privately owned) \n     and non-community water systems that are owned by a \n\n[[Page S 15123]]\n     government or non-profit organization. States may not provide \n     assistance to systems with a history of noncompliance, unless \n     steps are taken to assure that the system will have the \n     capacity to comply with requirements of the Safe Drinking \n     Water Act over the long term.\n       States may assist disadvantaged communities through grants \n     and forgiveness of loan principal. Each State is to develop \n     its own affordability criteria to determine which public \n     water systems are eligible for grants, rather than loans. \n     States may assist disadvantaged communities by forgiving a \n     part of a loan or by extending the repayment period for a \n     loan to up to 30 years. The total amount of grants and loan \n     forgiveness provided by a State in any fiscal year may not \n     exceed 30% of the amount of its capitalization grant from \n     EPA.\n       Each State may reserve up to 4% of the capitalization grant \n     for administration of the SRF fund. In addition, a State may \n     use a portion of the capitalization grant to support its \n     Public Water System Supervision program. The State may use \n     up to 10 percent of its annual grant to support programs \n     for source water protection and capacity development.\n\n\n             Section 4. Selection of contaminants; schedule\n\n       The Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1986 required EPA \n     to issue standards for 83 specific contaminants by not later \n     than 1989. That work has largely been completed, but EPA has \n     yet to issue new standards for arsenic, sulfate, radon and \n     other radionuclides. The 1986 Amendments also required EPA to \n     establish standards for an additional 25 contaminants every 3 \n     years beginning in 1989. EPA has not issued any standards to \n     comply with this requirement but has proposed regulations for \n     12 disinfection byproducts and for Cryptosporidium in partial \n     fulfillment of this duty. An additional 13 contaminants \n     (Known as the Phase Vib rule) are under study.\n       The bill repeals the requirement that EPA regulate an \n     additional 25 contaminants every 3 years. EPA is required to \n     complete regulations for 12 disinfectants and disinfection \n     byproducts, the Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule and a \n     national primary drinking water regulation for \n     Cryptosporidium.\n       Not later than July 1, 1996, the Administrator is to \n     publish a list of high priority contaminants not currently \n     regulated. EPA is to develop a research plan for each of the \n     listed contaminants to acquire information on health effects \n     and the occurrence of the contaminant sufficient to determine \n     whether the contaminant should be regulated under the Act.\n       Beginning in the year 2001, EPA is required to make a \n     regulatory decision with respect to at least 5 of the listed \n     contaminants every 5 years. EPA may decide that the \n     contaminant should not be regulated, that there is \n     insufficient information to make a determination, or that a \n     maximum contaminant level or treatment technique for the \n     contaminant should be promulgated under the Safe Drinking \n     Water Act. The Administrator is to establish national primary \n     drinking water regulations for those contaminants that occur \n     at concentration level and at frequencies of public health \n     concern.\n\n\n        Section 5. Risk Assessment, management and communication\n\n       The bill requires improvements in the scientific \n     foundations for drinking water standards and better public \n     communication of the potential risks of adverse health \n     effects associated with contaminants in drinking water.\n       The Administrator is to conduct a benefit-cost analysis for \n     each national primary drinking water regulation containing a \n     maximum contaminant level (MCL) or treatment technique before \n     it is proposed. The analysis will also include \n     consideration of alternative MCLs or treatment \n     requirements. The study is to include a determination of \n     the costs and benefits associated with each alternative \n     MCL or treatment technique relative to the other standards \n     under consideration.\n       The analysis is to incorporate information on risks to \n     subgroups that may be at greater risk than the general \n     population for adverse health effects as the result of \n     exposure to the contaminant. The Administrator is to publish \n     and seek comment on the study and is to use an advance notice \n     of proposed rulemaking to seek comment whenever the costs of \n     the national primary drinking water regulation are expected \n     to exceed $75 million.\n\n\n            Section 6. Standard-setting; review of standards\n\n       Standard-setting under the current Safe Drinking Water Act \n     is a two-step process. First, EPA identifies a concentration \n     level for a contaminant below which there will be no adverse \n     effect on human health. This is called the maximum \n     contaminant level goal or MCLG. For cancer-causing \n     substances, the MCLG has always been set at zero.\n       In a second step, EPA sets the actual enforceable standard, \n     called the maximum contaminant level or MCL, as close to the \n     goal as feasible. Feasible means the level that can be \n     reached using the best available treatment technology that is \n     affordable for large, regional drinking water systems.\n       This approach to standard-setting is taken because the \n     majority of Americans (80%) receive their drinking water from \n     large systems and economies of scale in treatment technology \n     make safe water very affordable.\n       On the other hand, this approach to standard setting has \n     caused problems with implementation of the Act. First, \n     standards written under the approach taken by current law can \n     impose very high costs on households served by small systems. \n     Second, for some contaminants that occur at relatively low \n     concentrations and are regulated for their cancer-causing \n     effects with a goal of zero exposure, the current approach \n     has led to high costs per cancer case avoided. And third, \n     treatment techniques employed to reduce the risk from some \n     contaminants may actually increase the health risks posed by \n     other contaminants in drinking water. For instance, \n     chlorination of drinking water to kill pathogenic organisms \n     increases cancer risks from chemicals, called disinfection \n     byproducts, that form in reaction with the chlorine.\n       To address these problems, the bill provides EPA with \n     discretion to consider the benefits and costs and the \n     potential for off-setting health risks associated with \n     proposed standards. In addition to this standard-setting \n     flexibility, the bill amends the variance provisions of the \n     law to ensure that small systems are not required to \n     employ treatment technologies that are unaffordable for \n     their consumers.\n       The bill makes the following changes to the standard \n     setting authority of the Safe Drinking Water Act:\n       1. EPA is authorized to set the maximum contaminant level \n     goal (MCLG) for a contaminant that is a known or probable \n     human carcinogen at a level other than zero, if the \n     Administrator determines that there is a threshold below \n     which there is unlikely to be any increase in cancer risk and \n     the MCLG is set at the threshold level with an adequate \n     margin of safety;\n       2. At the time that the Administrator promulgates a maximum \n     contaminant level (MCL), the Administrator must also publish \n     a determination as to whether the benefits of the MCL justify \n     the costs;\n       3. EPA is authorized to set a maximum contaminant level at \n     other than the level that is as close to the goal as \n     feasible, if application of the treatment techniques at the \n     feasible level would increase health risks from other \n     contaminants; this authority may be used to set the MCL or \n     treatment technique for the contaminant and for other \n     contaminants at a level that minimizes the overall health \n     risk;\n       4. The Administrator is given discretionary authority to \n     establish less stringent standards (than feasible), when the \n     Administrator determines that the benefits of a maximum \n     contaminant level set at the feasible level would not justify \n     the costs to systems that must comply with the standard or \n     the contaminant occurs almost exclusively in small systems; \n     if EPA uses this authority, the standard is to be set at a \n     level that maximizes health risk reduction at a cost that is \n     justified by the benefits;\n       5. The authority to set less stringent standards based on a \n     benefit-cost determination is not available for the \n     regulation of disinfectants and disinfection byproducts (in \n     Stage I or II) or to address the threat of Cryptosporidium; \n     and\n       6. A determination that the health benefits of a standard \n     do or do not justify the costs can only be set aside by a \n     court, if it finds that the Administrator's determination is \n     arbitrary and capricious.\n       The requirement in current law that the Administrator \n     periodically review and revise each national primary drinking \n     water regulation is extended from 3 years (in current law) to \n     6 years. Revision to standards are to maintain or provide for \n     greater protection of human health. Existing standards may \n     only be made less stringent in the future, if new science \n     demonstrates that the current level of health protection can \n     be achieved by a less stringent standard.\n\n\n                           Section 7. Arsenic\n\n       Arsenic is currently regulated under the Safe Drinking \n     Water Act. The MCL is 50 parts per billion. Although arsenic \n     is known human carcinogen by ingestion, the current standard \n     was not established to address this adverse effect. The 1986 \n     Amendments required the arsenic standard to be revised. EPA \n     has not completed this duty because of substantial scientific \n     uncertainty about the cancer-causing effect of arsenic at \n     very low doses. If the arsenic standard were revised based on \n     current policy, the standard might be set as low as 5 parts \n     per billion. A standard at this level may impose unnecessary \n     compliance costs, if there is a threshold for the cancer-\n     causing effect of arsenic that is substantially above this \n     level.\n       This bill allows additional time for research to resolve \n     this scientific uncertainty. The deadline for revising the \n     national primary drinking water regulation for arsenic is \n     delayed until January 1, 2001. The Administrator is to adopt \n     a research plan to resolve the outstanding questions with \n     respect to the carcinogenic effects of low levels of exposure \n     to arsenic within 180 days of enactment. Prior to proposing a \n     revised arsenic standard, the Administrator is to conduct a \n     formal review of the research results and consult with the \n     Science Advisory Board.\n\n\n                            Section 8. Radon\n\n       The Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1986 required EPA \n     to promulgate a national primary drinking water regulation \n     for radon by 1989. EPA proposed a standard at 300 picocuries \n     per liter (pC/L) in 1991. Congress suspended action on this \n     regulation pending a review of the costs and benefits of the \n     drinking water standard relative to other risks from radon in \n     the environment.\n       The bill directs EPA to promulgate a standard for radon not \n     later than 180 days after enactment. The standard is to be \n     established at 3000 pcC/L, a concentration that \n\n[[Page S 15124]]\n     will reduce the health risks from radon in drinking water caused by \n     inhalation (breathing radon that evaporates from water) to \n     levels commensurate with risks from radon in outdoor air.\n       Under the provisions of the bill, EPA may subsequently \n     revise the standard, but only if the Administrator \n     determines, and the National Academy of Sciences and the \n     Science Advisory Board concur, that revision is appropriate \n     to address risks from ingestion (swallowing radon in the \n     drinking water). The revised standard is to be no more \n     stringent than necessary to reduce the combined inhalation \n     and ingestion risk from radon to a level equivalent to the \n     inhalation risk from radon in outdoor air at the national \n     average level.\n\n\n                           section 9. sulfate\n\n       The 1986 Amendments required EPA to establish a standard \n     for sulfate. EPA has not completed this duty for two reasons. \n     First, scientific information is not sufficient to determine \n     the dose-response relationship for sulfate with a high degree \n     of confidence. Second, because persons become quickly \n     acclimated to sulfate in their drinking water, the adverse \n     health effect from sulfate exposure (diarrhea) is experienced \n     primarily by travelers, new residents and infants. In a rule \n     proposed by EPA in December, 1994, the preferred option to \n     protect these special populations relies on bottled water and \n     public education.\n       The bill authorizes the Administrator to use public \n     education and alternative water supplies (bottled water), \n     rather than centralized treatment, to reduce the costs of a \n     national primary drinking water regulation for sulfate. The \n     Administrator is directed to complete a rulemaking for \n     sulfate not later than 2 years after enactment.\n       The maximum contaminant level for sulfate promulgated under \n     the Safe Drinking Water Act is not to be used by the \n     Administrator for ground water remediation decisions under \n     CERCLA or RCRA, unless the Administrator engages in a \n     separate rulemaking under the authority of those statutes to \n     establish a remediation standard for sulfate.\n\n\n  section 10. technology and treatment techniques; technology centers\n\n       At the time that the Administrator promulgates a national \n     primary drinking water regulation, the bill directs EPA to \n     identify the treatment technologies that are feasible for \n     systems of various sizes, including systems serving: between \n     3,300 and 10,000 persons; between 500 and 3,300 persons; and \n     between 25 and 500 persons. The list of feasible technologies \n     may also include package units for small systems and point of \n     entry treatment equipment.\n       The Administrator is directed to make grants to \n     institutions of higher education to establish no fewer than 5 \n     centers that will provide training and technical assistance \n     to small public water systems. Appropriations of $10 million \n     per year through the year 2003 are authorized for this \n     purpose.\n\n\n                section 11. filtration and disinfection\n\n       The 1986 Amendments required EPA to issue rules requiring \n     filtration for all systems served by surface water sources \n     and disinfection by all systems. The Surface Water Treatment \n     Rule implemented the filtration and disinfection requirements \n     for systems served by surface water sources and became \n     effective in 1991. The disinfection requirement for systems \n     served by ground water sources has not been promulgated.\n       The bill postpones promulgation of rules for the \n     disinfection of drinking water from ground water sources \n     until the Stage II rule for disinfectants and disinfection \n     byproducts is issued. This will ensure that potential risks \n     from disinfection byproducts are balanced with the benefits \n     of disinfecting ground water supplies. The Administrator is \n     authorized, in consultation with the States, to develop \n     criteria to be applied by the States to determine which \n     systems relying on ground water sources are to use \n     disinfection.\n       The Administrator is directed to publish guidance to \n     accompany the proposal of the Enhanced Surface Water \n     Treatment Rule that identifies filtration technologies that \n     are feasible for public water systems relying on surface \n     water serving fewer than 3,300 persons.\n\n\n               section 12. effective date for regulations\n\n       Section 1412(b)(1)) of current law is amended to require \n     compliance with national primary drinking water regulations \n     no later than 3 years after promulgation (extended from 18 \n     months under current law). The compliance deadline can be \n     extended for up to 2 years in general (by the Administrator) \n     or for a particular public water system (by a State), if it \n     is determined that additional time is needed for the capital \n     improvement projects that will be necessary to meet new \n     treatment requirements.\n\n\n                  section 13. variances and exemptions\n\n       Public water systems may get a variance from a national \n     primary drinking water regulation under current law, if the \n     quality of their source water makes it impossible to comply \n     with the MCL even when best available treatment technology is \n     employed. However, under current law the variance may only be \n     granted after the best available treatment system has been \n     installed and has failed to achieve the standard. This \n     approach does not provide certainty for public water systems, \n     because it forces investments in costly treatment plants, \n     before the system can be assured that the investment will \n     allow the system to come into compliance with the Act. The \n     bill modifies the variance authority allowing public water \n     systems to receive a variance on the condition that they \n     install and operate best available treatment technology.\n\n\n                       section 14. small systems\n\n       The bill also modifies the variance provisions of the Act \n     to authorize variances for small systems that cannot afford \n     to comply with national primary drinking water regulations.\n       This new variance authority is to be exercised by the \n     States. A State may grant the owner or operator of a public \n     drinking water system serving 10,000 or fewer persons a \n     variance from compliance with a maximum contaminant level \n     or treatment technique of a national primary drinking \n     water regulation if a system cannot afford to comply with \n     the regulation and adequate protection of public health is \n     ensured. The variance is to provide for the use of the \n     best available treatment technology that is affordable for \n     small systems.\n       A system that applies for a variance from a regulation \n     under this subsection is not subject to enforcement for a \n     violation of the regulation, until a variance is either \n     granted or denied. If a variance is granted, the system has \n     up to 3 years to comply with the terms of the variance. The \n     variance is in effect for 5 years and reviewed every 5 years \n     thereafter. A person who is served by the system seeking a \n     variance may petition the Administrator to object to the \n     granting of a variance, if the provisions of the variance are \n     not in compliance with the Act.\n       A variance is not available for any contaminant regulated \n     before January 1, 1986 or for an MCL or treatment technique \n     intended to reduce the risks from pathogenic organisms in \n     drinking water.\n\n\n           section 15. capacity development; finance centers\n\n       There are more than 200,000 public water systems in the \n     United States. Some small systems, most often those owned and \n     operated by groups of homeowners or other non-governmental \n     entities, do not have the technical, financial or managerial \n     capacity to comply with the requirements of the Safe Drinking \n     Water Act. The bill includes several provisions to assist \n     these systems to improve capacity.\n       Within 4 years of enactment, each State is to develop and \n     implement a capacity development strategy to assist public \n     water systems that do not have the technical, managerial and \n     financial capacity. The drinking water primacy agency in the \n     State is to report to the Governor 2 years after the strategy \n     is adopted and every 3 years thereafter on progress toward \n     improving the technical, financial and managerial capacity of \n     public water systems in the State.\n       Each State is to obtain the legal authority or other means \n     to prevent the startup of new public water systems that do \n     not have the technical, managerial or financial capacity to \n     comply with the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act. \n     States that have not adopted this authority lose 5% of their \n     SRF grant in 1999, 10% in 2000 and 15% each year thereafter.\n       Within 1 year, each State is to prepare a list of public \n     water systems that are in significant noncompliance with the \n     requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act. The State is to \n     report on its efforts to bring such systems into compliance, \n     through capacity development or enforcement actions, 5 years \n     after enactment.\n       Grants to the existing network of Environmental Finance \n     Centers are authorized at $2.5 million per year through the \n     year 2003. The Centers are directed to establish a capacity \n     development clearinghouse for public water systems.\n\n\n           section 16. operator and laboratory certification\n\n       Each community water system or nontransient noncommunity \n     system receiving assistance from a State Revolving Loan Fund \n     is to be operated by a trained and certified operator. The \n     Administrator is to initiate a partnership with the States to \n     develop recommendations regarding operator certification and \n     to publish information for the States to use in designing \n     training programs. The determination as to the level of \n     training necessary to receive certification is to remain with \n     the States.\n       If a system that has received assistance is operated by a \n     person who is not certified, the Administrator is to withhold \n     funds from the SRF capitalization grant of the State in an \n     amount equal to the assistance that was provided to the \n     system. Systems receiving assistance for the first time are \n     to make a commitment to train operators before new treatment \n     equipment supported by SRF loans or grants goes into \n     operation.\n       The Administrator's guidance may also cover certification \n     for laboratories that perform testing to meet the monitoring \n     requirements of national primary drinking water regulations.\n\n\n        section 17. source water quality protection partnerships\n\n       As currently written, the Safe Drinking Water Act focuses \n     principally on monitoring and treatment of drinking water to \n     protect public health. Although the 1986 Amendments added \n     pollution prevention provisions for sole source aquifers and \n     the areas around wellfields for public systems, protecting \n     the quality of source water to avoid the expense of treating \n     contaminated water has not been \n\n[[Page S 15125]]\n     a major part of the national program. Building on the lessons from the \n     wellhead protection efforts made under the 1986 Amendments, \n     the bill authorizes a new source water quality protection \n     partnership program to encourage the development of locally-\n     driven, voluntary incentive-based efforts by public water \n     systems, local governments and private parties to respond to \n     contamination problems that would otherwise require \n     treatment.\n       The bill provides for the delineation of source water \n     protection areas for each public water system and, for \n     priority source water areas, vulnerability assessments. The \n     delineations and assessments are to be completed within 60 \n     months, but may be conducted on a priority-based schedule to \n     the extent that Federal funds are insufficient to pay for the \n     delineations and assessments.\n       States may establish source water quality partnership \n     petition programs. The purpose of a State program is to \n     identify voluntary, incentive-based source protection \n     measures to protect drinking water from contamination and \n     to redirect Federal and State financial and technical \n     assistance to support those measures.\n       Public water systems and local governments (in partnership \n     with other persons who may be affected by these measures) \n     many submit a petition to the State seeking assistance to \n     carry out the recommendations of the partnership.\n       Petitions may only address contaminants that are subject to \n     promulgated or proposed regulations and that are detected at \n     levels that are not reliably and consistently below the \n     maximum contaminant level.\n       State may use up to 10% of their annual SRF grants to \n     provide loans for projects that are recommended by petitions \n     approved under this program.\n\n\n                section 18. state primacy; state funding\n\n       Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, EPA establishes drinking \n     water quality standards that apply to all public water \n     systems. Assuring compliance with these standards is a task \n     achieved almost entirely by the States. Each State that \n     submits a regulation that is no less stringent than the \n     Federal standard is granted primary enforcement \n     responsibility. 49 States have primacy for most regulations \n     that have been issued under the Act.\n       Under current law, the deadline for submitting State \n     regulations to retain primacy for new or revised drinking \n     water standards is 18 months. That deadline is extended to 24 \n     months. In addition, the bill provides States with \n     ``interim'' primary enforcement authority during the period \n     after the State regulation is submitted until such time as it \n     is approved or disapproved by the Administrator. The State \n     regulation is effective during this interim period.\n       EPA makes an annual grant to each State to support its \n     enforcement efforts. The bill reauthorizes the grants for the \n     Public Water System Supervision (PWSS) program at $100 \n     million per year through the year 2003. In addition, States \n     are authorized (under part G) to set aside funds from their \n     SRF grants in amounts up to the amount the PWSS grant to use \n     in administration of the PWSS program.\n\n\n            section 19. monitoring and information gathering\n\n       Each national primary drinking water regulation includes \n     monitoring requirements to assure continuing compliance with \n     the maximum contaminant level. These monitoring requirements \n     impose substantial costs on pubic water systems. The bill \n     requires the Administrator to review and revise existing \n     monitoring requirements for not fewer than 12 contaminants \n     within 2 years.\n       The bill authorizes States to develop and implement their \n     own monitoring regime for each containment. The State \n     requirements may be less stringent than Federal requirements \n     but are to assure compliance and enforcement. This authority \n     takes effect after the first cycle of monitoring under \n     Federal regulations. The authority does not apply to \n     contaminants that are pathogenic organisms. The State program \n     must provide for monitoring at a frequency consistent with \n     Federal requirements in systems where a contaminant has been \n     detected, unless monitoring indicates that the level of the \n     contaminant is reliably and consistently below the maximum \n     contaminant level. The Administrator may act to approve or \n     disapprove a State alternative monitoring program within 180 \n     days of submission or may withdraw a State's authority to \n     establish monitoring requirements, if the State program does \n     not assure compliance and enforcement.\n       The Administrator or a State may suspend quarterly \n     monitoring requirements applicable to small systems for any \n     contaminant (other than a pathogenic organism or a \n     contaminant that causes an acute effect, or a contaminant \n     formed in the treatment or distribution system) that is not \n     detected during the first quarterly sample in a monitoring \n     cycle.\n       The Administrator is to establish a program of monitoring \n     for the presence of contaminants which may warrant regulation \n     in the future. The Administrator may list up to 20 \n     contaminants. All systems serving more than 10,000 persons \n     would be required to monitor for these contaminants. Each \n     State would establish monitoring requirements for these \n     contaminants for a representative sample of small systems \n     within the State. An annual appropriation of $10 million is \n     authorized to offset the costs of this monitoring. In \n     addition, the Administrator may set aside $2 million per year \n     of any appropriation for the State Revolving Fund to pay for \n     testing costs associated with monitoring at small systems.\n       The Administrator is to establish a national database \n     containing information on monitoring for regulated and \n     unregulated contaminants.\n\n\n                    Section 20. Public notification\n\n       Public water systems are required to notify their consumers \n     when the system violates important public health provisions \n     of the Act. The bill revises these requirements for public \n     notification. The new requirements provide for immediate \n     notification when a violation presents a serious threat to \n     public health; written notification not less often than \n     annually of violations of maximum contaminant levels or \n     treatment technique requirements; and publication by the \n     State of an annual report summarizing the status of \n     compliance with the State.\n       States are authorized to modify the form and content of \n     public notices to reflect the health threat posed by a \n     violation and to ensure that the public understands the \n     threat.\n\n\n                section 21. enforcement; judicial review\n\n       Enforcement actions to correct violations of the Act can be \n     taken both by EPA and by a State with primary enforcement \n     responsibility. Several modifications to the enforcement \n     authorities of the Act are made by the bill.\n       The Administrator is directed to notify local elected \n     officials before taking enforcement actions against public \n     water systems in non-primacy States.\n       The Administrator or a State is authorized to suspend \n     enforcement action with respect to a violation for a period \n     of 2 years, if the violation is to be corrected through a \n     consolidation or a restructuring during that period.\n       States are to adopt administrative penalties (of at least \n     $1000 per violation for large systems) to facilitate \n     enforcement of the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n       The maximum amount for an administrative penalty imposed by \n     EPA is increased from $5000 to $25,000 per violation. \n     Penalties in this amount may only be imposed after a full on-\n     the-record hearing.\n\n\n                      section 22. federal agencies\n\n       The Federal facilities provision of the Act is amended to \n     clearly waive the sovereign immunity of Federal agencies and \n     to allow citizens and States to seek penalties for all \n     violations of the Act at Federal facilities.\n\n\n                          section 23. research\n\n       The general research authorities are clarified and an \n     authorization of $25 million is provided for each fiscal year \n     to 2003. In addition, the Administrator is authorized to set \n     aside $10 million per year from appropriations for the State \n     Revolving Fund for the research on the health effects of \n     drinking water contaminants with priority given to research \n     on Cryptosporidium, disinfection byproducts, arsenic and \n     research on subpopulations at greater risk for adverse \n     effects. The bill includes new research programs for \n     interactive risks of pathogenic organisms and the \n     disinfection and disinfectant byproducts that result from \n     efforts to control the pathogens and for risks to \n     subpopulations that may be more sensitive to particular \n     contaminants than the general population.\n\n\n                        section 24. definitions\n\n       The definition of ``public water system'' is modified to \n     include some systems that provide water by means other than a \n     piped system (such as irrigation systems). The \n     modification would exclude from regulation those \n     connections to non-piped systems where alternative water \n     supplies or treatment to levels that are equivalent to \n     national primary drinking water regulations is provided \n     before the water is used for drinking or cooking.\n       Definitions for `community water system' and `noncommunity \n     water system' are added to the law and the definitions of \n     `State' and `Indian tribes' are modified.\n\n\n                  section 25. ground water protection\n\n       The Administrator is authorized to make grants to the \n     States to support general ground water protection programs. \n     Federal grants may not be used for more than 50% of the cost \n     of the program. The bill authorizations $20 million per year \n     through 2003 for this grant program.\n       Grants to support State administration of the Underground \n     Injection Control (UIC) program under part C are reauthorized \n     through the year 2003 at $20.85 million per year.\n       Grants to support the wellhead protection program \n     established by section 1428 are reauthorized through the year \n     2003 at $35 million per year.\n       Grants to support the critical aquifer protection program \n     under section 1427 are reauthorized at $20 million per year \n     through 2003. In addition, section 1427 is amended to reopen \n     the grant application period.\n       The Administrator is to conduct a study of the extent and \n     seriousness of contamination of private sources of drinking \n     water not regulated under this Act and, within 3 years of the \n     date of enactment, provide a report to the Congress \n     describing the findings of the study and recommendations for \n     needed actions.\n\n\n        section 26. lead plumbing, pipes and pumps; return flows\n\n       Section 1417 is amended to ban the sale of pipe, plumbing \n     fittings and plumbing fixtures that do not meet voluntary \n     standards for lead leaching rates established by the National \n     Sanitation Foundation within 2 years of enactment. If NSF \n     fails to set lead leaching limits and establish testing \n     protocols for \n\n[[Page S 15126]]\n     these items, the Administrator is authorized to set standards.\n       Section 3013 of P.L. 102-486 encouraging the use of heat \n     pumps that return water to the distribution lines of public \n     water systems is repealed.\n\n\n                       section 27. bottled water\n\n       The Secretary of Health and Human Services is directed to \n     establish regulations for the quality of bottled water for \n     each contaminant for which a national primary drinking water \n     regulation is issued, unless the Secretary determines that \n     the contaminant is unlikely to present a risk to health \n     through bottled water. The regulations are to be issued \n     within 180 days after the tap water standard and are to be no \n     less stringent than the standards that apply to tap water \n     (drinking water supplied by public water systems).\n\n\n   Section 28. Assessing environmental priorities, costs and benefits\n\n       The Administrator is directed to identify and rank sources \n     of pollution with respect to the relative degree of risk to \n     public health and the environment. The Administrator is to \n     evaluate the public costs associated with each source of \n     pollution and the costs of complying with regulations \n     designed to protect against risks caused by the pollution. \n     The Administrator is to periodically report to Congress on \n     the assessments conducted under this section. The \n     Administrator's rankings and assessments of benefits and \n     costs are to be reviewed by the Science Advisory Board.\n\n\n                      Section 29. Other Amendments\n\n       The Chief of the Army Corps of Engineers is authorized to \n     modernize the Washington Aqueduct that provides drinking \n     water to the District of Columbia and several Virginia \n     cities.\n       A requirement in section 1450 of current law for an annual \n     report to the Congress on the activities of the Administrator \n     is deleted.\n       Membership on the National Drinking Water Advisory Council \n     is modified to include 2 members representing small, rural \n     water systems.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues to \nintroduce this bill to reauthorize the Safe Drinking Water Act. \nEnacting this legislation is a high priority for the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. The bipartisan agreement that supports this \nbill gives us a great chance to achieve that goal.\n  We all agree that reform of the Safe Drinking Water Act is necessary. \nPublic health protection has been strengthened by the many new \nstandards that have been issued over the past few years. But the pace \nof standard setting and the costs of new treatment and monitoring \nrequirements have been a strain for water suppliers, especially smaller \ncommunities.\n  This bill includes many provisions to ease the burden. There is the \nnew grant program for drinking water revolving loan funds that \nPresident Clinton first recommended. States are authorized to reduce \nmonitoring costs by developing their own testing requirements tailored \nto conditions in their region. Under this bill, States may also grant \nvariances to the small systems that cannot afford to comply with the \nnational standard.\n  That's reform, but we're not rolling back health protection which is \nnow provided. No existing standard will be weakened. And the bill \nincludes many new initiatives that will keep the national program \nmoving forward. In addition to the SRF grants, there are new programs \nto prevent pollution of source waters used for drinking water supply. \nThere is a program to develop technical capacity at small systems. The \nbill pushes hard for more and better science, including a research \nprogram to determine whether some groups like children or pregnant \nwomen or people with particular illnesses are more likely to experience \nadverse effects from drinking water contaminants. EPA will continue to \nreview new contaminants and to make decisions on the need for national \nstandards.\n  I want to thank each of my colleagues for the hard work they have put \nin on this bill. The star of this performance has been Senator \nKempthorne. He has spent months going over every detail of the \nlegislation. And Senator Baucus blazed the trail for us last year with \nhis bill that passed the Senate with almost unanimous support. My thank \nyou also extends to the Water Office at EPA and to the coalition of \nState and local drinking water organizations that have worked so long \nand hard on this bill. Their expertise has been available at every step \nand has been very helpful.\n  I look forward to quick action by the committee and by the Senate on \nthis bipartisan bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President. For several months now there has been tough \nbipartisan negotiation to find common ground on the Safe Drinking Water \nAct. We began with S. 2019 which the Senate passed last Congress. Now, \nhowever, we have industry and State and local governments expressing in \nlegislative language their need for more local control drinking water \nsystems. I am cosponsoring this bill for two primary reasons.\n  First, there has been a great deal of compromise on both sides. Not \neveryone will be happy with some elements in this bill; both sides \nspent many hours working out the direction and the particulars of this \nbill. I am convinced that if this deliberative bipartisan process is \ngoing to produce legislation then this is how it will be done--through \nrational discussion and by taking the time to work out the \ndisagreements. Through this process reasonable legislation will be \npassed out of the Senate.\n  And second, I am convinced that if we are going to pass a safe \ndrinking water bill this year, then given the process and the bill \nbefore us, we need to proceed further in the bipartisan effort. My \nprinciple concern is whether there will be safe drinking water in the \ntaps of homes across the country; whether the contaminants will be \nmonitored sufficiently to warn our communities; and whether there will \nbe accountability in a process so essential to the health and well \nbeing of our citizens. As I noted, this bill contains a great deal of \ncompromise, but I believe that what we have all been able to maintain \nis the integrity of the goals and the mechanics of safe drinking water.\n  The EPA would still have the vital responsibility of regulating \ncontaminants and setting standards while allowing for increased \nflexibility in implementing the regulations by the state and local \nwater systems. A State revolving fund will be established to assist the \nStates and rural systems. These and other provisions of the bill \nunderscore the very deliberative compromise that has evolved. Perfect \nshould not be an enemy to the good and looking for a perfect bill will \nnot serve our constituents if we pass up a bill that will serve our \ncommunities well.\n  I commend Senators Chafee and Kempthorne for their willingness to \nwork together in this vital purpose. I appreciate Senator Baucus' \nleadership as the ranking member of the full Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is a solid bill. It builds on the \nwork that was done, during the last Congress, to reform the Safe \nDrinking Water Act. It will reduce regulatory burdens while fully \nprotecting public health. And it reflects a careful, bipartisan \napproach that puts the public interest ahead of partisan politics.\n\n\n                               background\n\n  The Safe Drinking Water Act has guided Federal, State, and local \nefforts to assure that the water Americans drink is clean and pure. In \nthe last several years, however, there has been growing concern that \nsome provisions of the act misdirect Federal resources. There also has \nbeen concern that the act imposes regulatory burdens that local water \nsystems simply can't comply with, no matter how hard they try. More \nspecifically, critics of the act point to several flaws:\n  Unlike the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act does not \nprovide federal financial assistance to help local water systems meet \nenvironmental mandates.\n  Small drinking water systems, including many small systems in my home \nState of Montana, have faced the greatest challenges in complying with \nthe act's numerous and complex mandates.\n  The limited economies of scale of small systems have caused household \nwater rates to skyrocket in recent years as communities financed \ndrinking water projects.\n  Contaminant monitoring requirements have been overly prescriptive, \nand the requirement to regulate 25 new contaminants every 3 years is \nunrealistic and unnecessary.\n  The enforcement and public notification provisions are inadequate.\n  During the last Congress, the Environment and Public Works Committee \nunanimously reported legislation to reform the Safe Drinking Water Act, \nand \n\n[[Page S 15127]]\nthe Senate passed the legislation by a vote of 95 to 3. Unfortunately, \nthe bill was not enacted into law.\n\n\n             The Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1995\n\n  The bill that we are introducing today builds on the solid foundation \ncreated by last year's bill. The bill addresses each of the concerns \nwith Safe Drinking Water Act. The bill expands funding, reduces \nregulatory burdens, and provides greater flexibility to those trying to \nprovide safe drinking for all Americans--while not only maintaining but \nincreasing public health protection.\n  To begin with, the bill provides substantial and sustained funding \nfor drinking water projects. The bill authorizes new drinking water \nloan funds. Moreover, the bill allows a State to use its existing Clean \nWater Act loan fund to meet drinking water needs and, if appropriate, \nto use the drinking water loan funds to meet Clean Water Act needs. \nAnd, in some cases, the bill allows States to give a public water \nsystem a grant rather than a loan. That way, a State can provide \nspecial assistance to small, disadvantaged communities that have a \nparticularly hard time providing safe drinking water at an affordable \ncost.\n  The bill reduces regulatory burdens, especially for small \ncommunities. It does so in several ways. Most significantly, the bill \neliminates the requirement that EPA regulate 25 new contaminants every \n3 years, whether or not there is a public health need to do so. \nInstead, EPA will review the health effects of currently unregulated \ncontaminants in drinking water and determine whether, based on sound \nscience, those contaminants pose public health threats and should be \nregulated. In other words, the bill reforms the act by allowing EPA to \ntarget resources to the greatest threats to drinking water.\n  The bill increases State flexibility. It authorizes a State to \nestablish its own program for monitoring drinking water quality, and to \nreduce some monitoring requirements for small drinking water systems \nthat have good compliance records. And it allows a State to take other \nsteps to address the special needs of small communities. In Montana and \nelsewhere, the operators of small drinking water systems want to comply \nwith the act, but cannot afford the cost of complying with many of the \nregulations. The bill's variance provision will allow small systems to \nprovide safe, affordable water to their customers.\n  So the bill reduces regulatory burdens, and increases flexibility, in \nmany ways. But in doing so, it does not relax existing standards or \nweaken provisions of the Act that are necessary to protect public \nhealth. In fact, in addition to allowing EPA, States, and local \ncommunities to target resources to the greatest threats, the bill \nimproves the act's enforcement and compliance provisions. And it \nimproves the important provisions that require water system operators \nto alert people about drinking water problems in their communities, \nespecially problems that create health threats.\n  Putting all this together, the bill significantly reduces regulatory \nburdens and otherwise improves the operation of the Safe Drinking Water \nAct. At the same time, it not only maintains but increases public \nhealth protection.\n\n\n                         A BIPARTISAN APPROACH\n\n  Mr. President, during this Congress, most debates about the \nenvironment have deteriorated into partisan battles. As a result, we \nhave missed the opportunity to develop a consensus, a support of \nreforms that reduce regulatory burdens while improving environmental \nprotection.\n  This bill that we are introducing today is a refreshing exception. \nRepublicans and Democrats have worked together, cooperatively. There \nhas been compromise, and nobody got everything that they wanted.\n  This process has not been an easy one. It's taken time, and it's \ntaken painstaking negotiation. But because we have taken a bipartisan, \ncooperative approach, we have been able to develop a bill that will \nattract widespread support and can, I believe, quickly be enacted into \nlaw.\n  I very much appreciate the leadership and hard work of the committee \nchairman, Senator Chafee, the subcommittee chairman, Senator \nKempthorne, and the subcommittee ranking member, Senator Reid. I look \nforward to working with them as we move forward to reform the Safe \nDrinking Water Act.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this moment comes only after hours of hard \nwork by Chairman Chafee, Senator Kempthorne, Senator Baucus, and \nSenator Reid. I want to take this opportunity to thank them for all of \ntheir commitment to this much needed reauthorization. Coming to \nagreement on this bill has not been easy. It is the product of many \ndifferent points of view and carries important public health protection \nwhile providing reasonable regulatory relief for small communities.\n  Last year I became involved in the safe drinking water discussion \nbecause it is critical to the State of Nebraska. Ninety percent of our \npublic water systems serve communities that are 2,500 or less in \npopulation. Those communities need and deserve flexibility to achieve \nthe safest water possible for their citizens. This bill strikes an even \nbalance between providing States with flexibility and the ability to \naffect decisionmaking; and allowing EPA to provide guidance and \nregulation.\n  I am an advocate of cost-benefit analysis which this bill contains. \nIt allows public water systems to allocate their limited resources to \nthose contaminants that will cause the greatest threat to public \nhealth. I know the concept is a tough one to write into legislation and \nI expect there will be some, including me, that want to make small \nchanges. Overall, I have to say the language looks fair and I believe \nthis bill achieves a carefully crafted balance.\n  For the last 2 years I have led the fight to keep EPA from publishing \na drinking water standard for radon. The reason I did this is because \nthe known health threat for radon is through inhalation, not ingestion. \nThe greatest public threat from radon in drinking water is when you're \nin the shower. If left to the current process for setting standards, \nEPA would set the level for radon well below the level found in the air \noutside. The result of that standard would cost Nebraska's communities \nmillions. I am quite pleased to see that the bill includes language \nthat provides a permanent fix for the radon in drinking water issue.\n  The Safe Drinking Water Act exists to protect public health. In \nreviewing how EPA sets standards I saw a need to involve the Department \nof Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control. This \nbill includes an active role for HHS and I strongly support that. In \nfact, I would like to see a larger role for HHS and I'm willing to work \nwith the chairman on that point.\n  Again, I would like to thank Chairman Chafee, Senators Kempthorne, \nBaucus, and Reid and let them know that I am committed to helping them \nsee this bill pass as quickly as possible. It is important to \nNebraskans and all Americans.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n        Johnston, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Mack, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Dole, and \n        Mr. Lott):\n  S. 1317. A bill to repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act of \n1935, to enact the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1995, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n             the public utility holding company act of 1995\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today I introduce the Public Utility \nHolding Company Act of 1995. I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues \non the Banking Committee, Senators Shelby, Mack, Faircloth, and Dodd; \nthe chairman and ranking member of the Energy Committee, Senators \nMurkowski and Johnston respectively; and Senate Majority Leader Dole \nand Majority Whip Lott as sponsors of the bill.\n  Mr. President, this bill would repeal the Public Utility Holding \nCompany Act of 1935 (``the 1935 Act'') and transfer certain regulatory \nfunctions from the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission and the Public Service Commissions of \nvarious States. The bill is supported by the SEC, the energy industry, \nand Senators on both sides of the aisle.\n  In June, the SEC published a comprehensive report on the 1935 Act. In \nthat report, ``The Regulation of Public-\n\n[[Page S 15128]]\nUtility Holding Companies,'' the division of investment management \nstated that:\n\n       The 1935 Act had accomplished its basic purpose and that \n     its remaining provisions . . . either duplicated other State \n     or Federal regulation or otherwise were no longer necessary \n     to prevent recurrence of the abuses that led to its \n     enactment.\n\n  The SEC Division of Investment Management reviewed the history of the \n1935 act and the energy industry along with other subsequent \nadministrative and legislative changes. The report's recommendation \nsuggests that Congress conditionally repeal the act since the current \nregulatory system imposes significant costs, in direct administrative \ncharges and foregone economies of scale and scope, that often cannot be \njustified in terms of benefits to utility investors.\n  In recommending a conditional repeal, the SEC noted that \nunconditional repeal of the 1935 act could expose consumers to some of \nthe same abuses that it was enacted to prevent. As SEC Chairman, Arthur \nLevitt, cautions:\n\n       [A]s long as electric and gas utilities continue to \n     function as monopolies, the need to protect against the \n     cross-subsidization of nonutility operations will continue to \n     exist . . . the best means of guarding against cross-\n     subsidization is likely to be thorough audits of books and \n     records and federal oversight of affiliate transactions.\n\n  Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today, the Public Utility \nCompany Act of 1995, would maintain the provisions of the 1935 act \nessential to consumer protection.\n  This bill would eliminate many of these burdensome and duplicative \nregulations while maintaining protection for energy consumers and \nratepayers. For example, this legislation would allow holding companies \nto diversify into new business ventures. Diversification into utility \nor non utility business will increase competition and increase the flow \nof capital as non utility companies are able to enter into joint \nventures with holding companies. Also, the integration requirements of \nthe 1935 act, which prohibit any registered holding company from owning \nutility companies in more than one State, would be eliminated. \nPermitting ownership of utility companies in more than one state would \nallow holding companies to achieve greater efficiencies and lower \nadministrative costs. The resulting savings can be passed on to \nconsumers in lower energy rates.\n  The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1995 provides State and \nFederal regulators with the necessary authority to examine books and \nrecords and conduct audits of public utility companies. It is important \nthat the States be given the authority to examine the books and records \nof public utilities and be given the authority to examine the books and \nrecords of public utilities and their affiliates, to make sure that \nretail electricity rates are set fairly and that the cost of other \nventures are not passed on to the captive utility rate payer. To be \ncertain that this burden does not fall on the States alone, the FERC \nwill share this function.\n  Transferring ratemaking functions to the States and the FERC also \neliminates the regulatory gap created by the Supreme Court's Ohio Power \ndecision, which effectively stripped the FERC of its authority to \nregulate holding company wholesale rate increases.\n  Mr. President, this bill puts in place the proper consumer safeguards \nto protect electric and gas utility ratepayers and stockholders from \nbearing the costs of diversification by registered holding companies.\n  Mr. President, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 has \nachieved the original congressional purpose--it broke up the mammoth \nholding company structures that existed more than half a century ago. \nThe registration and disclosure requirements of the Securities Act of \n1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 have become effective \ntools for the SEC to protect investors and ensure the integrity of the \nmarket for public utility holding company securities. Further, State \nPublic Service Commissions have become effective retail energy \nregulators, who can protect their ratepayers.\n  Presently, only 11 electric utility companies and 9 gas companies are \nsubject to the 1935 act; approximately 100 companies are exempt. The 20 \nregistered utility companies are also regulated by States and the FERC. \nThe same provisions that were originally enacted to protect consumers \nand investors have become unnecessary impediments to business. For \nexample, to ensure that holding companies do not further abuse power, \nthe 1935 act requires that the SEC give prior approval to all utility \nacquisitions. However, these acquisitions are subject to FERC and State \napproval, as well as that of the SEC, and are reviewed to comply with \nantitrust laws. This duplicative approval system often delays the \nacquisition of a new company for months or years, while providing no \nadded protection to consumers.\n  Mr. President, the Banking Committee has consulted the Energy \nCommittee, the SEC and the FERC as well as industry and consumer \nrepresentatives in crafting this legislation to make sure appropriate \nregulatory authority is maintained in a new legal framework that allows \nholding companies to participate in new ventures and diversify without \nnegative consequences to utility customers.\n  The Banking Committee intends to hold hearings on this legislation in \nthe near future. Although some would like to tie Public Utility Holding \nCompany Act reform to other more controversial energy-related issues, \nthe time for this legislation is now. The repeal of the 1935 act will \nincrease competition in the public utility industry without \ncompromising investor and consumer protection. I urge my colleagues' \nsupport.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to cosponsor Senator D'Amato's \nlegislation to reform the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is long overdue. The Public Utility \nHolding Company Act was enacted 60 years ago to curb serious abuses by \npublic utilities that harmed consumers. PUHCA was needed in the 1930's, \nbut now we live in a different world. By limiting activities and \nrestricting corporate structure, PUHCA denies the companies that \ngenerate and sell electricity the flexibility necessary to respond to \nchanging consumer needs and market circumstances. This legislation will \neliminate unnecessary and costly regulation, retaining only that which \nis still needed to protect consumers.\n  Over the past 60 years a comprehensive State-Federal regulatory \nsystem has been developed to protect consumers. In a nutshell, State \npublic utility commissions regulate transactions that are intrastate in \nnature, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates those \nthat are interstate in nature.\n  State public utility commissions perform their regulatory activities \npursuant to State law, and the FERC performs its pursuant to the \nFederal Power Act. With the maturity of both State and Federal utility \nregulation--along with mature securities regulation by the Securities \nand Exchange Commission--PUHCA is now redundant at best.\n  In this connection, it should be noted that in some instances PUHCA \nis counterproductive, actually interfering with effective utility rate \nregulation by the FERC. For example, in Ohio Power a Federal court held \nthat the SEC's utility decisions under PUHCA preempt the FERC's \nauthority over utility rates under the Federal Power Act. This \nlegislation addresses that issue by giving the FERC clear and exclusive \nauthority to address matters within its statutory jurisdiction. In \nshort, the streamlining of the regulatory system proposed by this \nlegislation will not diminish needed consumer protection. It will \nenhance it instead. If the regulatory system created by PUHCA \nbenefitted consumers, then the regulatory burdens it imposes might be \njustified. But as everyone now acknowledges, PUHCA is no longer needed \nto protect consumers. There is adequate and comprehensive regulatory \nauthority in other laws. As a result, regulatory costs caused by PUHCA \nare simply passed on to consumers as higher rates without any \noffsetting consumer benefits.\n  Congress and the executive branch have long recognized that PUHCA \ncreates serious regulatory problems, but up to now these problems have \nbeen addressed piecemeal. In 1978, the Public Utility Regulatory \nPolicies Act provided an exemption from PUHCA for \n\n[[Page S 15129]]\ncertain types of electric power generators. In 1992, the Energy Policy \nAct gave additional exemptions to certain other types of electric power \ngenerators. The SEC is loosening its restrictions on non-utility \nactivities as much as it can within the bounds of PUHCA. And the \nCongress is currently considering PUHCA exemptions to allow registered \nelectric utilities to enter the telecommunications business, just the \nsame as non-registered utilities.\n  These are all Band-Aid fixes to PUHCA; they help, but they do not \naddress the fundamental problem. The need to legislatively reform PUHCA \nwas recognized by the SEC's July 1995 report ``The Regulation of \nPublic-Utility Holding Companies.'' This legislation is based on its \nrecommendations to Congress.\n  Complete reform of PUHCA is needed, and it is justified. It is time \nto streamline and modernize the act. It is for these reasons that I am \ncosponsoring Senator D'Amato's legislation.\n  Mr. President, there may be some who will try to use this legislation \nas a vehicle to restructure the electric utility industry, possibly to \nimpose retail wheeling or to federally preempt State public utility \ncommissions. I will strenuously resist any such effort. I have received \nassurances that Senator D'Amato is of like mind.\n  This is not the time nor the place to make these kinds of changes. \nRetail wheeling and other competitive issues are not directly related \nto PUHCA reform. Moreover, retail wheeling and other Federal Power Act \nmatters are entirely within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources, not the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \nAffairs, to which this legislation will be referred. Electric utility \nissues are very complex, and they are very significant not only to \nconsumers but also to this Nation's competitiveness and economic well \nbeing. These kinds of changes cannot, and will not be made without \ncareful and complete consideration by the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources of all aspects of the issues and questions they \nraise.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my colleagues \nin introducing the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1995. This is \nthe first step in changing a law of which I have urged reform for many \nyears. The purpose of this bill is to bring into the 1990's a 60-year-\nold, now-antiquated law: the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 \n[PUHCA]. Our goal is to do away with burdensome and duplicative \nregulation, which stifles our Nation's economic well-being, and yet \nstill provide adequate protection for electricity consumers. In this \nregard, this bill effectively implements the recommendations of \nSecurities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt.\n  At the time of its enactment in 1935, PUHCA was clearly necessary. \nThe aim of this New Deal era law was to eradicate the abuses of large, \nmonopolistic public utility holding companies. The holding company \nstructure permitted such companies to deceive investors and obstruct \nState utility regulation. Importantly, in 1935, Federal regulation of \nholding companies was nonexistent.\n  Times have clearly changed. State regulators have the authority to \nprotect retail ratepayers from monopolistic prices, and the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission [FERC] has similar authority with respect \nto wholesale ratepayers. This proposed bill does away with unnecessary \nregulation of public utility holding companies by the Securities and \nExchange Commission, but augments the authorities of State and Federal \nutility regulators to do their jobs better.\n  Times have clearly changed. State regulators have the authority to \nprotect retail ratepayers from monopolistic prices, and the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission [FERC] has similar authority with respect \nto wholesale ratepayers. This proposed bill does away with unnecessary \nregulation of public utility holding companies by the Securities and \nExchange Commission, but augments the authorities of State and Federal \nutility regulators to do their jobs better. Specifically, the bill \ngives FERC and the States augmented authority to review the books, \nrecords, and accounts of companies within holding company systems. The \nbill also gives FERC and State public utility commissions the ability \nto examine so-called affiliated transactions, that is, the authority to \ndetermine whether a public utility company may recover in rates any \ncosts of an activity performed by an associate company, or any costs of \ngoods or services acquired by public utilities from their associate \ncompanies.\n  Although I support the goals of this bill, I wish to make one point \nclear. I understand that, in a letter to Senator D'Amato, the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission has raised several concerns regarding the \nspecific provisions of any proposed bill which would reform PUHCA. I am \nin receipt of FERC's letter to Senator D'Amato, and am committed to \nworking with the Banking Committee to achieve a resolution of any \noutstanding issues. Although I believe the bill introduced today goes a \nlong way toward achieving reform of PUHCA, I believe a number of issues \nmust be resolved, particularly, the way in which FERC will carry out \nits new authorities under the bill as proposed with respect to holding \ncompanies which were formerly exempt from PUHCA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Con. Res. 30\n\n       Whereas the United States and Mexico share a 2,000-mile \n     border and economic relations between the two nations are \n     increasing;\n       Whereas Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo has stated his \n     commitment to ``create a nation of law,'' combat drug \n     trafficking, investigate political assassinations, and punish \n     official malfeasance;\n       Whereas President Zedillo's appointed an opposition party \n     member, Antonio Lozano, as Attorney General, the first \n     opposition member in the Cabinet;\n       Whereas the Government of Mexico has taken steps to end \n     impunity by arresting Raul Salinas, the brother of former \n     President Carlos Salinas, for his involvement in the murder \n     of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, and by requesting the \n     extradition of Mario Ruiz Massieu, former Deputy Attorney \n     General, for his alleged tampering with evidence in the \n     investigation into the murder of his brother and for \n     accepting money from drug traffickers;\n       Whereas the investigations of the assassinations of the \n     Cardinal Posadas, PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo \n     Colosio, and PRI General Secretary Jose Francisco Ruiz \n     Massieu remain unresolved;\n       Whereas elements of Mexico's bureaucracy are engaged in \n     drug-related and other corruption, including collaborating \n     with drug traffickers who pay for protection, allowing the \n     drug trade to proliferate and threatening United States and \n     Mexican security;\n       Whereas Mexico is both a major transit point for drugs \n     produced in South America and elsewhere, and a production \n     source of much of the marijuana and heroin shipped into the \n     United States;\n       Whereas increased drug enforcement efforts in the \n     southeastern United States have achieved some positive \n     results;\n       Whereas drug smuggling activity has increased along the \n     U.S.-Mexican border;\n       Whereas, despite President Zedillo's initial efforts, \n     actions by the Government of Mexico have not pursued \n     aggressively President Zedillo's public commitments to \n     eliminate impunity for former and current government \n     officials: Now, therefore be it Resolved by the Senate (the \n     House of Representatives concurring), That\n       (a) the Congress recognizes the initial steps taken by the \n     Mexican Government of President Ernesto Zedillo to \n     investigate drug-related and other corruption in Mexico.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the President of the United States should encourage and \n     support President Zedillo's efforts to create an independent \n     Mexican judicial body to evaluate the financial holdings of \n     former and present Mexican officials;\n       (2) the President of the United States should encourage and \n     support President Zedillo's efforts to investigate to the \n     fullest extent possible corruption and economic malfeasance \n     in an effort to bring about a true democracy in Mexico;\n       (3) the United States Congress should pursue efforts to \n     strengthen relations with the Mexican Congress;\n       (4) the Attorney General of the United States should pursue \n     greater cooperation with the Mexican Government to \n     investigate cross-border corruption and to provide protection \n     for those willing to come forward publicly;\n       (5) the President of the United States and senior United \n     States officials should encourage and support efforts by \n     President Zedillo to investigate vigorously the killings of \n     Cardinal Juan Posadas in May 1993, PRI presidential candidate \n     Luis Donaldo Colosio in March 1994, and PRI Secretary General \n     Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu in September 1994;\n       (6) the Government of Mexico should replace and prosecute \n     corrupt regional police commanders;\n       (7) the Mexican people have the support of the United \n     States in efforts to eliminate illegal drug trafficking on \n     both sides of the United States-Mexico border; and\n       (8) the interdiction of illegal narcotics should be a top \n     priority for the United States in its management of the U.S.-\n     Mexican border.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this concurrent resolution to the President.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American people have an enormous stake \nin Mexico--a neighboring country with which the United States shares a \n2000-mile border and which is a significant trading partner. Many of \nMexico's problems have become our problems, especially drug trafficking \nfueled by incredible corruption which touches every community in \nAmerica.\n  On August 8, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee conducted a \nhearing on the magnitude of the illegal Mexican drug trade and its \naffect on United States-Mexican relations. It was startling to hear \nboth United States officials and Mexican experts describe the spreading \ntentacles of drug trafficking and drug-related corruption threatening \nto engulf the 10-month presidency of Ernesto Zedillo. The hearing, \nhowever, was not limited to the bad news; the witnesses offered several \ninitiatives that could be helpful to President Zedillo and the Mexican \npeople in confronting the drug lords.\n  This hearing prompted Senator Feinstein and me, working with Senator \nGrassley as chairman of the Senate Drug Enforcement Caucus, to prepare \na resolution I now send to the desk for first reading and appropriate \nreferral.\n  The enormity of the problem confronting Mexico is such that the \nMexican Government's own National Institute for Combating Drugs \nconcluded recently that the increasing power of the drug kingpins could \nultimately make Mexico ``ungovernable.''\n  All too often, Mr. President, these evil traffickers are aided and \nabetted by unscrupulous Mexican Government and law enforcement \nofficials. For example, it has been reported that the leader of the so-\ncalled gulf cartel, Juan Garcia Abrego--who also has become a fixture \non the FBI's most wanted list--bribes senior Mexican Government \nofficials to the tune of $50 million a month in running his operations.\n  While United States officials were heaping praise upon former Mexican \npresident Salinas' commitment to fighting drugs, Mr. Salinas' senior \ndrug enforcement officials were on the traffickers' payroll. Two of his \nthree drug enforcement directors have been charged with accepting \nbribes from drug traffickers. Salinas' Deputy Attorney General, Mario \nRuiz Massieu, kept millions of dollars in U.S. bank accounts which the \nU.S. district attorney for southern Texas alleges are payoffs from drug \ntraffickers.\n  And in another disturbing revelation, in May, Mexican newspapers \npublished transcripts of phone conversations involving Marcella \nBodenstadt, identified as a Garcia Abrego associate and the wife of a \ncartel money-launderer, and Salinas' Minister of the Presidency, with \nwhom she was having an affair. The Minister of the Presidency, who \nmanaged the national security and intelligence apparatus for the \nSalinas government, claims he knew nothing about Ms. Bodenstadt's drug \nconnections.\n  This concurrent resolution recognizes that President Zedillo \ninherited the governmental structure influenced \n\n[[Page S 15131]]\nby the drug lords. It acknowledges his initial efforts at reform. And \nit urges President Clinton to encourage and support President Zedillo's \ninitiatives to create a nation of law, combat drug trafficking, \ninvestigate political killings--many of which also are related to the \ndrug trade--and to punish official malfeasance.\n  It is in Mexico's interest to pursue vigorously the investigations of \nthree high-profile murders linked to drug trafficking. The May 1993 \nmurder of Cardinal Juan Posadas, allegedly by drug traffickers led by \nthe kingpins of the so-called Tijuana cartel, Benjamin and Ramon \nArellano Felix, shocked the world. However, 2\\1/2\\ years later, the \nArellano Felix brothers are still free, even though they reportedly are \nseen around town.\n  Then there was the killing of PRI Presidential candidate Luis \nDonaldo Colosio in Tijuana in March 1994. Drug traffickers and corrupt \npolice officials have been implicated in the killing and in subsequent \nefforts to obstruct investigations. Two weeks after Colosio's murder, \nthe local police chief was gunned-down while conducting his own \ninvestigation into the assassination. In May 1995, the Governor of Baja \nCalifornia confirmed that the Tijuana police chief had been murdered by \na Federal Judicial Police officer.\n\n  Mr. President, corruption within the police remains a serious \nproblem. In March 1995, 14 officers of the same Federal Judicial \nPolice--a group known for torture, rape, and drug corruption--were \naccused of stealing and selling cocaine base. Earlier this year, NBC \nNightly News aired film footage of Mexican police helping traffickers \nunload cocaine. And when President Zedillo's appointed chief of police, \nJuan Pablo de Tavira, decided to purge the force of corrupt officers, \nhe was mysteriously poisoned hours before a meeting with the Attorney \nGeneral to implement the cleansing of the police force.\n  In the case of Mexico, President Zedillo must guarantee that his \nnation will be governed by law--which has not been the case during the \nPRI's 66-year one-party rule of Mexico. It is not sufficient to arrest \nan occasional drug lord who has not paid for protection. A consistently \napplied standard of punishment against all drug traffickers and corrupt \ngovernment and law enforcement officials, regardless of position or \nwealth, is crucial.\n  U.S. programs to combat drug trafficking are a waste if senior \nforeign government officials assist drug gangs and policemen are in \ncahoots with traffickers. The U.S. Government must send the message \nthat we support tough antidrug and anticorruption initiatives. While a \nfew dedicated United States officials daily combat drug trafficking, in \ndiplomatic exchanges with Mexico, drug trafficking and corruption are \nrarely ever mentioned. It seems that U.S. officials fear that the mere \nmention of drugs will offend their counterparts and perhaps ruffle cozy \ndiplomatic relationships. This is absurd.\n  The insidious influence of drug trafficking and political corruption \nare the greatest threat to both nations' national security. All of us \nare affected by drugs and crime--much of which is committed by persons \nunder the influence of drugs. We have a responsibility to fight drugs \ncrossing our borders. The lives and well-being of our families, \nchildren, and grandchildren are at stake. It is the intent of this \nresolution to signal our resolve in fighting the scourge of illegal \ndrugs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/12/senate-section/article/S15130-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SENATE RESOLUTION 181--RELATIVE TO THE SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. DOLE (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) The purpose of the General Agreement on Tariffs and \n     Trade (hereafter in this amendment referred to as the \n     ``GATT'') and the World Trade Organization (hereafter in this \n     amendment referred to as the ``WTO'') is to enable member \n     countries to conduct trade based upon free market principles, \n     by limiting government intervention in the form of state \n     subsidies, by limiting nontariff barriers, and by encouraging \n     reciprocal reductions in tariffs among members;\n       (2) The GATT/WTO is based on the assumption that the import \n     and export of goods are conducted by independent enterprises \n     responding to profit incentives and market forces;\n       (3) The GATT/WTO requires that nonmarket economies \n     implement significant reforms to change centralized and \n     planned economic systems before becoming a full GATT/WTO \n     member and the existence of a \n\n[[Page S 15133]]\n     decentralized and a free market economy is considered a precondition to \n     fair trade among GATT/WTO members;\n       (4) The People's Republic of China (hereinafter referred to \n     as ``China'') and the Republic of China on Taiwan (hereafter \n     referred to as ``Taiwan'') applied for membership in the GATT \n     in 1986 and 1991, respectively, and Working Parties have been \n     established by the GATT to review their applications;\n       (5) China insists that Taiwan's membership in the GATT/WTO \n     be granted only after China becomes a full member of the \n     GATT/WTO;\n       (6) Taiwan has a free market economy that has existed for \n     over three decades, and is currently the fourteenth largest \n     trading nation in the world;\n       (7) Taiwan has a gross national product that is the world's \n     twentieth largest, its foreign exchange reserves are among \n     the largest in the world and it has become the world's \n     seventh largest outbound investor;\n       (8) Taiwan has made substantive progress in agreeing to \n     reduce upon GATT/WTO accession the tariff level of many \n     products, and non-tariff barriers;\n       (9) Taiwan has also made significant progress in other \n     aspects of international trade, such as in intellectual \n     property protection and opening its financial services \n     market;\n       (10) Despite some progress in reforming its economic \n     system, China still retains legal and institutional practices \n     that restrict free market competition and are incompatible \n     with GATT/WTO principles;\n       (11) China still uses an intricate system of tariff and \n     non-tariff administrative controls to implement its \n     industrial and trade policies, and China's tariffs on foreign \n     goods, such as automobiles, can be as high as 150 percent, \n     even though China has made commitments in the market access \n

Taiwan's earliest \n     membership in the GATT/WTO;\n       (3) the United States should support the membership of \n     China in the GATT/WTO only if a sound bilateral commercial \n     agreement

application for membership in the GATT/WTO \n     should be reviewed strictly in accordance with the rules, \n     guidelines, principles, precedents, and practices of the \n     GATT.\n

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The economy of Cuba has experienced a decline of \n     approximately 60 percent in the last 5 years as a result of--\n       (A) the reduction in subsidies from the former Soviet \n     Union;\n       (B) 36 years of Communist tyranny and economic \n     mismanagement by the Castro government;\n       (C) the precipitous decline in trade between Cuba and the \n     countries of the former Soviet bloc; and\n       (D) the policy of the Russian Government and the countries \n     of the former Soviet bloc to conduct economic relations with \n     Cuba predominantly on commercial terms.\n       (2) At the same time, the welfare and health of the Cuban \n     people have substantially deteriorated as a result of Cuba's \n     economic decline and the refusal of the Castro regime of \n     Cuba's economic decline and the refusal of the Castro regime \n     to permit free and fair democratic elections in Cuba or to \n     adopt any economic or political reforms that would lead to \n     democracy, a market economy, or an economic recovery.\n       (3) The repression of the Cuban people, including a ban on \n     free and fair democratic elections and the continuing \n     violation of \n\n[[Page S 15134]]\n     fundamental human rights, as isolated the Cuban regime as the only \n     nondemocratic government in the Western Hemisphere.\n       (4) As long as no such economic or political reforms are \n     adopted by the Cuban government, the economic condition of \n     the country and the welfare of the Cuban people will not \n     improve in any significant way.\n       (5) Fidel Castro has defined democratic pluralism as \n     ``pluralistic garbage'' and has made clear that he has no \n     intention otherwise tolerating the democratization of Cuban \n     society.\n       (6) The Castro government, in an attempt to retain absolute \n     political power, continues to utilize, as it has from its \n     inception, torture in various forms (including psychiatric \n     abuse), execution, exile, confiscation, political \n     imprisonment, and other forms of terror and repression as \n     most recently demonstrated by the massacre of more than 40 \n     Cuban men, women, and children attempting to flee Cuba.\n       (7) The Castro government holds hostage in Cuba innocent \n     Cubans whose relatives have escaped the country.\n       (9) Over the past 36 years, the Cuban government has posed \n     a national security threat to the United States.\n       (10) The completion and any operation of a nuclear-powered \n     facility in Cuba, for energy generation or other wise, poses \n     an unacceptable threat to the national security of the United \n     States.\n       (11) The unleashing on United States shores of thousands of \n     Cuban refugees fleeing Cuban oppression will be considered an \n     act of aggression.\n       (12) The Government of Cuba engages in illegal \n     international narcotics trade and harbors fugitives from \n     justice in the United States.\n       (13) The totalitarian nature of the Castro regime has \n     deprived the Cuban people of any peaceful means to improve \n     their condition and has led thousands of Cuban citizens to \n     risk or lose their lives in dangerous attempts to escape from \n     Cuba to freedom.\n       (14) Attempts to escape from Cuba and courageous acts of \n     defiance of the Castro regime by Cuban pro-democracy and \n     human rights groups have ensured the international \n     community's continued awareness of, and concern for, the \n     plight of Cuba.\n       (15) The Cuban people deserve to be assisted in a decisive \n     manner in order to end the tyranny that has oppressed them \n     for 36 years.\n       (16) Radio Marti and Television Marti have been effective \n     vehicles for providing the people of Cuba with news and \n     information and have helped to bolster the morale of the \n     Cubans living under tyranny.\n       (17) The consistent policy of the United States towards \n     Cuba since the beginning of the Castro regime, carried out by \n     both Democratic and Republican administrations, has sought to \n     keep faith with the people of Cuba, and has been effective in \n     isolating the totalitarian Castro regime.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to assist the Cuban people in regaining their freedom \n     and prosperity, as well as in joining the community of \n     democratic countries that are flourishing in the Western \n     Hemisphere;\n       (2) to strengthen international sanctions against the \n     Castro government;\n       (3) to provide for the continued national security of the \n     United States in the face of continuing threats from the \n     Castro government of terrorism, theft of property from United \n     States nationals, and the political manipulation of the \n     desire of Cubans to escape that results in mass migration to \n     the United States;\n       (4) to encourage the holding of free and fair democratic \n     elections in Cuba, conducted under the supervision of \n     internationally recognized observers;\n       (5) to provide a policy framework for United States support \n     to the Cuban people in response to the formation of a \n     transition government or a democratically elected government \n     in Cuba; and\n       (6) to protect American nationals against confiscatory \n     takings and the wrongful trafficking in property confiscated \n     by the Castro regime.\n\n     SEC. 4.

ENFORCEMENT OF THE ECONOMIC EMBARGO OF CUBA.\n\n       (a) Policy.--(1) The Congress hereby reaffirms section \n     1704(a) of the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992, which states the \n     President should encourage foreign countries to restrict \n     trade and credit relations with Cuba in a manner consistent \n     with the purposes of that Act.\n       (2) The Congress further urges the President to take \n     immediate steps to apply the sanctions described in section \n     1704(b)(1) of such Act against countries assisting Cuba.\n       (b) Diplomatic Efforts.--The Secretary of State should \n     ensure that United States diplomatic personnel abroad \n     understand and, in their contacts with foreign officials are \n     communicating the reasons for the United States economic \n     embargo of Cuba, and are urging foreign governments to \n     cooperate more effectively with the embargo.\n       (c) Existing Regulations.--The President shall instruct the \n     Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General to enforce \n     fully the Cuban Assets Control Regulations in part 515 of \n     title 31, Code of Federal Regulations.\n       (d) Trading With The Enemy Act.--(1) Subsection (b) of \n     section 16 of the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C.

SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) The purpose of the General Agreement on Tariffs and \n     Trade (hereafter in this amendment referred to as the \n     ``GATT'') and the World Trade Organization (hereafter in this \n     amendment referred to as the ``WTO'') is to enable member \n     countries to conduct trade based upon free market principles, \n     by limiting government intervention in the form of state \n     subsidies, by limiting nontariff barriers, and by encouraging \n     reciprocal reductions in tariffs among members;\n       (2) The GATT/WTO is based on the assumption that the import \n     and export of goods are conducted by independent enterprises \n     responding to profit incentives and market forces;\n       (3) The GATT/WTO requires that nonmarket economies \n     implement significant reforms to change centralized and \n     planned economic systems before becoming a full GATT/WTO \n     member and the existence of a decentralized and a free market \n     economy is considered a precondition to fair trade among \n     GATT/WTO members;\n       (4) The People's Republic of China (hereinafter referred to \n     as ``China'') and the Republic of China on Taiwan \n     (hereinafter referred to as ``Taiwan'') applied for \n     membership in the GATT in 1986 and 1991, respectively, and \n     Working Parties have been established by the GATT to review \n     their applications;\n       (5) China insists that Taiwan's membership in the GATT/WTO \n     be granted only after China becomes a full member of the \n     GATT/WTO;\n       (6) Taiwan has a free market economy that has existed for \n     over three decades, and is currently the fourteenth largest \n     trading nation in the world;\n       (7) Taiwan has a gross national product that is the world's \n     twentieth largest, its foreign exchange reserves are among \n     the largest in the world and it has become that world's \n     seventh largest outbound investor;\n       (8) Taiwan has made substantive progress in agreeing to \n     reduce upon GATT/WTO accession the tariff level of many \n     products, and non-tariff barriers;\n       (9) Taiwan has also made significant progress in other \n     aspects of international trade, such as in intellectual \n     property protection and opening its financial services \n     market;\n       (10) Despite some progress in reforming its economic \n     system, China still retains legal and institutional practices \n     that restrict free market competition and are incompatible \n     with GATT/WTO principles;\n       (11) China still uses an intricate system of tariff and \n     non-tariff administrative controls to implement its \n     industrial and trade policies, and China's tariffs on foreign \n     goods, such as automobiles, can be as high as 150 percent, \n     even though China has made commitments in the market access \n     Memorandum of Understanding to reform significant parts of \n     its import regime;\n       (12) China continues to use direct and indirect subsidies \n     to promote exports;\n       (13) China often manipulates its exchange rate to impede \n     balance of payments adjustments and gain unfair competitive \n     advantages in trade;\n       (14) Taiwan's and China's accession to the GATT/WTO have \n     important implications for the United States and the world \n     trading system.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) the United States should separate Taiwan's application \n     for membership in the GATT/WTO from China's application for \n     membership in those organizations;\n       (2) the United States should support Taiwan's earliest \n     membership in the GATT/WTO;\n       (3) the United States should support the membership of \n     China in the GATT/WTO only if a sound bilateral commercial \n     agreement is reached between the United States and China, and \n     that China makes significant progress in making its economic \n     system compatible with GATT/WTO principles;\n       (4) China's application for membership in the GATT/WTO \n     should be reviewed strictly in accordance with the rules, \n     guidelines, principles, precedents, and practices of the \n     GATT; and\n       (5) Both Taiwan's and China's accession to the GATT/WTO \n     have important implications for the United States and for the \n     world trading system.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        HELMS AMENDMENT NO. 2919\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. HELMS submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe amendment No. 2900 proposed by Mr. Simon to the amendment No. 2898 \nproposed by Mr. Dole to the bill (H.R. 927) supra; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the word ``SEC.'' and insert the \n     following:\n\n     103A.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to see that a \nbill has been introduced to repeal the Public Utility Holding Company \nAct of 1935 [PUHCA]. PUHCA has long since outlived its usefulness. It \nhas become duplicative with other regulation, both at the Federal and \nState levels. The utility industry, both gas and electric, has changed \ndramatically since PUHCA was first enacted, and particularly the new \ncompetitive pressures and State regulation that now exists, makes PUHCA \nunnecessary. I thank Chairman D'Amato and my colleagues on the Banking \nCommittee, and the Securities and Exchanges Commission [SEC], which has \nrecommended repeal, for their diligence in bringing this legislation \nbefore us.\n  While the utility industry is changing, there are some who argue that \nany action on the repeal of PUHCA must be tied to broader changes in \nthe structure of the electric utility industry. I do not accept or \nsupport that position, but rather believe that PUHCA can and should be \nrepealed while the debate on the other broader issues matures. The SEC \nfirst recommended repeal of PUHCA in 1982, and have more recently, in \nJune, called again for the antiquated law's repeal. We should act \naccordingly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/12/senate-section/article/S15138-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN PRAISE OF THE HAVERSTRAW ALL-STARS\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN.

Mr. President, on September 29, 1995, at the Dupont \nCountry Club in Wilmington, DE, the 5th annual Roger Crozier \nInvitational Golf for Adoption was held. This event benefits the \nGladney Center, which places children for adoption throughout the \nUnited States, and the National Council for Adoption. It was created by \nan accomplished athlete, a successful \n\n[[Page S 15139]]\nbusinessman, and a strong advocate for the cause of adoption, Mr. Roger \nCrozier. During the evening of the event, a special ceremony was held \nhonoring Mr. Crozier for his achievements and efforts on behalf of \nadoption. The well-known sports writer, Tony Kornheiser, wrote a \nbefitting tribute for the evening and I ask that the tribute by Mr. \nKornheiser be printed in the Record.\n  The tribute follows:\n\n                       Remarks by Tony Kornheiser\n\n       Many of you in the audience may be young enough that you \n     are not familiar with the great career Roger had in hockey. \n     So let me fill you in a bit:\n       He played 14 years in the National Hockey League as a \n     goalie. Of all the sports that I've covered, I think hockey \n     is the toughest to play. You're hardly in motion at all in \n     baseball. You're in motion all the time in basketball--but \n     when you touch somebody in basketball you're called for a \n     foul. In hockey, there is continuous motion and frequent \n     violent hitting. True, the hitting is harder in football, but \n     there is more rest between plays. So I think hockey stands \n     alone in what it asks of you physically.\n       And of all the sports I've covered, I think playing goalie \n     is the toughest position. The puck is flying at you, \n     frequently at speeds exceeding 100 miles an hour. And often \n     there are people between you and the puck, screening off your \n     vision, so you don't even get a good look at the puck as it \n     hurtles towards you. Sometimes, just before it gets there, \n     just as you have your glove out to snatch it, somebody will \n     nudge it with a stick or a skate, and you have to readjust \n     instantaneously. As a goalie you are asked to be a wizard \n     with your stick and glove, and an acrobat on your skates. And \n     don't you ever forget that every eye in the place is on you. \n     And should that puck trickle through your legs, or skip over \n     your stock, or rip into the net behind you . . . you will \n     hear boos that will make your ears burn. No matter how many \n     pads a goalie wears, he's always naked out there. Sometimes I \n     think goalies wear those masks less for protection from the \n     puck than to hide their faces, so the booing fans won't know \n     who to chase after the game.\n       Roger Crozier did this for 14 years at the highest level of \n     hockey in the world. Can you imagine the skill and courage \n     and reflexes it took to do it for that long.\n       You can't be ordinary and last 14 years. They'd have \n     shipped you out long before that.\n       Roger was very good from the start. He was named Rookie of \n     The Year in his first season in the league; his name is on \n     the Calder Trophy along with people like Bobby Orr, Mario \n     Lemieux and Denis Potvin--giants of the game. In Roger's \n     rookie season a Canadian hockey writer said of Roger, ``Few \n     goaltenders have descended on the National Hockey League \n     in the past 10 years with the impact of the acrobatic \n     Crozier. This sprawling, weaving, twisting hockey octopus \n     is a fan's delight.''\n       Later in his career Roger played for Buffalo and \n     Washington, expansion teams where there were so many holes in \n     the defense that a goalie feels he's skating through swiss \n     cheese. When a goaltender gets hot people say, \n     appreciatively, ``He stood on his head tonight.'' Well, with \n     an expansion team even standing on your head can't help. But \n     in those early days with the Detroit Red Wings, Roger played \n     on a team that gave him a chance to strut his stuff. Canadian \n     columnist Red Burnett talked about Roger's goaltending style \n     then, saying. ``He usually makes a last second lurch with the \n     speed of a striking rattler to block or glove the puck. Some \n     say he has the fastest catching hand in the business.'' Roger \n     was in fact so fast and so good that in 1966, even though \n     Detroit loss the Stanley Cup final to Montreal, Roger was \n     named the Most Valuable Player in the playoffs.

Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the \nbudget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office \nunder section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for \nSenate scorekeeping of section 5 of Senate Concurrent Resolution 32, \nthe first concurrent resolution on the budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget \nthrough October 10, 1995. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, \nand revenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 1996 concurrent resolution on the budget (H. Con. \nRes. 67), show that current level spending is below the budget \nresolution by $4.3 billion in budget authority and above the budget \nresolution by $2.9 billion in outlays. Current level is $44 million \nbelow the revenue floor in 1996 and below by $0.7 billion over the 5 \nyears 1996-2000. The current estimate of the deficit for purposes of \ncalculating the maximum deficit amount is $248.5 billion, $2.9 billion \nabove the maximum deficit amount for 1996 of $245.6 billion.\n  Since my last report, dated September 12 1995, Congress cleared for \nthe President's signature the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (H.R. \n402). The Congress also cleared and the President signed the Military \nConstruction Appropriations Act (Public Law 104-32), and the 1996 \nContinuing Appropriations Act (Public Law 104-31). These actions \nchanged the current level of budget authority and outlays.\n  The material follows:\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 11, 1995.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, on September 13, 1994, after 6 \nyears of gridlock, President Clinton signed the toughest, smartest \ncrime bill in American history. Rejecting the stale political debates \nthat doomed earlier efforts, the Violent Crime Control Act [VCCA] \noffers a balanced approach to fighting crime--one that combines \npolicing, prevention, and punishment.\n  In 1 year, the VCCA has made a difference. More police are on the \nbeat. ``Three strikes and you're out'' is the law of the land. \nInterstate domestic violence, stalking and harassing are Federal \noffenses. Assault weapons can no longer be manufactured. States and \ncities have more resources to build boot camps. Law enforcement \nagencies across America have greater tools to implement drug courts, \nupgrade criminal record histories, and incarcerate violent offenders \nand keep them off the streets.\n  If we keep the promises we made to the American people 1 year ago \nwhen the Crime Act was passed, we will continue to have more police on \nthe streets, more prisons to lock up violent offenders, and fewer \nneighborhoods where the streets remain empty and doors stay shut.\n  But just as new evidence indicates that violent crime among teenagers \nand young adults is skyrocketing, this Congress seems ready to break \nthose promises. Unless we act now to stop young people from choosing a \nlife of crime, the beginning of the 21st century could bring levels of \nviolent crime to our communities that far exceed what we now \nexperience. The programs created by the 1994 Crime Act are a critically \nimportant component in halting the advance of violence and crime. We \nneed to ask at this critical junction: Will we build on the progress in \nthe fight against crime, or will we let the ground we have gained slip \naway?\n  The crime control priorities funded in the fiscal year 1996 Commerce, \nState, Justice appropriations bill offer the Nation a very mixed \nmessage in answer to this question. Token programs are saved, but the \nmajority of proven and effective crime prevention efforts are slashed \nor eliminated then tossed into a block grant with vague promises of \nbeing able to achieve similar levels of crime prevention.\n  This structure of priorities seems almost hypocritical for a Congress \nthat is bent on reducing spending by eliminating waste in inefficiency. \nI share that goal, which is why I believe that crime prevention pays. \nCrime control costs the American people approximately $90 billion a \nyear. Only a small amount of funding on crime prevention goes a long \nway in reducing incidences of crime and the costs of crime on our \nsociety.\n  On a positive note, the Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law \nEnforcement Assistance Program thankfully survived the slash-and-block \nattacks on crime control. Law enforcement officials have told me of the \nsuccess they have had as a result of these funds. Drug enforcement task \nforces, improved law enforcement technology, the DARE Program, domestic \nviolence intervention and countless other valuable antidrug and \nanticrime efforts have been possible, in part, through funding \navailable under the Byrne Program. I quote from an officer on the front \nline in my home State of Iowa, ``The assistance we have received by way \nof the Edward Byrne grants has been the key to our approach in fighting \ndrug violators.''\n  On the other hand, the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services \n[COPS], the cornerstone of the first year of crime fighting efforts, \nwas eliminated by the committee. Under this funding bill that came to \nthe floor, services provided by the COPS Program would have been forced \nto compete for scare resources with other crime prevention programs \nsuch as programs for delinquent and at-risk youth, gang resistance \nprograms and many other community and school-based initiatives to keep \nkids from turning to a life of crime. The end result of course, would \nbe less money for all crime prevention efforts.\n  Perhaps the most tragic aspect of the proposal to eliminate the COPS \nProgram is the loss of local control. Proponents traditionally argue \nthat block grants increase local control. The crime prevention block \ngrant proposed in the Commerce, State, Justice funding bill does no \nsuch thing. This initiative replaces a highly successful program that \nresponds to public desire for an increased police presence with a \nprogram that merely gives money to State governments that may keep up \nto 15 percent before distributing the remainder to local governments. \nAllowed uses for the funding are expanded to include not just \nadditional funding for more cops on the beat, but also for procurement \nof equipment and prosecution. This is a significant departure from the \nCOPS Program which funneled the funding directly to the local law \nenforcement agencies.\n  The COPS Program was created as a Federal-local law enforcement \npartnership, providing grants to local law enforcement agencies to hire \n100,000 new officers. With community policing as its base, the program \nencourages the development of police-citizen cooperation to control \ncrime, maintain order and improve the quality of life in America.\n  In less than 12 months, this program is ahead of schedule and on \ntarget in funding one quarter of the 100,000 cops promised to the \nAmerican people. As a block grant under the Commerce, State, Justice \nbill there would be no requirement that even one officer is hired.\n  The block grant approach to crime prevention invites the abuse of \nfunds the COPS Program was created to eliminate, as well as doing away \nwith effective crime prevention programs that worked hand in hand with \ncommunity policing initiatives set up under the COPS Program. The \npriorities delineated in the committee bill were misplaced, creating an \nineffective response to our Nation's war against crime and a sad \ndeparture from the successful efforts started under the 1994 Violent \nCrime Control Act. I am happy that the COPS Program was restored during \nfloor consideration and would urge my colleagues to continue their \nsupport for crime prevention efforts throughout the budget \nprocess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/12/senate-section/article/S15140-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15140-S15141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL FIRE PREVENTION WEEK\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, October 8 through 14 marks the \nobservance of National Fire Prevention Week. During this week, the \nNation focuses its attention on fire safety awareness and education. \nThese preventive efforts play an important part in the protection of \nour citizens from the devastation of accidental fire. While education \nis vital to fire prevention, the indispensable crux of our country's \nfire prevention efforts is the men and women who risk their lives daily \nto protect their community from harmful fires. These hard working \nindividuals diligently serve the public despite the risks inherent in \ntheir profession.\n  Sadly, these risks sometimes overtake these public servants. Some may \nremember the terrible tragedy that occurred near Glenwood Springs, CO \nlast year. On Wednesday, July 6, 1994, 14 elite firefighters died when \na wildfire exploded up a mountainside. The Nation grieved that loss and \nwe continued to extend our sympathies to the families and individuals \naffected.\n  I am especially saddened for the nine young men and women from Oregon \nwho perished in the fire--Bonnie Holtby, Jon Kelso, Tami Bickett, Scott \nBlecha, Levi Brinkley, Kathi Beck, Rob \n\n[[Page S 15141]]\n\nJohnson, Terri Hagen, and Doug Dunbar. These fine young men and women \nrepresented nearly half of a 20-person crew based in the Central Oregon \ntown of Prineville. But they were not alone; individuals from Idaho, \nMontana, Georgia, and Colorado also met a tragic fate in the line of \nduty.\n  Calling themselves the Hot Shots, these elite firefighters were a \nspecial breed. The nine from Prineville came from a region especially \nsusceptible to forest fires. But these Hot Shots were committed to \nfighting fires all over the country and served in States all over the \nwest, where summer fires can be so dangerous. These young men and women \ncame to Colorado directly from fires in California and Oregon. I know \nthey took pride in being part of a national team and a national effort \nto protect our homes and communities from the terror of forest fires.\n  We have lost tremendous potential, hope, and energy with these young \nfire-fighters. Nothing can replace the loss of a loved one, but each \nyear in October the Nation pauses to recognize the volunteer and career \nfirefighters who have died in the line of duty. The National Fallen \nFirefighters Memorial in Emmitsburg, MD serves as a monument to the \ncourage and dedication of these heroic men and women. This weekend \nfamilies and friends gather together to mourn the loss of these \ncourageous individuals and to commemorate the valiant service of \nfirefighters across the Nation.\n  As these families collectively grieve, the Nation should share in \ntheir grief remembering the sacrifices of firefighters who have lost \ntheir lives in the line of duty. As we observe National Fire Prevention \nweek and commemorate the actions of those no longer with us, we should \nalso recognize the courage of our active firefighters who selflessly \nprotect their communities day in and day out. These individuals deserve \nour recognition, our gratitude, and our highest admiration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/12/senate-section/article/S15140-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MAKING MAJORITY COMMITTEE APPOINTMENTS\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE.
