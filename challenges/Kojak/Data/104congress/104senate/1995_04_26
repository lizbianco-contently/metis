As Lord of the \nuniverse, Sovereign Ruler of nations and men, and Holy Redeemer of the \nunborn, the living, and the dead, we join this Senate today confessing \nour unworthiness in Your presence. You are total love. Through the \nexample of Your son, You taught us to love one another and to reach out \nto our neighbor, as well as our enemy. But too often we have been \nconsumed by our own selfish concerns. Why must it take, O God, a \ntragedy as occurred last week to shock our Nation into realizing the \npotential evil inherent in every man's heart and our ultimate \nhopelessness without the manifestation of Your love in each of us \nthrough Your son, Jesus Christ.\n  You are God and we are but persons of clay. We begin this \ncongressional day by acknowledging Your power and requesting Your \nguidance in all deliberations. Holy Father, give the Members of this \nbody not only the wisdom to know right but also the courage to do what \nis right. The Members of this Chamber are accountable to the people of \nthese United States but ultimately to You. Psalms 72 reminds us that \nYou, God, give rulers Your justice that they may judge Your people with \nrighteousness, Your poor with compassion, that they may defend the \ncause of the destitute, give deliverance to the needy, and crush the \noppressor. Lord, may You give to the esteemed men and women of this \nsacred Chamber the willingness to cooperate with You in promoting \njustice and righteousness, establishing peace and tranquility across \nour troubled land. May we strive for the day when peace covers the \nEarth as water covers the sea.\n  Holy God, today, great pressures will be brought to bear on the men \nand women of this room. Remind them now that You allowed the people to \nelect them because of their inner strengths that will protect them from \noutside pressures. May the words of their mouths, the meditations of \ntheir hearts, and the actions of their hands be acceptable in Your \nsight this day. In Jesus' name I ask this. Amen.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, is there a pending amendment?\n  [[Page S5684]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is \namendment No. 599 offered by the Senator from Washington on behalf of \nthe Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we are engaged in the debate over the \npublic liability bill. The pending business is an amendment basically \nsponsored by the Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown], having to do with \nrule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  There will be no votes until at least 6 o'clock this evening, at \nwhich time there will be votes both on an amendment by the Senator from \nMichigan [Mr. Abraham], and a second-degree amendment to that amendment \nsponsored by the Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings].\n  As a consequence, there are essentially three amendments to the basic \nproduct liability bill before the Senate at this point. It is \nappropriate to debate each one of them.\n  In addition, I wish all Senators and their staffs who are listening \nto this debate to understand that while many Members of the Senate are \nin Mississippi for the funeral of our former colleague, Senator \nStennis, it is appropriate at any time during the day to come and speak \nto any potential future amendment to this bill. We know that it is \ncontroversial. We know that there will be amendments to narrow the \nbill. We know that there will be amendments to broaden the bill. \nAnything that Members can do to discuss some of their proposals or \ntheir general attitudes on the bill itself during the course of the day \nwill be appreciated.\n  How long this evening the majority leader will wish to keep us in \nsession I do not know. But I do know that we will vote on the Hollings \nsecond-degree amendment and the Abraham first-degree amendment at \napproximately 6 o'clock. I know that the majority leader hopes \nthereafter to deal with the Brown amendment by vote today.\n  After that, under the order, the majority leader himself will present \nan amendment broadening the scope of the bill as it respects punitive \ndamages. That will be a major amendment to the bill, and it is \nperfectly appropriate for people to express their views on that subject \nat any time during the day, even before the amendment itself is \nadopted.\n  Simply to summarize, this is the first time that the Senate has \nactually dealt with amendments, engaged in a formal debate on the \nsubject of product liability or, more broadly, tort reform. In spite of \nthe fact that there have been product liability bills introduced and \nsometimes reported by the Commerce Committee, at least since 1982, and \nperhaps earlier than that, the bill, in my view and that of my \ncolleague, the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller], is a \nbalanced approach, balancing the interest of judgment and the \nprosecution of claims and product liability cases against the undoubted \nnegative impact of product liability litigation on the creation of \njobs, on American competitiveness, on the research and development of \nnew products, of the marketing of valid products.\n  The impact of product liability litigation on the marketplace has \nbeen distinctly negative. It has dramatically reduced the number of \nproducers of many important medicines, of commodities like football \nhelmets, for example--almost anything that is ever associated with \ndangerous kinds of activities. We hope not to restrict the access to \nthe courts on the part of people who are injured by the genuine \nnegligence of manufacturers but to see to it that there is a balance in \nthat litigation, a balance which more greatly encourages economic \ndevelopment in this country and encourages fairness by not subjecting \nmanufacturers or wholesalers or retailers to litigation over matters \nwhich are not their fault or which subjects them to charges beyond \ntheir fault in the case of any such accident.\n  Mr. President, I spoke in general terms the day before yesterday, \nwhen this debate began, to the proposition that we now had precise \ninformation as to the impact of product liability legislation and did \nnot have to deal with this question entirely in the abstract.\n  In spite of my statement just a few moments ago, there has, in fact, \nbeen action by this Congress on one very narrow, focused field of \nproduct liability in one very narrowly focused area.\n  For almost a decade, our colleague, the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. \nKassebaum] has attempted to get relief for the manufacturers of small \naircraft. Finally, last year, this Congress passed, with respect to \nsmall aircraft, one aspect of this product liability legislation: \nsimply a statute of repose, an 18-year statute of repose, which \nfrustrated lawsuits against the manufacturer with respect to aircraft \nmore than 18 years in age.\n  The fact of so much product liability litigation against those \naircraft manufacturers had reduced the production of private aircraft \nin the United States by companies like Piper and Cessna by some 95 \npercent over a period of about 20 or 30 years--95 percent, Mr. \nPresident.\n  For all practical purposes, that business was defunct in the United \nStates of America, not only, of course, harming the companies, their \nemployees, and their past employees, but limiting the availability of \nsuch aircraft to those who wished to purchase them and to fly them.\n  The mere passage into law 1 year ago of a statute of repose for that \ntype of aircraft has already had a remarkably positive impact.\n  Quoting from testimony by the president of the General Aviation \nManufacturers Association on this bill, the bill that is before us \nright now:\n\n       After stopping the production of piston engine aircraft in \n     1986 because of spiraling liability costs, Cessna Aircraft \n     recently announced construction of a new production facility \n     for piston-powered airplanes in Independence, Kansas. Cessna \n     plans to build 2,000 planes per year at the new facility and \n     create over 1,500 new jobs. This will generate thousands of \n     additional jobs among suppliers and vendors in Kansas and \n     throughout the United States.\n       Piper Aircraft, which was forced into bankruptcy in 1991 \n     largely due to the costs of product liability suits and the \n     threat of future litigation, is now planning to emerge from \n     bankruptcy in the near future. Piper has increased both its \n     employment and production schedules by thirty percent.\n\n  There is further testimony on Mooney Aircraft in Kerrville, TX.\n  But, Mr. President, if a modest statute of repose of that nature in \none industry, albeit one graphically impacted by product liability \nlitigation, can have such an immense recovery, benefiting, obviously, \nnot only itself, its employees, and its suppliers, but obviously the \npeople, the market out there for these aircraft, how much greater \nimpact--100 times greater, or 1,000 times greater, we do not know--can \ngeneral, fair, and balanced product liability legislation have in the \nUnited States of America, legislation that includes a statute of repose \nslightly longer, a statute of repose of 20 years, but one which also \nlimits the arbitrary nature of punitive damage awards, one of the \ngreatest fears of all manufacturers, but particularly small \nmanufacturers, in the United States.\n  One such manufacturer who testified before the Commerce Committee \nshrugged his shoulders and said: ``A single such lawsuit could drive me \nout of business and destroy the work of an entire lifetime, whether I \nreally had a major responsibility or not.'' Not only because of the \nunlimited nature of potential punitive damage awards but because of the \ndoctrine of joint liability under which, when there is more than one \ndefendant, one, the deep pocket, can have imposed on it the entire \njudgment, even though the responsibility of that defendant was, say, \nonly on the order of some 10 percent.\n  So reforms in joint liability, reforms in punitive damages, reforms \nby reason of a statute of repose, the removal of responsibility from a \nwholesaler for judgments against the manufacturer, each of these is an \nimportant step forward, which not only does not undercut justice but \nadvances the cause of justice. At the same time, reforms can have an \nimpact, perhaps not as dramatic as these to which I have spoken in \nprivate business driven aircraft, but across our entire economy vitally \nimportant and positive.\n  This, Mr. President, is an important bill. The general subject of \nlegal reform beyond this is important, as well. Just yesterday \nafternoon, the Senate Labor Committee reported a bill similar to this \non the subject of medical malpractice, a vitally important element in \nany health care reform, in the view of this Senator.\n  So I hope that, certainly by sometime next week, we will be able to \n[[Page S5685]] bring this bill in its then form to some final vote. \nBut, in order to do so, we need the cooperation of Members. We need \nthem to appear. We need them to speak to their amendments or speak to \nthe bill, to let their views be known, to carry on the debate in the \nbetter traditions of the Senate.\n  So, Mr. President, I summarize by saying we are open and ready for \nbusiness and any Member who wishes to do business will be welcome \nthrough the door.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today for just a few \nmoments to express my admiration and appreciation and my respect for \nDavid Pryor, our colleague, who has announced that he will not be \nrunning for reelection next year.\n  For those of us in Washington and, of course, for those people in \npublic life all over the country, we meet all manner of different human \nbeings, both in terms of the constituents that we meet and, of course, \nthe colleagues with whom we work. While none are bad, some are \ndifferent from others and some are better and some are best. And in the \ncategory of best, I would put David Pryor, the best kind of a human \nbeing, the best kind of a friend, the best kind of a public \nrepresentative.\n  The people in Arkansas know very well what an outstanding person \nDavid Pryor is and what a great public servant David Pryor has been. He \nis beloved by virtually everybody in Arkansas to the extent that when \nhe ran for reelection last time, he had no opposition, and had he run \nfor reelection in 1996, it is undoubtedly true that he would have \nreceived an enormous majority of the votes cast in that election.\n  So David Pryor's record of accomplishment and achievement, the esteem \nin which he is held by people in Arkansas, is well known. Those of us \nhere who have worked with him in the Senate are equally well aware of \nwhat it is that David Pryor has accomplished and what kind of a person \nhe is. In my judgment, David Pryor is the best kind of a public \nservant, the best kind of a Senator, for many reasons, chief among \nwhich, in my judgment, is the fact that he is a person who can and does \nwork with all of his colleagues, regardless of which side of the aisle \nthey happen to occupy. I believe that is an enormous virtue in a public \nservant, and that it is invaluable in the Senate where, in order to get \nthings done in a constructive fashion, in order to keep the place \nworking, people have to have a willingness and an ability to compromise \ntheir differences in order to get things passed, in order to keep \nlegislation moving and, more importantly perhaps, in order to assure \nthe people that we represent all over the country that this is an \ninstitution that can work.\n  David Pryor understands that as well as anybody I have met in my now \n6 years here in the Senate. He practices that. Although we Democrats, \nof course, know how comfortable and how easy it is to work with him, I \nknow it is equally true that Republicans recognize in David Pryor a \nperson who, more than anything else, wants to get things done and in no \nway, ever, is interested in just impeding the work of the Senate.\n  So he is an outstanding person. Personally, David Pryor, when I came \nhere 6 years ago, befriended me immediately. He went out of his way, \nrecognizing that I was new to the process, and he went out of his way \nto see to it that I got along here and got to know my colleagues, got \nto know a little bit about how the Senate works, and in every way and \nat every turn, when I ran up against an obstacle or had a problem I did \nnot know how to deal with, I felt comfortable talking to him. He was \nalways receptive and always willing to put aside whatever it was he was \noccupied with in order to take care of my needs and to help ensure that \nI became a working Member of this body.\n  So David Pryor has been not only a great Senator but he has been a \nwonderful human being. I think that we can celebrate what he has \naccomplished in his career here in the Senate and celebrate it in a way \nwhich really does not, in any way, suggest that his career is over. He \nis not running for reelection in 1996. He says he wants to return to \nthe private sector. Whatever he does, he is going to be good and \neffective at it. He is a person of public service, and his career in \npolitics may go on at another time in another place and in another job. \nIf it does, we will all be very well served.\n  So David Pryor, we love you and we respect you. We have great regard \nfor what you have accomplished here among us, and we wish you well \nduring these next 18 months when you will continue to serve with us. We \ncertainly wish you, Barbara, and your family continued good health and \nhappiness as you wend your way along the path of life.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/26/senate-section/article/S5685-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5685-S5686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATOR DAVID PRYOR\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I happened to turn my television set on in \nmy room and caught Senator Kohl making his brief remarks about our \ncolleague, Senator Pryor. It occurred to me that I should come over \nhere and just say a few things also, about David Pryor, who has \nannounced that he is not going to be running for reelection.\n  I can remember when I was in the House and I heard David Pryor speak \nto a breakfast meeting. I had known him just to say hello, but I was \nvery favorably impressed and I have been favorably impressed through \nthe years.\n  Two things I think of specifically in connection with our colleague, \nSenator Pryor. One is the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. The Internal Revenue \nService does excellent work, but whenever you have human beings, \noccasionally there are those who abuse their privileges and that is \ntrue in any organization--the U.S. Senate, the Internal Revenue \nService. So David Pryor introduced his Taxpayer Bill of Rights, which \ngives the ordinary taxpayer, who may be abused, or feels he or she is \nabused by the IRS, an option and an ombudsman who can say: Let us take \na look at whether we are doing the right thing.\n  The second thing I can remember is Dave Pryor standing here on the \nfloor and going through an amazing list of consultants being hired by \nvirtually every agency of Government. It was an astounding \naccumulation. I do not remember what the figure was, but it was \nabsolutely astounding. I remember then the next appropriations, and the \nnext budget, we whacked away at that. It may very well be creeping back \nup again, I do not know, but it is one of those areas that is very \neasily abused by Government. We hire consultants for everything from \nthe Department of Energy, Department of Defense, foreign aid--whatever \nit is, we hire consultants.\n  I also think of Dave Pryor as someone who is genuinely interested in \nthe well-being of our country. Yes, he is a partisan as we all are \npartisans, but frequently this body gets too partisan. I hear it in our \nDemocratic caucuses. I am sure my colleague hears it from Republican \ncaucuses. He has not invited me to any of his Republican caucuses, but \nI am sure he hears the same. And I think one of the things the public \nwants from us is that we say, ``What is \n[[Page S5686]] good for the country?'' And we follow that. Dave Pryor \nreally has done that.\n  He has been just a distinguished Member of this body in addition to \nbeing a friend of all of us. It has been a real privilege to serve with \nhim in the U.S. Senate. He has served Arkansas well, but I think more \nimportant than that, he has served the United States of America well. I \nam proud to have him as a colleague here in the Senate.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator from Illinois yield?\n  Mr. SIMON. I will be pleased to yield to my friend from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. I enjoyed the description by the Senator from Illinois of \nthe Senator from Arkansas. I agree with it. I may also say I believe \nthe Senator from Illinois has described himself.\n  Mr. SIMON. My friend from Washington has been too generous in that \nremark, but I thank him anyway.\n  Mr. President, if no one else seeks the floor--I see my colleague \nfrom Colorado does not look as if he is quite ready. He is still making \nnotes.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto speak as if in morning business for a period of not more than 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss the approaching \ninsolvency of our Medicare Program.\n  The Clinton administration has confirmed that Medicare is going \nbankrupt. We must act now to save it. We must reform Medicare to \nprotect it, to preserve it, and to improve it.\n  Next year, for the first time in its 30-year history, the program \nwill begin deficit spending. And on April 3, the Medicare Board of \nTrustees announced that Medicare will go bankrupt by the year 2002. In \n7 years--well before I will be eligible for benefits--the program will \nhave exhausted all of its resources and will cease to exist in its \ncurrent form. We must act now.\n  This is not new information--Congress has been warned repeatedly of \nthe Medicare time bomb. Mr. President, the clock is ticking--we must \ntake action this Congress to save this vital program. I come before you \ntoday to discuss the successes and failures of this program, and to \nbegin to look for ways to protect and preserve its long-term health.\n  What is Medicare? It is a Government program which gives 32 million \nolder Americans and 4 million individuals with disabilities access to \nthe private health care system. Medicare is actually made up to two \nentirely different programs: A hospital insurance program, which is \ncompulsory for seniors, and a physician insurance program, which is \nvoluntary, with 96 percent of all seniors participating in this \nvoluntary insurance program.\n  Medicare's hospital insurance program--part A--is funded by a payroll \ntax on working citizens, a tax which entitles them to future benefits.\n  The physician insurance program, part B, in contrast, is funded by a \ncombination of general tax revenues and premiums paid by the \nbeneficiary.\n  Medicare has been very successful, successful in providing access to \nquality care. More than 37 million Americans today are covered by the \nprogram. Today's elderly live longer, live healthier lives, and enjoy a \nbetter quality of life than ever before. Medicare participants are \nextremely satisfied with the overall care they receive. Yet, Medicare \nhas become a victim of its own success. All will be lost if we do not \nact to save Medicare.\n  Over the years, many have found fault with the program: it does not \ncover comprehensive benefits; it does not protect out-of-pocket costs; \nit does not really provide incentives for consumers to maintain cost-\nconscious behavior; it does not reward providers with keeping people \nhealthy; and its costs clearly are growing out of control faster than \nthe Nation's economy, faster than the budget as a whole, and faster \nthan twice the rate of inflation. Medicare spending rose by 11 percent \nlast year, while private sector health care spending rose by only 4 \npercent.\n  Thus, each of us comes to the Medicare Program with the hope of \naddressing one or more of these problems. As a citizen legislator, one \nwho comes to the Senate directly from the private sector, I approach \nthis challenge wearing many hats. I come to the table as a health care \nprovider, a physician who on a daily basis has served the personal \nhealth care needs of thousands of Medicare patients. I come to the \ntable as the son of two active parents, both of whom are 84 years of \nage. They have been beneficiaries of Medicare as they were treated for \nheart attacks, colon cancer, pulmonary edema, a fractured neck, \nbleeding ulcers, kidney failure, a broken arm, phlebitis, and a stroke. \nI come to the table as a father of three boys whose generation will be \nworking to the pay the bills for my generation. And I come to the table \nas a legislator who sees the looming crisis of Medicare staring us \nstraight in the face.\n  When Medicare was designed in 1965, the goal very clearly was to \nprovide senior citizens with greater access to our country's health \ncare system. Medicare at that time was structured to mirror the private \nsystem of the time which in 1965 was primarily Blue Cross and Blue \nShield fee for service. That means Congress paid providers based solely \non the cost of the care delivered. There was no fee schedule of \nnegotiated rates with providers. There was no real justification of \ncosts. Furthermore, at that time Medicare insulated providers from the \nGovernment by allowing them to work through fiscal intermediaries and \ncarriers, similar to private insurance.\n  Now, Medicare is an insurance program that pays for private services. \nGreat Britain took quite a different approach. I spent almost a year as \na physician in England, and I as a physician worked directly for the \nEnglish Government receiving a salary from the English Government as an \nemployee of the National Health Service. The English have replaced \ntheir national insurance program and moved directly into Government \nprovision of services. Whereas our country relies on the private sector \nfor control and direction, England relies on direct Government \nintervention. This underlying philosophy is fundamental to our \nunderstanding of Medicare. Medicare was established to give seniors \naccess to the very same health care system available to all other \nAmericans.\n  But as the American medicine delivery systems have changed over the \nlast 30 years, and matured and diversified, Medicare has remained \nstagnant. Medicare fails to give seniors access to the full range of \nplans currently available to all other Americans. The private system \nhas evolved and Medicare has failed to keep up. Changes and \nimprovements are required today before seniors and the disabled fall \neven further behind.\n  Managed care illustrates that point. Today, 63 percent of working \nAmericans obtain their care through some type of managed care program. \nIn contrast, only 9 percent of seniors are enrolled in some type of \nmanaged care. Yet, it is important for people to understand managed \ncare is only one of the options in the private system today. There are \nmany others. And reasoned Medicare reform would open the Medicare \nProgram broadly to the many options that are available to all other \nAmericans in our private system today. It would allow seniors the \nfreedom to direct their Medicare money to the plan of their choice. For \nsome, that would mean an employer-sponsored plan. For others, it would \nmean an indemnity-type plan, and for still others a looser form of \nmanaged care. But the bottom line is that the Government should no \nlonger restrict a senior's choice of health plans.\n  New to this body, I find it hard to understand why Congress has \nfailed to pay attention to the ticking time bomb--Medicare. By failing \nto address the issue head on, we only delay the inevitable and make it \nmore difficult for our successors. If we choose not to preserve \nMedicare's integrity, we resign ourselves to either substantial benefit \nreductions for seniors or repetitive tax \n[[Page S5687]] increases. We must act now. Either my generation, the \nchildren of today's Medicare beneficiaries, will have greatly reduced \nopinions in the future, or our children will incur unprecedented tax \nincreases.\n  Now, the President of the United States has failed to address this \nimminent financial crisis. In fact, the Clinton administration predicts \nMedicare expenditures will grow by a staggering 66 percent over the \nnext 5 years. Yet, despite this forecast and despite the findings of \nthe Medicare trustees and the entitlement commission, the President \nfailed in his fiscal year 1996 budget to recommend even one measure to \nsave Medicare.\n  We must act now. I expect that the President will rely simply on tax \nincreases to maintain the program in the future, and that will work \nonly for a short time, because it fails to address the underlying cause \nof the crisis. If nothing is done, the Medicare portion of FICA taxes \nwould have to be raised by 125 percent. That is more than $700 taken \nout of a $40,000 salary. That is intolerable. Structural improvement is \nnecessary if we are to protect and preserve Medicare in the long run. \nWe can and will protect and save Medicare if we act now.\n  I will be taking time over the next several days to come back to the \nfloor to continue this discussion of how best this Congress is to save \nMedicare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are about to be engaged in a debate in \nthis Chamber on welfare reform, an issue which has failed the \nrecipients, has failed the American taxpayer, and on which I think men \nand women of good will on both sides of the political aisle agree we \nmust undertake some major structural reforms. I think that we can do so \nin a bipartisan fashion.\n  It was in this context during the recent April recess that I spent an \nentire morning at one of the busiest welfare offices in Las Vegas, the \nWest Owens District Welfare Office. May I say, Mr. President, to my \ncolleagues, it was an educational opportunity, and if my colleagues \nhave not previously done so, I would urge each of them to avail \nthemselves of this opportunity.\n  I first sat in on a welfare eligibility interview, a process that \nlasts for approximately 1 hour. I observed this process from the \nbeginning to its conclusion.\n  In the Owens Welfare Office, eligibility workers sit in very small \ninterview rooms, somewhat affectionately referred to as the ``chutes.'' \nThe eligibility worker has a desk literally surrounded on all sides \nwith shelves full of various forms and regulations that deal with the \nnearly 20 different programs a person in need of welfare assistance may \nbe eligible to receive. The client comes into the interview room from \nthe reception area, sits across from the eligibility worker's desk, and \nthe interview process begins.\n  Now the interview I observed, contrary to some of the stereotypical \nimages that are often projected, was of a young Caucasian woman. She \nwas married, living with her husband and two children. Her situation \nrepresents the prototype of the kind of problem that many people in \nAmerica face who seek welfare assistance.\n  She and her husband had moved to Nevada from California, and \ncurrently both are working. Although their jobs pay above the minimum \nwage, they are still unable to provide for their family of four. Her \nemployer structures her workweek so that her hours do not exceed 20 \nhours per week, and so she is ineligible for the medical benefits which \nher employer pays for those who work full time. One of her children has \na preexisting medical condition, so medical care is a necessity. Her \nhusband's employer provides no medical insurance. She also needs to pay \nfor the cost of child care, and her child care cost is more than 50 \npercent of the gross hourly wage that she makes each hour.\n  Following this eligibility determination interview, I sat down to a \nvery frank discussion with eligibility workers concerning the areas of \nthe welfare system that they believe need reforming.\n  Let me say, Mr. President, I had anticipated the thrust of the \ncomments would be that you all in the Congress need to provide more \nmoney; the system works. In effect, I thought I might be hearing a \ndefense of the status quo, because these are eligibility workers, the \ncommitted and dedicated people who choose, in terms of their own \neducational background and their work experience, to provide care to \nothers. So these are highly compassionate, sensitive people who see the \ntravail of life before them every day.\n  To my great surprise, they are as enraged and as frustrated and as \nangry as are the American people and each of us who, as Members of \nCongress, have had a chance to look at this system that has failed so \nabysmally. Their suggestions and comments to us, I think, are extremely \nworthwhile for us to consider. They are the people that are on the \nfront lines. They know the nuances of the system. They know how the \nsystem is ripped off. And they also know of its shortcomings in \nproviding help to those who all of us in this body would acknowledge \nare in genuine need of help.\n  As one of the underpinnings of the welfare system, I think all of us \ncan agree, whether we position ourselves in the political spectrum to \nthe left of center, to the right of center, or in the middle, that we \nwant a system that encourages people to work.\n  Most of us in America have a work ethic that is part of our \nbackground. It is part of what our parents shared with us. And, for \nwhatever measure of success we may have achieved in life, it is the \npresence of that work ethic that contributed to that success.\n  But a person who is on welfare, who gets a job, who achieves that \nfirst rung on the job ladder, oftentimes is confronted with a horrific \nchoice. Immediately that individual may be cut off from all medical \ncare, all child care assistance, and that individual may, in fact, find \nherself in a more disadvantageous position than before she attained \nemployment.\n  That part of our system, it seems to me, ought to be fundamentally \nchanged. We ought to be encouraging and rewarding those people like the \nyoung applicant whose interview I observed, who is going out, getting a \njob, and trying to help herself and her family.\n  Our present system provides all of the disincentives by not providing \ntransitional help for her, so she can get a little better job, that \npays a little bit more, so that she is able to provide for herself and \nher family. That, it seems to me, ought to be one of the structural \nincentives that any welfare reform ought to encourage.\n  The welfare system is replete with conflicts, both indefensible and \nmaddening. It is the sort of thing that encourages the American public \nto react as it does when the word ``welfare'' is mentioned.\n  I would like to talk about a few of those, if I may, Mr. President.\n  One of the key policy problem areas the eligibility workers brought \nto my attention is how the term ``household'' is defined for \ndetermining the eligibility of individuals living together at one \nresidence for different welfare assistance programs.\n  One of the most egregious examples of how policy and effect conflict \nis the Food Stamp Program definition of ``household.'' Assume with me \nfor the moment that two families have the same number of family \nmembers, and the same income. Applying the ``household'' definition can \nmean a family where everyone is a legal citizen is ineligible for food \nstamps, while a similar family with one member, who is an illegal \nalien, is eligible for such assistance.\n  Let me be more specific.\n  Let us assume family A and family B both have a total monthly \nhousehold income of $1,200, and each parent individually earns $600. \nFamily A's two working parents are both legal citizens. Family B also \nhas two working parents, but one is an illegal alien.\n  [[Page S5688]] Under the present system, in determining eligibility, \nthe eligibility worker looks at the household members, and finds two \nworking parents who are legal citizens. The worker must count family \nA's full $1,200 monthly income. Since family A's total household income \nis more than the monthly gross income allowed for food stamp \neligibility, which is $1,066 for a two-person family, family A is \nineligible.\n  However, with family B, the eligibility worker looks at the household \nmembers, and does not count the $600 income from the illegal alien \nparent. Only the half of family B's gross monthly household income \nearned by the legal citizen parent is counted. Family B's gross monthly \nhousehold income is only $600 a month, well under the maximum allowed.\n  Family B, with the illegal alien, receives food stamp assistance. \nAlthough technically the illegal alien member of family B does not \ndirectly receive food stamps, it is the member's presence as part of \nthe household that allows for this incongruous and indefensible result.\n  Why, I would ask, are we penalizing the two-parent working family \nwhose members are legal citizens by denying eligibility for food stamp \nassistance, while allowing a two-parent working family with an illegal \nalien family member to receive assistance? Would it not be fairer to \ndetermine a family's eligibility for assistance by looking at the total \nincome of the household rather than by who is in the household?\n  That is whether the individual parent is illegal or a legal alien. \nThis is a situation that must be corrected.\n  On the other hand, the Food Stamp Program specifically requires \nwelfare offices to report any illegal alien who tries to apply for \nbenefits. However, there is no similar requirement for the Aid to \nFamilies with Dependent Children Program. Why? It makes no sense as a \nmatter of policy.\n  Throughout this country, people are justifiably angry about illegal \naliens who have access to our Nation's welfare system. We can and we \nought to, at the very least, require all of our welfare assistance \nprograms to provide information and to report illegal aliens to the \nImmigration Service. We have all heard from INS that there is simply \nnot enough staff and funding available to investigate every alleged \nillegal alien, and that priority decisions\n must, by necessity, be made. But we are creating an atmosphere where \nthose who test the welfare system feel relatively safe in attempting to \ndefraud it. If we do not want illegal aliens to receive benefits they \nare not entitled to, we need to ensure adequate resources are available \nto prevent it from occurring.\n\n  Another area of policy conflict occurs with young teenage parents. We \nrequire young teenage parents under 20 years of age to participate in \neducation and training programs or lose their eligibility for AFDC \nassistance. But once that same young parent turns 20, she continues to \nbe eligible for AFDC benefits, while no longer being required to \nparticipate in any education or training program or to work.\n  So what kind of an incentive do we create for those mothers not to \nparticipate in education or job training programs and not to work?\n  Millions of American women in this country are single heads of \nhouseholds who get up every morning, get their kids ready to go to \nschool, get themselves out in the job force, and yet we provide no \nassistance for these women. And the welfare system, as it is currently \nstructured, provides assistance for those who neither seek employment \nnor participate in job training programs. Again, this is a policy \nconflict we ought to correct.\n  The eligibility workers also pointed out to me the difference in \ntreatment under the Food Stamp Program between disabled seniors living \non limited incomes and homeless people. Disabled seniors who usually \nhave a house many times are eligible to receive only $10 a month in \nfood stamp benefits. I was told by one eligibility worker that she \nactually sees seniors with cases of obvious malnutrition, something she \nsaid would just break your heart, but she is unable to provide more \nthan $10 under the system the way it is currently structured.\n  On the other hand, a homeless person gets expedited service, has \nbenefits available in 5 days, and is able to get the full benefit of \n$115 a month. It seems to me there is a dichotomy here that is \nirreconcilable. In the one instance, everyone agrees the deserving \nsenior, who currently gets only $10 a month, desperately needs more to \nsurvive, and yet she is not provided that assistance.\n  Another example of a policy and an effect in conflict occurs when an \nunmarried man and woman live together. Each person is considered \nseparately to determine eligibility for food stamp benefits, even if \nthe woman is pregnant with the man's child. It is only after their baby \nis born that the man and woman are considered to have a child in \ncommon, and are then treated as a married couple, and are no longer \neligible for separate individual benefits.\n  Also, couples who were married, who divorce, but continue to live \ntogether can be certified as separate persons for food stamps as long \nas they do not have a child in common. We ought to be encouraging, as a \nmatter of public policy, people to be married and to raise their \nchildren as a family. Allowing this aberration--two people living \ntogether, previously married, divorced, and now able to receive welfare \nassistance--clearly is a disincentive we must correct.\n  Intentional welfare fraud can also result in a conflict between \npolicy and effect. If a person receiving aid to families with dependent \nchildren benefits is discovered to have committed an intentional \nwelfare fraud, the fraud sanction is to reduce benefits by up to 10 \npercent or to eliminate the AFDC benefit. The same family may then be \neligible for more food stamps and a higher housing allowance because of \nthe reduced AFDC cash benefit, a benefit which was reduced as a \nconsequence of their intentional fraud perpetrated upon the system.\n  That creates the situation in which there is essentially no penalty \nfor this person, because the reduction in AFDC cash benefits is likely \nto be offset by increases in benefits from other programs.\n  Under the Food Stamp Program, the penalty for fraud is either a 10- \nor 20-percent reduction in benefits. However, the reality of this \nsituation is when someone commits a fraud, the welfare system basically \nends up paying such people to pay the system back for the previous \nfraud from one program, by increasing that person's benefits from other \nprograms. It makes absolutely no sense at all, Mr. President.\n  I have long been a supporter of strengthening our ability to enforce \nthe payment of child support from irresponsible parents. It came as a \nsurprise to me to learn that the Food Stamp Program, that I have long \nsupported as an essential part of our safety net program, does not \nrequire--does not require--its recipients to participate in efforts to \ntry to retrieve unpaid child support payments. All Federal welfare \nassistance programs must require its recipients to cooperate in State \nand Federal efforts to recover outstanding child support payments. We \nneed to use every available option to bring delinquent parents back to \nthe reality of their financial responsibility for their children.\n  The eligibility workers also brought to the table suggestions for \nways to help eliminate these policy conflicts.\n  First, they suggest more standardization of eligibility requirements \nfor all welfare programs. This would particularly help to prevent a \nfraud penalty reduction in benefits in one welfare program resulting in \nan increase in benefit eligibility in other programs, the net effect of \nwhich is to provide no net income loss or penalty for the individuals \nseeking to defraud the system.\n  They also suggest the penalty percentage reduction be made more \nflexible to allow for differences in the degree of frauds. \nAdditionally, the eligibility workers would like to see fraud penalties \nfollow the person. By that, Mr. President, we mean that under the \ncurrent system, an individual who is identified as having perpetrated a \nfraud in one State can collect and apply for benefits in another State.\n  If a person commits a welfare program fraud in one State, and then \nmoves to another State, the person's fraud penalty from the first State \nshould follow the person to the second State for collection.\n  Also, all welfare programs should require their recipients to \nparticipate in \n[[Page S5689]] State and Federal efforts to collect delinquent child \nsupport. As I stated before, we need to avail ourselves of all options \navailable to ensure child support payment is enforced. When I \nreintroduced my child support enforcement legislation, my new bill will \nprovide all welfare program recipients cooperate in child support \nenforcement efforts, as a condition of their receipt of assistance.\n  I want to reemphasize how much each of us can learn from the \npractical knowledge these frontline eligibility workers have about how \nthe welfare system works, where the problems are, and what the possible \nsolutions are to address them. They are not defenders of the welfare \nsystem status quo. They see both the positive and the negatives of the \ncurrent welfare system, and they are just as frustrated with the \nwelfare system as are the public and Members of Congress.\n  The welfare system must be substantially changed, and on that we can \nall agree. We can all agree too that there will always be people who \nwill need the safety net welfare assistance provides at some time in \ntheir lives, and we must ensure the net is there for them.\n  But as the Senate begins its deliberations on welfare reform, we need \nto heed the lessons learned by these eligibility workers. As we make \nthe necessary changes, let us always remember to work to ensure the \ncurrent policy conflicts are not carried forward. Let us not create \nmore unintended consequences when we change the system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/26/senate-section/article/S5687-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5689-S5694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          COMMONSENSE PRODUCT LIABIL- ITY AND LEGAL REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Parliamentary inquiry. What is the business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business before the Senate is \namendment No. 599.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to advocate the adoption of the \nBrown amendment No. 599 that proposes to restore the sanctions against \nfrivolous actions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  Most Americans would be shocked, I believe, to find that the Congress \nhas acted to gut the restrictions against bringing frivolous legal \naction. Many will ask in this Chamber, ``How is that possible? Who in \nthis Chamber would possibly vote or even advocate doing away with \nrestrictions on bringing frivolous actions in Federal courts?'' And the \nanswer is that the previous Congress did it through neglect. The last \nCongress took what I believe most Americans will find to be an \nabsolutely outrageous act by neglect, by refusing to consider the \nproposed changes to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Proposed \nchanges in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure become effective \nautomatically if Congress fails to act, and that is what Congress did--\nfail to even consider them.\n  There literally was not a bill brought up in the Judiciary Committee \nwhich allowed Congress to voice its concern about the proposed changes \nto the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  To make matters worse, the changes to rule 11 eliminated the \ndeterrence against frivolous lawsuits. Let me quote the dissent from \nthe Supreme Court opinion with regard to this matter:\n\n       It takes no expert to know that a measure which eliminates, \n     rather than strengthens, a deterrent to frivolous litigation \n     is not what the times demand.\n\n  Mr. President, that is true, and what we attempt to do with this \namendment is simply restore to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure a \nform of sanctions and admonitions against bringing frivolous \nlitigation. I intend to ask for a record vote on this, and it will be \nan opportunity for Members of the Senate to go on record: Do they favor \nour Federal courts being used to bring frivolous action, groundless \naction, or do they oppose it? It is a very clear vote. It is a very \nclear amendment. It is not complicated.\n  I think a legitimate question at this point is how in the world could \na change of this kind ever possibly have taken place without someone \nstanding up and calling the attention of this body to it and making \nsure it did not happen?\n  Let me address that because I think it is a relevant question and one \nto which Members deserve an answer.\n  In transmitting the changes to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \nChief Justice Rehnquist, in his letter of April 22, 1993, said the \nfollowing:\n\n       This transmittal does not necessarily indicate that the \n     Court itself would have proposed these amendments in the form \n     submitted.\n\n  For those in this Chamber who think the fact this was transmitted to \nus by the Supreme Court means they agreed with it, they need to take a \nlook at the very transmittal document itself. The Chief Justice makes \nit clear that this does not involve, or necessarily indicate, the Court \nfavors these changes.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important to note that none other than \nJustice White issued a separate statement with regard to that, and I \nintend to go into his statements\n voicing his concern about the procedure, and the dissent was filed by \nJustices Scalia in which Justice Thomas joined and Justice Souter \njoined as well.\n\n  I might mention that dissents with regard to changes in civil \nprocedure are very unusual, and it is an exceptional case in which \nanyone ever dissents because, frankly, as Justice White points out, it \nis their view that there is some constraint on the Court through \nquestions of constitutionality and of what role they should play in \nthis activity, which is basically a form of legislation.\n  Let me quote Justice White because I think he explains this process \nin a clear fashion:\n\n       28 U.S.C. Section 2072 empowers the Supreme Court to \n     prescribe general rules of practice and procedure and rules \n     of evidence for cases in the Federal courts, including \n     proceedings before magistrates and the court of appeals. But \n     the Court does not itself draft and initially propose these \n     rules. Section 2073 directs the Judicial Conference to \n     prescribe the procedures for proposing rules mentioned in \n     section 2072. The Conference has been authorized to appoint \n     committees to propose such rules. These rules advisory \n     committees are to be made up of members of the professional \n     bar and trial and appellate judges. The Conference is also to \n     appoint a standing committee on rules of practice and \n     evidence to review recommendations of the advisory committees \n     and to recommend to the Conference such rules and amendments \n     to those rules as may be necessary to maintain consistency \n     and otherwise promote the interest of justice. Any rules \n     approved by the Conference were transmitted to the Supreme \n     Court which, in turn, transmits any rules prescribed pursuant \n     to section 2072 to the Congress.\n\n  Mr. President, what he has outlined quite clearly is that these \nchanges in the rules, while transmitted through the Supreme Court, do \nnot necessarily represent the views of the Court--a view echoed by the \nChief Justice.\n  Further, Justice White states:\n\n       The Justices have hardly ever refused to transmit the rules \n     submitted by the Judicial Conference. And the fact that aside \n     from Justices Black and Douglas it has been quite rare for \n     any Justice to dissent from transmitting such rules suggests \n     that a sizable majority of the 21 justices who sat during \n     this period concluded that Congress intended them to have a \n     rather limited role in the rulemaking process. The vast \n     majority, including myself, obviously have not explicitly \n     subscribed to the Black-Douglas view that many of the rules \n     proposed dealt with substantive matters the Constitution \n     reserved to Congress, and that in any event were prohibited \n     by 2072 in injunctions against abridging, enlarging, or \n     modifying substantive rights.\n\n  Mr. President, I mention this because I think it is critical as \nMembers consider this subject to ask themselves whether or not the \nchanges that went into effect automatically carried with them an aura \nthat we should respect and honor and not question or even review. \nJustice White concludes in his opinion that was transmitted stating \nthis:\n\n       In conclusion, I suggest it would be a mistake for the \n     bench, the bar, or the Congress, to assume that we are \n     duplicating the functions performed by the standing committee \n     of the Judicial Conference with respect to changes in the \n     various rules which come to us for transmittal.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe the record is quite clear. It is a mistake \nfor anyone to come before this body and to suggest that the fact that \nthe Supreme Court transmitted these proposed rules changes means that \nthey think they are good rules changes. I think the statement of \nJustice White, and particularly the dissent of the three Justices, \nwhich is almost unprecedented, \n[[Page S5690]] indicates very clearly that the Court itself has serious \nconcerns.\n  Mr. President, the reality is this: Congress has the power in the \nConstitution to enact statutes. Congress did not perform its function \nbecause no vehicle was allowed to be considered. That is why I think it \nis important that we provide for the consideration of these changes \nright now. Let me state quite clearly, I would like to go back to the \nold rules. I think the old rules were not only far superior to the \nchanges that happened by default, but I think they were much stronger. \nBut the amendment before you is a version that is somewhere between the \nold rules and the new rules. The amendment adopts or accepts many of \nthe changes that seemed to have articulable support behind them or for \nwhich the Trial Lawyers Association could come forward with reasonable \narguments. So this amendment does not go as far as I would like it to. \nIt does not restore the old rules. But it does restore a portion of the \nold rules in areas where I felt there was literally no reasonable \njustification for accepting the gutting changes proposed by the \nJudicial Conference.\n  Mr. President, rule 11 is one of the most important tools courts have \nto fight frivolous, baseless, and harassing suits. This amendment gives \nMembers a chance to go on record on that question. Do you want \nfrivolous actions brought? Do you want baseless and harassing suits \ncluttering up our courts or not? That is what this amendment is all \nabout.\n  Swift action against frivolous lawsuits and claims save time and \nmoney and taxpayers' dollars and promotes public respect for the \nintegrity of the Federal court. I think that may be the most single \nimportant question raised by this amendment and those rule changes. \nShouldn't our Federal courts require integrity in their process and \nsubstance in the allegations? Those who want to gut rule 11 will say, \nno, we should not have any restrictions in this area. But I believe \nmaintaining the integrity of the Federal court system is important, and \nthat is why this amendment is brought before the Senate.\n  The new version of rule 11, which was changed upon the recommendation \nof the Judicial Conference, eviscerates the deterrent value of rule 11. \nThat is not just my opinion. It is the opinion of attorneys and judges \nwho have reviewed the action and who share my concern about our turning \nour backs on ensuring the integrity of the Court.\n  The December 1, 1993, version of rule 11 allows frivolous lawsuits to \ngo forward. It allows baseless lawsuits. It actually allows attorneys \nto file allegations without knowing them to be true. Let me repeat that \nbecause I think it is the core of what we are talking about. It allows \nattorneys to go into court and to file allegations without knowing them \nto be true.\n  How can anyone come before this body and say that makes sense? How \ncan anyone come before the American people and say we are going to set \nup a court system in which you are going to have filings in which even \nthe paid advocate of the cause does not know to be true? Mr. President, \nthe rules allow attorneys to make assertions without any factual basis \nand before they have done their research. Let me repeat that. It allows \nattorneys to literally make assertions without having any factual basis \nfor those assertions. It is scandalous to suggest that our courts are \ngoing to be used for hearings on allegations that have no factual basis \nand before any research is done. That is ludicrous, it is shameful, and \nit is why it is so important for us to move ahead and to correct what \nis clearly an abuse by and neglect of previous Congresses.\n  In short, the December 1, 1993, version encourages the kind of \nbaseless suits and claims which rule 11 was literally enacted to \nprevent. The new rule 11 says, ``Sue first and ask questions later.''\n  Mr. President, that is not an exaggeration. That is literally what \nrule 11 allows in its current form. Sue first and do research later.\n  What this amendment does is put teeth back into rule 11. It does so \nby making sanctions for frivolous suits mandatory, as they once were.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes and go through \nspecifically what this amendment does, how it compares with the old \nrule, and how it compares with the new rule.\n  I think it is important for Members to know and understand that what \nis before them is a very moderate version. The amendment adopts many of \nthe changes the Judicial Conference wanted. But it does not adopt the \nconcept that we will gut rule 11 and threaten the integrity of the \ncourt system.\n  How can anyone looking at our Federal court system want to allow \ncourts to be cluttered up with frivolous actions? The facts are these: \nIn 1990, over 10 percent of the Federal district court cases were over \n3 years old. Mr. President, we have such a huge backlog that we \nliterally have more than 10 percent of the cases who, after 3 years, \nhave not been resolved.\n  The current trend of more and more cases filed in Federal court \ncontinues. In 1992, over 226,000 cases were filed, and literally, under \nthe current trends, the number of cases will double every 14 years. In \nthe face of eviscerating rule 11, Congress did not act to save the one \neffective tool that deters frivolous litigation. Congress allowed a new \nrule to be adopted that weakens the process despite evidence and \nopinions of judges and lawyers.\n  Mr. President, I want to go into those opinions because the judges \nand lawyers that work with this are alarmed at the changes in rule 11. \nSomeone will say, well, now, wait a minute, at least there was a \ncommittee, there are some people who admit they like these changes, and \nthat is the Judicial Conference Committee that dealt with this. Take a \nlook at the attitudes of the bar in general, because one should not \nassume that the fact that the Judicial Conference or, more \nspecifically, a committee of that conference, made the recommendations, \nthat they speak for attorneys and judges across this country.\n  Here are the facts: In a recent study by the Federal Judicial Center, \nthey found that a strong majority of Federal judges support the old \nrule 11, not new rule 11, but the old rule 11. The study found that 95 \npercent of Federal judges who responded believed that rule 11 does not \nimpede the development of law. They found that 71.9 percent believe \nthat the benefits of rule 11 outweighed any additional requirement of \njudicial time. They found that 80.9 percent believe the old version of \nrule 11 had a positive effect on litigation in the report. Mr. \nPresident, let me repeat that: Over 80 percent of the judges felt the \nold version of rule 11 had a positive impact on litigation in the \nFederal courts. The proponents of the new form of rule 11 that come to \nthis body and claim this somehow has the blessing of the legal \ncommunity have not looked at the facts. This had the blessing of a \ngroup of insiders, of a committee, but it did not have the blessing of \nthe bar as a whole. Over 80 percent believe the old rule 11 should be \nretained in its current form.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, would the distinguished Senator from \nColorado take a question?\n  Mr. BROWN. I would be happy to take a question at the completion of \nmy remarks.\n  Mr. FORD. I wanted to insert because the Senator said ``of those \njudges responding,'' and I did not know whether half responded, 25 \npercent responded--the Senator is using the 80 percent--or whether 100 \npercent responded and the Senator is using 80 percent. ``Of those who \nresponded,'' I wonder if it was a large number or a small number.\n  Mr. BROWN. I appreciate the question of the distinguished Senator. I \nthink he may not have heard in my remarks I quoted the 1990 study of \nthe Federal Judiciary Center, and I will be happy to supply the Senator \nwith the study.\n  It might also be noted that rule 11 issues were raised in only 2 to 3 \npercent of all cases; that they concluded that rule 11 imposes only \nmodest burdens on Federal judges and that rule 11 sanctions have \ntypically been taken in the form of monetary charges payable to the \ninjured party.\n  Mr. President, I want to turn now to the rules changes themselves. I \nwill, of necessity, deal and focus particularly on three of them. There \nare additional nuances, but I think these three are the most important \nand at the heart of the amendment that is before this body.\n  Mr. President, the first one that we want to look at is the old rule, \nwhich required that the attorney or the party \n[[Page S5691]] must sign the pleading of the motion and indicate that \nthe facts designated therein represent the best of the signer's \nknowledge and that they are based on information and belief formed \nafter a reasonable inquiry that is well grounded in fact and that is \nnot interposed for improper purposes such as to harass or cause \nunnecessary delay or needlessly increase the cost.\n  Mr. President, the new rule guts those provisions that are meant to \nensure integrity in the process. Here is how it reads:\n\n       By presenting to court, an attorney is certifying the \n     allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary \n     support, or if specifically so identified, are likely to have \n     evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for \n     further investigation or discovery.\n\n  The option which then controls is ``or likely to have support, if \ninvestigated.'' In other words, they do not have to certify any longer \nthat they are true or that they have investigated them. They are \nliterally saying we can bring filings in the court that have not been \ninvestigated and which a person does not know are true.\n  Here is what we do with the version that is presented in this bill. \nWe say, ``by presenting to court, an attorney is certifying the \nallegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support or \nare grounded in fact.'' It is less severe than the old rule. I would \nlike to go back to the old rule. But at least this amendment requires \nthat the allegations are grounded in fact or have evidentiary support.\n  Now, that is a clear question. Should filings in Federal court be \ngrounded in fact? Should they have evidentiary support? Or should a \nperson be allowed to find anything they want without a requirement of \nknowing that it is true? Or even having been required to investigate it \nbefore it is filed? It is a very clear question. It is one I think \nMembers will be anxious to cast their vote on and let citizens know how \nthey feel.\n  The second change deals with an additional question. Let me read the \nold rule:\n\n       If a pleading, motion or other paper is signed in violation \n     of this court rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own \n     initiative, shall impose upon the person who signed it, a \n     represented party or both, an appropriate sanction.\n\n  In other words, if a person is guilty of violating the rules, that \nperson will get sanctioned. That must not sound very unusual for \nobservers. Why would we want to change that?\n  The new rule does a couple of things. What it says is that if a \nperson is guilty, if they violate the rules, a person does not have to \nbe sanctioned.\n In other words, an opposing counsel can point out that this was done \nwithout any background, and when the attorney--who has made an \ninaccurate filing, when an attorney who has violated the rules--is \ncaught, the new rules say that even though you are guilty, even though \nyou have been caught, even though you have caused the other party harm, \nyou can get off scot-free. That is not my idea of justice and I do not \nthink it is the American people's idea of justice.\n\n  Here is what we do. We restore that portion of the old rules that \nsays if you are guilty you are going to get sanctioned. It leaves it up \nto the court to decide what the appropriate sanction is, but at least \nwe say if you are guilty of violating the rules and it is shown to the \ncourt, you will be sanctioned. Those who want violators to get away \nwithout being sanctioned will want to vote against this amendment. But \nthose who think if you are guilty you ought to be sanctioned will want \nto vote for it.\n  The third one I want to summarize is one that I think Members will \nfind hard to imagine that the committee recommended. The new rule says \nthat if you are guilty of violating the rules, and even though under \ntheir changes you do not have to be sanctioned, but if you are \nsanctioned even though you do not have to be sanctioned, then they say \nthe penalty for this misbehavior can be paid to the court and not to \nthe injured party. Talk about rigging the rules. They are saying: First \nof all, we are going to dilute what is impermissible behavior; but if \nyou are found guilty of impermissible behavior even under the diluted \nrules, you do not have to be sanctioned; and even if under the diluted \nrules you are found guilty and you are sanctioned, the money does not \ngo to the injured party. In other words, they pull the rug out from \nunder any incentive of the injured party to seek redress.\n  The amendment addresses the third area in a pretty basic and simple \nway. It restores the preference that if you are guilty and if you are \nsanctioned, the awards first go back to the injured party, not to the \ncourt. The amendment reads as follows:\n\n       A sanction imposed for violation of this rule may consist \n     of reasonable attorneys' fees and other expenses incurred as \n     a result of the violation, directives of a nonmonetary \n     nature, or an order to pay penalty into court or to a party.\n\n  In other words, we eliminate the priority that the sanction go to the \ncourt and give the court discretion in that area. That is basically \nwhat we are talking about in this amendment. We restore to the rules \nsome of the integrity of the process. We indicate that there will be \nsanctions if you are guilty, and we eliminate the favored status of \nhaving the penalty, if it is imposed, go to the court and allow it to \ngo to the injured party if they wish.\n  This does not solve all the problems with frivolous litigation. I \nwish it did. But it does restore some of the integrity to rule 11 and \nsome of its effectiveness.\n  I want to quote the dissent signed by three Justices of the Supreme \nCourt when they forwarded these. It is very unusual for dissents to be \nwritten in these transmittals, but I think the words speak for \nthemselves.\n\n       In my view, the sanctions in the new rule are not strong \n     enough; thus, the new rule eliminates a significant and \n     necessary deterrent to frivolous litigation . . . and perhaps \n     worst of all introduce into the trial process an element that \n     is contrary to the nature of our adversary system.\n\n  That is what this is all about. Will we eliminate a deterrent to \nfrivolous litigation? Will we burden the district courts? That is \nreally what this is all about. I think a reasonable question could be \nraised at this point and that reasonable question would be simply this: \nDo lawyers, do attorneys behave differently if these sanctions, \nmonetary sanctions exist? If there are mandatory sanctions for \nviolating the rules, does it affect the behavior of attorneys? That is \nthe assumption this process is based on anyway, that by having a rule \nthat prohibits frivolous litigation and provides mandatory sanctions, \nthat counsel will behave differently; they will behave different if \nthey have to pay a mandatory penalty than they will if they do not.\n  There is some evidence on that. There is some evidence because before \n1983 you did not have mandatory sanctions and after 1983 and before \nthis recent change you did have monetary sanctions. So there was a \nstudy done. It is known as the Nelken study, by Melissa L. Nelken. She \ndid a study of rule 11 and she considered the impact on the Federal \npractices of both lawyers and judges in the northern district of \nCalifornia. It is confined to that area. It was part of the ninth \ncircuit.\n  The survey questionnaire was sent to some 17 judges, 7 magistrates, \nand 107 attorneys. All of these individuals had been involved in rule \n11 proceedings. That was done to make sure the survey was conducted \namong people who had some knowledge of the process and some experience \nwith it. Mr. President, 68 attorneys, 64 percent of them, responded; 12 \njudges or magistrates, or 50 percent of those, responded to the survey. \nHere is what it showed.\n  The question was, ``Has amended rule 11 changed your practice, if \nany, in the following areas?''\n  The change they are talking about is the change of making sanctions \nmandatory in 1983. Mr. President, 46 percent of the respondents \nindicated that they had engaged in additional prefiling factual \ninquiry. What we are literally seeing is 46 percent of those attorneys, \nthose practitioners, those on the line, had said when sanctions are \nmandatory they engaged in more prefiling factual inquiry than they did \nwhen they were not mandatory. I think that is a plus. I think that \nimproves the integrity of the system.\n  Mr. President, 33 percent indicated additional prefiling legal \ninquiry; that is, when sanctions were mandatory, 33 percent indicated--\nadmitted that they had done additional prefiling legal inquiry over and \nabove what they did when sanctions were not mandatory.\n  This is only one study. It is a limited area. But I think it is real \nproof of \n[[Page S5692]] what our common sense would tell us. When sanctions are \nrequired there is more work that goes into making sure the filings are \ncorrect than when there is no sanction.\n  I want to take one more quote out of the opinion of the Supreme Court \naccompanying the recommended changes in 1993. This is at the conclusion \nof the dissent. It says as follows:\n\n       It takes no expert to know that a measure which eliminates \n     rather than strengthens a deterrent to frivolous litigation \n     is not what the times demand.\n\n  I do not think it could be said any clearer. Should we eliminate \ndeterrence to frivolous litigation? That is what this amendment is all \nabout. If you favor deterring frivolous litigation, you will want to \nvote yes. If you do not want to deter frivolous litigation, then you \nwill vote no.\n  It boils down to these substantive changes in the rules--to efforts \nto restore these basic rules: First, should filings be grounded in \nfact? I think they should.\n  Second, should sanctions be required if you file frivolous actions? \nIf you are found guilty of filling frivolous actions, should sanctions \nbe required? I think they should.\n  Third, should the injured party have a standing for compensation, or \nmore particularly should the priority of the court be to have a \nsanction for someone who is guilty, and should the priority be for that \nmoney to go to the court, or should it be the priority or at least the \noption for that money to go to the injured party? I think the injured \nparty should not be shortchanged in this process.\n  These are moderate changes in rule 11. Again, they do not go back to \nthe old rule 11 which I would like to. They do adopt some of the \nchanges proposed by the conference. But, Mr. President, this is an \nimportant matter because this is an effort to restore the integrity to \nthe legal process. It is an effort to restore integrity to our courts \nand discourage frivolous actions by restoring rule 11. I think it is \nappropriate for this bill. I do not think the amendment could be more \nappropriate because at the heart of addressing the problems with the \nlitigation system in the United States--at the heart of it--is to \nrestore integrity to the system. That is what this amendment is \nintending to do.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to comment very briefly on \nthe eloquent remarks of my friend from Colorado. His remarks are \nequally and highly thoughtful and persuasive. There is no question but \nthat this Senator strongly supports his judgments with respect to rule \n11 and the desirability of a return to a much more fair and balanced \nsuch rule.\n  At the same time, Mr. President, I must say that rule 11 has little \nif anything to do with the subject before the Senate, the product \nliability bill, which almost universally will apply to litigation \nbrought in State courts and, therefore, whether or not it is \nappropriate to be included with this bill is a question which I think \nrelates primarily to the attitude of Members of the body itself.\n  This is an extremely controversial bill. Should this strengthen its \nchances for passage, it would be welcome. If it weakens the chance for \npassage of something as important as product liability, I hope at some \npoint or another the bill would be withdrawn and dealt with at a more \nappropriate time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Product \nLiability Fairness Act which I consider to be a very important piece of \nlegislation. I believe it is the principal first step in reforming our \nincreasingly irrational, often unfair and very costly civil justice \nsystem. This system is burdening our economy, it is burdening America's \nconsumers and its middle class; ultimately it is weighing down the \ncommunity institutions and organizations that help us live together as \nfriends and neighbors. By enacting product liability reform, we can \nbegin reinvigorating our economy, giving consumers a choice of products \nand decreasing the expense and unpredictability of our tort system.\n  This bill makes a number of much-needed reforms. First, it caps \npunitive damages in product liability suits. This reform does not limit \nanybody's right to recover in full for any damages suffered. That right \nremains intact even if the recovery runs into the millions. Rather, it \nmerely limits the punitive damages that can be awarded over and above \nwhat is needed to compensate those injured by defective products.\n  These punitive damages are supposed to function as a punishment for \nthe defendant. But because they are awarded to claimants, their \npotential availability attracts lawsuits whenever somebody thinks he or \nshe might get lucky and hit the jackpot.\n  Capping these damages will place a real limit on windfall profits in \nproduct liability lawsuits and thus lead to fewer frivolous claims \nbeing filed and less unnecessary extension of lawsuits which could be \nsettled.\n  In addition, the bill would eliminate joint liability for noneconomic \ndamages in product cases, and replace it with proportionate liability. \nIt thus would end the costly and unjust practice of making a company \npay for all damages when it is only responsible for, say, 20 percent, \njust because the other defendants already have gone bankrupt. Instead \neach defendant would have to pay only for the noneconomic damage he or \nshe actually caused.\n  The bill also establishes important limits to the liability of \nproduct sellers, as well as suppliers of raw materials critical to the \nproduction of life-saving medical devices. Generally speaking, the bill \nmakes clear that these sellers and suppliers can be held liable only \nfor their own misconduct in connection with the product. If, for \nexample, the purchaser misuses the product, then that purchaser is \nresponsible to the extent he or she is injured on account of his or her \nown misuse.\n  These provisions go a good way toward restoring individual \nresponsibility as the cornerstone of tort law. They also recognize an \nimportant problem with our legal system: Ultimately, in its current \nform the system is profoundly anticonsumer.\n  The tort tax imposed by our legal system raises prices on many \nimportant goods, rendering them unavailable to poor people. And in \nextreme cases, our legal system can literally bring death or misery; it \ndoes so by driving off the market drugs that can cure terrible but rare \ndiseases, or medical devices for which raw materials are unavailable on \naccount of liability risks.\n  Mr. President, this is not mere hyperbole. There are some 5,000 \ndiseases that affect small numbers of Americans. Many of these \ndiseases, such as cystinosis, a fatal kidney disease, and leprosy, are \nextremely serious. But a number of them go untreated. Pharmaceutical \ncompanies cannot afford to market drugs to treat these diseases because \nthe cost of liability insurance is prohibitive.\n  To give just one example: A West German chemical company \nat one time supplied Americans with botchyoulinum. If \nproperly used this drug, otherwise a paralytic poison, can control a \nrare but incapacitating disease, characterized by uncontrollable \ntwitching of the eye muscles. Unfortunately the company cut off \nAmerican supplies to avoid the risk of being held liable should people \nmisuse its product.\n  And this is no isolated instance. A recent Gallup survey found that \none out of every five small businesses decides not to introduce a new \nproduct, or not to improve an existing one, out of fear of lawsuits. \nAnd, according to a Conference Board survey, 47 percent of firms \nwithdraw products from the market, 25 percent discontinue some form of \nresearch, and 8 percent lay off employees, all out of fear of lawsuits.\n  Mr. President, this bill takes important steps to address these \nproblems. The reforms I have specifically noted, as well as others in \nthe bill, will help consumers. They will help our economy. And they \nwill help our legal system. I pledge my full support for this well-\nconsidered legislation.\n  However, I would also like to take this opportunity to urge my \ncolleagues to go further. And I mean go further in two respects. First, \nthe reforms under consideration apply only to product liability. That \nis, they affect only suits involving manufacturers' and sellers' \nliability for defects in manufacturing and handling products. And \nsecond, the reforms do not address certain key flaws in our civil \njustice system.\n  The problems with our current system are deep and pervasive. They are \n\n[[Page S5693]] not limited to product liability. They affect \nhomeowners, accountants, farmers, volunteer groups, charitable \norganizations, small businesses, State and local governments, \narchitects, engineers, doctors and patients, employers and employees. \nIn short, they affect all of us.\n  We need to repair our system for all Americans. And doing that will \nrequire reforms that go beyond the field of products liability. We must \nreplace our litigation lottery with a civil justice system that is less \ncostly, more predictable, and ultimately more fair to everybody. And we \nmust replace the current incentives to sue with incentives to settle \ndisputes before they get into court.\n  This is why in the course of the next few days I intend, along with \nothers, to offer and support amendments that would broaden the \nlegislation currently under consideration.\n  These amendments fall in two classes. The first class takes valuable \nreforms currently in the current product liability reform bill and \napplies them to other kinds of cases. Thus I will be leading an effort \nto broaden application of this bill's joint and several liability \nreform and supporting an effort to broaden application of this bill's \npunitive damages reform.\n  The other category of amendment I am supporting would reorient our \ncurrent system's distorted incentives. Today, Mr. President, our tort \nsystem encourages people to spend money on lawyers and litigation \nrather than on resolving disputes quickly and compensating deserving \nclaimants.\n  The right to know and rapid recovery amendments I have introduced \nwith my colleague from Kentucky will promote speedy compensation for \nclaimants, save attorney's fees, greatly reduce the cost of liability \ninsurance and change our culture of litigation, which brings me to my \nlast point, Mr. President. A broad approach to legal reform will help \nour communities. Our current system discourages the voluntarism and \ncivic participation that hold our towns and neighborhoods together. A \nGallup survey found that 8 percent of nonprofit organizations had \nvolunteers resign over liability concerns; 16 percent reported \nvolunteers withholding their services due to fear of liability, and 49 \npercent reported seeing fewer volunteers willing to serve in leadership \npositions.\n  This is disastrous, Mr. President. When almost half our nonprofit \norganizations are finding it more difficult to get people to serve in \nleadership positions, we are in trouble. When our citizens are afraid \nto serve their neighbors out of fear of being sued, we are in danger of \nlosing that sense of common cause and mutual reliance that is at the \nheart of any community.\n  We have been hearing a good deal lately about the breakdown of our \ncommunities. And it is a real problem. This problem arises in part from \npeoples' understandable fear of local bullies and strangers who prey on \nthem in their streets and homes.\n  But today our law-abiding citizens suffer from another even more \ndebilitating fear: a fear of each other.\n  Too many Americans are afraid to get involved with their local little \nleague or Girl Scouts or volunteer fire department because they \nseriously believe that if they make an honest mistake they will be sued \nand lose everything they have merely for trying to help.\n  So long as Americans see one another as potential plaintiffs, they \ncannot see one another as neighbors. So long as we encourage lawsuits \nrather than personal responsibility and early dispute resolution our \ncitizens will fear even those they know well--and come to see them as \nstrangers whom they themselves will sue at the slightest provocation.\n  Neighbors no longer trust one another enough to look out for each \nother, and each others' children. The result is a breakdown of mutual \nsupport and pride in the community, leaving it easy prey for other \nsocial ills like crime and delinquency.\n  We must break this destructive cycle, Mr. President, for the sake of \nour families and our children. We must begin to rebuild our communities \nby restoring the sense that we can count on one another's good will and \nforgiveness for innocent mistakes. We must restore trust among our \ncitizens, and health and vigor to our economy, by remaking our civil \njustice system to reward neighborliness rather than stubborn greed.\n  Mr. President, we must reform our tort system so that we encourage \npeople to come together on their own to settle disputes before they end \nup in court, costing time, money, and bad feelings.\n  The result will be a reinvigorated economy, more jobs and necessary \nproducts for us all, and a revival of that civility and common feeling \nsome of us remember with regret from an era not too long ago; an era in \nwhich Americans thought of one another not as potential plaintiffs and \ndefendants but as neighbors trying to help each other in making their \ncommunity a better place.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair.\n  I am starting my seventh year in the Senate, and every year it seems \nas if we always come up with a product liability bill. I have served on \nthe Commerce Committee under the leadership of Senator Hollings and \nunder the leadership also of Senator Danforth, who was a great champion \nof product liability reform.\n  I want to thank Senator Gorton, who has picked up the traces, so to \nspeak, and especially to Senator Rockefeller who through all of the \nyears I have been here, starting the seventh year, has also played a \nvery strong part in leadership on this issue, diligently trying to seek \nreform.\n  I have supported product liability reform primarily because I believe \nit is time now for Congress to act on what some would term barriers to \neconomic growth in this country. And the need to reform our product \nliability system is no less urgent now while the economy is seemingly \nhealthy than if we would experience economic downturn.\n  The current system drives up costs in nearly every sector of the \neconomy and does very little to improve our quality of life and does \nvery little to increase safety at the workplace. In the last 30 years, \nthe number of cases filed in Federal courts has more than tripled, to \nover 250,000 a year.\n  Now, this issue, yes, is a jobs issue; it is a competitiveness issue, \nand some would term it even a moral issue. Currently, the typical \nAmerican manufacturer faces product liability costs that are 20 to 50 \ntimes higher than that of his or her foreign competitor. This \nadditional cost makes American companies less competitive; they lose \nmarket share to foreign competition.\n  So what do they do? They raise prices and they lay off workers. The \ncosts of runaway litigation are felt by American companies, workers \nand, yes, consumers alike. It is not just a big business issue either. \nIt affects small businesses as much if not more than our large \nbusinesses.\n  The 1,100-percent rise in the number of Federal product liability \ncases in the 1970's and 1980's has driven up the cost of liability \ninsurance to astronomical amounts. The burden of this increased cost is \nproportionately much greater for small business and in some cases it is \nthe element that is a ``make or break'' issue for them.\n  This issue is most often presented as a consumer issue, Mr. \nPresident. I disagree with those who say that if you are for product \nliability reform, you are against the consumer. I reject that argument. \nConsumers do not benefit when the business community has to protect \nitself from runaway lawsuits. They pay for it. As we have often been \ntold, it just goes into the operating costs; that companies and \ncorporations do not pay taxes either. People pay taxes.\n And the threat of lawsuits keeps the vital consumer products from the \nmarket and discourages safety and other improvements that would make it \na better product. Moreover, liability stifles research and development \nfor new consumer and medical products.\n\n  This bill seeks to bring fairness to a system without taking away an \ninjured person's right to a fair and speedy trial and, yes, just \nsettlement. Right now the system fails to compensate those injured in \nproportion to their losses and it takes them far too long to receive \nthe compensation.\n  The people who benefit the most in the current system, let us face \nit, are the principals involved, the lawyers. Studies say that 50 to 70 \ncents of every \n[[Page S5694]] dollar a jury awards to an injured person goes to the \nattorney. This hardly seems like a system that benefits the consumer.\n  There is a tremendous amount of support for this liability lawsuit \nreform in my home State of Montana. In a recent poll, 89 percent of \nMontanans indicated that the current system has problems and it should \nbe fixed. There is a growing awareness that the only winners in the \nlawsuit lottery game are the attorneys and the professional plaintiffs.\n  S. 565 will reform the current system to make it more effective. We \nmust protect people from careless manufacturers and defective products. \nThis bill does not compromise that objective. It just ensures that we \ndo so in a fashion that still allows American businesses to compete and \ngrow in a global economy.\n  Congress has the opportunity to reform our product liability system, \nand I hope that we do not miss this window of opportunity and that we \ntake advantage of it. This bill must become law. I ask my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I want to signal my strong support for S. \n565, the Product Liability Fairness Act. My distinguished colleagues, \nSenators Gorton, Rockefeller, and Pressler, are to be commended for \ntheir leadership on this particular legislation.\n  This legislation is needed for several reasons. Our present system of \nliability has been estimated to cost the American economy an astounding \n$117 billion. In addition to this tort tax, our system of liability \nstifles innovation and prevents better--often safer--products from \nreaching the marketplace. The present system of liability also \nundermines American competitiveness, both here and abroad.\n  There has been a concerted effort to spread misinformation about \nthese reforms--scare tactics--in order to hide the real issues. So let \nme be clear: The reforms contained in this bill, despite efforts to \nportray them otherwise, do not prevent persons who are harmed from \nrecovering full compensation for their injuries. In fact, this \nlegislation addresses abuses that undermine such compensation. Nor does \nthis legislation alter civil rights and environmental laws in any way. \nIn fact, the legislation explicitly excludes such Federal laws.\n  What this legislation is about is fairness. Our legal system is one \nof the bedrocks of our free society. But over the last 25 years, it has \nsuccumbed to efforts to turn it away from American principles, \nindividual responsibilities and justice. In many cases, our system of \nliability resembles a lottery, where damage awards become windfalls and \noften deserving plaintiffs do without.\n  Thus, I strongly support the provisions of this bill that seek to \nrein in abusive punitive damages. Punitive damages are not intended to \ncompensate victims, as the name suggests, they are intended to punish \nwrongdoing. But punitive damages have been widely abused in recent \nyears, and the problem now affects every American.\n  Mr. President, I plan to offer an amendment later today. As I \nunderstand, after a couple of votes and after disposition of the Brown \namendment, I will be recognized to offer an amendment. That may be \nlater tonight, 7 or 8 o'clock or it may be sometime tomorrow morning. \nIn any event, I will offer the amendment later and expand on these \nprotections at that time and what I believe the amendment does and does \nnot do.\n  But I am talking about protection for Little League players, the Girl \nScouts, and small business. Groups like that are at risk from abusive \nlawsuits and overwhelming punitive damages. I hope to give you some \nexamples of how this affects the Girl Scouts, Little League, and \nothers--how many boxes of cookies they have to sell to protect \nthemselves from frivolous lawsuits, in some cases.\n  We cannot allow the threat of liability to keep hard-working \nAmericans from volunteering their time to help. We must not allow the \nthreat of liability to sink small businesses who often can barely keep \ntheir doors open.\n  Although I support the Rockefeller-Gorton bill, I believe we cannot \nsimply stop with reforms that help big business alone. We have to take \na look at small business and some of the charitable groups and other \ngroups that most American families have contact with. It is as much our \nresponsibility to help the little guy, and that is what my amendment \nwill achieve.\n  This amendment leaves the underlying provisions on the measure of \npunitive damages intact. Thus, punitive damages would be limited to \nthree times economic damages, or $250,000, whichever is greater.\n  What my amendment would do is to take the same provision in the \nunderlying bill and extend these protections to Americans who are often \nleast able to cope with outrageous punitive damages.\n  Thus, instead of limiting these protections to product liability \nactions, my amendment would extend them to ``any civil action affecting \ninterstate commerce.''\n  I emphasize again that this amendment in no way undermines full \ncompensation to victims, nor does it alter Federal laws.\n  Most of the issues raised by the Rockefeller-Gorton bill are well \nknown. The Commerce Committee has considered similar legislation in the \n97th, 99th, 100th, 101st, and 102d Congresses, and a similar bill was \nconsidered on the floor in the 102d and 103d Congresses. We will have a \nreasonable time to debate these issues, but it is my hope we will not \nengage in dilatory tactics to distract the Senate from moving forward \non this important legislation.\n  Having said that, I hope we will complete action on this legislation \nsometime midweek next week. I know that on Friday of this week the \nDemocrats have a conference outside the city and Republicans have a \nconference inside the city. But we will be in session late tonight and \nlate, late tomorrow night and, hopefully, we can at that point see the \nend when we might complete action on the legislation.\n  It would be my intention to file a cloture motion if it appears we \ncannot complete action in a timely fashion. I will say, as I have said \nbefore, the Senate has a lot of work to do to catch up with many things \nthat have been sent to us from the House. My view is we will get it \ndone. It will mean we will have fewer recesses in the Senate. It means \nwe will be here many more days probably than the House will be in the \nnext 100 days. It will mean long evenings. But I hope my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle understand that we have a responsibility, that \nwe all made statements to get here to the voters of the United States, \nand we intend to keep our word to the American voters, win, lose, or \ndraw.\n  So it is my hope we will have a very productive several weeks before \nthe brief Memorial Day recess and that will be about the last recess, \nmaybe with the exception of a couple of days July 4 and 5 before we \ndecide what to do with the August recess. It is not a statutory recess. \nIt can be changed by resolution and it may be if we cannot complete our \nwork in time we might have to abbreviate the August recess. I hope that \nis not the case, because many of my colleagues have made plans to be \nwith their families and made other plans. So we will do the best we can \nto accommodate people on both sides of the aisle.\n  I do believe that we have a responsibility. We know it takes longer \nin the Senate. We know the Founding Fathers planned it that way. This \nwas to be the deliberative body and we are deliberate, believe me. \nSometimes it is almost too deliberate. Today is an exceptional day \nbecause many of our colleagues are attending services for former \nSenator John Stennis. I think 25 of our colleagues are in Mississippi \ntoday. So that necessarily means we may not accomplish much until they \nreturn about 5 o'clock.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/26/senate-section/article/S5689-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5694-S5695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECESS UNTIL 2:30 P.M.\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I wanted to add my voice, on behalf of the \npeople of California, my voice that is going to say today that we send \nour love, our condolences, and our sympathies to our friends in \nOklahoma.\n  A couple of California residents happened to be in that building at \nthe time of the blast so we certainly share in this tragedy. I send my \nwords of thanks to the incredible people who have shown up from all \nparts of this country to help the people of Oklahoma City cope with \nthis tragedy.\n  I have a lot of thoughts and feelings, but rather than say them \ntoday, I will be writing them down because I do not want to misspeak or \nin any way say anything that could be misconstrued.\n  Today I just wanted to say that I am very fearful that what occurred \nin Oklahoma City could be a signal that America is losing something \nvery special that we have always had, which is an ability to take our \ndissent and take it right to the ballot box.\n  If we lose that, and if we all do not guard against violence, we will \nlose the very essence of our Government, the Government of, by, and for \nthe people. When we attack people who work for the Government, we are \nattacking our neighbors and friends, and indeed we are attacking \nourselves.\n  One of the things that has concerned me for a long time is the \ndropoff in voter participation that I have seen. There are many people \nthat are disgruntled and discontented with laws that are passed, the \ndebates that we have here.\n  I encourage them to participate, to take that frustration and those \nfeelings and organize politically and get your candidates here to the \nU.S. Senate, to the House of Representatives--whatever a person's \nphilosophy, be it on the left, right, in the center, it matters not.\n  The beauty of what we have in America is this incredible democracy \nwhere everyone has a chance to get here. Certainly I got here very \nunexpectedly myself, a first-generation American--my mother never even \ngraduated from high school--and I got to the U.S. Senate.\n  This is an open country and there is no need to harbor bad feelings \ntoward one another. Here in this Senate we debate many times and we \nsometimes get angry at each other because we disagree with each other. \nHowever, it is done with respect. I only hope in the years that I am \nhere it will continue to be done with respect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/26/senate-section/article/S5695-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5695-S5702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    COMMONSENSE PRODUCT LIABIL- ITY AND LEGAL REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we have many problems that need fixing in \nour country. I just have to say that product liability law should not \nbe one of the problems. It is not a problem. Yet we are here, facing \nthis bill, S. 565, the Product Liability--it is called Fairness--Act \nwhen this is not a problem.\n  Why do I say this? First, this country has an enviable record of \nproducing safe products. All the countries in the world wonder how we \ndo it. Well, we have laws that hold people responsible if they produce \na dangerous product. The people who want this bill want to change that \nlaw.\n  Why should we tinker with laws that contribute to one of the best \nsafety records for products known to human kind? The only thing I can \nimagine is that there are some special interests who do not like it.\n  That is why, I think, we are here discussing S. 565, because it \ncertainly is not going to contribute to safer products. Indeed, I say, \nif it passes--and I am doing everything I can so that it does not pass \nand it does not become law--it is going to contribute to unsafe \nproducts, products that harm the people of my State and products that \nwill harm the people of this country.\n  Second, there are those who say that we have an explosion of \nfrivolous lawsuits related to product liability, to dangerous products. \nI want to say unequivocally, and I will repeat it many times during \nthis debate, that it is a figment of someone's imagination that there \nis an explosion of litigation around dangerous products.\n  Let me give the facts, because there is a lot of rhetoric around \nhere. Product liability lawsuits are only one-third of 1 percent of all \ncivil lawsuits in State courts. Let me repeat: They are one-third of 1 \npercent of all civil lawsuits in State courts.\n  Listen to this: In 25 years, the last 25 years, there have only been \n355 punitive damage awards. Now, what is a ``punitive damage award?'' \nPunitive--meaning to punish. When a company harms an American citizen, \na person using a product, because of shoddy manufacturing and a mistake \nwas made, and the person is injured, say, burned beyond recognition, \nthat company is sued for punitive damages, meaning, ``Let us punish the \npeople who caused this grief''--sometimes for loss of life and limb.\n  In a single year during that 25-year time period, there were an \naverage of 11 punitive damage awards. Yet this bill is going to limit \npunitive damages--the ability of an average person to walk into court \nand get justice--because this Congress has decided it knows better than \na jury.\n There is no wave of frivolous lawsuits here. We know where the \nfrivolous lawsuits are: businesses suing businesses. That is where the \nexplosion is, but this bill does not deal with that. This is the \nBusiness Protection Act.\n\n  I find it really intriguing that many of the Senators who were \npushing this bill, which would take precedence over State law, are the \nvery ones who say let the States do everything else. ``Oh, let the \nStates do the School Lunch Program. But we know better, all of a \nsudden, than the States and the State legislatures, when it comes to \nproducts liability.'' I find that really astounding.\n  This is a rigid law. How could we determine now what the cap on \npunitive damages should be? I assure my colleagues, if a multibillion-\ndollar corporation makes a mistake in building a bus and the bus \nexplodes, to punish a multibillion-dollar corporation $250,000 or three \ntimes economic damages is not going to cut it. Why not just repeal \npunitive damages while you are at it? The reason is they cannot get the \nvotes to do that.\n  This law would pretend to know all the facts of every case in advance \nwithout seeing them. We are the all-seeing Senators here. We are the \nall-knowing Senators here. We know every case in advance here, and we \ncan say here, without any problem, we ought to limit the ability of \njuries and judges to make awards. We know all the scientific evidence, \nI suppose, and all the circumstances under which a product was sold and \nmanufactured. That is what this bill says.\n  There are billions of products manufactured each and every year, and \nthis bill says we can foresee that under no circumstances should a \ncompany have punitive awards greater than $250,000, or three times \neconomic damages. We, the almighty Senators, know--better than a jury, \nbetter than the States.\n  S. 565 would shift the current level playing field against the \naverage person in favor of big corporations and there is no question \nabout it. It would remove much of the responsibility of manufacturers \nand sellers of dangerous products. They do not have to fear a big jury \naward. They can just write it off as a cost of business. So what if a \ndrug you took made you infertile? So what if a product your child got a \nhold of caused that child great damage to his brain or his limbs? It \nwould take away the hard-won rights of average citizens to a safe \nmarketplace for \n[[Page S5696]] goods. That is why every major consumer group is \nfighting against this bill. There are many groups fighting against this \nbill.\n  But one group of companies love this bill. The tobacco companies love \nthis bill. Because some day in the future, when some court finds out \nthat they knew their products were addictive, they will be shielded by \nthis bill. And each and every Senator voting for it will have to say to \nthe people who lose their loved ones to smoking, ``You know, I didn't \nrealize it when I voted for this S. 565. You're right, it would limit \npunitive damages for cigarette companies.'' But that is what we are \nabout to do here.\n  Current law, that S. 565 seeks to change, contains incentives for \nmanufacturers to consider possible dangers before selling products to \nthe unsuspecting public. That law would be changed. This law gives \ncorporations and sleazy, marginal retailers an incentive to sell a \ndangerous product. Consumer safeguards will be displaced.\n  I believe this bill is nothing more than special interest legislation \ndressed up with a virtuous title: fairness. These are the words you \nhear so much around Congress these days: fairness; products liability \nfairness. It is really not fairness, it is a repeal of sensible product \nliability law, law that has worked, law that has not resulted in an \nexplosion of lawsuits. That is a myth.\n  The backers of this bill are powerful. I can say that. I mentioned \nthe tobacco companies. Many of them are unseen. You do not see the \ntobacco companies lobbying around here, but they are behind this. I say \nthe public has a right to safe products. They have a right to a legal \nsystem that deters the sale of unsafe products. And the public has a \nright to fair compensation if they are harmed by a dangerous product. \nLet me say that again. The public has a right to safe products. They \nhave a right to a legal system that deters the sale of unsafe products. \nAnd, finally, they have a right to adequate and fair compensation if \nthey are harmed by a dangerous product.\n  I had a press conference in California with women who were harmed by \nsilicone gel breast implants, and women who are called DES daughters. \nDES is a drug that was given to their mothers to help them sleep during \npregnancy, which wound up giving them terrible, terrible problems and \npain and suffering. The DES daughters and the silicone breast implant \nvictims are lobbying against this bill.\n  What is their special interest? They have none. They are just \nsounding a warning cry to future victims if we pass this bill. This \nbill would prevent juries from imposing deterrents to future sale of \ndefective products.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Is the Senator aware in this bill about DES?\n  Mrs. BOXER. DES.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. We had that discussion, the Senator and I did, \nyesterday.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator said DES was not approved by the FDA, did the \nSenator not?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. By the modern FDA.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It was approved by the former FDA.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. But not by the one by which the law was formerly \ninterpreted.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The FDA----\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. If the Senator will yield? What the Senator fails to \nunderstand is that if this law before the Senate had been in effect at \nthe time that, for example, Representative Patsy Mink went through her \nhorrible circumstances, that in fact she would have had the recourse to \nsue that she does not have under the present law. Because under the \npresent law in some cases the statute of limitations runs out in 2 \nyears after time of injury. She did not know something was wrong for \nquite a while.\n  Very specifically, in our bill, it is explicitly laid out that if \nsomething happens 20 years later, 30 years later, 40 years later, the \nstatute of limitations does not begin until a person knows, first, that \nthey have been hurt; and, second, why they have been hurt--what is the \ncause, why they have been hurt. It is at that point that the statute of \nlimitations begins to run. So that Representative Patsy Mink could have \nindeed gone, even today, had this bill been in effect back then.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I might say to the Senator, \nRepresentative Mink is opposed to this bill and so are the DES \ndaughters. They think this bill is a terrible bill. They think this \nbill is a step backward. There are many other parts of the bill, as my \nfriend knows because he is so involved in it, that do not deal with the \nstatute of limitations but that deal with capping damages.\n  I say to my friend again, it is very nice to hear that the Senator \nfrom West Virginia feels that the bill would be good for victims of \nDES, but the victims of DES oppose this bill. The victims of breast \nimplants oppose this bill. Women's groups oppose this bill. So they do \nnot see it the way the Senator from West Virginia sees this bill.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I did not try to explain that they did see it the \nway the Senator from West Virginia sees it. What I was suggesting is \nthat they do not know that in this bill, they are not eliminated by the \nstatute of limitations. The statute of limitations changes entirely. \nWhether or not they know it, that is the fact. That is just something I \nwant those who are listening to understand.\n  It is the same thing as last year, when we had the FDA in and the \nconsumer groups that the good Senator refers to. They were constantly \nsaying, ``Well, that would mean that if you had a problem with the \nDalkon shield or breast implants, you did not have a cause of action.'' \nAll of which was totally an untruth, but it was said-- megaphoned and \nmegaphoned so loudly--that because they had never been approved by the \nFDA, therefore, they will have no defense whatsoever.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, maybe he misunderstood. What the \ngroups were saying is that this is a bill about what happens in the \nfuture, and that a full one-half of the FDA-approved pharmaceuticals \nare recalled.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. On this bill----\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend raised the issue. It was in the bill last year \nand, as he knows, it is in the House bill. The FDA excuse is in the \nbill. That was passed the House. And if this bill passes--I know the \nSenator is working toward that end and I am working toward an opposite \nend--but if the bill does pass, and it has a chance of passing, it will \ngo to conference and I hope my friend will in fact oppose it if the FDA \nexcuse is in it.\n  The point is the Senator from West Virginia raised the issue of the \nFDA excuse and said that the groups did not really understand what we \nwere doing when they mentioned silicone breast implants. The fact is, \nthe silicone breast implants were grandfathered into an approval \nprocess, No. 1. But even if that is not as clear as a sure FDA \napproval, what the groups were trying to say--and they have no ax to \ngrind, in my view, these are people who consumed, these are people who \nare victims of these terrible drugs, whether it is DES or silicone \nbreast implants or the Dalkon Shield is one thing. Whether or not they \nwere approved by the FDA, what they were talking about last year was \nthe fact that since half of the drugs that are approved by the FDA are \nrecalled, that FDA approval does not necessarily carry with it total \nand complete safety.\n  And in this bill, what you did not do last year, you capped punitive \ndamages, and many women who understand this bill understand that women \nare going to be penalized because, if it is a choice between $250,000 \nor three times economic damages, women still in our society earn 71 \ncents for every dollar earned by men. Many do not work, many more do \nnot work, and their economic damage of lost wages, et cetera, will be \nlower.\n  So I think that the Senator has every right to support this bill. I \nadmire him and respect him for his belief in this bill. But when the \nSenator gets up and says Patsy Mink would have been better off, I think \nan average listener would have assumed that Congresswoman Patsy Mink, \nwho had a DES daughter, would support this bill. She not only opposes \nit, she opposes this bill with passion.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I understand that very well. I simply was responding \nto the point that the Senator made about the DES. And the point is that \nhad this bill been in effect at the time \n[[Page S5697]] that Patsy Mink went through her terrible situation, she \nwould have been in an entirely different circumstance. I wanted the \nSenator to know that.\n  When the Senator mentions that women are hurt by this bill, women in \nAmerica now have long been deprived. If the Senator wishes to further \nyield--\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield. I wanted to make a point. Since the \nSenator brought up Congresswoman Mink, her daughter was harmed by a \ndefective product. I am not sure, but I believe her daughter did \nrecover some damages.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Good.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to continue to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Understand that this bill would not in any way protect anybody who \nmakes a product, the Dalkon shield or any harmful product, such as \nsilicone breast implants. The Senator does understand that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. No, I do not, because my friend under this bill is \ncapping their punitive damages. Current law is much tougher on the \npeople who make these products. This bill would cap punitive damages. \nSo, therefore, it is a great step back. That is why the big business \ncommunity supports his bill and consumers oppose it, because whereas \neach State would decide, there would be a cap on punitive damages. By \nthe way, in California, we have no cap on punitive damages. We have \nother caps in place, but there is no cap on punitives. My people in \nCalifornia who would be victims of a future Dalkon shield would suffer \nunder this bill.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I am trying to give a different point of view, that \nthe Dalkon shield and breast implants are not covered because they are \nnot approved by the FDA and besides the FDA defense from last year's \nbill is not even a part of this bill.\n  It is interesting. The New England Journal of Medicine indicated that \nwomen, and particularly women, I believe, who are pregnant, are now \nbeing excluded from clinical studies of different pharmaceuticals. That \nis not helpful for women. Benedictine is a morning sickness drug that \nin fact was approved and is used all over the world, and is not used in \nthis country because they felt that they were unable to withstand \nlitigation and potential charges. So there must be millions of women \nwho do not have the advantage of that particular drug, which is \napproved everywhere else in the world.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I could say to my friend, since I am yielding, and I \nthink it is best we have a dialog on each point with respect to \nthalidomide, which was a drug made in England. My friend and I are from \nthe same generation. We remember the tragedy of babies born without \nlimbs and brains, and the rest of it. The FDA did not approve that drug \nhere. And maybe our product liability laws kept that company out of \nAmerica.\n  I want to say, in behalf of the women, at least from the State that I \nrepresent, they do not want any more Dalkon shields and they do not \nwant thalidomide and they do not want unsafe products and silicone \nbreast implants. That is just what they are going to get if bills like \nthis go forward, because you are protecting companies in this bill and, \ntherefore, they will be less vigilant. And that is why of consumer \ngroup in this Nation opposes this bill.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I say to the Senator further that where she refers \nto big business, about 30 percent of the businesses in this country are \nrun by women, owned or run by women. The great majority of them are in \nfact small businesses. The guess is that by the end of this century, \nabout 40 percent of all small businesses in this country will be run by \nwomen. Of course, it is the small businesses who are the least able to \ntake on the risk of litigation and often withdraw products rather than \nsubject themselves to that because they could be thrown out of business \nbecause maybe of a jury decision.\n  Julie Nimitz, obviously a woman, in Senate testimony--she runs a \nsporting goods company and is the chief executive officer of it, in \nfact.\n  She is one of the two CEO's who run a U.S. manufacturer of football \nhelmets, and she said, ``Our employees hold their breath every time a \ncase goes to the jury because a runaway award would mean the end of the \ncompany.''\n  Norma Wallace, who is head of an engineering company, said that the \ncurrent situation with litigation--and evidently her company is in the \nmachine tool industry--is made a great deal less competitive by the \nproduct liability system.\n  So the question of will women be helped or will women be hurt, I \nthink, is not quite as easy as my friend indicates.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I could respond to my friend.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Please.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is not small businesses that brought these drugs to \nthe market. My friend knows that. These drugs are developed over years. \nMillions of dollars go into these drugs, and they are sent to the \nmarketplace. The fact that we----\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I was not----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Excuse me. I believe that I am making a point here. I \nraised the issue of women, not women who own businesses or women who \nwork for business. I raised the issue of women as consumers.\n  What I am saying to my friend is I believe I speak for the vast \nmajority of women who would say to my friend today if they had the \nopportunity--and I am standing in here for some of them--please do not \nmake it easier to push on us silicone breast implants. Please do not \nmake it easier to push on us the Dalkon shield. Please do not make it \neasy for us to get thalidomide. Please do not change the legal system \nin such a way that we are no longer protected by the best system in the \nworld.\n  Everybody always says this is the greatest country in the world. I \nhave heard my friend say it. We have the best marketplace in the world, \neven though we do recall 50 percent of the drugs the FDA approves. We \nare the envy of the world.\n  I would say to my friends in small business--and my friend is right, \nsmall business is the engine of this economy--we are talking about this \nvery narrow bill that focuses on basically product liability and mostly \non punitive damages caps, that in a study, there were 355 punitive \ndamage awards in 25 years. And was it last year there were 11--excuse \nme. I stand corrected. The last year of the study was 1990. There were \nan average of 11 cases per year. So my friends who are in small \nbusiness, when it comes to punitive damage awards, they should know \nthat there have been 300 plus in 25 years. So when I talk about the \nwomen of this country, I am talking about them as, frankly, people who \nhave been victimized by dangerous products.\n  It is hard to know what it is worth if your mate is sterile and you \ncannot have a child. I am going to be a grandmother. It is one of the \nmost exciting things that has ever happened to me. My friend is a proud \ndad. If I did not have that opportunity--and many DES daughters never \nhad that opportunity--what kind of cap could I put on that? How can I \ntell you what it is worth? If I was to ask my friend what are his \nchildren worth, I do not think he could even measure it. But we are \nsaying right now to future victims of products which might make them \nsterile, male or female, $250,000 or three times economic damages; that \nis all it is worth. And I do not believe in many cases that will punish \nthese huge businesses and corporations that can write off $250,000 as \neasily as most Americans can write off a dollar or 10 cents.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Let me say to my friend from California, if she has \ntime to engage in this, let me just go on further on this business of \nwomen and the effect on them.\n  Phyllis Greenberger is the executive director of the Society for \nAdvancement of Women's Health Research, and she has said this year, \n``The current liability climate is preventing women from receiving the \nfull benefits that science and medicine provide. There is evidence,'' \nshe says, ``that maintaining the current liability system harms the \nadvancement of women's health research.''\n  I would point out to my good friend from California, with whom I \nagree on 95 percent of matters, 98 percent perhaps, under the current \nproduct liability system there is only one major \n[[Page S5698]] pharmaceutical company still investing in contraceptive \nresearch. So whether it is Benedictine for morning sickness or it is \ncontraceptives or whatever, it is not the fact that there have only \nbeen x number of punitive damages awarded. It is the fact that punitive \ndamages are always out there and that they have the effect of deterring \npeople.\n  In fact, we have come to the point where I think 47 percent of \nbusiness--no. I forget the exact number. It was a big percentage of \nbusinesses have indicated that when they want to improve a product that \nthey already have, they often reject the chance to improve the product \nfor fear that it will indicate their previous product was somehow \ndeficient, which is just not the way things work in America. So it is \nnot the number just of punitive damage awards. It is the chilling \neffect of the possibility of what could happen. It is, in fact, cutting \noff enormous amounts of research which affect women's health, all of \nwhich is basically what I am trying to say to my good friend.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me say to my friend I come from a State that has one \nof the largest pharmaceutical fields in the whole country. It is very \nrobust. It is very exciting. And I say to my friend, I wish he would \ncome with me. There is one company called Shaman Pharmaceutical. Shaman \nis sort of a doctor in the rain forest. And Shaman Pharmaceutical was \nfounded by a young woman who said there are many of these products \namong the flora and fauna that hold promise. So the current liability \nlaws did not stop Lisa Contey, who is the CEO of that company, from \nstarting a new company from scratch, from building it up to the point \nwhere she has three products before the FDA.\n  What I am saying to my friend is I think the people who support this \nbill because they say there is a crisis are making up a crisis. There \nare many new drugs on the market. We want to work with the FDA to get \nswifter approval in some cases, and we will. But I say to my friend be \nvery, very cautious. We are the envy of the world. I do not want to \nrush to get a new contraceptive that might hurt and maim and destroy \npeople. You do not either, I say to my friend. So why mess with a law \nthat has protected us? If we did not have laws like this, we might have \ngotten thalidomide on the market. If we did not have laws like this, we \nmight have gotten many more dangerous drugs that you read about in \nother countries that are not as careful.\n  So I say that if, in fact, there is only one company doing this \nresearch and they are being careful and they are testing carefully and \nwe do not have to--how many more times do women have to be used as \nguinea pigs in this country? It is not once that it has happened. It \nhas happened with contraceptives continually. And maybe these companies \nwill start making contraceptives for men. Maybe they will be a little \nmore careful because, contrary to my colleague's remarks, it happens to \nbe that these large pharmaceuticals are mostly dominated by men.\n  That is a fact of life. But I say that the laws we have in place are \npart of the patchwork approach to safe products, and I feel very \ndifferently than does he. I am not that concerned that there are not \nseven new contraceptives coming on the marketplace because, frankly, I \nwould rather that they come slowly and that they be safe than that we \nexpose women to the torture of some of these DES daughters. The one I \nmet at my press conference, I tell you, it will haunt me for the rest \nof my life. She went through menopause in her twenties, and she has \nstruggled ever since with the most life-threatening diseases because of \nDES.\n  So I do not want to have a law passed that will say to everyone out \nthere, ``Come on. Bring your products onto market, because you can be \ntaken to court but you're pretty well protected with a cap on punitive \ndamages.''\n  I think it is a big mistake to do it. And I say that in behalf of, \nfrankly, tens and tens of groups who really oppose this bill, many \nwomen's groups and consumer groups who represent both men and women.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I would just conclude, because my friend from \nWisconsin has been more than patient in waiting to speak, by just \nsaying two things.\n  No. 1 is, I ask unanimous consent to have a letter from the American \nSmall Business Leaders on Product Liability Reform printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n   Joint Letter to Members of Congress From American Small Business \n          Leaders on Product Liability Reform--April 3, 1995.\n\n       Dear Members of Congress: On behalf of the nation's more \n     than 21 million small and growing businesses, we are writing \n     to strongly urge your support of S. 565, The Product \n     Liability Fairness Act of 1995.\n       You know the problem: A single lawsuit can and has put many \n     small business owners out of business.\n       For many small businesses, the explosion in product \n     liability cases means it is simply impossible to find and \n     keep affordable liability insurance.\n       You've heard the horror stories. (If you haven't, give us a \n     call.)\n       Why should you care? Small business create virtually all \n     the net new jobs in the economy. And businesses owned by \n     women now employ more people than the entire Fortune 500 \n     combined. While most of our company names are not household \n     words, small business comprises the backbone of the nation's \n     economy--from Main Street to Wall Street.\n       We need your help!\n       Product liability reform was the #1 issue at the White \n     House Conference on Small Business in 1986. Finally, after \n     more than a decade of struggle, product liability reform \n     seems within our reach.\n       Please support of S. 565. The Product Liability Fairness \n     Act of 1995, and help protect U.S. consumers, workers and \n     small businesses. Our future, and the future of our nation's \n     economy, depends on it.\n       Thank you for your support.\n         Gary Kushner, President, Kushner & Company, Inc., \n           President, National Small Business United, Kalamazoo, \n           Michigan; Carol Ann Schneider; President, Seek, Inc., \n           President, Independent Business Association of \n           Wisconsin; Patty DeDominic, President, National \n           Association of Women Business Owners (NAWBO), Los \n           Angeles, California; Willis T.

Mr. President, this is a letter from Patty \nDeDominic, who is the president of the National Association of Women \nBusiness Owners, and others, in which they write: ``On behalf of the \nNation's more than 21 million small and growing businesses,'' we ask \nyou to support this bill.\n  This is just not the idea, therefore, that this is all big business. \nI mean that really is not the case.\n  Second, and finally, and with great respect to my friend from \nCalifornia, who cares passionately that people be protected, as do I. I \nthink the Senator knows my heart as well as the Senator's, not as well \nas the Senator knows her own heart, but she knows what I stand for and \nwho I am.\n  But I think the statement is fine, which is one company which is \ndoing research on contraceptives, or if you put that over into other \nareas such as Alzheimer's.\n  I had dinner last night with a person who has Parkinson's. He was \ndescribing to me a little bit of what that was like. That happened to \nbe a man and not a woman. But I really never, ever want, as in the \nSoviet Union, where there is one company which is doing research on \nAlzheimer's and Parkinson's and some of these enormous diseases that \naffect men and women. I mean, the whole point is competition in the \nmarketplace. And even worse is the fact that companies are withdrawing \nthe amount of money that they spend on research in general.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, what I said--because I do not want to \nbe mischaracterized--is that it is fine that unproven drugs are not \nbeing pushed on the marketplace because in many cases if unproven drugs \nare pushed on the marketplace they will kill people.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. They certainly will.\n  Mrs. BOXER. They will maim people. They will hurt people. And nowhere \ncould this be more true than when it comes to contraceptives or drugs \ngiven during pregnancy and the like. And women have been used as guinea \npigs.\n  So when my friend says, in terms of contraceptives, that he is very \nworried that it is this legal system that is stopping these drugs, I \nsay better that we go slowly, better that we move wisely, better err \nthat we test these products and not have another case of the Dalkon \nShield or the DES. We do not need these.\n  We learned a lesson and the lesson should not be that you open up the \nfloodgates by protecting companies. The lesson should be that we should \nbe very, very cautious.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. And the lesson should also be that we open up the \nfloodgates of the courthouse door to people who might be afflicted by \nanything that might happen in the future.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think the courthouse door is fine right now. I mean, on \nthe one hand----\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Are you satisfied with the system the way it is?\n  Mrs. BOXER. With product liability; I think it is fair to say that we \ndo not have the problem with product liability. If you want to talk \nabout other areas of the law where there is frivolous lawsuits, that is \nfine.\n  But when I see that there were an average of 11 punitive damages \nawards for products cases in a single year, nationally, I do not think \nwe have an explosion.\n  And then my friend says let us open up the courthouse door, on the \none \n[[Page S5700]] hand, when many on his side say already the courthouse \ndoor is too wide open.\n  I just want to say to my friend when it comes to Alzheimer's, I am \nvery interested, and his heart is there. We know that a new drug was \nput on the market last summer. We also know for Parkinson's there is a \nnew operation that holds some promise. We are making progress.\n  I do not think we need to take a system that has acted as a protector \nof the American consumer and destroy it, as this bill would.\n  Now this bill only goes halfway to destroy it. The one in the House, \nthat some of my friends here on the Republican side of the aisle like, \ngoes to the heart of it, goes to the heart of it. They just want to get \nthis bill in conference and go all the way with this bill if they can \ndo it, and keep the votes together. I think we are playing a very \ndangerous game here.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Final question, with apologies to both the Senator \nfrom California and the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator does not have to apologize, I say to my \nfriend. I enjoy this give and take.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Sure.\n  The Senator appeared to be saying that she is, Mr. President, \nentirely satisfied with our present system. I believe she did say that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I said, on product liability, I think that we have a good \nsystem.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The status quo on product liability is absolutely \nfine and there does not need to be any changes made. I mean, most trial \nlawyers will not say that.\n  So what I was going to ask my friend from California, if there was a \nbill that was able to balance the requirements of getting more \nopportunities for research and discoveries, more opportunities for new \ndrugs, and balance the needs of business in that respect and also the \nquestion of how business is treated so business, even though there were \nonly 11 punitive damage cases in one particular year, that, in fact, \nthe chilling effect of those 11 cases hangs over hundreds of thousands \nof businesses and, therefore, affects, in effect, hundreds of thousands \nof businesses and, on the other hand, was able to protect consumers and \nopen up new avenues of protection for consumers, if it were possible to \ndevelop such a bill, would the Senator be interested?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will work with my friend to make sure that we can \nencourage the best and the brightest people in this country to work on \nresearch. That is why I am such a proponent of NIH grants. Because, as \nmy friend knows, right now we are only approving one in five grants. We \nare only funding one in five approved NIH grants.\n  I will work with my friend if he can show me part of the law that he \nthinks is hurting the people of this country. I am just saying to my \nfriend that we have, with all of its faults and all of its problems, \nthe safest products in the world. And I am saying to my friend, even \nthough we have had our share of problems, we are still the safest.\n  Why would we go back from that? I think that is where my friend and I \ndisagree. He does not seem to think that the current law has protected \npeople. I mean, my friend has stated here and to me in other settings \nthat he thinks his bill is good for future victims.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. This Senator thinks that the bill before us offers a \nnumber of areas which would make it substantially a more protected \nsituation, a more have-your-chance-at-the-courthouse situation, have \naccess to alternative dispute resolutions on a voluntary basis where \nthe claimant never has to pay anything but the defendant does.\n  I think there are a number of areas where this bill does, in fact, \nopen up new opportunities for protection and due process to women.\n  This will be my fourth attempt to close, and I am picking on myself, \nnot the distinguished Senator from California.\n  There is one more thing that I notice here. Again, the New England \nJournal of Medicine, 1993, concluded that the manufacturers' liability \nconcerns are contributing to the exclusion of women, which I indicated \nearlier, from clinical studies.\n  Now, that is a terribly serious statement. That is the same thing as \nI ran into in the Persian Gulf war syndrome with the use of the drug \npyridostigmine, which when used in connection with other chemicals may \nbe a contributing factor to the tens of thousands of men and women in \nthis country who have a so-called mystery illness, which is no mystery \nto me but which evidently seems to be to our scientists.\n  And women in the test that the Department of the Defense conducted to \ntest this pill were entirely excluded. Not one single woman, even \nthough the bodyweight of women obviously is not as great as that of the \naverage man and, therefore, the effect of the pill, which was made on \nmen and women, would be much worse on women. So the importance of \nhaving women in clinical studies in this research is very, very \nimportant.\n  Having said that, for my part I want to thank my friend from \nCalifornia, and apologize to my friend from Wisconsin and yield the \nfloor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senator from West Virginia \nand I were able to engage in this dialog. I think today people have to \nknow that when there is disagreement among friends, you still talk to \neach other. We do that too seldom, even on the floor of the Senate. \n``No, I won't yield. I want to say my piece. I don't agree with you and \nI won't yield.''\n  I think the fact that we can go back and forth--and we are really in \ndisagreement on this bill, there is no question about that--is a good \nthing.\n  I say to my friend that I know he is doing what he is doing because \nhe thinks it is best for everyone. But I think at some point one has to \ntake a look at who opposes you and listen to the groups that oppose \nyour bill, and to stand on the floor and say, ``I'm doing it for DES \npeople, I'm doing it for consumers, I'm doing it for women,'' how about \ngiving these people the credit to know themselves whether this bill is \ngood for them?\n  I told a story about this Boy Scout who saw this little old lady and \nwent over to her and took her across the street. And he wondered why \nshe did not say thank you. Finally, he said, ``Why didn't you say thank \nyou to me?\"\n  She said, ``Because I didn't want to go across the street.''\n  Why are we taking the consumers across the street? They do not want \nto go. Why are we telling the women in this country to go across this \nstreet? They do not want to go. I understand why one would support this \nbill. There are some big businesses that desperately want this bill. \nThe tobacco companies want this bill. They do not like the threat of \nlarge punitive damages. Why would they? They would just as soon put a \nproduct on the market, take the risk and know they are protected.\n  I am talking for consumers, I am talking for women, and I am not \nmaking it up. I am going to read you the list, and it may take a while. \nI am not going to read the whole list:\n  Action on Smoking and Health opposes liability reform. AIDS Action \nCouncil opposes it. Alabama Citizen Action opposes it.\n  Here are others in opposition: The American Bar Association; American \nCoalition for Abuse Awareness; American Council on Consumer Awareness; \nAmerican Public Health Association; American University Washington \nCollege of Law; Americans for Nonsmokers Rights; Arizona Citizen \nAction; Arizona Consumers Council; Aviation Consumer Action Project; \nCalifornia Citizen Action; California Public Interest Research Group.\n  This is an unprecedented group of people across the political \nspectrum, in my opinion.\n  The American Bar Association has lawyers on both sides of this; \nCenter for the Public Interest Law at the University of San Diego; \nCenter for Public Representation, Inc.; Center for Women Policy \nStudies; Children Now; Citizen Action; Citizen Action of Maryland and \nNew York; Citizen Advocacy Center; Citizens Action Coalition of \nIndiana; Clean Water Action Projects; Coalition for Consumer Rights; \nCoalition of Labor Union Women; Colorado Public Interest Research; \nCommunications Workers of America; Connecticut Citizen Action Group; \nConnecticut Public \n[[Page S5701]] Interest Research Group; Consumer Action; Consumer \nFederation of America.\n  All these groups oppose liability reform, and people will get up and \nsay this bill is good for the consumers, and people will get up and say \nit is good for women, and people will get up and say it is good for \nvictims. Well, that is the best kept secret in America because here are \nthe groups that oppose it:\n  Consumer Federation of California; Consumer Protection Association; \nConsumers for Civil Justice; Consumer League of New Jersey; Consumers \nUnion.\n  It goes on: DES Action USA. We heard the Senator from West Virginia \nget up and say he thought it would be better for DES people if this \nbill was law. Interesting. DES Action USA opposes the bill. So do DES \nSons. So they do not want this bill to become law.\n  Empire State Consumers Association; Families Advocating Injury \nReduction; Fair Housing Council of San Gabriel Valley; Federation of \nOrganization for Professional Women oppose.\n  My friend talked about how women want this. Well, there is no such \nthing. Some women, I guess, who are in business want it and some do \nnot.\n  Georgia Citizen Action; Fund for Feminist Majority.\n  It goes on.\n  Hollywood Women's Political Committee; Idaho Citizens Action Network; \nIdaho Consumer Affairs; Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence; \nIllinois Public Action; International Brotherhood of Teamsters; Iowa \nCitizen Action Network; Kentucky Citizen Action; Latino Civil Rights \nTask Force; Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund. I am going to lose \nmy voice. I might have to save this for a later debate.\n  I think I have made my point.\n  And I have not even told you all the prestigious, important, decent \norganizations that do not want this bill to pass. This is America. They \ndo not want this bill to pass.\n  National Organization on Disability; the National Rainbow Coalition; \nthe National Women's Health Network. They do not think liability reform \nis good for women.\n  Nebraska Citizen Action; New Hampshire Citizen Action; New Jersey \nEnvironmental Federation; New Mexico Citizen Action; North Carolina \nConsumers Council. It goes on. I am only on the O's.\n  Public Citizen; Uniformed Firefighters Association of Greater New \nYork.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I will be happy to yield. I am getting tired.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. When you go on to the R's, that would be an \nappropriate time to yield to me.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Go ahead. I yield to you now.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I noticed that the Senator mentioned one AIDS \ninterested group. That compels me to say something which, again, I \nthink is so important, that one of the reasons that the list is so long \nis people on a subject like this, and when you have a very intense \ngroup fighting so hard--the Senator mentioned lawyers in general--but \nthere is a particular group of lawyers that is fighting this thing \nvery, very hard, a tremendous amount of sensationalism.\n  I have a letter which is being passed around West Virginia written by \none of these particular kinds of lawyers basically saying that if you \nhave been exposed to asbestos, Rockefeller is trying to cut off your \nchance for recourse, which is an absolute falsehood because this bill \nis entirely prospective and asbestos does not enter into it at all.\n  What I am suggesting is that many, in fact, amazingly, many of these \nconsumer groups are so completely wedded to the status quo that they do \nnot want to see any change.\n  I can remember--every year I do this. I ask the president of the \nAmerican Trial Lawyers Association to come into my office, which they \nalways do with one of their particular lobbyists. And I say, ``Is there \nanything I can do to work with you on this problem because I want to \nsolve it in a way which is fair to both business and consumers.''\n  I come from a State where consumers far outnumber businesses, and I \nwant to make sure it is a fair bill.\n  Every year the answer is, ``No, the bill is fine exactly the way it \nis. There is no need for any kind of change whatsoever. Which is a \nremarkable attitude when you consider, for example, what Abbott \nLaboratories said. Abbott Laboratories has made the decision to drop \nplans for human trials of the drug to prevent HIV-infected mothers from \ntransmitting the AIDS virus to their unborn children. Abbott \nLaboratories is not a small operation. They are not doing that anymore.\n  Dr. Fauci, who is Director of AIDS research at the National \nInstitutes of Health called these liability concerns ``very real,'' and \n``something we have to address.'' This is the area of AIDS. A \npharmaceutical company and a major Government research organization \nagree on the need to make some reforms in our product liability system.\n  All the junior Senator from West Virginia is trying to suggest to my \nfriend from California is that somehow--here is another, Dr. Elizabeth \nConnell, Chair of FDA's obstetrics and gynecology devices panel, said \nthat the United States is losing its leadership role in the area of \ncontraceptive technology ``with potentially disastrous consequences for \nwomen and men in this country and elsewhere.''\n  All I am trying to say to my good friend from California is that I \nthink one of the real problems on this piece of legislation, frankly, \nis that people really have not looked at the bill;\n that there is this atrocious mindset on the part of those who oppose \nit--I hope not on the part of those who propose it--that it is \natrocious to bring it up. Often, in my State's legislature, somebody \nwould bring up the beginning of an idea, an amoeba, and the lobbyist \nwould crush it immediately before it had a chance to grow in any \ndirection, so that it might in fact become something.\n\n  All I am saying is that opposing any change, praising the status quo, \nwhen such things as testing for AIDS passed from a mother to a child \ncould no longer be carried out is beyond my understanding.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, my friend should come to me about this \nsituation, no drugs are being developed. The pharmaceutical industry is \nbasically the fastest growing industry in California. I might tell my \nfriend that the Pediatric AIDS Foundation is intimately involved in \nmaking sure that we do research on pediatric AIDS. I happen to know the \ndoctor who actually made the finding that the AIDS virus passed through \nthe mother's milk to the baby. The fact of the matter is, I do not see \none reason that has been offered by any of my friends in the U.S. \nSenate on either side of the aisle that there is an explosion of \nlawsuits that is chilling this whole Nation.\n  I think that we have a system of justice in this country regarding \nproduct liability that is working. The truth is, with all of the talk \nabout this great explosion of lawsuits, we heard all that and nobody \nput down one statistic about it. We finally got the statistic, and now \nthey are coming up with another reason for the bill. Oh, it is a \nchilling effect. Yes, there are only 355 cases over 25 years, but it is \na chilling effect. I say to my friends, if you want to see an explosion \nof litigation, it is in the business law area. That is where businesses \nare suing businesses and an explosion in litigation is taking place in \nthat arena.\n  So there is no case to be made that there is this explosion of \nlitigation. This is, in fact, an area of the law where the law serves \nas a deterrent from terrible, harmful products, be they drugs, medical \ndevices, toys, or be they buses that explode. I am not a lawyer--which \nis a little refreshing around here--but I am not stupid when it comes \nto what is important for the rights of the people. I am not stupid when \nit comes to thinking about what it would mean if I did not have a baby \nbecause I was a DES daughter or I took a drug that was not carefully \nthought through. And then to say $250,000 capped for any horrible \ndamage that was done to me, you know, if you lose your ability to bear \na child, if that is your damage, you may be able to work. You may have \nvery low economic damages. And if you can tell me that we know better \nin this U.S. Senate than they do in the States and on a jury in any and \nall cases what that punitive damage award can be, I say that is being \n``Big Brother'' at its worst, and I might say ``Big Sister,'' depending \non the gender of the Senator involved.\n  [[Page S5702]] I am very concerned about this bill, very concerned \nabout this bill. I have to say, I think it is an offense to the names \nof the groups that I read here to say that these people have somehow \nbeen hoodwinked--that was not my friend's word; I tried to write down \nwhat he said--riled up, made to believe that this is a bad bill when \nreally it is a good bill for them.\n  I know some groups. You try to tell the Hollywood Women's Political \nCommittee what is good for them and they will show you the door because \nthey are going to figure out what is good for them. I have tried it on \nthings on which they do not agree with me. They are not going to \nbelieve me in the American Trial Lawyers or the American Bar \nAssociation. They are going to look and they are going to decide. They \nhave a very simple idea in their mind: They are going to oppose \nlegislation that hurts people. That is what they believe. Do not blame \nit on the fact that they are so naive that they will follow the \nlawyers.\n  I do not know whether my friend knows it, but lawyers are not that \nwell thought of these days. I happen to like lawyers. I am married to \none. My father was one and my son is one. If you ask the average \nperson, they are not going to follow lawyers, they are going to make up \ntheir own minds. If they agree with the lawyers, they will follow them. \nBut to say some of these groups would follow blindly, I find that \ninsulting on behalf of these groups. How about the YWCA, the Young \nWomen's Christian Association? They oppose certain liability reform. I \ndo not think they did it because they follow the lawyers.\n  In any event, there is going to be a lot more debate. I am going to \nclose and again thank my friend for engaging me in this dialog.\n  I want to remind my colleagues of a few people: 14-year-old Shannon \nFair, of Kentucky, in 1988, was in a school bus and it was hit by a \ndrunk driver. No one was hurt by the collision itself, but the entire \nbus was engulfed in flames because the manufacturer decided against \ninstalling a metal safety cage for the fuel tank. Reckless frugality. \nSixty-four children and four adults lost their lives. And we are going \nto cap, in this bill, the punishment to a company like that? We ought \nto be ashamed of ourselves.\n  Let us remember people like James Hoscheit of Minnesota, who at age \n14 lost both of his arms when they were caught in a forage blower. If \nthe piece of farm equipment had a simple safety guard, which cost the \ncompany $1, James Hoscheit would have his arms. And we are going to \nsay, in our great wisdom, from Washington, DC, in the U.S. Senate, that \nwe know better what kind of award James Hoscheit should get? I would \nrather leave that up to the people on the jury. Maybe they will find he \nshould get $100,000. Maybe they will find he should get $200,000 or $1 \nmillion, because he lost both of his arms. I am not going to say what \nthat should be. I think anyone who votes to do that is not fair to the \nfuture victims.\n  Don Taylor, Moreno Valley, CA, was driving his morning commute--and \nit could be any one of us--when another car cut him off. The Ford \nBronco he was driving rolled three times and the roof caved in. The \nseat belts failed to retract. He was paralyzed from the shoulders down. \nFord had notice of the defective seat belts, and he was still driving \nwith the defective seat belt, and he is permanently paralyzed. Am I \ngoing to tell the jury from here what that is worth to him and his \nfamily? Not this Senator. I am going to fight against that.\n  Punitive damages are meant to punish and discourage flagrant or \nwanton conduct. And, as I said, punitive damages are awarded only \nrarely in product liability cases, and that is what we want. We want \nthem used rarely--this is an important point, I say to my friends--\nbecause if they are used rarely, it means punitive damages are working \nbecause their very existence shapes up these companies, makes them \nthink twice and three times and 10 times and 100 times before they put \na potentially dangerous product into the hands of American consumers.\n  That is what we want. We want these punitive damages set on an \nindividual basis, but we do not really want them at all. If everyone \nproduces safe products, we will not have these awards. Why mess with a \nsystem that is deterring dangerous products?\n  You know, these caps they are talking about here are going to hurt \nwomen because they do not earn as much as men do. If you have a woman \nand a man and in the same bus and you have the exact same injury, but \nthe man has a top-level job. You know, 95 percent of all of the top \njobs in this country are held by men; it is just true.\n  It is just true. We women have a long way to go. We are getting \nthere. However, it is slow.\n  If you have a woman and a man in the same bus, and they suffer the \nsame injury, under this bill--under this bill--the man is going to \nreceive more punitive damage awards because we will figure if he was \nnot paralyzed, he would have earned so much more money, and he will be \nrewarded, and he will get a higher award. And the woman, who may not \nhave been working at the time or worked at a lower job, will get less.\n  This is discriminatory on its face. Take the case of the Copper-7 \nIUD, intrauterine device. My friend and I talked a lot about these \ndevices. The manufacturer knew for more than 10 years that their \nproduct could cause loss of fertility, serious infection, and the need \nto remove reproductive organs. The manufacturer continued to produce \nthe Copper-7 IUD.\n  Now, the jury awarded one $7 million punitive damage award for this \nintentional misrepresentation of its birth control device. Under this \nbill, it would have been $250,000, or three times the plaintiff's \neconomic damages. This is not a good bill.\n  I say to my friends, we should put a human face on this issue. We \nshould remember the people who have suffered. However, they were able \nto go to court and be made whole because the law allowed that to \nhappen. We should not jump in and preempt 50 States on this. We should \nallow the jury system to work.\n  I hope that after long debate--and I think we will have long debate \non this; we already have had several days of debate--our colleagues \nwill realize a couple of things. They will realize there is no \nexplosion in this area of the law, no explosion of litigation. And they \nwill realize that, by having a good, strong product liability law in \nall the various States that we have, that acts as a deterrent against \nunsafe products.\n  We have had our fill of the DES problem, of the silicone breast \nimplant problem, of the Copper-7 IUD problem, of trucks and cars that \nexplode. We should protect the people we were sent to represent, and we \nshould not approve this bill. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson).

Mr. President, I am quite disappointed and even puzzled \ntoday by the Supreme Court's decision in the United States versus Lopez \ncase. Usually, the courts speak with one voice, but today the majority \nof the court spoke for several separate opinions.\n  By a slim 5 to 4 margin, the court struck down the bipartisan Gun-\nFree School Zones Act, a law that prohibits possession of firearms \nwithin 1,000 feet of a school.\n  In my judgment, this is a classic example of judicial activism, and \nit ignores the safety of our American children.\n  I will briefly say something about the facts that the court today \nignored. Each day in our country more than 100,000 students bring guns \ninto our schools. One-fifth of urban high school students have been \nthreatened with firearms, and several hundred thousand schoolchildren \nare victims of violent crimes in or near their schools every year. \nMoreover, the problem of youth violence is rapidly escalating. In 1984, \na total of 1,134 juveniles were arrested for murder; by 1993, that \nfigure had more than doubled. According to the Justice Department, the \nvast majority \n[[Page S5703]] of these murders were committed with firearms and many \nwith handguns.\n  Democrats and Republicans in Congress, together, tried to do \nsomething about this disturbing trend when we enacted the gun-free \nschool zones legislation in 1990. Today, a slim majority of the court \nhas shot Congress down, and in so doing, put America's children at \ngreater risk.\n  Now, because we reenacted and perfected the Gun-Free School Act last \nyear as part of the crime bill, the current law may still be \nconstitutional. Indeed, we may yet be able to ensure the \nconstitutionality of the law with a technical amendment, and I plan to \nintroduce a bill to do that next week.\n  Broadly interpreted, however, the reasoning of the majority in this \ncase could have far-reaching consequences that may undermine a variety \nof crucial Federal laws, like the Drug-Free School Zones Act on which \nthe Gun-Free School Zones Act was based, or the bans on cop-killer \nbullets, or our Federal wetlands laws, and many of our civil rights \nstatutes.\n  Mr. President, I agree with the strong dissent by Judge Souter, \njoined by Justices Ginsburg, Stevens, and Breyer, who labeled this \nruling today by the Supreme Court a step backward.\n  I again want to express my disappointment with today's decision.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nopposition to S. 565, the Product Liability Fairness Act of 1995. It is \nbecause I really see it as the worst of both worlds.\n  First, I think it is a bill that has been shown to have little, if \nany, demonstrated need; second, I think it will have drastic and undue \neffects on some of our most vulnerable citizens in this country.\n  Those who support this legislation have stated over and over that the \nbill is to everyone's benefit. It supposedly will benefit \nmanufacturers, investors, business owners, workers, and consumers, they \nsay.\n  Yet, I have still not heard of a single major U.S. consumer \norganization that has endorsed this legislation. The legislation is, in \nfact, opposed by virtually every group in the country representing \nworking people, consumers, children, and the elderly.\n  The Product Liability Fairness Act says that it seeks to set uniform \nFederal standards for product liability legislation that would override \ncertain existing State laws.\n  It is not really a bill that provides uniformity at all. Those State \nlaws that are more protective of injured consumers are preempted under \nthis bill while those State laws that go beyond what this bill would do \nin terms of shielding negligent manufacturers are left intact. They are \nleft the same. It is not a bill that has anything to do, really, with \nuniformity.\n  In addition, Mr. President, it establishes a heightened--that is, \nmore difficult--conscious and flagrant standard for the rewarding of \npunitive damages in product liability cases, and it would arbitrarily \ncap damage awards for punitive damages at $250,000, or three times \neconomic damage.\n  Again, those State laws with higher caps or no caps are preempted. \nThose States with lower caps or no punitive damages awards are left \ncompletely untouched.\n  The bill would also set a 20-year statute of repose, unless, of \ncourse, a State law has a lower statute and is, therefore, left alone \nand also a 2-year statute of limitation.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this legislation would eliminate joint \nliability for noneconomic damages and create new standards for seller \nliability.\n  There are several reasons why I oppose this bill. Before I talk about \nthe specific flaws of this legislation, I think it is important to note \nthe larger context that the issue of product liability reform fits \ninto. That is why, as I look at this whole bill, I oppose the whole \napproach. It is not a question of fixing this and fixing that. I think \nthe whole concept driving this bill is an error and should be defeated.\n  For the past several months, all of us, Republicans and Democrats, \nhave, of course, been trying to interpret the meaning of the November \nelection. Many of our Republican colleagues have interpreted those \nelections as being a statement against big, inefficient and \nbureaucratic government. I disagree with a lot of the statements that \nhave been made about what the November elections have been about. But I \nthink that maybe is one legitimate interpretation of the elections, to \nsay that people have had it with big government. And I think in many \ncases that is a legitimate complaint that our constituents have, and \nthat they did express on November 8.\n  It would make no sense to argue that all Government programs should \nbe run by Washington, DC, or that all Government programs should be run \nby the States. Some programs do address underlying problems that are \nnational in scope, across State borders. But others are more local in \nnature and are best left to the local and State governments to \ndetermine how they can best address problems that they are more \nfamiliar with than are the folks that work in Washington, DC.\n  With regard to this matter I, for one, strongly believe that there \nare many issues that should clearly be left to the State and local \ngovernments to address. One of the reasons I opposed last year's crime \nbill was precisely because it shifted power away from our State and \nlocal courts and the law enforcement officials there, who have been \ndealing with crime problems in their own regions and are best equipped \nwith the knowledge and creativity to solve those problems. So that is \none reason why I opposed the crime bill, because I did not think we \nshould have an overarching Federal Government controlling all aspects \nof that issue.\n  Many on the other side of the aisle have been among the strongest \nproponents for the so-called States' rights issue. Indeed, our \ndistinguished majority leader has stated repeatedly this year his \nintention to dust off the 10th amendment and give greater control over \nlocal problems to the State governments. It was the Speaker of the \nother body who stated the following in his address to the Nation on \nApril 7, about the intent of the congressional Republicans in the 104th \nCongress. He said:\n\n       We must restore freedom by ending bureaucratic \n     micromanagement here in Washington. This country is too big \n     and too diverse for Washington to have the knowledge to make \n     the right decision on local matters. We've got to return \n     power back to you, to your families, your neighbors, your \n     local and State governments.\n\n  Given those statements, how does this square with the legislation we \nare considering today? What happened to the need to address local \nproblems on the local level? All this talk about States' rights is \nabout to go right out the window, as we usurp over 200 years of State \ncontrol over their tort systems. It seems a very odd trend indeed.\n  It should come as no surprise that this legislation is vehemently \nopposed by the American Bar Association, the National Conference of \nState Legislators, and the Conference of State Chief Justices. But \nthose who support this legislation do not want to listen to State \nlegislators or State judges or consumer organizations. They do not even \nwant to listen to those individuals who have been tragically maimed or \ninjured by the negligence of a small but powerful group of \nmanufacturers.\n  Of course, those who support this legislation justify the bill by \nsaying that such drastic action is needed to curb the so-called \nlitigation explosion that has supposedly resulted in a court system \ntotally bogged down in product liability litigation. Let us take a \nquick look at just how bogged down are our courts with product \nliability claims. The Department of Justice, using data compiled by the \nNational Center for State Courts, recently released a study of 378,000 \nState tort cases which apparently represents about half of all tort \nsuits completed between July 1991 and June 1992. According to the \nstudy, only 3 percent of all tort claims involve product liability, \njust 3 percent of all tort claims. The bulk of the tort claims \n[[Page S5704]] come in the form of automobile accidents and premises \nliability.\n  This study also found that in 1993 tort claims comprised only about \n10 percent of all civil case filings. That means that the so-called \nmassive usurping of State sovereignty because of a so-called explosion \nis occurring to address an area that represents less than 1 percent, \nactually less than a half a percent of all civil case filings. So, this \nis no panacea for our civil justice system.\n  Despite these statistics supporters continue to claim that our small \nbusiness and manufacturing communities are suffocating under the burden \nof liability insurance and the constant threat of litigation. Yet just \n2 years ago the National Association of Manufacturers--clearly one of \nthe biggest backers of this legislation--announced their own results of \na survey they had conducted of their own members in which they asked \ntheir members what specific issues were of concern to them and what \nproblems in their minds pose the largest impediments to growth in the \nmanufacturing industry. The results are very interesting and I think \nsomewhat at variance with the claims of those who are so strongly \nsupportive of this bill.\n  Somewhat incredibly, given the rhetoric, just 8 percent of the \nrespondents listed product liability as a major problem in the \nmanufacturing industry, only 8 percent. This is not a survey of the \nwhole public. This is a survey of manufacturers. In fact, almost three \ntimes as many of the respondent manufacturers listed the Federal budget \ndeficit as undermining the growth of the manufacturing sector.\n  So who is on the side of the manufacturers here? Those who support \nreforming the legal system, which less than 1 in 10 manufacturers \nlisted as a major impediment to growth in investment? Or those of us \nwho have consistently been out here voting for legislation that slashes \nGovernment spending and reduces the deficit, such as the President's \n1993 budget bill that has cut our annual projected deficits by almost \n$100 billion.\n  I guess I am a little surprised at the eagerness of those on the \nother side to usurp the authority of the States to address a problem \nthat has traditionally been a State issue. Unfortunately, though, I am \nno longer surprised at the continued pecking away at the provisions and \nprinciples contained in our Constitution. In this case I think this has \nsomething to do with some of the principles embodied in the Bill of \nRights. I think it is astonishing the number of different efforts \nunderway in this Congress that would dramatically alter the U.S. \nConstitution. Let us just start with the proposed constitutional \namendments.\n  We had the balanced budget amendment, which was thankfully defeated \nin this body. We had a constitutional amendment being proposed for \nline-item veto authority. Soon we will apparently be considering term \nlimit constitutional amendments, which in my view represent a \nprofoundly undemocratic viewpoint, that we need to limit people's \nvoting rights by telling the voters back home for whom they can and \ncannot vote.\n  There are other things this Congress apparently has in store for \nrewriting, redrafting, and in my view gutting the Bill of Rights. \nConstitutional amendments have been introduced on school prayer and \nflag desecration which, to my knowledge, would mark an unprecedented \nhistorical event by amending the first amendment. And in the Judiciary \nCommittee recently, Mr. President--you sit on that committee as well--\nthe Republicans have all but stated their intention to toss out the \nexclusionary rule, a key legal principle derived from the fourth \namendment, on unlawful search and seizures. Perhaps we will soon be \nholding hearings in the Judiciary Committee on the eighth amendment and \nwhat may be obsolete principles, according to some, of excessive bail \nand cruel and unusual punishment.\n  In a sense I think this bill unfortunately turns us to another \nprovision of the Bill of Rights, the seventh amendment. This product \nliability legislation in my view really, at least in principle, \ncontradicts an important legal principle that has been the cornerstone \nof our judicial process for the last 200 years, and that is the right \nto trial by jury. True, there have been no proposals in the 104th \nCongress, at least not yet, to eliminate an individual's right to a \njury trial. But I am concerned about it, especially after the senior \nSenator from West Virginia has described the efforts of some in this \nCongress to relegate the Constitution to the rare book room of the \nlibrary.\n  But I think it is clear what a tremendous emphasis our Founders \nplaced on the notion of allowing a panel of your peers to determine \nyour fate, and that it is the jury, representative of the American \npeople as a whole, that is best equipped to hear the facts of a case, \nfilter out the truth, determine who is at fault in a case, and then \nfinally determine the appropriate degree of punishment. That is a jury \nfunction in our common law tradition, not a judge function, \ntraditionally, and certainly not the function of the Federal Government \nas embodied in the U.S. Congress in Washington.\n  I will speak in more detail about this at a later time but I view \nthis measure as nothing more or less than an assault on the concept of \ntrial by jury.\n  Mr. President, in addition this legislation is riddled with \ncomplications and contradiction. Let me discuss this cap on punitive \ndamages for a moment. Under this legislation, punitive damages are \ncapped at $250,000, or three times a plaintiff's economic damages, \nwhichever is greater.\n  First, I find it interesting that those who support this legislation \nclaim that it provides uniform Federal standards with respect to \nproduct liability. How can they even stand up with a straight face and \nsay that? It is simply not true because, if this was truly a uniform \nstandard, that would mean the punitive damages would be capped at \n$250,000, or three times economic damages in all of our 50 States. But \nthat is not the case. Those States that currently prohibit punitive \ndamages would be permitted to continue to completely prohibit punitive \ndamages. They would not have to comply with this new Federal standard \nof allowing at least up to $250,000 or three times economic damages in \npunitive damage awards.\n  So let us be clear about what this means. This is the opposite of \nuniformity. If two individuals living in States with different sets of \nproduct liability laws are injured by defective products produced in \nthose respective States the two individuals have substantially \ndifferent legal rights and remedies available to them. But that is not \nall. One of the foremost purposes of punitive damage awards is not only \nto punish those manufacturers who deliberately and willfully market a \nproduct they know to be effective and dangerous, it also is to deter \nother manufacturers from engaging in such practices. I would presume \nthat the reason some punitive damage awards are permitted under this \nbill--at least I hope this is the view--is because the supporters of \nthis bill presumably agree that punitive damages have at least some \nsort of role, some purpose to play in deterring such abuses and \nprotecting consumers.\n  Mr. President, this just does not add up. Under this bill, those \nStates that currently prohibit punitive damages would be able to \ncontinue to completely prohibit punitive damages. That means consumers, \nchildren, and the elderly living in different States with different \nsets of laws will have substantially different protection from injuries \nand defective products.\n  So much for this notion that this bill is all about uniform Federal \nstandards, and so much for the idea that this bill is fair, equitable, \nand beneficial to consumers. But again, I assume that most of the \nsupporters of this legislation do have a feeling of supporting some \nconcept of punitive damages, recognizing that there are clearly a set \nof cases where punitive damage awards are appropriate and necessary to \nsanction a manufacturer who has been willfully negligent.\n  Mr. President, I ask: Why do we not force those States that currently \nhave this absolute rule prohibiting any punitive damage awards to \nchange their laws and to meet this new Federal standard that is \nproposed in this bill?\n  I guess I am going to have to take a crack at predicting the answer \nto that question. I presume that the answer would be that we here in \nCongress should defer to the State legislatures that have made the \ndetermination that there should be no punitive damage awards in their \nState's product liability cases.\n  [[Page S5705]] But how does this rationale justify the preemption of \nState laws, such as those in my home State of Wisconsin, that allow \npunitive damage awards where appropriate? Why do we not respect the \nState of Wisconsin enough to defer to the wisdom and judgment of its \nlegislature and its Governor on this matter?\n  It appears to me to be completely contradictory to say that you \nsupport uniform Federal standards for product liability laws, and also \nsupport the notion that States can have different standards for \npunitive damage awards. The bottom line for those on the other side of \nthis aisle is clear: Giving more power to the State and local \ngovernments is a great idea, but only when you agree with the \nprinciples and policy that those entities are pursuing.\n  Second, I assume that those who support limiting punitive damages do \nso because they believe that these awards are out of control and that \nlimiting punitive damages will allow us to somehow simultaneously \nimprove our productivity and innovation and somehow continue to \nconstrain the abuses--sometimes very willful abuses--of manufacturers \nwho market defective products.\n  I would like to now examine those premises. First, with regard to the \nfrequency and size of punitive damage awards, I think that the evidence \nthat has been presented thus far has made it clear that punitive damage \nawards have been grossly mischaracterized. They are not out of control. \nThey are not adversely affecting the competitiveness of American \nmanufacturers.\n  Recently, the Senate Judiciary Committee on which I serve held a \nhearing on punitive damage. At that hearing Dr. Stephen Daniels of the \nAmerican Bar Foundation reported findings of a study that he completed \nof over 19,000 civil jury verdicts in 89 counties in 12 States plus the \nentire States of Alaska, Idaho, and Montana for the years 1988 through \n1990.\n  Not only did this study find that punitive damages are awarded in a \nsmall percentage of all civil cases--that figure was roughly 4.8 \npercent--the study also excluded that punitive damage awards were \nmodest and more often awarded in financial property harm cases than in \nproduct liability cases. This study was consistent with an earlier \nstudy of Dr. Daniels of punitive damage awards in the early 1980's. \nThat study at that time produced very similar results.\n  The bottom line is that in recent years there has been virtually no \nproliferation in the size or frequency of punitive damage awards.\n  As has been cited by others as well, another study by Professors \nMichael Rustad and Thomas Koening found that during the years 1965 \nthrough 1990, a 25-year period, there were a total of just 355 punitive \ndamage awards in both State and Federal courts. Roughly a quarter of \nthese awards were reversed or remanded upon appeal. Mr. President, 91 \nof these cases were related to the asbestos issue. That means excluding \nasbestos cases there has been an average of about 10 punitive damage \nawards a year in both Federal and State courts for the past 25 years.\n  Clearly these studies and others demonstrate the inaccuracy of claims \nthat punitive damages are increasing in size and frequency. Those who \nbelieve we need to cap punitive damage awards in product liability \ncases, as this bill prescribes, should understand that we are only \ntalking apparently about roughly 10 cases per year.\n  What will happen to the quality of American-made products under this \nlegislation? How concerned will multimillion-dollar corporations be \nabout the safety and quality of their products when they are most \nlikely to face a punitive damage award that would only be equal to a \nfraction of their profits in one day--just a fraction of one day's \ncorporate profits? It does not sound like much of a deterrent.\n  Just last year, a California jury ordered Dow Corning Corp. to pay \n$6.5 million in punitive damages for knowingly manufacturing faulty \nsilicone gel breast implants. This verdict was upheld by the ninth \ncircuit court of appeals that found that Dow Corning knew that the \nproduct had possible defects and exposed thousands of women to a \npotentially painful and debilitating disease.\n  Under this legislation, that punitive damage award would have been \nreduced to three times economic damages, or about $l.4 million. It \nwould have been a 78-percent reduction in that judgment. Measured \nagainst Dow Corning's assets of $l.4 million, punitive damage award for \nthese acts would have only represented about 0.04 percent of that \ncorporation's assets; just four one-hundredths percent.\n  What does this mean? It means that a corporation was able to \nknowingly market a product that they knew to be defective, and they \nknew it threatened the health of thousands of women. And yet under this \nbill they would only have had to pay a penalty of four one-hundredths \nof 1 percent of their assets of a huge corporation.\n  That is what happens when you replace the jury's knowledge and \nfamiliarity with the particulars of a case and replace it with an \narbitrary cap on certain damage awards. That clearly illustrates just \nwho stands to benefit from this legislation and demonstrates the \nabsurdity of the notion that anyone could say that this bill is fair to \nconsumers.\n  I also want to discuss the elimination of joint liability for \nnoneconomic damages under this legislation. Opponents of the principle \nof joint liability make a pretty compelling case. I have to concede \nthat on the surface it is one you really have to examine in order to \ncounter it. It is hard to understand. Why should someone who is held to \nonly 50 percent, or 25 percent, or even 10 percent liable for an \nindividual's injury be forced to assume a much greater burden of \ncompensatory damages if another liable party is financially unable to \npay the damages? Certainly there is a force behind that when you just \nlook at it on the surface.\n Why should a party that is held to be partially liable for an injury \nbe forced to pay an entire damage award if the other party or parties \nare unable to pay?\n\n  Some believe this is a good argument for supporters of this bill. It \nsounds good; it sounds fair, unless, of course, you are a 10-year-old \nchild who has lost his vision for the rest of his life because of the \nnegligence and irresponsibility of a manufacturer who is held not \nentirely but the manufacturer is held partially liable for the damages. \nThe manufacturer is partly responsible for the horrible thing that has \nhappened to this 10-year-old.\n  Suppose in this case the manufacturer is held 60 percent liable while \nthe large multi-million-dollar retail chain that sold the product is \nheld 20 percent liable, and other parties involved make up the \nremaining 20 percent. Suppose the manufacturer then files for \nbankruptcy. What happens then? Sure, the child's family will be \nreimbursed for their hospital bills and maybe for the lost wages of the \n10-year-old for the lawns he used to mow or the driveways he used to \nshovel.\n  When we talk about noneconomic damages--noneconomic damages--the \nchild under this law, under this bill before the Senate, will only get \na fraction of that to which he is entitled.\n  I notice that the interests that support this legislation have \ncleverly chosen to highlight kids in that age group, using the Little \nLeague of America as an example of the need for tort reform. But what \nabout the baseball games that this 10-year-old boy could no longer \nparticipate in because of his loss of vision? What about the fact that \nthis 10-year-old boy could no longer even watch a baseball game either \nat a stadium or on television? Baseball is finally back, as of \nyesterday and today. But this bill cuts out those considerations and \ncaps them for a child such as this.\n  Is it fair that supporters of this legislation are more concerned \nabout the manufacturer who is 10 or 20 or even 30 percent liable for an \naccident, partially liable, more concerned about that manufacturer than \nthe child who is zero percent responsible, zero percent responsible, \nand completely innocent of any wrongdoing? Is that the right balance?\n  Of course, those corporate interests backing this legislation are not \nterribly concerned about those questions. They are preoccupied with \nstock reports and profit margins. You have to recognize that asking the \nretailer to pay more is much more fair than forcing an injured child \nwho is 100 percent innocent of any wrongdoing to receive only a \nfraction of the compensation that will allow him to return to as \n[[Page S5706]] close a life as possible before the accident, which the \nretail chain is partially to blame for, actually occurred. And I think \nthis provision, this provision that I am discussing now--and it is hard \nto choose because there are a lot of bad ones in the bill--more than \nany other one in the bill as revealing the outlandish proposition that \nthis bill is fair. It is this provision that changes the complexion of \nour legal system.\n  This legislation will alter the precept of our legal system to say \nthat a victim of wrongdoing and negligence is no longer the principal \nconcern of the tort law. The principal concern will now be the profits \nand economic health of a business interest that has been convicted by a \njury of negligence in the manufacture, sale, and use of a defective \nproduct. This is about companies that have been adjudicated guilty of \nmaking something that did not work right and that can hurt people. This \nis not about companies that have been found to be innocent. This \nlegislation is grounded in a belief that it is more important for our \nbusiness and manufacturing communities to remain prosperous, very \nprosperous in many cases, and shielded from liability than it is to \nreturn an innocent victim of a defective product back to a state as \nclose as possible to their well-being before the accident occurred.\n  So, Mr. President, I look forward to returning to discuss a lot of \nthe specific amendments and issues in the bill. Let me just conclude my \nopening statement by saying that I believe these choices here are \nfairly clear, the lines are fairly well drawn, and that bill is a bill \nthat definitely deserves to go down to defeat in the Senate.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, first I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from North Carolina [Mr. Faircloth] be added as a cosponsor \nboth to S. 565, the Product Liability Fairness Act of 1995, and to the \nGorton substitute amendment to H.R. 956.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I think perhaps at this point in the \ndebate, it may be appropriate to speak not so much to the broad nature \nof the bill but to two or three arguments advanced by the last two \nopposing Senators, the distinguished Senators from Wisconsin and from \nCalifornia.\n  Together with Senator Hollings, the Senator from Wisconsin was \nsomehow or another implicating the seventh amendment right of trial by \njury into this debate and has implied at least that the bill before us \nsomehow or another restricts that constitutional right to trial by \njury.\n  This is a curious, perhaps a bizarre argument. It is an argument \nwhich is equally applicable to every statute, State or Federal, which \nsets legal parameters which juries must follow in reaching verdicts. To \nsay somehow or another that a limitation on punitive damages is a \nviolation of the seventh amendment is to say that a jury instruction \nlimiting actual damages to those that have really been suffered by a \nvictim is somehow unconstitutional, that any instructions to any jury \nas to what the law is under any circumstances are unconstitutional.\n  Even more strange, more bizarre to this Senator, is the proposition \ncoming from Members of this body who when we are dealing with the \ncriminal code want very strict legal limitations on sentences that can \nbe imposed on convicted criminals. I have not heard either of these \nSenators argue that a jury which finds an individual guilty of a \nmisdemeanor under Federal law should be permitted to impose life \nimprisonment on that convict, and yet that is exactly the proposition \nfor which they argue here in connection with a civil case.\n  They argue that as a form of punishment, punitive damages, a jury's \ndiscretion should be absolutely unlimited, no matter how egregious the \nconduct; no matter whether we are dealing with an individual, a small \ncompany, or a large corporation, the jury's discretion should be \nuntrammeled, and that the jury should be permitted to impose punitive \ndamages of whatever limit.\n  Mr. President, that is analogous to saying a jury ought to be able to \nsentence a jaywalker to hanging if for some reason or other the \ndiscretion of the jury should reach that point.\n  Why is it--this is one question I have not heard answers to, directly \nor indirectly. Why is it that in our entire criminal code we have as a \nprotection against convicted defendants limits on sentences, but in \ncivil actions in which proof does not need to be adduced beyond a \nreasonable doubt but only by a preponderance of the evidence in many \nStates, and by clear and convincing evidence should this bill pass, why \nhere alone should that discretion be absolutely unlimited?\n  It is a question I would like to have answered by those who oppose \nany kind of limitations. A debate against the specific limitations of \nthis bill and adjustment, a feeling that we can do better, is something \nthat I know both the Senator from West Virginia and I are both open to.\n We may not have gotten the formula exactly right.\n\n  But the proposition that there should be some kind of limit seems to \nme to be obvious and has even moved the Supreme Court of the United \nStates to say, without coming up with what those limits are, that there \nmay be some constitutional limits, with the clear implication that \nCongress could make just exactly such a decision.\n  The next point that I should like to clear up at this stage, Mr. \nPresident, is the confusion, I think--and I can only ascribe it to \nthat--which is the inevitable result of listening to opposition \nspeakers about whether or not there is some kind of limitation in this \nbill on the recovery of all of the damages which an individual actually \nsuffers as a result of the negligence of a manufacturer.\n  Mr. President, the only limitations in this bill are limitations on \npunitive damages, which by definition are not direct compensation for \nlosses suffered as the result of an accident or of someone's \nnegligence. No limitations are imposed by this bill on the recovery of \nactual damages--loss of wages, medical expenses, and the like. No \nlimitations are included in this bill on the recovery of noneconomic \ndamages. ``Pain and suffering'' is the usual phrase for such damages. \nThere are those who propose such limitations, but they are not included \nin this bill, and this Senator does not intend to vote for any. And I \nbelieve I also speak for the Senator from West Virginia in that \nconnection.\n  So no individual, none cited by the Senator from California, none \ncited by the Senator from Wisconsin, none cited by the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, will be deprived by the passage of this bill of his or \nher right to recover all economic and all pain and suffering damages \nwhich a jury determines they have suffered in a product liability \naction.\n  The only limitations are on the amount of punishment to which a \nnegligence defendant can be subjected. And there, as I have already \nsaid, we have the curious argument that in the civil courts that \npunishment should be unlimited while in the criminal courts it should \nbe subjected to very, very real limits.\n  I also found interesting and somewhat curious the argument of the \nSenator from Wisconsin with respect to joint damages. He said--and I \nbelieve I am paraphrasing him correctly--why should an innocent victim \nbe deprived of all of the damages that victim suffered even from a \nparty not responsible for all of those damages? That, if a retailer, \nfor example, is responsible for only 30 percent of the losses of an \nindividual plaintiff, the plaintiff should nonetheless be able to \ncollect 100 percent of his total damages from that retailer.\n  Well, why not from you or me, Mr. President? Under those \ncircumstances, what difference is there? Once we have determined the \ndefendant is responsible for more than what that defendant was \nresponsible for, there really is not any distinction between one \ncitizen and another.\n  Should we, for example, in the Criminal Code, when two brothers, one \nwealthy and one not wealthy, are sentenced for a crime, each, in \naddition to a jail sentence, is fined $100,000, say that the wealthy \nbrother should pay the other brother's fine because the other brother \ncannot pay it? Well, of course not. We would never think of doing that \nin a criminal case. And yet we do that constantly in connection with \njoint liability.\n  [[Page S5707]] That is not justice, Mr. President. And if we feel \nthat the victim should always be fully compensated, then perhaps that \nis a duty of society as a whole, but it should not be imposed on one \nparty not responsible for the particular harm for which compensation is \nbeing sought.\n  I want to congratulate the Senator from West Virginia on his \nmarvelously logical answers to the Senator from California on research \nand development of new products. Of course, if you look only at a \nparticular victim, that victim and that victim's attorneys want the \nmaximum possible recovery. But when the net result of the system which \ncauses that tells one very large company that it should logically give \nup AIDS research or contraceptive research lock, stock, and barrel \nbecause the flame is not worth the candle, that there are simply too \nmany risks in the development of a new product, it is not an answer to \nsay that there are other companies that are still engaged in research. \nWe in our society want the maximum possible number of people, of \nindividuals and of companies, to attempt to deal with all of the ills \nwhich afflict the human race.\n  We were not advantaged, to take another example, when 20 years ago 20 \ncompanies made and developed football helmets and now only two are \nleft. That is not an advantage.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is happy to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is a good point to yield on.\n  If you will forgive me for this observation. I have been watching the \ndebate on this most significant bill. It seems as if we have been \nhearing from no one except lawyers. And I do not want to lose sight of \nthe fact that this bill is not so much a legal reform as a potential of \nbeing the largest jobs bill passed in probably a decade.\n  When the Senator talks about the football helmets, there are so many \nproducts that used to be produced exclusively in America that are not \nproduced here any more for that one very reason. You mentioned football \nhelmets. I could name a number of things.\n  But what comes to my mind, in the real world, I was in the field of \naviation. In fact, I have the distinction of being the only Member of \nCongress to ever fly an airplane around the world.\n  I remember, when I did that, going across Europe and seeing where all \nof the aircraft are being made today that used to be made in America. \nPrior to 1980, we manufactured about 17,000 single-engine aircraft each \nyear. In the last 4 years, we have averaged about 400 a year.\n  And there is not any big mystery as to why that happened. It happened \nbecause you cannot be globally competitive and offset the costs of \nproduct liability.\n  In fact, in the other body, when I was in the Aviation Subcommittee, \nwe had a bill up that we were successful in getting passed finally this \nlast year, the Aviation Revitalization Act of 1994. We had testimony \nfrom Beech Aircraft that the average cost to offset the exposure of \nproduct liability was $83,000 a vehicle. Obviously, if you are talking \nabout a large jet aircraft, that $83,000 is not all that significant. \nBut when you are talking about a single-engine plane or a four-\npassenger aircraft, you cannot be competitive.\n  We actually had the repose bill that I think you remember and you \nwere participating over on this side on it.\n  I remember when Russ Meyer, who is the president of Cessna Aircraft, \ntestified before our committee. Now this is a product liability bill \nthat did one thing. It said that once a manufacturer of an aircraft or \nof aircraft parts had had that aircraft or those parts functioning as \nthey were designed to function for 18 years, beyond that point they \ncould not be held liable for something that went wrong with the \nproduct.\n  They had some exceptions to it. That seemed to be very reasonable. \nRuss Meyer, the president of Cessna Aircraft, said on the record, \n``Inhofe, if you pass that bill, we at Cessna Aircraft will start \nmanufacturing single-engine aircraft which we quit manufacturing in \n1986 and we commit that we will manufacture 2,000 airplanes in the \nfirst year after the bill is passed after our tooling up.''\n  That is exactly what has happened. You might remember when Piper \nAircraft went into bankruptcy. There was a news conference. The \npresident of Piper said that the reason they went into bankruptcy was \nbecause they could not be competitive on a global basis. In fact, they \neven suggested they could move their tooling up to Canada and make the \nsame airplanes and make a profit, while they could not in this country.\n  Anyway, as a result of all that, we were successful in passing that \nbill. I remember when it started out as being a 12-year repose and then \nwent to 15 years. When they finally agreed to settle on 18 years, I \nwent to the underwriting community and said, ``I think that is too \nlong.'' They said, ``No.''\n  The point is there has to be some point in the future in which \nlawsuits cannot be lodged against manufacturers. It is now a reality. \nSince that time, Cessna Aircraft has done what they said they would do, \nthey are producing aircraft.\n  I have heard estimates as to how many jobs will be created \nnationwide, and it is in excess of 25,000 jobs, just in one industry \nwhere product liability reform was the cause of the increase in jobs.\n  We know in Kerrville, TX, Mooney is now increasing their production \nrate by 40 percent. We know that Unison is now making electronic \nignition systems. In my State of Oklahoma, there is a single-engine \nmanufacturer whose first model will be coming off the assembly line in \nthe next few weeks. It is a composite single-engine airplane. We know \nin Nowata, OK, they are making cylinders, all because of one thing. We \nreformed product liability in one industry and that industry happened \nto be the aircraft industry.\n  So I think sometimes when we become too theoretical and try to guess \nwhat the future will bring if we do this, this is an actual case as to \nhow many jobs in America are being created as a result of product \nliability reform only in one industry.\n  I was very glad to be a part of that, and you were, too. I certainly \nthink that is the most convincing evidence that we should expand that \nto other manufactured items.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for that \neloquent statement. It does seem to me that the experience of just the \npast year, since the passage of that small aircraft statute of repose, \nindicates much more graphically than can any theoretical argument the \nactual positive impact on jobs, on the availability of new products, of \nAmerican competitiveness. We do not have to argue theory anymore. We \ncan now argue from fact, and the burden of proof, it seems to me, is on \nthose who say ``that far and no further'' is overwhelming.\n  I must tell you, when the Senator from California stated that she \nfelt that no changes were needed in our product liability laws, and \nwhen we got the same implication from the Senator from Wisconsin, I \nlooked up their record last year in voting on that aircraft bill \nexpecting to find they voted against it, but they voted for it. So \ntheir position must be that aircraft is the only thing where any kind \nof reform is needed. Nothing else. It was the only industry adversely \naffected by product liability litigation.\n  Of course, that proposition is insupportable. If a statute of repose \nalone could have such a dramatically positive impact on the small \naircraft industry, it is obvious that balance changes, such as these \nare which, as I already said, does not restrict anyone's right to \nrecover all of their actual provable damages in any product liability \ncase, that the positive impact of change is going to be dramatic and \nsignificant.\n  For those who look back and say here are terrible things that \nhappened and we want an absolutely risk-free society in any and all \ncircumstances, they see, I think quite erroneously, one set of \nconsequences. Those who feel that we have not developed all of the \nproducts that we ought to develop in the history of the United States, \nthat we should encourage new developments and that we should encourage \ncompetition, and that while those who make serious mistakes, purposeful \nor negligent mistakes, should be responsible for the consequences of \nthose mistakes, we are not going to add to that responsibility, \nabsolutely unlimited, unfettered by any discretion, punishment without \nany of the protections of the \n[[Page S5708]] criminal code that we should do that, seems to me, as I \nbelieve it does to the Senator from Oklahoma, overwhelmingly obvious.\n  As I said in the beginning, and as the Senator from Oklahoma said so \neloquently, we now have one very positive example of how this kind of \nlegislation works. Now let us do more of it, and I think we will see an \neven more dramatic recovery in many industries which have been \nconstricted on the part of many companies that have abandoned lines of \nproducts and many new companies, entrepreneurs who would like to go \ninto new businesses and who are discouraged from doing so by the \nspecter of lawsuits.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, during the course of the discussion \nthis afternoon, it seems that the debate has centered on the premise \nthat somehow there isn't anything wrong with the present system.\n  Let me try to lay out some of the reasons why we need to change the \nproduct liability system, not radically, but change it in a way which \nmakes it fair to consumers and to businesses.\n  Let us just start out by saying the consumers lose often under the \ncurrent system. They receive inadequate compensation through product \nlitigation. Severely injured consumers only recover about a third of \ntheir actual damages, while their mildly injured counterparts recover \napproximately five times their economic losses. There is a disparity \nthere which is not good.\n  Consumers wait forever. They have to wait 2\\1/2\\ years to receive \ntheir compensation because of the whole process of a trial and \ndepositions and then appeals, particularly where punitive damages are \nconcerned, which can force people to wait even longer. So an injured \nperson can be forced to wait between 2\\1/2\\ to 4 years to get \ncompensated for something that happened to them, let us say in a \nmachine shop where their hand was mangled which puts them in a position \nof having to depend entirely on their own resources, worker's \ncompensation,\n and health insurance, if they have any health insurance. The consumer \npays heavily for our current product liability system, and that is \nbecause the costs of liability insurance increase the costs of products \nthat people need. Consumers also suffer because manufacturers decide \nnot to introduce needed new products, and thus the consumers do not get \nthe products they need. Consumers may be paying 50 percent of the cost \nof the ladder in insurance costs for liability. For some \npharmaceuticals it is up to 95 percent. Under our system, consumers can \npay outrageous costs.\n\n  The current tort system pays more to lawyers and transaction costs \nthan it does to claimants. That is really a quite remarkable statement. \nHow can we have a product liability system where somebody is injured \nand the lawyers on both sides end up getting more money than does the \ninjured person? I do not understand why that is not something that \nsomebody would want to change and make better. I think the consumer \nloses on that.\n  The consumer also faces a closed courthouse door under the current \nlaw, and that is because in some States the statute of limitations \nsimply does not allow the consumer to take his or her request for due \nprocess into the courtroom because it is already closed; the door is \nclosed. And we are saying in our bill that, in fact, we are going to \nmake sure that anybody who has been injured, but may not even know it \nat the time because it may be a toxic injury or a chemical injury of \nsome sort, will still be able to be compensated. Under our bill, \ninjured persons will still be able to seek compensation 15 or 20 years \nafter they have been injured if they do not discover that injury until \nthat much time has elapsed. This is called the discovery rule, and it \napplies not only to the discovery that the individual is sick, but also \nto the cause of the illness, and once that has been discovered, the \nstatute of limitations for 2 years begins to run.\n  This is a very proconsumer change, particularly in the world that we \nare moving into, which has so many toxic chemicals that can threaten \nthe health of consumers.\n  I think, also, because we have talked about consumers--and this is \nmeant to be a balanced bill so let us also talk about manufacturers. I \nthink manufacturers lose under the current system.\n  Liability stifles research, and it stifles development. This has been \namply recorded in the literature. Many businesses spend a lot more on \nlitigation than on research and development. That may not be the only \nreason. Companies tend to be pulling back on R anyway. But the fact \nthat they spend more on litigation--many do--than on R does not sound \nto me like an American sort of system. Well, that is our current \nsystem. I would think people would want to make it a better one. \nLiability makes successful products unmarketable.\n  I have already talked this afternoon about Bendectin, the antinausea \nmedication, different AIDS-related and pre-AIDS-related vaccines and \nmedicines, football helmets, and others. They simply are not made \navailable because it is decided they are too big a risk and therefore \nBendectin, which is available in Canada and has been for years, is not \navailable in the United States, and thus our consumers and our \nmanufacturers lose under this because they are precluded from doing \nsomething for fear of litigation.\n  Liability decreases funding. That is fairly obvious. The fear of \nproduct liability has diminished investment in basic scientific \nresearch. Now, that is important because you have basic research and \nyou have applied research leading to commercialization of a product, \nand they are very different. Basic research is sort of the seminal \nresearch. That is the kind of thing where you really have to have a \nsense of stability and predictability and confidence in the future, and \nthat is now way down, and part of the reason for that is the fear of \nproduct liability litigation.\n  I think that the United States itself, as a country, loses under the \ncurrent system of product liability. Insurance rates disable \nmanufacturers. American manufacturers pay 10 to 50 times more product \nliability insurance rates than do their foreign competitors. Well, at \nsome point, when you are fighting over every nickel in a car or in some \nvaccine, or something else, these things matter, and the foreign \ncountry wins out and we lose out. So America loses out.\n  In fact, in Texas, in a single year, they have estimated that the \nliability system has cost the State of Texas 79,000 jobs. I cannot \nprove that, but that is what has been said. Texas stands behind that. \nSeventy-nine thousand jobs in West Virginia would be as if a \nsubstantial part of the population simply moved out. And then the funny \nthing also is that there is no real proof that the current product \nliability system does not enhance product safety. It is interesting \nthat the number of tort suits rose dramatically in the 1980's, even \nthough consumer injury rates declined steadily. Tort goes up, injuries \ngo down, and now that was not just in the 1980's but also in the \n1970's. For 20 years, injuries were going down and tort actions were \ngoing up.\n  Let me spend a moment discussing the costs of the tort system in the \nUnited States. Estimates of the cost of tort litigation, of which \nproduct liability litigation is part, range from $80 billion to $117 \nbillion a year. Concerning the need for uniformity, the United States \nhas 51 separate product liability systems. The European Economic \nCommunity, which is 13 countries, has one product liability system. \nJapan has one system. I have worked very hard in Japan. For years we \nhad something called the structural impediment talks with the Japanese, \nand we would tell each other what we thought each country ought to do \nto improve their performance so that our trade deficit would get better \nand theirs would get less better, and one of the things the Japanese \nkept saying to us was that you ought to get more uniformity into your \nproduct liability laws because you are getting eaten alive by a lot of \ncountries, including ourselves.\n  This is staggering, and I hope that those who hear my voice will \nlisten to this. Nearly 90 percent of all companies in the United States \nof America can expect to become a defendant in a product liability case \nat least once. It has been suggested that there were only 11 cases in \nwhich punitive damages were awarded in 1990. But if 90 percent of all \nbusinesses can expect to be sued at some point, this is the so-called \n[[Page S5709]] chilling effect. Are 90 percent of American businesses \ndoing the wrong thing each day?\n  Manufacturers today can be sued for products that were manufactured \nin the 1800's. I do not think that is the American way.\n  Companies can be forced to pay damages to persons whose abuse of \nalcohol and illegal drugs caused their injuries. That is wrong; that is \nunfair. In 1994, the Gallup survey said that one in five small \nbusinesses reported that they have decided not to introduce a new \nproduct or not to enhance an existing one out of concern for potential \nproduct liability. That is 20 percent of all small businesses saying we \nare not going to improve our product, or we are going to withdraw the \nproducts we are about to introduce.\n  Interestingly, the Brookings Institution found no link between \nlawsuits and the safety of products. That is an important statement. \nAnd they documented many instances where safety improvements are not \nmade, again, because of the fear of litigation.\n That being, if they made an improvement, it would imply that the \nprevious iteration was somehow not safe and therefore they might get \nsued.\n\n  The United States is the only nation in the world that allows a \nsafety improvement to be admitted as evidence that the preceding \nproduct was less safe. We do it legally. Therefore, companies have \nreason to be afraid.\n  I note that it is 5 o'clock. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Under the previous order there \nwill be 1 hour of debate equally divided between the Senator from \nMichigan and the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan would amend \nhis amendment to provide not just ``claimant'' but ``parties''--which \nwould be both the plaintiff and the defendants.\n  Therein, Mr. President, goes right to the reason--one of the big \nreasons--I put in my amendment to his. It was quite obvious to me, \nquickly reading on last evening the amendment of the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan, that here they were getting plaintiffs' lawyers. \nIn my amendment I wanted to get at all lawyers.\n  Now, right to the point, in this limited time, once again what we \nhave, Mr. President, is an issue that searches for justification, or a \nsolution looking for a problem that has been going on for some 15 \nyears.\n  It started, of course, back in the Ford administration whereby they \nsaid it was a national problem, and President Ford appointed a \ncommission. The commission found it was not a national problem and \nrecommended leaving it to the States.\n  They were not satisfied with that, Mr. President. They came in and \nsaid insurance was impossible to obtain. We, of course, refuted this \nargument, and they do not even contend for it today.\n  Otherwise, they came with the claim that there was a litigation \nexplosion and we needed massive product liability reform in order to \nconfront the national litigation explosion, which, of course, was \ndecreasing not increasing.\n  Then they came and said they were not developing certain products out \nof fear of litigation, this was particularly true in the drug and \nchemical industry. Of course when we were debating NAFTA and GATT these \nindustries proclaimed that they were world class and could compete with \nanybody in the world. So then they came with competitiveness. There was \na buzz word that went on around here for about 5 years, that the \nmarket--by the way, which now we will leave everything to the market \nforces--the market was insufficient and what we needed was a Congress \nto pass a law to make us competitive, and that unless we legislate \nproduct liability we could not be competitive.\n  Of course, we pointed out in our own backyard we had some 100 German \nindustries, 50 Japanese industries, blue-chip corporations of America, \nwho all were coming to my State and never once complaining about \nproduct liability.\n  I have been the Governor and the Senator there now for numerous \nyears, and the attraction of industry and we can relate industry after \nindustry almost get a habit of asking the question. So it was not \ncompetitiveness.\n  Then they started with various gimmickry with respect to the Little \nLeague. They said, no, they were not involved. And then they went, of \ncourse, to the matter of the Girl Scouts. The Girl Scouts said, ``Wait, \nwait. That is not the case at all. We do not have a problem with \nproduct liability.''\n  Then they had a little TV show where a former colleague, Senator \nGeorge McGovern of South Dakota, came on and said he went broke on \naccount of product liability. Now they have quit running that because \nthat is not the case at all.\n  Still a solution searching for a problem, now they place their ace \ncard--lawyers, aha. Any time we take a poll in America, immediately the \ndisdain for lawyers. So they say, if we cannot get this bill passed on \nlawyers, it will never pass.\n  It talks here in the amendment, as I was just reading it, of ``equity \nin legal fees.'' I challenged the distinguished Senator from Kentucky \nand the Senator from Michigan on last evening to bring me the series of \nproduct liability cases where somehow the clients had been done in by \nthe plaintiff's lawyers.\n  Of course, the amendment by the Senator from Michigan termed it \n``claimants.'' Now I guess he would like to say, just a minute, we will \nchange ``claimants'' to ``parties'' and get attorneys on both sides.\n  But there is not any question that these men are very erudite and \nvery learned and have written books in law and everything else of that \nkind, and they knew what they were doing until, of course, we put up \nour amendment, and said, wait a minute, we will bring into focus the \nreal issue here, and that is not product liability, but lawyers.\n  Now, if I could put in a bill to solve the lawyers problem, I would \ndo it. However, I do not know that we are that good here in the Senate \nof the United States.\n  Be that as it may, the idea is, as was said in Henry VI ``Kill all \nthe lawyers.'' Take any poll, and if we can convince the individual \nMembers, who are busy on so many different issues, to come now and vote \nwhether for or against lawyers, they will vote against the lawyers, and \nwe will get this bill passed.\n  I think of the saying:\n\n       Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at \n     the price of chains and slavery? . . . I know not what course \n     others may take, but give me liberty or give me death.\n\n  Patrick Henry, the lawyer.\n  We can see, Mr. President, that young leader sitting with his bill in \nhand, crafting the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson, the \nlawyer, or the father of the Federalist papers.\n\n       But what is government, save the best of reflections on \n     human nature? If men were angels, the government would not be \n     necessary. And if angels governed man, there would be no need \n     for controls over the government. So the task in formulating \n     a government to be administered by man over man is first, \n     frame that government with the capacity to control the \n     government and thereupon oblige that same government to \n     control itself.\n\n  James Madison, father of our Constitution.\n  Again, going up all Presidents right on up to Abraham Lincoln. We can \nsee him, ``equal justice under law,'' signing the Emancipation \nProclamation. Abraham Lincoln, the lawyer.\n  Or the darkest days of the Depression, people searching for hope. \n``All we have to fear is fear itself.'' Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a \nlawyer.\n  I can see now in December 1952, standing before the Supreme Court of \nthe United States.\n\n       But your honor, if the State-imposed policy of separation \n     by race is removed, the young children will have the freedom \n     to choose their school and their own classmates and play \n     together.\n\n  The beginning of the end of segregation in this land. Thurgood \nMarshall, of the NAACP, a lawyer.\n  Even today, we find Ralph Nader crusading for safety and health. On \nlast evening's TV Morris Dees down in Alabama, working around the \nclock--or Mississippi, I forget. I know Morris but I have forgotten. I \njust came back from Mississippi, but I know he has this Southern policy \non poverty, Southern law center on poverty where he has been tracking \nthat Ku Klux Klan.\n And \n[[Page S5710]] now the Michigan Militia and the others, against \nterrorism, at the risk of his own life; Morris Dees, a lawyer.\n  We begin to wonder, if these lawyers had been silenced what we would \nhave in this land? Obviously I am very proud to be an attorney at the \nbar and I am not going to join in this derision, save of those who just \nreally are fixers rather than lawyers at the bar, and Heavens knows \nthis city of full of them--60,000 lawyers and the majority of them come \nnow to fix us, the jury, on billable hours.\n  Pat Choate wrote his book, ``Agents of Influence,'' how the Japanese \nhave those attorney firms, over 100, retained at a cost of over $110 \nmillion. The country of Japan, by pay, is better represented than the \npeople of the United States in Washington. The consummate pay of 535 \nHouse Members and Senators is only $71 million. But they are all over \nus, and that is the genesis of this thing that has been going on for 15 \nto 16 years--the power of the lobby. Because the problem does not \nexist. It is not a national problem. We do have product liability; 46 \nof the 50 States have reformed their product liability laws in the last \n15 years. But now comes the ace card, if we can play this with respect \nto the equity of legal fees. What is the equity? That is the most \namazing thing, to this particular Senator, to have the parties \nsponsoring this legislation and trying to amend it talking in terms of \nthe consumer, how they are looking out for the consumer. Every consumer \norganization in the country is absolutely opposed to this bill. The \nAmerican Bar Association, they do not have lobbyists up here. The \nAssociation of State Legislators, they do not have lobbyists up here. \nThe Association of State Supreme Court Justices, they do not have \nlobbyists up here.\n  But yes, the Business Round Table, the Conference Board, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the chamber of commerce--yes, they keep \nbig buildings full of lobbyists. So we got this legal reform movement \ngoing and it has been a faltering point. So now they will bring in \nequity in legal fees on last evening--of course for plaintiff and not \nfor the defendant. Now the distinguished Senator says, ``I want to make \nit for both sides.'' That is what my amendment said.\n  Billable hours--we are paid at $133,000. I figured it out. If we \ncould have, rather than a minimum wage, have a maximum wage for these \nfixers, we would have a $50 a billable hour limitation. If they work 51 \nhours, I would give them $133,000 a year and then if they work some on \nthe weekend they could go on up to a couple of hundred thousand \ndollars--pretty good. But I figure we ought to pay them as much as we \npay the Senators, and that would be a goodly plenty and I think it \nwould clear out 30,000 of the 60,000--if we want to get rid of the \nlawyers. If we want to get rid of the lawyers.\n  So there is the amendment to bring into focus the absolutely empty \nnature of this particular initiative. And it is lobbyists moved, \norganized, financed, motivated, committed for in the campaigns. Yes, \nwhen I ran in 1992 I had the different groups come to me: ``Can't you \nhelp us this time on product liability?'' I said, ``They just passed \nthe reform here in South Carolina. What is the problem? Ask the judges; \ngo to talk to our judges. Most of them are Republicans, obviously, in \nSouth Carolina. They had been appointed by President Nixon, President \nReagan, President Ford, President Bush. They will tell you in a flash \nit is not a problem.'' But they have to find some reason. Now they are \nplaying the ace card, and that is why I put up this particular \namendment.\n  I do not guess I will be able to control them. I would like to. But, \nbe that as it may, we have had our time at bat to expose the nature of \nthis particular amendment and the nature of this particular \nlegislation. It is absolutely not in the interests of consumers, not in \nthe interests of good law. We have the professors, 121 professors at \nlaw have come as a group to attest against this particular measure. \nThey do not have lobbyists up here. No, it was not considered in the \nJudiciary Committee where fundamental law is considered. There was a \nquick 2-day turn, adding on amendments in the evening, destroying any \nidea of uniformity.\n  That is what they started with. At least they had the good conscience \nto change the title. I thought maybe it was a gimmick, but I will give \nthem credit for conscience. You will find this bill over on the House \nside, ``To regulate interstate commerce by providing for a uniform \nproduct liability law.'' But when you get over to the Senate side it is \nsome kind of fairness act they call it now. They at least got away from \nthe uniformity, not trying to continue that particular charade. ``This \nact may be cited as `The Product Liability Fairness Act Of 1995.'''\n  So we have the amendment relative to fees and instituting regulatory \nmeasures--bureaucracy at its worst. I have time to practice law but not \nto keep all the records. I have a simple, clear-cut contingent fee. I \nassume all the costs, assume all the expenses, assume all the bills for \nthe doctors, the witnesses, assume all the printing measures for the \ntranscript of the record, the appeal record and everything else of that \nkind going up to the court--I assume all of those. And when I get \nthrough, if we win then we get the third. If we lose we get nothing and \nI have paid all the bills.\n  It goes right to the heart of the misunderstanding of the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, when he \ntalks about delays, the trial lawyers delay. Heavens above, you get 10 \nor 15 of these cases you have backed up in the office thousands of \ndollars of cost and hours spent and never paid for. Billable hours? I \nnever had a client with billable hours in 20 years of law practice, but \nyou got that backed up. It is in my interests to bring that to a \nconclusion. I have to move on these cases. We are not trying to delay.\n  The ones who can sit up in the ivory tower on the 32d floor with the \nmahogany walls and Persian rugs and all the secretaries running around \nand all the investigators and you press buttons and say ``Well, yes, I \nam having this coffee but mark it down as thinking. Give me another \nbillable hour.''\n  Come on. You are worried about lawyers and their fees? Let us get to \nthe defense counsel that is running up the majority of the costs. He is \nabsolutely wrong. He is not for the consumers, the Senator from West \nVirginia. They are getting their money. They are not complaining. And \nthey are getting the majority of it. When it comes to who gets the \nmajority of the fees, plaintiff or the defendant, the defendants do. \nThe national insurance study, we put it in the committee report, shows \nthey are the ones running up the costs. We have no time or interest in \nrunning up any kind of costs whatever.\n  It is a proud thing in America that the poor and middle class can get \ncompetent representation. It has worked. It continues to work. It is \nnot a national problem. They never have had a hearing in any particular \nbody about lawyers' fees. But if that is the game, then when we take up \nmedical malpractice we will go into doctors' fees. And we will try \nthese amendments and initiatives that they have because they cannot \nprove their case otherwise. I wait for the distinguished Senators from \nKentucky and Michigan to show me the series of cases in product \nliability where there was not any, as the title says here, ``equity in \nlegal fees.''\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from South Carolina \nretains the remainder of his time. It is 11 minutes.\n  The distinguished Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 597, as modified, to amendment No. 596\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I desire.\n  Mr. President, following discussions with my colleague from South \nCarolina, and the managers, I ask unanimous consent to modify the \nunderlying first-degree amendment. I send the modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to that modification?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 597), as modified, to amendment No. 596, is as \nfollows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following new title:\n\n                    TITLE III--EQUITY IN LEGAL FEES\n\n     SEC. 301. EQUITY IN LEGAL FEES.\n\n       (a) Disclosure of Attorney's Fees Information.--\n       [[Page S5711]] (1) Definitions.--For purposes of this \n     subsection--\n       (A) the term ``attorney'' means any natural person, \n     professional law association, corporation, or partnership \n     authorized under applicable State law to practice law;\n       (B) the term ``attorney's services'' means the professional \n     advice or counseling of or representation by an attorney, but \n     such term shall not include other assistance incurred, \n     directly or indirectly, in connection with an attorney's \n     services, such as administrative or secretarial assistance, \n     overhead, travel expenses, witness fees, or preparation by a \n     person other than the attorney of any study, analysis, \n     report, or test;\n       (C) the term ``party'' means any person who retains an \n     attorney in connection with a civil action arising under any \n     Federal law or in any diversity action in Federal court;\n       (D) the term ``contingent fee'' means the cost or price of \n     an attorney's services determined by applying a specified \n     percentage, which may be a firm fixed percentage, a graduated \n     or sliding percentage, or any combination thereof, to the \n     amount of the settlement or judgment obtained;\n       (E) the term ``hourly fee'' means the cost or price per \n     hour of an attorney's services;\n       (F) the term ``initial meeting'' means the first conference \n     or discussion between the party and the attorney, whether by \n     telephone or in person, concerning the details, facts, or \n     basis of the claim; and\n       (G) the term ``retain'' means the act of a claimant in \n     engaging an attorney's services, whether by express or \n     implied agreement, by seeking and obtaining the attorney's \n     services.\n       (2) Disclosure at initial meeting.--\n       (A) In general.--An attorney retained by a party shall, at \n     the initial meeting, disclose to the party the party's right \n     to receive\n      a written statement of the information described under \n     paragraph (3).\n       (B) Waiver and extension.--The party, in writing, may--\n       (i) waive the right to receive the statement required under \n     subparagraph (A); or\n       (ii) extend the 30-day period referred to under paragraph \n     (3).\n       (3) Information after initial meeting.--Subject to \n     paragraph (2)(B), within 30 days after the initial meeting, \n     an attorney retained by a party shall provide a written \n     statement to the party containing--\n       (A) the estimated number of hours of the attorney's \n     services that will be spent--\n       (i) settling or attempting to settle the claim or action; \n     and\n       (ii) handling the claim through trial;\n       (B) the basis of the attorney's fee for services (such as a \n     contingent, hourly, or flat fee basis) and any conditions, \n     limitations, restrictions, or other qualifications on the fee \n     the attorney determines are appropriate; and\n       (C) the contingent fee, hourly fee, or flat fee the \n     attorney will charge the client.\n       (4) Information after settlement.--\n       (A) In general.--An attorney retained by a party shall, \n     within a reasonable time not later than 30 days after the \n     date on which the claim or action is finally settled or \n     adjudicated, provide a written statement to the party \n     containing--\n       (i) the actual number of hours of the attorney's services \n     in connection with the claim;\n       (ii) the total amount of the fee for the attorney's \n     services in connection with the claim; and\n       (iii) the actual fee per hour of the attorney's services in \n     connection with the claim, determined by dividing the total \n     amount of the fee by the actual number of hours of attorney's \n     services.\n       (B) Waiver and extension.--A client, in writing, may--\n       (i) waive the right to receive the statement required under \n     subparagraph (A); or\n       (ii) extend the 30-day period referred to under \n     subparagraph (B).\n       (5) Failure to disclose.--Except with regard to a party who \n     provides a waiver under paragraph (2)(B) or (4)(B), a party \n     to whom an attorney fails to disclose information required by \n     this section may withhold 10 percent of the fee and file a \n     civil action for damages in the court in which the claim or \n     action was filed or could have been filed.\n       (6) Other remedies.--This subsection shall supplement and \n     not supplant any other available remedies or penalties.\n       (b) Effective Date.--This title shall take effect and apply \n     to claims or actions filed on and after the date occurring 30 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina indicated, as we discussed the effect of the modification, it \nis to correct the transpositional error that took place when we took \nlanguage from another piece of legislation and created this amendment. \nMy intent was, and remains, to apply the amendment that I offered \ninitially, not just to the clients of plaintiffs' attorneys but to the \nclients of defense attorneys as well. That is the purpose of the \nmodification, to fundamentally change the word from ``claimant'' to \n``party'' so it would apply to all cases.\n  Mr. President, what I would like to do is talk briefly about why this \namendment was offered initially and to clarify some ambiguities and \nsome misunderstandings that appeared to exist and comment a little bit \nabout the merits of the amendment.\n  First of all, let me begin by saying that I am an attorney, as is the \nSenator from South Carolina and many other Members of this body. I \nrespect my colleagues who are lawyers. I respect the attorneys who \npractice in my State and those who practice in the other States. I \nbelieve most lawyers are doing an outstanding job, and I think that \nconsequently the amendment I am offering is not going to really have \nmuch effect on the overwhelming percentage of attorneys in America. In \nfact, the goal of my amendment is essentially to eliminate bad \npractices undertaken by some attorneys who do not attempt to keep their \nclients well informed as to the arrangements into which they enter.\n  Often we have, particularly in cases where clients who are less \nexperienced in the legal system, clients who are unsophisticated about \nthe ways in which attorney-client relationships work, we have \nsituations where clients are less informed than they should be about \nthe arrangements they are entering into. Such is the case when I go to \nhave my television or my automobile repaired and inquire ahead of time \nfor some assessment of what the cost will be and what is wrong with the \ncar or the television set. I think many clients of attorneys need \nsimilar help to make informed decisions about the types of arrangements \nthat they will enter into.\n  That is basically the purpose of my amendment. People are unhappy in \nmy State and elsewhere with respect to the way the current system of \nlegal fees is entered into.\n  Just to mention a couple of cases in point, I recently received a \nletter from a Michigan resident who wrote that the U.S. District Court \nfor the Northern District of Illinois had just notified him that he was \nincluded in a class action case, and the court soon would be holding a \nhearing whether to give final approval to a settlement with Chrysler \nCorp. under the proposed settlement. Under the alleged defect in the \nChrysler credit leases, each class member was going to be paid between \n$2 and $2.50. The attorney who brought the case would be paid up to \n$175,000. Under this agreement, the lawyer would get enough money to \nbuy a big, new house. The victims would get enough to buy a Big Mac.\n  That struck me as hardly the kind of appropriate practice that we \nshould tolerate without the clients having full information as they \nbecome engaged in the matter. That is the reason a number of \norganizations that represent consumers have called for the kind of \namendment which I am offering here today.\n  Bill Pride, the executive director of an organization of Americans \nwho are for legal reform--and the only consumer group, I might add, \nthat has publicly stated that it accepts no money from big business, \nsupports disclosure of attorney fees, and the sort of approach I am \ntaking with this amendment--recently testified before the House \nJudiciary Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property. He stated \nthat because of its complexity and expense of lawyers, the legal system \nis inaccessible to more than half the population when they have legal \nproblems. For low-income people, legal help is almost nonexistent \nexcept for the most poor, who qualify for legal aid. Millions of \nmiddle-income people cannot get any help from lawyers for simple \nremedies because of the complex and expensive and intimidating \nprocedures established by the legal profession.\n  He went on to indicate the need for reform. One of the reforms that \nhis organization supports is the kind of fee disclosure proposal which \nI am offering here today because of its potential value to the clients \nas they enter into legal relationships and negotiate fees.\n  So indeed there are people who are not satisfied with the information \nthey have with regard to entering into legal arrangements and who are \nnot sophisticated enough in dealing with entering into those relations \nto enter into them in a knowledgeable way, or to even know what their \noptions are.\n  My coming here today is not to argue that fees are too high or too \nlow or wrong or right. I did not come before the Senate with this \namendment to affect the fees that are paid. What I came here for was to \ntry to provide a system by which fee arrangements would be \n[[Page S5712]] entered into by the less sophisticated among us on a \nknowledgeable basis.\n  The requirements I am suggesting in the amendment I believe are both \nsimple and fundamentally fair. Without going into all of the details \nagain, as I did yesterday, basically the amendment requires attorneys--\nand under the modification, this will be for the defense as well as for \nplaintiffs' counsel--prior to the entering into an arrangement to \nprovide the potential client with information as to an estimated amount \nof time that would be involved in handling the matter with an \nexplanation of the various options available as far as the nature of \nthe arrangements that would be entered into, whether it would be hourly \nbilling, or a national fee, or a contingent fee, and then an \nexplanation as to the type of fee as well as the specific amounts that \nwould be employed; in other words, the per-hour amount, the contingent \npercentage, or the national fee. Following completion of the matter, a \nsimilar kind of accounting would take place in which the actual hours \nwould be made available to the client, the amount of the fee which was \nultimately calculated or charged, and then the computation of what the \nhourly rate would be.\n  I recognize that for some small law firms, this may be more \nburdensome than for others. But like the Senator from South Carolina, \nwho I gathered was in a small firm at one time in his career, I began \nmy legal career when I left law school in a small firm in Lansing, MI. \nWe did not have a lot of fancy computer equipment or access to \naccountants. But we did maintain a pretty good recordkeeping of our own \nefforts and the hours that we put in on matters, regardless of the \nnature of those matters because, simply, we thought it was to be able \nto operate our offices in an efficient fashion, as well as to serve our \nclients better and to be able to satisfy requests of this sort if they \nwere to come from clients who knew their rights included the ability to \nmake such requests. But I will add a few other points.\n  The amount that I am offering has several options in it. One is a \nwaiver option. Clients may, under the amendment, waive their rights to \nthis information either preliminary to or following the transaction of \na legal matter. It does not require, therefore, that in each case the \nattorney provide this information.\n  Second, I think it is very consistent with a recent formal opinion, \nformal opinion No. 94-389, addressing attorneys' contingent fees, which \nwas recently entered into by the American Bar Association Standing \nCommittee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility. That section, at \npage 7, said that, among other things, regardless of whether the lawyer \nand the prospective client, or both, are initially inclined toward a \ncontingent fee, the nature and details of the compensation arrangement \nshould be fully discussed by the lawyer and client before any final \nagreement is reached.\n  It went on to say that among the factors that should be considered \nand discussed are the following: The likelihood of success, the likely \namount of recovery or savings if the case is successful, the \npossibility of an award exemplary or multiple damages, and on and on. \nAnd included in the things that were recommended was the amount of time \nthat is likely to be invested by the lawyer.\n  In other words, the proposal I am making is not the only one that I \nthink many lawyers already follow. It is also something which the \nAmerican Bar Association, which may be on different sides of other \nparts of this pending legislation, has in its own recent opinion \nsuggested ought to be followed.\n  Finally, I will just say that we are not in this legislation telling \nthe States what to do. This amendment is limited to actions within the \nFederal court; in short, within the purview of what I believe is the \nappropriate purview of this Congress in determining the areas in which \nwe might apply these types of regulations; in short, the matters before \nour Federal courts.\n  So I would just conclude by saying that when I proposed this and \nbrought it to the floor, I really did it with a belief it essentially \nwas a matter which would give consumers more information, a right to \nknow what the legal fees they were entering would be like, what they \nshould anticipate, what their options were, an accounting for those \nfees. In no way was it my intention to cast aspersions on the legal \nprofession. Certainly it was not my intention to be critical of the \nmany fine lawyers who are referenced by the speech of the Senator from \nSouth Carolina. I hope that was not the case.\n  We are always hearing in the Congress the concerns that virtually all \nof us have I think about consumers, about the interest of consumers, \nabout the interests of people who are frequently finding themselves in \na disadvantaged position with respect to big business, with respect to \nbig Government, with respect to other big institutions. Many of those \nindividuals find themselves from time to time in circumstances where \nthey would like to litigate a concern or defend one. If they are not \nwell informed, it seems to me they are at an even greater disadvantage, \nand I believe that this amendment provides a chance to help them and at \nthe same time improve the legal system.\n  It is the case that there is a lot of criticism about lawyers and the \nway the legal system works. One of the reasons this legislation on \nproduct liability was generated obviously was because of concerns about \nthe system. I do not want to kill all the lawyers. I wish to improve \nthe legal system. I think by eliminating from the many concerns people \nhave the concern that they are brought into legal arrangements without \nthe full knowledge of their options, without the full accounting of the \ntime and the dollars involved, that it would substantially improve the \nsystem and the way it functions.\n  Finally, as I said a little earlier, I think we are asking here \nlawyers to do nothing more than we ask of many other professionals in \nmany other service parts of the economy. As I mentioned, when I go to \nthe auto shop with a car problem, I am given information as to what is \nlikely to be wrong, what the likely cost of repairs are, and so on, so \nthat I can make an informed decision whether I wish to pursue repair.\n  We are told that it is harder to do that in this context because it \nis a more complex area, and I agree it is more complex. But I think, \nbecause of its complexity, because it is a more difficult area, that is \nall the more reason why we should try to get the people who come into \nthis often intimidating setting the sort of information that would \nallow them to make knowledgeable decisions. That is the purpose of my \namendment.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of whatever time \nI have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 17 minutes \nremaining.\n  Who yields the Senator from West Virginia time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I yield myself time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, at 6 o'clock, we are going to have \ntwo votes, and as the Democratic manager of this bill I wanted to alert \ncolleagues on both sides as to the plan that the Senator from \nWashington [Mr. Gorton] and myself have, what we are going to do so \nthat Senators might be appraised of the situation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suspend for a moment. Since \nwe are under a time agreement, the Chair asks who yields the Senator \nfrom West Virginia time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time remaining is divided between----\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I so yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan yields the Senator \nfrom West Virginia time. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Again, I want to let my colleagues know of the \nsituation and what Senator Gorton and I will do at 6 o'clock. We are \nhere to consider repairing something called the product liability bill. \nWe are not here to determine the hourly rates of lawyers. We are not \nhere to do a variety of other things.\n  Therefore, the Senator from Washington will move to table the \namendment of the Senator from South Carolina, and I will move to table \nthe amendment of the Senator from Michigan.\n  [[Page S5713]] We are not here, again, to determine how lawyers' fees \nshould be publicized. That is my reason. I understand the interest that \nboth Senators have in raising these questions. But I want the Senate to \nconsider a bill that has been the subject of hearings, close scrutiny, \nand careful work, and that is called the product liability bill. I do \nnot think this bill is the bill to use as a vehicle for regulating the \nfees of lawyers, telling them how to publicize their fees or \nintervening into the lawyer/client relationship.\n  In moving to table these amendments, the managers and authors of this \nbill want to make a point, however. We are discouraging, actively \ndiscouraging amendments outside the scope of the product liability bill \nitself. We welcome constructive revisions to this bill within the \ncontext of the bill, but we do not welcome the phenomenon of loading up \non this bill for the purpose of making points, some of which might be \nvalid, but we just do not want to do that. And we do not want to have \namendments scoring points against lawyers.\n  So we are here to do the serious work of the product liability bill, \nand I want my colleagues to be informed as to how the managers will \nproceed.\n  I thank the Senator from Michigan and I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan retains 14\\3/4\\ \nminutes. The Senator from South Carolina has 11 minutes remaining.\n  Who seeks recognition? The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished President.\n  Mr. President, I am trying to find--I thought we had found it. After \nthe day was over last evening, I went back to my office and I said on \nthat airline case, several airlines really of overcharging, and the \nlawyers steamed up a class action, and as the distinguished Senator \nfrom Michigan reported in a letter to the colleagues, the lawyers got \nsome $16 million and others got coupons worth $20 or $25, one of my \nsecretaries said, ``Yes, that got lost in the mail. You had a chance to \ndo it.'' But I said I never heard it, but I had plenty of money left on \nthe table, I guess, because I never knew anything about the case. So a \nyoung attorney in my office said, ``Well, I denied knowing anything \nabout the case, but I got $150 when I got notice.'' I said, ``Well, who \nare the lawyers?'' He said, ``I don't care. I do not know who the \nlawyers were and don't care. They got me some money.''\n  Now, no one is complaining about the lawyers and no one is inventing \nequity. The truth of the matter is we had some 15 years ago, I say to \nthe Senator from Michigan, a big debate about the Federal Trade \nCommission coming in and regulating attorneys and attorneys' fees and \neverything else of that kind.\n  And we can have the hearings again and come back and go over that \nthing. But in the last dozen years we have not had hearings on this. \nThe best the Senator from Michigan refers to is a letter from Michigan \nabout a class action and one gentleman over on the House side who \ntestified supporting disclosure of fees. I hope he does support \ndisclosure of fees. All of us at the bar do.\n  Here I hold in my hand ``Model Rules of Professional Conduct and the \nCode of Judicial Conduct'' from the Center of Professional \nResponsibility of the American Bar Association. And we practice under \nthis. And it has on page 18 rule 15 about the fees and it runs down--I \ndo not want to spend all my time, but it has not only the time and \nlabor required, much better than the amendment of the Senator from \nMichigan, the amount involved, the time limitations, the nature and \nlength of professional relationship, the experience, whether the fee is \nfixed or contingent, right on down, all in writing.\n  I never have found that client--I guess that is the nice experience \nof mine--complain to me about the handling of product liability.\n  And we have had it up five times before the Commerce Committee, five \ntimes with hearings, five times the report and we had every \nramification that you can think of on product liability, and here we \ncome again and without ever having any testimony whatsoever or the \nsubject raised about fees, a Senator or a couple say, well, let us go \nto lawyers. We cannot get them on the Girl Scouts or the Little League. \nWe cannot get them about their former colleague going broke.\n  There is no litigation explosion. The only explosion is businesses \nsuing businesses. And after all, remember, we are representing \nconsumers. Now, if anybody believes that, I happen to represent the \nconsumers in this instance and not the manufacturers. They are trying \nto take advantage here, when we are talking about welfare reform, \nmaking the recipients more responsible, we are going backward and \nsaying manufacturers be more irresponsible. We have got a long litany \nin this debate about the good in America for the safety of products. We \ncan count on it. It redounds to our safety and our health; we almost \ntake it for granted. Where there have been some adjustments, the States \nhave taken care of it. But fees, the equity in fees, to assume that \nthere is not any and that you need to pass a law in Congress to get it \nis ludicrous, really laughable.\n  I mean any lawyer go down here, or anybody else, to my billable hours \nfriends. They will tell you the American Bar and everything else like \nthat. They do have an understanding with the billable hours. They like \nit. The phone rings. ``Wait a minute.'' ``There is another $25. I \nanswered the phone.''\n  ``You got a copy of that? Twenty-five cents for every copy. Run some \nextra copies. We have to pay for the copy machine.''\n  ``Put a little fee on the computer.''\n  Senator Abraham and I can get computers now. Put fees on those. \nLittle internal fees for computers, like these MRI's at the hospitals, \npaid for five or six times. They have bought every computer downtown 10 \nor 15 times with little fees on the computers.\n  Lawyers know how to look at these. I am one trying to look out for \nthe clients. Let us not diminish the rights of the clients.\n  I can tell you now, yes, in Henry VI, Dick the butcher says, yes, \nthat the first thing we must do is kill all the lawyers. That was not, \nin a sense, a demeaning or pejorative term. He was saying, if tyranny \nwas to succeed, the tyrants must first kill the lawyers. And if \ndemagoguery is going to persist and succeed, then we are going to have \nto get rid of all the lawyers who are going to expose the demagoguery \nthat is going on in our Government today.\n  I can tell you here and now, I am proud of that expression ``Kill all \nthe lawyers,'' because it is the best of all compliments. We stand in \nthe way of the takeover of the big business and the clients that have \nkept this going for 15 years, again and again and again and again, with \ncommitments and elections and everything else working. And it is that \npoor, injured client in middle-class America, they cannot pay any \nbillable hours, so they come in.\n  And, yes, you know, no matter how thin the pancake, there are two \nsides to every pancake and every question. And you do not have a sure \nshot. You have to get all 12 jurors. You do not try a case and get a \nmajority vote as we do in the Senate. You have to get a unanimous vote \nby the greater weight of the preponderance of the evidence, or for \npunitive, willful misconduct, by the greater weight of the \npreponderance of the evidence.\n  Do not act as though there is a problem out there with respect to the \ntrial of cases. If there is runaway verdicts, it is businesses suing \nbusinesses upon suing businesses upon suing businesses. They love to \ncome all dressed up and go in the boardroom and say, ``Well, take them \non.'' Of course, the lawyers, billable hours, ``Hot dog. That will take \ncare of the family and send my boy through college during the next 4 \nyears. Billable hours, whoopee. We had a board meeting today, and let \nme tell you who we are going to sue. I have no idea if they are going \nto win it, but it will take care of me.''\n  That is what has been going on in the courtroom and cluttering it up, \nand not these tort claims because, yes, they are more safe. There is \nless injury, and if there is less injury, there is less tortuous \ninjury.\n  I cannot understand the logic of the Senator from West Virginia, who \nuses his hands up and down, whatever it is. It is not relevant \nwhatsoever, or not responsive.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina retains the \nremainder of his time. He has a little over 2 minutes remaining.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  [[Page S5714]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield myself such time as I desire.\n  Mr. President, I just want to reiterate a couple of points I made. \nThe purpose of the amendment which I have offered is not defined to \naffect legal fees. In fact, it is the second-degree amendment that the \nSenator from South Carolina has offered which would attempt to put \nconstraints on those fees.\n  Again I express, all I am trying to do is provide information, both \nbefore as well as after the entering into of a legal arrangement \nbetween clients and their attorneys.\n  I think the descriptions of such an amendment as being overly \nbureaucratic and so on is really inconsistent with several facts. \nFirst, the fact is that whether it is the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Carolina or other Members of this Chamber who are attorneys that \nI have spoken to on this or heard from about it--and I have heard from \nseveral--virtually to a person, they indicate that in one way or \nanother they already perform the function of information and \ntransmission that we are talking about.\n  The attorneys in my State who have talked to me prior to the offering \nof this amendment and since have likewise said that in their current \narrangements, they provide similar information. But they all \nacknowledge, at least the ones in my State, that there are people in \nthe practice of law who do not. And the people who are unfortunate \nvictims in these situations are the less knowledgeable, the people who \nare less familiar with the legal process and what their rights are when \nthey enter into these kinds of arrangements. They frequently are in a \ndisadvantaged position because they are the victim of an injury or a \nharm and in a disadvantaged position because they are intimidated \nentering into the legal process itself.\n  Again, I stress that this is really, in my judgment, a choice between \nhelping consumers or inconveniencing those attorneys who do not follow \nthe various American Bar Association and State bar association \nguidelines that both the Senator from South Carolina and I have \nreferred to or the practices of most attorneys.\n  It seems to me that to inconvenience those attorneys who do not feel \nit is their responsibility to at least inform their clients as to the \nkind of fee arrangements they are going to enter into and the likely \namount of time involved, as well as to inform them after the fact of \nwhat the costs are and how much time was involved, to worry about \ninconveniencing them rather than worrying about protecting those \nconsumers of legal services that are at least the victims I am trying \nto help with this legislation is to have the balance struck the wrong \nway.\n  So, for that reason, I believe the amendment makes sense.\n  I would also just reference back to the example we used yesterday \nthat was in a letter we sent around regarding the airline matter. It \nwas brought to my attention by an article in the Washington Post. The \narticle was written from the perspective of one of the various people \nwho were part of the class of people that were affected and received \nthese awards. It was not a complimentary position that was taken by \nthat plaintiff. It was a position of somebody who apparently was \nrepresentative of a lot of other plaintiffs that were not happy. They \nwere unhappy with the outcome. That is often the case. I think it is \nparticularly the case when people have no information as to what the \nfee structures will be. And for that reason, I think the amendment that \nI am offering, as I say, will help consumers.\n  It may prove to be an inconvenience for some attorneys, but those \nattorneys who will be inconvenienced are the ones who are not following \nthe kinds of practices and recommendations of the bar association as \nare those of the profession who I think are doing an outstanding job.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan reserves the \nremainder of his time. He has 10 minutes and 42 seconds remaining.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, just in the minute or so that I have \nremaining, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the \nfull text of this Monday edition.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 20, 1995]\n\nIn Settling With Airlines, There's No Free Ride; Coupons for Travelers, \n                        $16 Million for Lawyers\n\n                          (By Anthony Faiola)\n\n       When a number of the nation's major airlines agreed to \n     settle a price-fixing lawsuit by offering passengers discount \n     coupons on air fares, it looked as if the flying public was \n     getting a plum.\n       But passengers soon discovered, after the coupons arrived \n     in January, that there would be no free rides because the \n     terms of the settlement limited savings on any one trip.\n       Meanwhile, the airlines--defendants in the class-action \n     lawsuit that led to the settlement--found themselves with a \n     wonderful marketing tool. Although the coupons had a total \n     face value of $438 million, they could be redeemed only a few \n     dollars at a time.\n       And the lawyers who represented the members of the class in \n     the suit were the ones to make real money--$16,012,500.\n       The legal fees and the limited benefits to the flying \n     consumers have led many travel and legal experts, including \n     the federal judge in Atlanta who signed the settlement, to \n     label this a ``lawyers' case.''\n       ``Defendant and plaintiff attorneys have learned to fall in \n     line with each other'' in class-action cases, said Cornish \n     Hitchcock, an attorney with Washington consumer activist \n     group Public Citizen. ``A sweet settlement deal for the \n     defendants can be cut, and the plaintiffs can get their huge \n     attorneys' fees, then everyone is happy. Everyone, that is, \n     except for the class,'' he said. Hitchcock was among those \n     who argued for lower legal fees in the case.\n       The 4.2 million plaintiffs in the airline case had little \n     choice in who represented them. Thirty-seven law firms \n     nationwide raced to file antitrust suits on behalf of air \n     travelers, then went in search of a class of clients.\n       Five firms, in particular, came away with the most in fees, \n     court documents showed. They included the offices of the four \n     lawyers who chaired the steering committee representing the \n     plaintiffs and the Atlanta firm that oversaw the \n     administration of the case.\n       In Washington, the firm Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll \n     received $326,912,08. In Philadelphia, considered by legal \n     experts as the power center of class-action firms, Fine, \n     Kaplan and Black received $155,685.75; Cohen, Shapiro, \n     Polisher, Shiekman and Cohen received $261,117.03; and Kohn, \n     Nast,\n      Savett, Klein & Graf received $382,277.14. In Atlanta, the \n     firm Carr, Tabb & Pope received $504,980.16, according to \n     court records.\n       Attorneys calculated the awards based on an estimate that \n     2.3 million travelers would request coupons. Instead, almost \n     double that number responded, which led to lower awards for \n     all plaintiffs.\n\n\n                       frustration for travelers\n\n       The coupons cannot be used for flights during certain \n     blackout dates and cannot be pooled for significant \n     discounts. The largest discount on a $240 ticket, for \n     instance, is $10.\n       Travelers such as Adams Morgan resident Geraldine Triana, \n     one of 4.2 million passengers who gathered years-old flight \n     receipts in the hopes of gaining an award, said the case \n     amounted to frustration and wasted time.\n       Triana, who flies primarily between Long Island and \n     Washington on fares of less than $200, doubts she'll get much \n     use from her four coupons, each valued at $25. To get a full \n     $25 credit, she has to buy a ticket worth at least $250.\n       ``Where is the justice in that?'' she said.\n       The coupons do offer sufficient incentive that consumers \n     want to use them, making them an effective marketing tool for \n     the airlines. In fact, Alaska Airlines, one of the few large \n     carriers not named in the original case, asked to be a \n     defendant when it learned of the coupon program and was \n     accommodated.\n       ``The airlines using those coupons are going to see \n     substantial additional ticket sales because of them,'' said \n     Louis Cancelmi, a spokesman for Alaska Air. ``We asked to be \n     named in the case because, once we saw the settlement, we \n     realized it was to our competitive disadvantage not to do \n     so.''\n       Spokesmen for the other defendant airlines--American, \n     Continental, Delta, Northwest, TWA, United and USAir--cited \n     the court-approved agreement that provided the coupons and \n     declined to comment further. Under the agreement, the \n     defendant airlines did not admit fault. Eastern and Pan \n     American World Airways, both now defunct as operating \n     entities, also were among the original defendants.\n       In her Philadelphia office, Dianne Nast, one of four \n     lawyers who served as co-chair of the plaintiffs' committee, \n     said that the 4.2 million plaintiffs ``should be satisfied'' \n     with what they got. Coupons, she said, ``are better than \n     nothing.''\n       ``Just because a settlement may benefit a defendant doesn't \n     mean it won't benefit the plaintiff; that's not logical,'' \n     said Nast, a partner in Philadelphia's Kohn, Nast, Savett, \n     Klein & Graf. She now is working on class- \n     [[Page S5715]] action cases against tobacco and silicon-\n     breast implant manufacturers.\n\n\n                           best job possible\n\n       Nast said she and her colleagues expended thousands of \n     hours of legal time wrangling against some of the best \n     corporate attorneys in the business. Class-action cases, she \n     said, remain the best way to bring together scores of\n      people commonly wronged, but who could never gain \n     retribution on their own.\n       ``Considering the circumstances, we did the best job \n     possible,'' Nast said. ``I don't feel the fees were too high. \n     In fact, in this case, I would say they were low.''\n       The lawyers had asked for $24 million in fees and expenses. \n     The federal judge in the case lowered that amount to slightly \n     more than $16 million.\n       The case started in the shadow of Washington Dulles \n     International Airport, where the Airline Tariff Publishing \n     Co. (ATP) has its headquarters.\n       The company is owned by 30 domestic and international air \n     carriers and was created by the airline industry to \n     distribute fares to travel agencies through one database.\n       But in 1989, the U.S. Justice Department was alerted by \n     reports in the aviation trade press of suspicions that the \n     database was being used for electronic fare negotiations \n     among its member carriers.\n       Mark Schechter, deputy director of operations for the \n     department's antitrust division, said an investigation was \n     begun in the summer of 1989. Schechter said the Justice \n     Department believed the airlines were comparing fares through \n     the computer system before they were listed on travel agents' \n     computers.\n       For example, according to Justice Department \n     interrogatories filed in connection with its case, United \n     Airlines inserted a ``proposed'' fare into the ATP computer \n     on Dec. 15, 1988, that would increase prices by $15 between \n     Chicago and several cities. Two weeks later American, \n     Braniff, Continental, Delta, Northwest, TWA, USAir and \n     Piedmont, which later merged into USAir, also posted \n     ``proposed'' increased fares in the computer, matching \n     United's and essentially ratifying its increase. On Jan. 14 \n     all these airlines implemented the suggested $15 increase.\n       On Dec. 21, 1992, the department filed a civil antitrust \n     suit against most major airlines in U.S. District Court. The \n     Justice Department settled its case with the airlines last \n     March. The airlines agreed to stop using the database to \n     compare fares but did not admit fault.\n       ``This was a major case, probably the most important civil \n     antitrust case brought since AT,'' Schechter said. ``It was \n     hotly contested and hotly litigated, there were nine \n     defendants out there and each of them had top legal talent, \n     they were very well represented and ready for a fight.''\n       On June 28, 1990, long before the Justice Department \n     settlement, lawyer Nast read about the department's \n     investigation in the Wall Street Journal. She immediately \n     asked her Philadelphia firm's researchers to begin \n     investigating.\n       Dozens of other lawyers saw the Journal story too and \n     launched their own investigations. In Washington, \n     Philadelphia, Atlanta, San Francisco and more than a dozen \n     other cities, firms specializing in class-action litigation \n     rushed in.\n       ``I had heard some things, you know, some hints at \n     Washington parties, that this airline case was brewing,'' \n     said Jerry Cohen, a Washington lawyer who was\n      co-lead counsel on the case. Cohen is a former member of the \n     Senate antitrust and monopoly subcommittee and his firm, \n     Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll, played a key legal role \n     in the Exxon Valdez case. The tanker Exxon Valdez ran \n     aground in 1989 in Alaska's Prince William Sound, spilling \n     10 million gallons of oil.\n       ``But when we saw the Journal article, we assigned a couple \n     of people to look into it, and we prepared a complaint. \n     Before we filed, we talked to several other law firms to find \n     out how they were going to handle it.''\n       By August, 37 firms had filed suits.\n       The attorneys, Cohen said, used a complicated formula to \n     quantify the airlines' liability, and came up with a total of \n     $3 billion.\n       ``These lawyers don't waste their time on the small \n     stuff,'' said Laurance Schonbrun, a San Francisco attorney \n     who argued before the court that the plaintiffs' attorneys \n     should be paid in coupons, not cash, because that's what they \n     won for their clients.\n       When the suits were filed, attorneys listed specific \n     individuals as plaintiffs. These plaintiffs were, in many \n     cases, friends or pre-existing clients of the law firms, said \n     Federal District Judge Marvin Shoob, who presided over the \n     case in Atlanta.\n       The 42 named plaintiffs took home as much as $5,000 each, \n     for a total of $142,500. They were the only members of the \n     plaintiffs to receive money, court records show.\n       Judah I. Labovitz, also a co-chair in the case, said the 42 \n     plaintiffs ``are more than just names on a piece of paper.'' \n     His law firm's plaintiff was a longtime friend and client, \n     Labovitz said. ``He dug up his travel records and gave a \n     deposition. The entire class benefited from his actions, why \n     shouldn't he get some money?'' Labovitz said.\n       In September 1990 the cases were consolidated in Atlanta \n     and a steering committee was established to coordinate the \n     efforts of the 37 law firms. Some of the largest and best-\n     known firms became the leaders and Nast, Labovitz, Cohen and \n     Philadelphia attorney Allen D. Black became co-chairs.\n\n\n                           coupons, not cash\n\n       Several factors pushed the parties toward a settlement with \n     coupons rather than cash, attorneys for both the airlines and \n     the plaintiffs said.\n       The airline industry was in financial chaos in the midst of \n     a recession that would see it lose more than $10 billion over \n     three years. If the case were won and cash settlements were \n     huge, it could bankrupt the industry, lawyers for both the \n     plaintiffs and the airlines agreed.\n       Meanwhile, the plaintiffs' lawyers faced the prospect of \n     proving electronic collusion in front of a jury that might \n     not have the patience for a technical trial potentially \n     lasting three years or more.\n       ``You've got to have a little common sense. All the \n     airlines were in serious trouble at the time,'' Cohen said. \n     ``They literally had no money. Eastern and\n      Pan Am had already gone belly up, and Continental, Northwest \n     and TWA were in serious trouble.''\n       But opponents, primarily consumer activists, cried foul. \n     ``It would have been better for the plaintiffs if the lawyers \n     took the case to trial,'' said Edward M. Selfe, a corporate \n     attorney from Birmingham who filed a motion to stop the \n     settlement on the grounds consumers should receive rebates, \n     not coupons.\n       However, plaintiffs counsel had invested considerable time \n     and effort in developing the case, with no guarantee they \n     could win and recover even their costs, much less their legal \n     fees.\n\n\n                       $16 Million in Legal Fees\n\n       So the settlement was reached: $438 million worth of \n     coupons to an unknown number of passengers for up to a \n     maximum of 10 percent of the cost of their air fares, and $16 \n     million in legal fees to plaintiffs' counsel.\n       Each individual plaintiff, however, did not receive even as \n     many coupons as originally expected because there were many \n     more applicants than the settlement presumed, and there was a \n     ceiling on the payout.\n       The plaintiffs' lawyers had estimated that 2.3 million \n     people would seek coupons, Shoob said. The plaintiffs' \n     attorneys formulated that number based on the advice of \n     experts, and relying on the history of plaintiffs' response \n     in similar cases.\n       The number of travelers responding came in at 4.2 million. \n     Included were huge corporations, such as International \n     Business Machines Corp. and AT Corp., which entered claims \n     of more than $1 billion and ended up getting most of the \n     coupons. However, AT and several other companies now say \n     the coupon restrictions make them extremely difficult to \n     redeem.\n       ``Obviously, we were surprised,'' Nast said. ``We believe \n     it was due to all the publicity the case received.''\n       The miscalculation had the effect of making the settlement \n     appear more lucrative then it actually was, Shoob now said. \n     The minimum payback per person worked out to $73 in coupons, \n     with a limit per flight of a 10 percent discount. Earlier \n     projections had put the minimum payback at almost $140 in \n     coupons per person, he said.\n       ``I based my approval on the belief that claimants would \n     get much more back than they actually did,'' Shoob said. ``I \n     believe [the attorneys made] an honest mistake--there was no \n     attempt to purposely mislead the court. But it was a mistake \n     nonetheless.''\n       Nast said: ``We looked at the historical response to this \n     type of situation to calculate--but this was an extraordinary \n     case. I feel it's a comment on how good a job we did for the \n     class that so many people responded.''\n       Shoob said, ``in this case, even in the event of a cash \n     settlement, chances are, each person in the class would have \n     received an extremely small amount of money in comparison to \n     the return to the lawyers.''\n       ``I think [class-action] cases are absurd,'' he said. ``So \n     many are generated by lawyers not to benefit the class, but \n     to generate legal fees. The lawyers are just doing their job \n     under the law. The flaw is with the law that allows it.''\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The amount of money in that case referred to by the \ndistinguished Senator in the justification for his amendment, the \nairlines case, with the total verdict of $438 million, that is where \nthe lawyers got $16 million. There were 4.2 million plaintiffs. They \nhad law firms racing all over; 37 law firms were racing around. They \nhave all the law firms listed.\n  But rather than a third or 20 percent or 10 percent or 5 percent or 1 \npercent, it is less than 1 percent that the lawyers got.\n  Now, you have all of those clients in there. I knew that this \nparticular fee, even though it sounded outrageous in the news story, \nwas based in reason by the court. The court would not approve giving \nthe clients $25 and giving the lawyers $16 million. That is the garish \nnonsense that you find going on as justification for product liability \nreform.\n  On that basis, if Senators want to vote on that basis not only for \nthe amendment of the distinguished Senators from Michigan and Kentucky, \nbut on product liability, let them do \n[[Page S5716]] that. But that is how extreme they have gotten.\n  Now, here is the case. I hope everybody will read about the 37 law \nfirms and the 4.2 million plaintiffs and the $438 million obtained, to \nbe divided up. And the lawyers, all those 37 law firms, got $16 \nmillion. I rest my case, Mr. President.\n  I hope you do not table our amendment. If we can get a good vote on \nthis amendment, it will bring attention to the really fanciful nature \nof this entire exercise on product liability.\n  We have welfare reform, we have the budget, we have \ntelecommunications, we have terrorism, we have a crime bill to come up, \nwe have more work to do that is good work of national significance, \nrather than manufacturing amendments through halfway stories in the \nWashington Post.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back the remainder of his \ntime. There are 10 minutes 42 seconds remaining to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President. I just will make several \ncomments.\n  One, in the case the Senator from South Carolina and I have been \ndiscussing, I just will point out, again, this is a quote from the \nmedia, the judge in that case actually later said that he regretted \nhaving approved of the fees that were involved for the reasons that he \nbelieved they were inappropriate.\n  Again, my point is not to talk about excessive fees or fees that are \ninadequate. I have not yet encountered any attorney who says they did \nnot earn the fees that they charged, and since they feel that way, my \nguess is they should not object to the requirements of this amendment, \nwhich would simply ask that prior to and following the conclusion of \nmatters, accountings be made and the fees, as well as the hours \ninvolved, be tabulated.\n  I would also stress though, as I did earlier, the amendment provides \na waiver provision so that those attorneys who feel this is too \nburdensome and cumbersome can at least seek to have their clients waive \nthis right to have both prior- as well as post-litigation or settlement \naccounting occur.\n  But basically, again, Mr. President, I think that the thrust, at \nleast of my underlying amendment, is one of disclosure, it is one of \nproviding consumers with the right to know the kind of legal \narrangements that they are getting into, and the right to know what has \ntranspired and how the fees that they are paying will be structured.\n  I believe it is pro-consumer. I believe the only people who might \nfind this inconveniencing are those attorneys who are not following the \ncommon practice that is outlined by so many legal organizations of \ncalling upon attorneys to provide that sort of information.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 598 to Amendment No. 597\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am generally a supporter of disclosure \nrequirements, but I will vote to table the Abraham amendment for two \nreasons.\n  First I believe that the States are more familiar with the issues \nraised by this amendment and that it is inappropriate for us to take \nover this area of the law in a floor amendment which has not even been \nconsidered in committee.\n  Second, the amendment would impose a cumbersome new regulation on \nattorneys--not just in product liability cases, but in all cases in \nFederal court. Attorneys would have to send not one, but two notices of \nfees to each client in a case. That may sound simple, but the chief \ncase that has been cited as the basis for this amendment was a class \naction brought on behalf of some 4.2 million individuals. That means, \npresumably, that 8.4 million separate notices would have to be mailed \nout in that case alone.\n  Moreover, the amendment would require attorneys to calculate hourly \nfee rates even in cases where the client is being charged on a basis \nother than hourly rates--such as a contingent fee or a flat fee. That \nmeans that every attorney would have to keep records of every hour \nspent on every case, even in cases where those hours are not the basis \nfor the attorney's fees, and the actual basis for those fees is fully \ndisclosed to the client. That is a huge new paperwork requirement, the \ncost of which would inevitably be borne not by lawyers, but by their \nclients.\n  I believe that we should avoid these cumbersome new requirements and \nleave requirements for disclosing attorneys' fees in the hands of the \nState governments unless and until a clear need is shown for the \nFederal Government to take over.\n  I also intend to vote to table the Brown amendment to revise rule 11 \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Rules Enabling Act \ndelegates to the Supreme Court the power to prescribe rules of \nprocedure for the Federal district courts. The courts have far greater \nexpertise in rules of judicial procedure than does the Congress. \nAccordingly, I do not believe that we should step in and overturn the \ncourts' \n[[Page S5717]] decision without hearings and without a clear showing of \nneed.\n         vote on motion to table amendment no. 597, as modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller] to table the amendment \nof the Senator from Michigan [Mr. Abraham].

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 599 to Amendment No. 596\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment numbered 599.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I believe the next item for consideration \nis amendment numbered 599, which is an amendment that I proposed which \nwould restore the deterrence against bringing frivolous actions and \nfrivolous lawsuits.\n  Mr. President, it is my personal feeling, and I believe the feeling \nof the distinguished senior Senator from Alabama, that this debate \ncould be concluded fairly quickly, perhaps as short as 20 minutes on \neach side; and then it would appear that it is the will of Senators to \nmove to a vote at that point.\n  Mr. President, rule 11 is a very important part of civil procedure. \nRule 11 changed in 1983 to provided strong admonishment against \nattorneys bringing frivolous actions.\n  It was changed again in December of 1993. It was changed, \nunfortunately, not through a vote or deliberation of this body, but by \nour failure to act.\n  Tragically, that automatic change in the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure resulted in the gutting of the protection against frivolous \nactions embodied in rule 11. The new rule 11 now allows someone to \nallege facts, bring facts before the court without knowing that they \nwere true or without having fully investigated the facts.\n  This amendment restores parts of the old rule 11 that more \neffectively deter frivolous action. I will be dealing with rule 11 in \ndetail in a few minutes. I wanted simply to alert Senators that we will \nbe moving to a vote on this, I believe, within 40 minutes or so. This \nvote is about discouraging frivolous action and frivolous lawsuits.\n  Our hope is that this amendment will play an important part in this \nbill, because stopping inappropriate actions and frivolous lawsuits is \nvery much an essential ingredient, I believe, in reform of the judicial \nprocess. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Brown \namendment.\n  Let me first explain a little bit about the procedure, what happens \nregarding the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which include rule 11.\n  There has been controversy over the history of this country as to how \ncourts ought to take care of its rule making authority. The prevailing \nview is that the judiciary--and this includes the States--has inherent \npower to determine its own rules.\n  However, Congress felt it had a role, and so it adopted the Rules \nEnabling Act by which rules of procedure would be changed by first \nhaving a committee appointed by the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates, to study any proposed change or changes.\n  After the committee made its report to the Judicial Conference, which \nis a body composed of judges from all levels of the judiciary, the \nJudicial Conference would study any proposals and then make \nrecommendations to the Supreme Court of the United States. Then the \nSupreme Court of the United States would consider the issue and make \nrecommendations to Congress. Under the Rules Enabling Act, Congress has \n6 months to either adopt the recommendations, to modify them, or to \ndelete them.\n  This particular rule 11 that came up was submitted to the Congress \nand the 6-month time period expired prior to Congress taking any \naction, and so all of the proposed Rules of Civil Procedure, including \nrule 11, went into effect on December 1, 1993. We knew toward the end \nof the Congress in 1993 that if any changes had to be made, they had to \nbe made before December 1, 1993.\n  If a Senator was interested in making a change to a rule, he or she \ncould introduce a bill, but no bill was introduced proposing to change \nrule 11.\n  During that 6-month period in 1993 in the House or in the Senate, if \nthere were reasons for change, a bill could have been introduced in the \nHouse or the Senate.\n  In all fairness to Senator Brown, he said that he did not like rule \n11, but he never took the steps to modify the proposed changes, and now \nhe is now belatedly taking steps on this particular bill, which is \nunrelated and not germane to the pending legislation.\n  My colleague from Colorado raises issues about frivolous lawsuits and \nlet me say that this has been considered by many concerned groups of \npeople. The Brown amendment is completely opposed by the civil rights \ncommunity. The Brown amendment is opposed by the Department of Justice. \nSix members of the Supreme Court approved rule 11 that is now in \neffect. Senator Brown quoted from Justice Scalia's dissent. There are \nalways going to be dissents over at the Supreme Court, but if you have \na 6 to 3 vote in the Supreme Court of the United States, that is a \npretty good vote.\n  As I have listened to the criticisms of the new rule 11 from Senator \nBrown and others, I do not agree with them. I have before me a \nmemorandum\n from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts which says:\n\n       I am writing to address criticism raised during the markup \n     of H.R. 2814 that the amendments to Rule 11 of the Federal \n     Rules of Civil Procedure will eviscerate the rule's effect on \n     parties filing frivolous proceedings and papers.\n       [[Page S5718]] The amendments to Rule 11 retain the rule's \n     core principle to ``stop and think'' before filing: By \n     broadening the scope of Rule 11 coverage and tightening its \n     application, the amendments reinforce the rule's deterrent \n     effect and also eliminate abuses that have arisen in the \n     interpretation of the rule. Although the amendments strike a \n     balance between competing interests, the changes \n     strengthening the rule have been neglected by those critical \n     of the amendments and need to be highlighted.\n       First, the amendments expand the reach of the rule by \n     imposing a continuing obligation on a party to stop \n     advocating a position once it becomes aware that that \n     position is no longer tenable.\n\n  What they would like to go back to under the old rule, as I interpret \nit, would be to allow ``a party to continue advocating a frivolous \nposition with impunity so long as it can claim ignorance at the time \nthe pleading was signed, which could have been months or years ago.''\n\n       Second, the amendments specifically extend liability to a \n     law firm rather than limiting the liability to the junior \n     associate who actually signs the filing.\n       Third, the amendments specifically extend the reach of Rule \n     11 sanctions to individual claims, defenses, and positions, \n     rather than solely to a case in which the ``pleading-as-a-\n     whole'' is frivolous. Some court decisions have construed the \n     rule to apply only to the whole pleading, relieving a party \n     of the responsibility for maintaining a single or several \n     individual frivolous positions.\n\n  So rule 11 that went into effect on December 1, 1993 was designed to \nstrengthen this matter.\n\n       Fourth, the amendments equalize the obligation between the \n     parties by imposing a continuing obligation on the defendant \n     to stop insisting on a denial contained in the initial \n     answer. Frequently, answers are general denials based on a \n     lack of information at the time of the reply. The amendments \n     impose a significant responsibility on the defendant to act \n     accordingly after relevant information is later obtained.\n       It is also important to highlight the provisions of the \n     rule that the amendments retain. A party must continue to \n     undertake ``an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances'' \n     before filing under the amendment. In those cases where a \n     party believes that a fact is true or false but needs \n     additional discovery to confirm it, the amendments allow \n     filing but only if such ``fact'' is specifically identified. \n     The provision does not relieve a party of its initial duty to \n     undertake a reasonable prefiling investigation. In cases of \n     abuse, the court retains the power to sanction sua sponte and \n     the aggrieved party can seek other remedies, e.g., lawsuit \n     for malicious prosecution.\n       The existing rule does not require a court to impose a \n     monetary sanction payable to the other party. Instead, the \n     rule does provide a court with the discretion to impose an \n     appropriate sanction, including an order requiring monetary \n     payments to the opposing party and to the court.\n\n  Now, as to the hearings that we had in the Judiciary Committee, the \nold rule 11--that is one that was in effect before December 1 of 1993--\nhad language that said that signature to a pleading demonstrated that \nthe pleading ``is well grounded in fact.''\n  Senator Brown at the subcommittee hearings on July 28, 1993, grilled \nthe chairman of the Rules Advisory Committee that had proposed to the \nJudicial Conference this aspect of the rule change.\n  Senator Brown claimed that under the new rule 11, a party ``no longer \nhas to research a claim and know that it is true.'' He feels that a \nparty ``no longer has to know his facts'' before bringing a lawsuit.\n  Well, what Senator Brown ignores from the testimony and the response \nthe chairman of the committee, Judge Sam Pointer, gave is that the new \nrule 11 ``still calls for and demands that attorneys have made a \nreasonable investigation under the circumstances.''\n  As Judge Pointer demonstrated, oftentimes a party does not get all \nthe facts until the discovery is finished, and the new rule does, \nindeed, require high standards and is not an egregious loosening of \nstandards.\n  The point is that under this new rule 11, ``if a plaintiff is going \nto make an allegation that he does not have hard support for, the \nplaintiff should say, I do this on information and belief, and be under \na responsibility to withdraw that or not continue to assert it, if \nafter reasonable opportunity for discovery, it turns out there is no \nbasis for it.''\n  Now, the new rule 11 has changes from the old rule in that if a \nviolation regarding a pleading is found, then the court may impose \nsanctions.\n  Under the old rule, the language was that a court must impose a \nsanction if it found a violation of the rule.\n  As Judge Pointer demonstrated in his testimony, a court needs the \nflexibility or discretion to impose sanctions because a complaint, or \nfor that fact an answer or motion to dismiss may contain a technical \nviolation, but the rest of that pleading could be perfectly acceptable. \nWhy, then, should a court be required to impose a sanction? Such \ndiscretion would not, in my judgment, giveaway to mass, irresponsible \npleading.\n  Obviously, those who are purporting to change rule 11 raise the \npossibility that a party could intentionally bring a frivolous action \nand, upon a finding of such by the court, might escape a penalty. The \nresponse to that concern is that well, yes, there could be no penalty, \nbut in that type of egregious intentionally frivolous pleading a court \nwill most likely impose a sanction.\n  Under the new rule--\n\n       [I]f warranted, the court may award to the party prevailing \n     on the motion the reasonable expenses and attorney's fees \n     incurred in presenting or opposing the motion.\n\n  Also, a court on its own initiative may begin a show-cause proceeding \nas to whether a party has violated the rule. This should take care of \nconcerns by Senator Brown that plaintiffs could irresponsibly plead, \nclaim, et cetera. The court has its own power to initiate an inquiry as \nto whether rule 11 has been violated.\n  As the Senate can clearly see, this is a highly technical matter that \nwe are being called upon to consider, and it is attempting to be \namended onto an unrelated bill without the Members of this body having \nan adequate opportunity to study the issues. For us here in Congress to \nhave to consider this amendment on an unrelated bill seems to me to be \nan irresponsible way of legislating.\n  So it is my opinion that we ought not to be involved in this at this \ntime. The Judiciary Committee had hearings, and there was ample \nopportunity for action to be taken. But no action was brought forth \nthrough the form of a bill being introduced to make any changes to rule \n11.\n  There are always efforts to look at matters and matters can always be \nconsidered by this body. But the Judicial Conference is designed and is \nmuch better equipped than this body to make the decisions pertaining to \nthat matter.\n  It seems to me that it is just improper and an inappropriate time to \nbring this matter up at such a late stage as this. If there had been a \nreal sincere effort, it could have been done within the 6-month time \nperiod allowed pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act. It seems to me that \nwe ought not to be dealing with this amendment at this time on this \nunrelated bill.\n  It may be that a bill could be introduced later, if they wanted to, \nand at other times go through the process.\n  But I feel that the new rule is a flexible rule and has provisions \nthat strengthen--not weaken--the efforts to prevent frivolous lawsuits. \nThe new rule is expected to reduce the number of inappropriate motions \nrequesting sanctions, thereby allowing courts to focus more attention \non legitimate sanction requests.\n  Mr. President, let me read from Rule 11 as it now exists. This is \nabout representations in a pleading.\n\n       By presenting to the court, whether by signing, filing, or \n     submitting, or later advocating a pleading, a written motion, \n     or other paper, the attorney or unrepresented party is \n     certifying to the best of the person's knowledge, \n     information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable \n     under the circumstances, that it is not being presented for \n     any improper purpose, such as to harass, or to cause \n     unnecessary delay, or needless increase in the cost of \n     litigation. The claim, the defenses, and other legal \n     contentions therein are warranted by existing law, or by \n     nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or \n     reversal of existing law, or the establishment of the new \n     law. The allegation and other factual contentions have \n     evidentiary support, and if specifically so identified are \n     likely to have evidentiary support of a reasonable \n     opportunity for further investigation or discovery. The \n     denials of fact show contentions are warranted to the \n     evidence, and, if specifically so identified, are reasonably \n     based on a lack of information or belief.\n\n  This is strong language. I want to point out basically what the \ndifference is. The current rule 11 allows a judge some discretion \nrather than making sanctions mandatory.\n  [[Page S5719]] That is the guts of the rule, whether or not a judge \nought to have some discretion pertaining to a matter or whether, on the \nother hand, it ought to be absolutely mandatory.\n  This is being opposed by the civil rights community and by a number \nof others.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter that was addressed to the \nHonorable George J. Mitchell, from the Committee on Rules of Practice \nand Procedure of the Judicial Conference of the United States, Judge \nAlicemarie H. Stotler, be printed in the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Alliance for Justice \nrelative to this issue also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure of the \n           Judicial Conference of the United States,\n                                   Washington, DC, March 15, 1994.\n     Hon. George J. Mitchell,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mitchell: I am requesting your assistance in \n     opposing Senator Brown's amendment (No. 1496) to S. 4, the \n     ``National Competitiveness Act of 1993.'' Senator Brown's \n     amendment would change certain parts of the amendments to \n     Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which became \n     effective on December 1, 1993. The Rule 11 amendments were \n     submitted to Congress in May 1993 only after extensive \n     scrutiny by the bench, bar, and public in accordance with the \n     Rules Enabling Act.\n       Serious consideration of amendments to Rule 11 began about \n     four years ago. The rule had been the subject to thousands of \n     decisions and widespread criticism since it was substantially \n     amended in 1983. In an unusual step, the Advisory Committee \n     on Civil Rules issued a preliminary call for general comments \n     on the operation and effort of the rule. It also requested \n     the Federal Judicial Center to conduct two extensive surveys \n     on Rule 11.\n       After reviewing the comments and studies, the committee \n     concluded that the widespread criticisms of the 1983 version \n     of the Rule, though frequently exaggerated or premised on \n     faulty assumptions, were not without merit. There was support \n     for the following propositions:\n       Rule 11, in conjunction with other rules, has tended to \n     impact plaintiffs more than defendants;\n       It occasionally has created problems for a party which \n     seeks to assert novel legal contentions or which needs \n     discovery to determine if the party's belief about the facts \n     can be supported with evidence;\n       It has too rarely been enforced through nonmonetary \n     sanctions, with cost-shifting being the normative practice;\n       It provides little incentive, and perhaps a disincentive, \n     for a party to abandon positions after determining they are \n     no longer supportable in law, or in fact; and\n       It sometimes has produced unfortunate conflicts between \n     attorney and client, and exacerbated contentious behavior \n     between counsel.\n       The draft amendments broadened the scope of the obligation \n     to ``stop-and-think'' before filing or maintaining a position \n     in court, but placed greater constraints on the imposition of \n     sanctions. The amendments were later revised by the advisory \n     committee and the Standing Committee on Rules and approved by \n     the Judicial Conference of the United States and then adopted \n     by the Supreme Court, with two justices dissenting.\n       The amendments strike a fair and equitable balance between \n     competing interests, remedy the major problems with the 1983-\n     version of the rule, and should reduce both the extent of \n     court-involvement with Rule 11 motions and the time spent on \n     frivolous claims, defenses, and other contentions.\n       The amendments represent the end product of a rigorous \n     public rulemaking process that worked as contemplated by \n     Congress under the Rules Enabling Act. The issues were fully \n     aired in a public forum. Interested individuals and \n     organizations were provided, and responded to, opportunities \n     to comment on the changes. The language of the amendment was \n     meticulously drafted only after the Judicial Conference \n     committees, which consist of prominent lawyers, law \n     professors, and judges, had the benefit of this public \n     examination.\n       Senator Brown's amendment to Rule 11 would undercut the \n     Rules Enabling Act process frustrating not only the intent of \n     the Act but also the participants in the rulemaking process, \n     including the public and many advocates of Rule 11 change. \n     Your leadership in maintaining the integrity of the Rules \n     Enabling Act would be greatly appreciated.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Alicemarie H. Stotler.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                         Alliance for Justice,\n\n                                                   April 26, 1995.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned organizations urge you to \n     oppose the changes to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 11 \n     that have been offered as an amendment to the Products \n     Liability Fairness Act. This amendment poses a grave threat \n     to civil rights and public interest litigation.\n       The proposed changes would roll back advances in Rule 11 \n     that were recently enacted following careful and thoughtful \n     discussion involving all concerned parties across the \n     political spectrum. We know from experience that returning to \n     the old Rule 11 will be particularly devastating to \n     underrepresented Americans.\n       Under the old rule, threats of sanctions quickly became the \n     standard ammunition in the arsenal of defense counsel. The \n     result was an avalanche of satellite sanctions litigation \n     that occupied a great deal of judicial resources and was \n     often as frivolous as the litigation Rule 11 was designed to \n     eliminate.\n       The old rule had a particularly harsh effect on civil \n     rights and public interest organizations and their clients. \n     As the Judicial Conference's Advisory Committee on Civil \n     Rules found:\n       (1) Rule 11 . . . has tended to impact plaintiffs more \n     frequently and severely than defendants; (2) it occasionally \n     has created problems for a party which seeks to assert novel \n     legal contentions or which needs discovery from other persons \n     to determine if the party's belief about the facts can be \n     supported by the evidence; [and] (3) it has too rarely been \n     enforced through nonmonetary sanctions.\n       Noting these concerns, the Judicial Conference offered \n     amendments that made sanctions permissive; created a 21-day \n     ``safe harbor'' period; and made clear that the purpose of \n     sanctions was to deter frivolous claims. These amendments \n     garnered broad support among judges, bar associations, legal \n     scholars, litigators and the Department of Justice, and were \n     ultimately adopted by Congress.\n       The safe harbor provision was a particularly significant \n     and welcome change. Once a party raised a Rule 11 objection \n     to a pleading, the opposing party has 21 days to consider the \n     objection and, if warranted, withdraw the challenged claims--\n     drawing the courts into further litigation.\n       The Rule 11 amendment threatens to roll back these \n     achievements and resurrect the very problems that prompted \n     the Judicial Conference, the Supreme Court and many others to \n     take action. The amendment would have an especially heavy \n     impact on plaintiffs, placing the cost of litigation beyond \n     the reach of ordinary Americans, particularly public interest \n     and civil rights litigants. It compromises the very notions \n     upon which our legal system is based--fairness and equity.\n       We urge you to reject any amendments to Rule 11.\n           Respectfully,\n     Nan Aron,\n                                             Alliance for Justice.\n     Lou Bograd,\n                                   American Civil Liberties Union.\n     Leslie Harris,\n                          People for the American Way Action Fund.\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I want to commend the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alabama for his thoughtful comments. He is a delight to work with \neven when we do not always see eye to eye. This is an area where we do \nnot see eye to eye.\n  I wanted to comment briefly on his remarks. First of all, there was \nthe implication that these suggested changes have only been considered \nfor a short period of time and we have not had a real opportunity to \nlook at what effect they would have on the rules. That would not be my \nassessment of them. Let me explain why.\n  The rule changed originally in 1983 from having permissive sanctions \nfor a violation of the rule to having mandatory sanctions for a \nviolation of the rule. That is, when someone has brought a frivolous \naction prior to 1983, the rule was as it is now: that is, you did not \nhave to have mandatory sanctions.\n  So the fact that this has not been tried before really does not \nsquare with our experience. The fact is we did try this permissive \napproach to sanctions prior to 1983. I think one could reasonably ask \nwhat were the results of that experiment when the sanctions were not \nrequired? There was a study done of that, and it studied the reaction \nof practitioners and judges in changing from permissive to mandatory \nsanctions.\n  Here are the results of that study.\n  I might mention that this study was conducted of both lawyers and \njudges in the northern district of California, which is part of the \nninth circuit. The questionnaire was sent to 17 judges, 7 magistrates, \nand 107 attorneys, all of whom had been involved in rule 11 \nproceedings, so these were not inexperienced people. They were people \nwho had understood the process and worked with it.\n  [[Page S5720]] Sixty-eight lawyers, 46 percent of them, responded; 12 \njudges and magistrates, 50 percent, responded to the survey, so there \nwas a good response. Here is the response: 46 percent of the \nrespondents indicated that they had engaged in additional prefiling \nfactual inquiry when the sanctions were mandatory. That is, when \nsanctions were mandatory, it resulted in the attorneys doing additional \nprefiling factual inquiry.\n  Now, if you favored more factual inquiry before filings are made, you \nare going to want mandatory sanctions because that is what mandatory \nsanctions resulted in. If you do not care about the additional \nprefiling inquiry, if that is not one of your objectives, then you will \nnot want the mandatory sanctions and you will want the rules as they \ncurrently stand.\n  The survey also indicated that 33 percent indicated additional \nprefiling legal inquiry when the rule in effect employed mandatory \nsanctions. That is, before they filed, they did additional work to make \nsure they were right on the law before they filed.\n  Is that not what we want? Is that not what we should be hoping for, \nthat people take the time to find out what the facts are and find out \nwhat the law is before they bring the lawsuit?\n  The survey indicated clearly that having sanctions required resulted \nin additional legal work and additional factual work before lawsuits \nwere brought. That is the essence of mandatory sanctions and mandatory \nsanctions are the essence of this amendment.\n  So the suggestion that this is some wild idea that has never been \ntried does not square with the pre-1983 and post-1983 experience. The \nfact is we had permissive sanctions prior to 1983, and it resulted, at \nleast according to the survey, in less legal research before you filed \nand less factual research before you filed.\n  Mr. President, it was alleged earlier that the issue of rule 11 could \nhave been brought up earlier, but it was not, somehow implying that the \npeople who are concerned about the gutting of rule 11 had been \ndilatory.\n  Mr. President, let me be very clear about that. I did introduce a \nbill, but that bill was not brought up for a vote.\n  What happened is that the Supreme Court transmitted to us the rule \nchanges and made very clear in that transmittal that they were not \nnecessarily endorsing them--let me read it because that is a serious \ncomment, a serious charge. The letter from the Chief Justice of the \nSupreme Court, William Rehnquist reads:\n\n       Transmittal does not necessarily indicate that the Court \n     itself would have proposed these amendments in the form \n     submitted.\n\n  It cannot be more clear than that.\n  The reality is that this was not voted on before, and the reason it \nwas not voted on before was because we could not get it put on the \nagenda and we could not get a recorded vote. But a bill was introduced, \nand I did do all I knew how to have the issue come before the Senate. \nThat is why it has to be brought up here.\n  Now, when you do not allow a vote on a bill, to say somehow the \nproponents of that position have been dilatory I think raises real \nquestions. What actually happened here is that these changes became law \nbecause we did not have a vote. And the Supreme Court's own documents \nsay that their transmittal of it does not necessarily mean they agree.\n  Now, Mr. President, for those who have read the report, Justice White \nalso commented on this, and he made a very important point. He made a \npoint that the practice of the Court has generally been--except for two \nJustices, the practice of the Court has generally been not to interfere \nwith this process, to simply transfer proposed changes on, because they \nhave some questions as to whether or not it is a proper role for the \nCourt to draft these changes.\n  Justices felt so strongly about this that three of them did dissent, \nwhich is highly unusual in this matter, and let me read to the Senate \nfrom that dissent. This is a dissent by Justices Souter, Thomas, and \nScalia. All three of them dissented. Remember, Justice Rehnquist \nindicated it was not necessarily endorsement; they passed it on, and \nremember Justice White's comments as well. But here is a quote from the \ndissent.\n\n       In my view, the sanctions proposed will eliminate a \n     significant and necessary deterrent to frivolous litigation.\n\n  That is a direct quote out of the Justice's comments.\n  The dissent goes on:\n\n       Under the revised rule, parties will be able to file \n     thoughtless, reckless, and harassing pleadings secure in the \n     knowledge that they have nothing to lose.\n\n  Mr. President, that is it in a nutshell. If we fail to address this \nquestion, it is very clear what the new rules do. Let me read what he \nsaid.\n\n       Under the revised rule, parties will be able to file \n     thoughtless, reckless, and harassing pleadings secure in the \n     knowledge that they have nothing to lose.\n\n  Now, Members of this body are going to have a chance to go on record \nto see whether or not they favor allowing the filing of ``thoughtless, \nreckless, and harassing pleadings secure in the knowledge that they \nhave nothing to lose.''\n  Lastly, Mr. President, it was suggested on this floor that there are \npeople who would object to my motion.\n  Let me assure this body I have personally sought out the groups that \nwere discussed. I have called them repeatedly. I have asked for \nmeetings. I have asked for their suggestions. They have not been \nwilling to respond or meet with us. And this happened not just once but \non many occasions.\n  If Members have questions about this amendment, I hope it is not on \nthe basis that this Senator was not willing to go out and ask for \nadvice, was not willing to contact the parties that might have concern, \nand was not willing to try and work with them, because I did. I did ask \nfor their advice. I did offer to work with them. And as a matter of \nfact, the measure that is before the Senate is not a full restoration \nof the old rulings but willingly adopts a number of the measures that \nwere proposed.\n  Mr. President, I could not come to this body and acquiesce, as the \ndissent says, in revised rules that will enable parties ``to file \nthoughtless, reckless, and harassing pleadings'' or acquiesce in \nallowing them to do so ``secure in the knowledge that they have nothing \nto lose.'' That would be wrong. And these new rules are wrong.\n  Now, it has been suggested that this amendment will eliminate a \njudge's discretion with regard to sanctions. The facts are these. The \nold rules and the amendment that I offer this body does restore the \nrequirement that you have sanctions when someone is guilty. This is not \na game where you blow the whistle and say start over. When you are \nwrong and your actions impede the process in the court, I think \nsanctions are important. But to suggest that we eliminate judge's \ndiscretion is not accurate. The judge retains discretion under the \nrules to decide what type of sanction is appropriate as well as how \nsubstantial the sanction is.\n  Mr. President, I say that because I think it is important to take \ncare of the questions that were raised.\n  I simply want to ask the body three questions that I think come full \ncircle on this issue of frivolous lawsuits and capture the essence of \nit.\n  Should filings be grounded in facts or not? If the Members of this \nbody feel filings in Federal court should be founded in facts, they \nshould vote for this amendment. If they do not think it is necessary \nthat the filing should be founded in facts, they will want to vote \n``no.''\n  Two, should sanctions be required if you file frivolous actions? I \nbelieve if you file frivolous actions and they are found to be \nfrivolous actions that sanctions should be required. But if you do not \nthink there should be sanctions if you file frivolous actions, then you \nwill want to vote ``no.''\n  Mr. President, finally, should an injured party be compensated for \nthe costs or not? That is, let us say someone files a frivolous action, \na party is injured because they have to respond and they have to pay \nfor attorneys' fees and expenses. The question before us is, should the \ninjured party be compensated for costs or not?\n  I think they should be. But if you do not think they should be, or if \nyou think that priorities should be given to having the sanction go to \nthe court and not to the injured party, which is what the new rules \ngive priority to--the new rules give priorities to having the sanction, \nif there is any, go to the court instead of the injured party. If you \nthink \n[[Page S5721]] the injured party should not be compensated or that \nshould be the low priority, then you are going to want to vote ``no.''\n  Mr. President, the summation of the concern of the Justice who \ndissented in the transmittal closes with this quote.\n\n       It takes no expert to know that a measure which eliminates \n     rather than strengthens a deterrent to frivolous litigation \n     is not what the times demand.\n\n  Mr. President, it cannot be said better than that. If Members of this \nSenate think that our times demand that you ought to eliminate \nsanctions for frivolous action, then vote no. But I agree with the \nJustice when he says:\n\n       It takes no expert to know that a measure which eliminates \n     rather than strengthens a deterrent to frivolous litigation \n     is not what the times demand.\n\n  Mr. President, it is wrong to bring frivolous actions. It is wrong to \nfile and not know the facts. It is wrong and I believe personally it is \nunethical for an attorney to bring frivolous actions before our courts. \nThat is what the question is in this amendment. Do we favor frivolous \nfilings or do we think there ought to be some sanctions for them?\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, the Senate is currently engaged in what is, in my \nopinion, a constructive debate on the subject of product liability. The \npending amendment, unfortunately, is destructive. It is destructive, \ncertainly, of the relationship between the Congress and the courts, a \nrelationship established pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act, that has \nworked and is working. And it is destructive of efforts to craft a \nproduct liability bill under the guidance of the Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. President, the fact is that the Brown amendment is, as you can no \ndoubt tell from the ``legalistic'' nature of the debate, a Judiciary \nCommittee issue. To the extent that this issue should be taken up and \ndebated, it should be done under the auspices of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from Colorado feels strongly about \nthis. But the question is whether or not it belongs as part of our \neffort to address the issue of product liability reform. I want to \nstrongly express my opinion that it does not. This amendment does not \nbelong on a Commerce Committee bill.\n  In the first instance, Mr. President, the whole argument that we \nshould make rule 11 sanctions for the filing of frivolous pleadings \nmandatory--and overturn what was established pursuant to the Rules \nEnabling Act, and what has been accepted by the legal community--\npresumes that there is a single definition of what is frivolous.\n  I submit to my colleagues that there is no single definition of what \nis frivolous. Indeed, in many instances, what one person may consider \nto be frivolous another might not.\n  I would remind my colleagues that there have been instances in our \nhistory, instances that we look back with some pride at this point, \nwhich, at first blush, might have been considered frivolous claims. \nUnder a mandatory sanctions regime similar to the one being proposed by \nthe pending amendment, those cases may not have ever been brought, due \nto the chilling effect of mandatory sanctions. These novel, but \nlegitimate, cases may never be given an opportunity to be heard if this \ntype of amendment were to be passed willy-nilly, without the reasoned \nconsideration that I believe it ought to have.\n  I remind my colleagues that it is often necessary to come up with \nnovel theories in cases in the areas of civil rights and discrimination \ncases. Rule 11, as amended, reduces this incentive to filing novel \npleadings. If you think back in the history for a little bit, I think \nthis issue becomes clear. When Thurgood Marshall filed the Brown versus \nBoard of Education case, to challenge the notion of ``separate but \nequal,'' the plaintiffs relied a great deal on psychological \narguments--the so-called Brandeis brief. The plaintiffs in Brown relied \non psychological and sociological evidence that proved the devastating \nimpact our separate educational systems were having on the educational \nand human development of minority youths. Who is to say that at first \nimpression someone might have said, ``Well, this is a silly argument. \nThis is a silly idea.'' Who is to say that Thurgood Marshall might not \nhave been intimidated from ever bringing the Brown case under a \nmandatory sanctions regime.\n  But because there was not the prospect of mandatory sanctions, \nbecause Linda Brown could file her novel claim without the threat of \nsatellite litigation over whether the claim was frivolous, the doctrine \nof separate but equal was struck down. I could cite several examples of \nthat sort of thing happening.\n  And so I believe that it makes sense for Congress to allow the court \ndiscretion in sanctioning parties for the filing of frivolous \npleadings.\n  Mr. President, Congress has established a procedure to amend the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, and that procedure is called the \nRules Enabling Act.\n  Under the Rules Enabling Act, the Judicial Conference appoints a \ncommittee to consider proposed changes to the Federal rules. The \ncommittee recommends any necessary changes to the Judicial Conference, \nwhich then studies the issue and then decides whether or not to \ntransmit those proposed changes to the Supreme Court.\n  The Supreme Court then decides whether or not to transmit those \nchanges to Congress, to us, and then we then have 180 days either to \nreject or modify those changes. If Congress does nothing, then the \nchanges go into effect.\n  Mr. President, the changes to rule 11 that Senator Brown opposes were \nadopted by the Supreme Court on April 22, 1993. Congress had until \nDecember 1, 1993, to reject or modify the rule 11 changes. The Senate \nJudiciary Committee, on which I served with Senator Brown, held a \nhearing on this issue on July 28, 1993. Yet in that time Congress took \nno action to reject the rule 11 provisions. I believe that Congress \nshould take no action now.\n  There is no evidence to indicate that the revised rule 11, which will \nbe thrown out by this amendment, has had an adverse impact on Federal \nlitigation. Preliminary indications are that it has produced cost \nsavings by decreasing the amount of ``satellite litigation''--\nlitigation on the side--as to what is frivolous, and by encouraging \nparties to withdraw frivolous pleadings within the 21-day safe harbor.\n  It is not as though the 1993 amendments to rule 11 completely repeals \nthe rule. The amendments gave attorneys the 21-day safe harbor in which \nto withdraw challenged pleadings and made sanctions discretionary in \nthe judges, not mandatory.\n  In addition, sanctions would normally be paid to the court in the \nform of a fine, rather than to opposing counsel in the form of \ncompensation.\n  Mr. President, these changes have been strongly supported by the \ncivil rights community. As I stated earlier, it is often necessary to \ncome up with novel theories in order to pursue civil rights cases. This \nproposed change, I think, would have an extremely detrimental effect.\n  In fact, I have a correspondence here from the NAACP Legal Defense \nFund in which they state that, ``The Brown amendment would be extremely \ndetrimental to civil rights litigation.''\n  But, again, to get back to what the studies say, the studies back up \nthe claim that the rule, as amended, is working.\n  A Federal Judiciary Center study demonstrated that, under the \nmandatory sanctions regime, sanctions were imposed in a \ndisproportionately higher percentage of civil rights cases than in tort \nor contract cases. Inherent in this problem, of course, is the \nvagueness of the term ``frivolous.''\n  In the same study, a group of judges asked to study a complaint \ndivided evenly over whether or not the complaint was frivolous, \nprompting one commentator to observe that ``one man's frivolous \ncomplaint is another man's serious question.''\n  And so, Mr. President, I would argue this afternoon that while the \nSenator from Colorado has obviously a concern in this area, this is the \nwrong forum and the wrong time. He spoke about the timeliness of the \nissue. This is the wrong time to take this issue up, and \n[[Page S5722]] certainly this is the wrong bill on which this issue \nshould be taken up.\n  If, indeed, further changes, further debate about whether or not \njudges should have discretion with regard to rule 11 issues, if that \ndebate is to happen, then it should happen in the context in which we \ncan make a judgment about it that is a sensible judgment and not just a \nrush to judgment.\n  I submit to my colleagues that the effect of this amendment would not \nonly be to limit the kind of cases that can be filed but also to limit \nthe court's discretion, because in this instance, with this amendment \nin place, all that a judge could do would be to choose an either/or--\neither the case is frivolous and thrown out altogether, or he has to \napply mandatory sanctions.\n  That is not the direction in which to go. That is going to increase \nthe cost of litigation. That is not going to help the process to work, \nand certainly I come back to my original point, that will then create a \nfurther imbalance and a further disruption in a relationship that has \nbeen established giving the courts a process for deciding on amendments \nto the Rules of Civil Procedure. That relationship will have been \ngreatly impaired by this kind of rush to judgment.\n  So I reluctantly, again--understanding that I serve on the Judiciary \nCommittee with the Senator from Colorado--submit to my colleagues, at \nthis point in time, on this legislation, this amendment is ill founded, \nand I ask my colleagues to reject it.\n  Thank you.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Iowa, I am \ngoing to be literally 2 minutes.\n  I just want to explain the position of the manager of the bill on \nthis, and for the benefit of my colleagues who are listening to this \ndebate and their staff who are listening.\n  We are now considering an amendment of the Senator from Colorado, \nSenator Brown, that tries to repeal part of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure dealing with rule 11 and the way it serves to inhibit so-\ncalled frivolous pleading.\n  This rule was modified as a result of action taken in 1993 following \nthe work of the Federal Judicial Conference. I have listened to the \nconcerns expressed by the Senator from Alabama and the Senator from \nIllinois, and others, pointing out this amendment is outside the scope \nof the bill before us, which is the product liability bill. From my \nprevious tabling motions and votes, I think my colleagues know that I \nam dead serious about trying to keep this bill limited to the bill, \nunloaded, unadorned with amendments that are not directly related to \nit.\n  I think that every Senator would agree that frivolous lawsuits should \nbe curbed, but I just want to say that at the proper time, I will move \nto table the amendment. It was received very recently and one would \nhope there could be full hearings on the amendment. I wanted people to \nunderstand what my plan was.\n  Mr. BROWN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Of course.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I just simply will say to the Senator, I am \nvery sensitive to the remarks he made. I understand fully his concerns. \nHe has a very important bill that he has brought forward. I want to \nassure the Senator that it would be the last thing I would want to do, \nto somehow burden his bill so that it could not pass. I want to assure \nthe Senator, in the event it is adopted but proves later to be a burden \nfor the Senator in terms of getting his underlying measure passed, that \nI will work with him in that regard.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I am thoroughly grateful to the Senator from \nColorado.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, when is it time to take up an amendment \nin the Senate? When is it appropriate to discuss any amendment? \nEverybody knows the rules of the Senate. Almost any time in the Senate \nis a time to discuss anything that you can get before the body. \nParticularly in the case of this approach, it seems to me very \nappropriate now because we are talking about an underlying piece of \nlegislation that is basic to making the courts a more effective tool \nfor the settlement of disputes.\n  In the particular case of the underlying piece of legislation, it is \nto establish some standards in the courts so that those cases that are \ngoing to be considered by the courts will have some continuing thread \nrunning through them from State to State to make sure the cases are \nfairly heard. And this issue that is before us, that is presented by \nSenator Brown, is such an amendment as well, an amendment that is going \nto make the Federal courts a more effective body for the determination \nof disputes.\n  It has become otherwise because courts can be very easily loaded down \nwith frivolous suits. The Brown amendment, which I support, is about \nmaking the courts serve the intent of the Constitution writers, to be \nan impartial body for the settlement of disputes, but not just any suit \nthat might come to people's minds, very serious suits.\n  So I want to associate myself with this amendment, and I want to say \nto my dear friend from Alabama, we very seldom disagree. This is one of \nthose times because I think it is time now to restore the effectiveness \nof rule 11. A strong, effective rule 11 is one of the most important \ntools that the courts have to fight frivolous, baseless, and even \nsometimes harassing lawsuits.\n  A strong effective rule 11 preserves judicial resources for litigants \nwho truly need access to our court system, and to give a swift action \nagainst frivolous lawsuits and claims is, in the end, going to save \ntime and going to save money and, by the way, that happens to be \ntaxpayers' dollars, and it is going to, most importantly, promote \npublic respect for the integrity of the Federal courts.\n  Now, on the other hand, the current version of rule 11, the one that \nSenator Brown wants to modify, the current version is of little value \nas a deterrent to baseless lawsuits. It actually allows attorneys to \nfile allegations without knowing them to be true. It allows lawyers to \nmake assertions without having any factual basis and before any \nresearch is done.\n  In short, the current version of rule 11 encourages the kind of \nbaseless suits and claims that rule 11 was originally enacted to \nprevent.\n  The current rule eventually says ``Sue first and ask questions \nlater.''\n  Senator Brown's amendment puts teeth back into rule 11. It does so by \nmaking sanctions for frivolous suits mandatory, as they once were. In \nfact, Mr. President, rule 11 was amended years ago to make sanctions \nmandatory because rule 11, up to that time, was ineffective when \nsanctions were discretionary, as they are under the current version of \nthe rule.\n  This amendment thus forces people who come into court to present the \nfacts and to present the law in a reasonable and honest way. It deters \nfrivolous claims and frivolous suits by denying litigants the \nopportunity to overreach with unresearched facts and to shoot for the \nMoon with unresearched law.\n  This amendment also provides the courts with a variety of tools to \ndefer frivolous suits, from attorney's fees and expenses to court \npenalties to nonmonetary sanctions. It also accounts for the innocent \nparty who has to spend time and money defending against baseless \nclaims, which the current version of the rule fails to do.\n  This amendment would enable the court to make the moving party whole \nfor the money spent defending against frivolous lawsuits or claims.\n  Let me use a very specific example. The milkshake case that Senator \nHatch talked about yesterday. A driver, as we recall, bought a \nmilkshake at a McDonald's restaurant and placed it between his legs. \nWhen he reached for something, he squeezed the milkshake and it spilled \ninto his lap. He became distracted and drove into the car of another \ndriver who sued the milkshake purchaser and McDonald's. His attorney's \ntheory was that McDonald's failed to warn the driver of the danger of \neating and driving at the same time.\n  Now, in reality, he was after McDonald's deep pocket because the \ndriver who caused the accident was uninsured. This case was thrown out \nof trial court but was appealed up to the New Jersey Supreme Court--\nconsuming, if we can believe this, 3 years of the court system's time, \nand thousands and \n[[Page S5723]] thousands of dollars of McDonald's money for defense of \na baseless action.\n  Now, when McDonald's asked for reimbursement for these fees, the \njudge refused, saying of the plaintiff, ``He's creative and imaginative \nand should not be penalized for that.''\n  Now, how ridiculous can we get when we talk about frivolous suits? \nThis case shows that far from discouraging frivolous litigation, the \ncurrent rule actually encourages it.\n  Senator Brown's relatively modest changes will restore the deterrence \nvalue of rule 11 and will have a positive impact on the ability of the \nFederal courts to deal with the ever-increasing onslaught of \nlitigation, because cases delayed is justice denied for some people who \nhave a legitimate suit.\n  I support and I ask my colleagues to support the needed change \nsuggested by Senator Brown.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to have a brief \ncolloquy or discussion with the proponent of this amendment, the \ndistinguished Senator from Colorado, Senator Brown. I have already \ntalked with him about the matter, and I think it is useful to make it a \nmatter of record as to the meaning of this amendment, which I think is \nreasonably apparent from the language.\n  There is always a consideration as to legislative intent as derived \nfrom these discussions, but I think that it is especially appropriate \nwhen we have an amendment to have the view of the author of the \namendment.\n  As I understand the amendment, it essentially restores the old rule \n11 which was in existence prior to its amendment. In general terms, is \nthat true?\n  Mr. BROWN. Yes, it restores the rule that was in effect prior to \nDecember 1, 1993.\n  Mr. SPECTER. As I understand the interpretation of the old rule, it \nprovided some reasonable flexibility with respect to the imposition of \nsanctions. My question to Senator Brown is, does his amendment leave it \nto the discretion of the court as to what sanctions would be imposed?\n  Mr. BROWN. It does leave to the discretion of the court as to what \nsanctions are appropriate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. So that there is no requirement that there be an \nimposition of attorney fees or a loser-pays rule for a violation of the \nrule arising from this amendment to rule 11?\n  Mr. BROWN. That is correct.\n  The fact is, in the past, before December 1, 1993, there were \noccasions on a number of times when the judges would find that it would \nbe inappropriate to award those fees although they found--\n  Mr. SPECTER. It would be appropriate?\n  Mr. BROWN. It would not be appropriate to award those fees, even \nthough they did find a frivolous action.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Although the language is mandatory that there has to be \nsome sanction, the scope of the sanction is up to the judge? That is, \nit is discretionary with the court?\n  Mr. BROWN. That is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. And the amendment does not require that attorneys fees \nbe paid or that the rule of loser pays be a consequence of a violation \nof the rule under the amendment that is being offered?\n  Mr. BROWN. That is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this, I think, is something which is \nimportant to have clear, which we have now clarified.\n  It is my sense that the adoption of the tightening provisions by \nSenator Brown achieves a purpose of further discouraging frivolous \nlitigation. That is already discouraged to some extent, under the \nexisting rule 11, but it further discourages frivolous litigation.\n  There is legislation in one of the bills passed by the House which \nwould impose the loser-pays rule, which is not in the House product \nliability legislation, but their companion bill and it might be \napplicable to all litigation so that it might apply to product \nliability cases.\n  It is my sense, given the concern about whether there is frivolous \nlitigation or the extent of frivolous litigation, that there is merit \nto try to reduce frivolous litigation to the extent that we can, and to \ndiscourage some more drastic, draconian measure, which I think would be \npresented by a loser-pays rule.\n  The United States has had a tradition throughout the judicial \nexperience we have had, that a loser-pays rule is not appropriate for \nour society. Without getting into the pros and cons and the extent of \nwhat may or may not be the rule in Great Britain, loser pays has not \nbeen our rule.\n  My experience as a practicing attorney has demonstrated to me that we \nought not to make that kind of a drastic rule which would, in effect, \nclose the courts.\n  What Senator Brown has done here in proposing a tightening of the \nrule against frivolous lawsuits, it seems to me, would tend to \ndiscourage any more drastic approach in this field.\n  I wonder if my colleague from Colorado would agree with that \ngeneralization?\n  Mr. BROWN. I might say that I concur in the view of the Senator.\n  It seems to me if there is a reasonable and a fair procedure to \ndiscourage frivolous actions in place, that will act as the strong \ndeterrent to go to the loser-pays provision that, for example, England \nhas incorporated.\n  On the other hand, if the rule stays without significant restrictions \nagainst frivolous lawsuits, my guess is there will be much greater \nstrength in this country of movement to go to loser pays.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague. Moving on to the one other \nprovision I wanted to discuss, with respect to the knowledge of the \nattorney who prepares the pleadings.\n  As I understand the amendment of Senator Brown, and I pose this \nquestion to my colleague from Colorado: does the amendment permit a \ngood-faith interpretation as to what the attorney for the plaintiff \nknows; that it is to the best of the person's knowledge, information, \nand belief, as the language says, formed after an inquiry, reasonable \nunder the circumstances.\n  So in essence, it is a good-faith representation by the attorney who \nsigns the pleadings.\n  Mr. BROWN. Indeed, that is correct. Rule 11 before and after my \namendment allows filings for which the party has a reasonable belief \nthat it is true. The basic notice pleading system is not affected. One \ncan still make a general, encompassing pleading, and then conduct \ndiscovery.\n  I might add, the proposals in the new rule which were meant to \ndiscourage rule 11 proceedings are retained in this amendment. In other \nwords, 21-day safe harbor that is part of the new rules, I retain.\n  What that does is require someone who is going to bring rule 11 \nproceedings to identify what they think is frivolous, then allow the \nperson who has brought the action to correct that within 21 days, and \nindeed if they do it ensures that they are totally free from sanctions.\n  That safe harbor provision, that I think is protection against rule \n11 proceedings, was retained. I retained it basically because I thought \nthat part of the change seemed to have merit and could be helpful.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by my good friend from Colorado, Senator Brown. This amendment \nis appropriate to restore rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure to its proper role. Rule 11 is an important weapon to prevent \nthe filing of frivolous claims and contentions in Federal courts. \nSignificant alterations to rule 11 went into effect on December 1, \n1993, and several of these changes are not desirable.\n  This is not an issue of favoring one party or group over another, but \nrelates to the standards of veracity which apply to all advocates in \nFederal courts. The issue is whether we in the Congress are going to \naccept changes in rule 11 which lower the standards that attorneys must \nsatisfy when filing claims and assertions in Federal court.\n  This is an issue which is of importance to the American people, too \nmany of whom already hold lawyers and our system of justice in low \nregard. The Congress is ultimately responsible for both the laws and \nthe procedures under which our Federal courts operate. We simply should \nnot accept the \n[[Page S5724]] lower standards in Federal courts which are made by the \n1993 changes to rule 11.\n  The amendment by Senator Brown will correct undesirable changes in \nrule 11, while maintaining other changes in the rule which improve the \nadministration of justice. The most critical correction made by the \nBrown amendment would require all factual contentions made in writing \nto a court to have evidentiary support or be well grounded in fact. The \n1993 changes in rule 11 permit a party to make contentions which are \nlikely to have evidentiary support after further investigation or \ndiscovery. It is important to correct this change in rule 11 to prevent \nlitigants from making broad assertions in the hope that they will be \nable to support them through future discovery. On the other hand, I am \npleased that Senator Brown agreed to my suggestion to incorporate the \nlong-standing standard that contentions must be well grounded in fact, \nbecause requiring every contention to have evidentiary support prior to \ndiscovery might be too high a standard and preclude claims and \nassertions that should be permitted.\n  Mr. President, I consider the Brown amendment to be desirable to \nrestore the standards of rule 11. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would further inquire of my \ndistinguished colleague from Colorado, whether the legislative intent \nhere is to allow discovery as to matters that a plaintiff could not \nknow about? So that when there is language here which says that, ``by \npresenting to the court * * * an attorney * * * is certifying * * * the \nallegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support or \nare well-grounded in fact,'' if a plaintiff makes representations to \nthe attorney which the attorney has reason to accept, that that would \nbe a sufficient evidentiary basis for the allegations in the complaint?\n  Mr. BROWN. Yes, I believe the Senator has said it correctly. All rule \n11 requires is an objectively reasonable belief that it is true. \nCertainly the case the Senator has outlined would fit that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If there is something which plaintiff does not know \nabout, which the attorney does not know about, there would be an \nopportunity for discovery to ascertain facts which are not within the \nknowledge of the plaintiff before there could be a challenge that there \nwas a violation of rule 11?\n  Mr. BROWN. It is my understanding of the workings of this rule that \nit is quite clear that you can still make general encompassing \npleadings and then conduct discovery.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Because a plaintiff would know on many matters what had \nhappened, but if there were some technical matter, some defect in a \nmechanism, for example, in a product, that could not be within the \nknowledge of the plaintiff, it might require some discovery. But you \nhave to state a sufficient claim to withstand a motion to dismiss, or \nperhaps just notice pleading. There would be an opportunity for an \nattorney to undertake discovery before there would be a basis for \nseeking sanctions under rule 11?\n  Mr. BROWN. Yes. It would be my feeling that this could well come \nunder the general pleadings and all it would require is a general \nbelief it was true. And it would, under those circumstances, allow the \ndiscovery.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Colorado. It is my intention \nto support this amendment and I do so because I think the experience \nunder the old rule--if I might ask the specifics of Senator Brown, when \nwas the old rule in effect specifically?\n  Mr. BROWN. The provision that required sanctions if indeed someone \nhad made frivolous filings was adopted in 1983 and lasted through \nDecember 1, 1993.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Within the 10-year period, I think that rule had \nsufficient flexibility to deter frivolous suits but was not so rigid \nand burdensome as to make it impossible to work in a reasonable \nfashion. And by returning to the old rule, which had been in effect for \nthat period of time, it is my sense that there will be a tightening of \nthe legal procedure and that it will make an improvement and satisfy \nthose who are concerned about the filing of frivolous lawsuits.\n  It is my sense generally that in seeking congressional changes in \nrules governing judicial proceedings that we have to proceed with \nsubstantial caution. In my comments on Monday I pointed out some of my \nexperience. As a practicing lawyer, I represented both plaintiffs and \ndefendants in personal injury cases and had a major piece of \nlitigation, which I had discussed on Monday, and have a sense that, as \nwe have had accretion or encrustation by the courts since the early \n19th century on the rules of law, where the cases are very, very \ncarefully analyzed and considered--I have read many of those cases \npersonally in connection with the litigation which I handled many years \nago, described in some detail in my earlier presentation--that the \ncourts have a much better opportunity to handle changes in the law than \nwe do in Congress, where frequently only one or two Senators may be \npresent at a hearing and our markups do not have the kind of careful \nand close analysis of an issue which judicial decisions have.\n  So that when Senator Brown seeks to return to a rule which had been \nin effect for 10 years, which tightens the procedures and which may \nwell foreclose a more drastic or draconian change on loser pays, I \nthink it is worth enacting. So I compliment my colleague from Colorado \nand I also compliment my colleague from Alabama, who has no peer here \nin terms of his knowledge of the judicial system and of judicial \ntemperament. We do not always agree, but Senator Heflin and I have been \non the Judiciary Committee for 14-years plus together and we have \nagreed most of the time.\n  I might say we are going to miss you, Senator Heflin. But on this one \nI must respectfully disagree and decide with Senator Brown.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nAbraham as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, first let me apologize to Senator Brown, \nwhen I said that he had not filed a bill on this. It was my \nunderstanding--I was told that, that was done after a reasonable \nsearch. My staff or someone, must not have done it.\n  That sort of illustrates why there ought to be discretion in regards \nto facts, sometimes, that might be stated or alleged. You ought to have \nan opportunity to correct a mistake. There ought to be discretion when \na party makes an honest mistake.\n  But basically this is an issue on whether or not we should return to \na rule that was in effect for 10 years from 1983 up until December 1, \n1993. The Judicial Conference, through an advisory committee, looked at \nthe way rule 11 then was operating and it felt that there ought to be \nsome changes made. So they proposed changes and the Judicial Conference \nof the United States agreed that there ought to be some changes made in \nrule 11, and that the rule ought not to be mandatory, but should be \ndiscretionary.\n  It went to the Supreme Court and six out of the nine members of the \nSupreme Court, agreed with the Judicial Conference and the Supreme \nCourt recommended the changes to the Congress. And the 6-month deadline \nwent by and therefore the new rules of civil procedure, including rule \n11 went into effect because there was no vote trying to amend them or \ntrying to prevent them from going into effect.\n  So we have a situation in which I feel we ought to see how rule 11 is \ngoing to work. The judiciary studied it for 10 years, the 10 years that \nthe old rule operated and basically this amendment attempts to take us \nback to the old rule. Basically, the Brown amendment has a lot of \ndifferent language but it really comes down to whether or not rule 11 \nought to be mandatory in every instance or whether it ought to be \ndiscretionary with the judge.\n  Senator Grassley talked about the milkshake case. There are bad \ncases. They say bad cases make bad law. You will have, probably, 1 out \nof 1,000 bad cases, but that ought not to necessarily be the \ncontrolling factor relative to a determination of whether or not the \n[[Page S5725]] rule ought to be mandatory or whether it ought to be \ndiscretionary.\n  I think the procedure that was followed by the judiciary was a very \ndeliberate procedure. It involved a studied approach, and scholars \nspent hours and days considering this issue. And here we are going to \nconsider this bill on the floor of the Senate, highly technical in \nnature, in about 1 hour and 10 minutes and are going to vote on it. It \nseems to me that the proper course that we ought to follow is to follow \nwhat the advisory committee of the Judicial Conference did, and what \nthe Supreme Court recommended to the Congress.\n  So, in my judgment I feel it is a mistake to adopt the Brown \namendment.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But the prevailing sentiment of \nthe chairman clearly is for an up-or-down vote, and I have yielded to \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment. If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nColorado.

Mr. President, as the senior senator from the State of \nNew York, and as a Democrat, I rise to offer an apology to our \nGovernor, George E. Pataki, for the inexcusable conduct of the national \nchair of the Democratic National Committee yesterday in Albany.\n  As has now been reported, and not disputed, Mr. Donald L. Fowler \nreferred to our Governor as a ``quasi-Governor''. This, he said, is \nself-defining. ``It means almost a governor, a governor who's not quite \nthere, a governor who doesn't quite have it together * * *'' Later he \nvolunteered to reporters, ``You know what `quasi' means. It means half-\nassed.''\n  In the annals of political invective, there has been yet more vulgar \ncalumny, but in this already sufficiently raucus time, this will serve. \nBut will not be allowed to stand.\n  Mr. Pataki is our duly elected Governor; a person of manifest ability \nand quiet dignity. It defies reason that the national chair of the \nDemocratic Party should journey to the State capital for the purpose of \nsummoning New Yorkers to support President Clinton in the next \nelection, whilst simultaneously insulting the person New Yorkers chose \nto be Governor in the last election.\n  I am sure Mr. Fowler regrets his remarks. I await his apology. And, \nto say again, tender my own on behalf of the great majority of \nDemocrats who would not wish to be associated with what has now taken \nplace, and who will insist that it not occur again. The President's \ntask in New York will be difficult enough; that would make it \nimpossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/26/senate-section/article/S5725-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to \nexpress my sadness over the passing of Mary Bingham, philanthropist and \nformer owner of the Louisville Courier-Journal.\n  It has been said that ``we are defined by those we have lost,'' and \nthis could not be more true than with Mary Bingham and the city she \ncalled home for over 60 years.\n  Her husband, Barry Bingham Sr., brought her to Louisville, and though \nthey forged a partnership that gave the city a spark it had not known \nbefore, her personal contributions both to the newspaper and to the \ncommunity at large, stood alone.\n  The Louisville Courier-Journal wrote that ``for those who understood \nthe remarkable partnership that shaped this region's intellectual, \npolitical and cultural climate for a century, Mary Bingham's own \nstature and contributions were never in doubt.''\n  And while Mary Bingham was not a native Kentuckian, she quickly \nembraced the place she would live out her life and we were proud to \ncall her our own.\n  Throughout the years, she was always the picture of grace and \nloveliness, a charming hostess and much-in-demand guest. But Mary \nBingham was not afraid to reveal the fierce fighter within, when it \ncame to battles on issues most important to her from the environment to \nhigh education standards.\n  And if those passionate beliefs placed her at odds with the powers \nthat be, than so be it--whether they were foes \n[[Page S5726]] of civil rights or President Roosevelt himself.\n  But mostly, a woman who had experienced so much personal loss in her \nown life, wanted simply to care for others. So much so, that I am sure \nthat upon hearing the news of her death, an entire city grieved not \nonly for the loss of a great philanthropist, but also for a close \nfriend.\n  In the days following her death, you often heard those describe her \nas being of a different era. Let us hope not. Her grace, her intellect, \nher sharp wit, and perhaps most important, her deep sense of \ncompassion, are qualities desperately needed in these confusing times.\n  I know her life of accomplishment, commitment, and kindness will set \na standard for generations of leaders to come in a city she led so \nwell.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/26/senate-section/article/S5725-4", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-715.

A bill to amend the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of \n1992 to revise the sanctions applicable to violations of that Act, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n           the iran-iraq arms nonproliferation amendments act\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, 4 years after the defeat of Iraq in \nthe Persian Gulf war, Iran has emerged as a growing threat to the \nregion. Bellicose statements are issued regularly from Tehran regarding \nthe foreign presence in the Persian Gulf. More importantly, this \nrhetoric has been accompanied by disturbing reports of new arms \nshipments to Iran and the deployment of weapons which pose a direct \nthreat to shipping in the Persian Gulf.\n  Today, Senator Lieberman and I are introducing legislation to assist \nthe President in his efforts to deal with this situation. The 1992 \nIran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act, which I cosponsored with then-\nSenator Gore, established sanctions against third parties which assist \nIran and Iraq in their efforts to rebuild their weapons capabilities. \nIt was a start, but it did not go far enough. Efforts by Senator \nLieberman and I last year to expand the legislation were unsuccessful.\n  The 1992 bill was intended to target not only the acquisition of \nconventional weapons, but weapons of mass destruction as well. In the \nprocess of amending the bill to the 1993 Defense Act, however, the \nexplicit references to weapons of mass destruction were dropped.\n  The bill we are introducing today attempts to make these applications \nabsolutely clear. It also removes from the proposed sanctions \nexceptions for assistance under the Freedom Support Act, thereby \nremoving the benefit of the doubt Congress may have given Russia in \n1992. As I will explain later in my statement, Russia has perhaps used \nthis exception to the detriment of United States policy in the Persian \nGulf.\n  To the current list of sanctions against persons assisting Iran and \nIraq in its weapons programs, which already include procurement and \nexport sanctions, the amendments we are offering today add the denial \nof visas, denial of commercial credit, and denial of authority to ship \nproducts across United States territory. To the list of sanctions \nagainst countries offering similar assistance, the amendments add the \ndenial of licenses for export of nuclear material, denial of foreign \nmilitary sales, denial of the transfer of controlled technology, denial \nof the transfer of computer technology, suspension of the authority of \nforeign air carriers to fly to or from the United States, and a \nprohibition on vessels that enter the ports of sanctioned countries.\n  The comprehensive international U.N.-mandated sanctions against Iraq \nmake the invocation of sanctions against third party suppliers of Iraq \nunnecessary in the near future, unless of course, the embargo is \nviolated or revoked. Presently, the more pressing need with regard to \nIraq is for the international community to remain firm on the embargo.\n  But given the history of the Iraqi military buildup before the gulf \nwar, the sanctions included in the Iran-Iraq Act may, at a later date, \nbe as important with regard to Iraq as they are currently in the case \nof Iran. Once the embargo is lifted, there will be a great temptation \nfor cash-strapped economies to resume sales of military hardware to \nIraq. Outside forces may once again be compelled to maintain a balance \nin the region through arms sales and a dangerous escalation of \nfirepower.\n  [[Page S5727]] Before Iraq's efforts to develop weapons of mass \ndestruction were ended in the aftermath of the gulf war, it had made \nsubstantial progress. Iraq had several workable nuclear weapon designs, \nmany key components, a multibillion dollar nuclear manufacturing base \nand a global supply network able to exploit lax Western export \ncontrols. Its Western-trained scientists had produced small amounts of \nweapons grade plutonium and enriched uranium. Even today, despite our \nbest efforts, Iraq maintains the equipment and expertise that may \npermit it to resume its pursuit of a nuclear weapon once the embargo is \nlifted.\n  Saddam Hussein's efforts to develop chemical and biological weapons \ncapabilities are also well known and, as with its nuclear program, \nthere is some lingering concern about whether Iraq retains a capacity \nto produce these weapons.\n  The Congressional Research Service did two illuminating studies 2 \nyears ago on the sources of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction \nprograms. The list of Iraq's nuclear suppliers included 3 French firms, \n11 German firms, 2 Italian firms, 2 Swedish firms, 4 Swiss firms, 4 \nBritish firms, and 2 Russian firms. The list of Iraq's chemical weapons \nsuppliers included 7 Austrian firms, 2 Belgian firms, 2 French firms, \n34 German firms, 3 Dutch firms, 3 Italian firms, 1 Spanish firm, 3 \nSwiss firms, and 1 British firm.\n  This is all in the past now. But we should take note that so many \ncorporations displayed an interest in supplying Iraq without regard to \nthe consequences. These corporations must be confronted with \ndisincentives in order to keep them from once again serving as Saddam's \nsupplier base.\n  It is also vitally important to prevent the reemergence of an Iraqi \nconventional military threat. One need only to observe the origins of \nthe weapons which constituted the Iraqi threat in 1990 to know that the \nkey to any postembargo containment strategy will depend on our ability \nto influence Iraq's trading partners in Europe, Russia, the People's \nRepublic of China, and North Korea.\n  It is my hope and intention that the sanctions detailed in this \nlegislation help us exercise the influence necessary to prevent another \ndangerous arms buildup in Iraq.\n  The threat from Iran is more immediate. Recent reports indicate a \nsubstantial increase in the Iranian military presence in the Persian \nGulf. In addition to Silkworm missiles and two Russian-built \nsubmarines, Iran has deployed on the islands, it controls in the \nStraits of Hormuz thousands of additional troops, surface-to-air \nmissiles, and artillery. These reports are particularly disturbing in \nthat they are a part of a well-established pattern. Iran is importing \nhundreds of North Korean-made Scud-C missiles. It is expected to \nacquire the Nodong North Korean missiles currently under development; \nand it is reportedly assembling its own shorter-range missiles.\n  In the course of preparing this legislation, I asked the \nCongressional Research Service to compile a chronology of reported arms \nshipments to Iran since the passage of the original Iran-Iraq bill in \n1992. The record is quite disturbing. I ask unanimous consent that the \nchronology be inserted into the Record following my remarks.\n  Iranian efforts to develop nuclear weapons are public and well \nestablished. Successive CIA Directors, and Secretaries Perry and \nChristopher have all testified to the effect that Iran is engaged in an \nextensive effort to acquire nuclear weapons. In February, Russia signed \nan agreement to provide Iran with a 1,000-megawatt light water nuclear \nreactor. The Russians indicate that they may soon agree to build as \nmany as three more reactors--another 1,000-megawatt reactor, and two \n440-megawatt reactors.\n  I have raised my concerns regarding this sale with the administration \non a number of occasions. I have maintained that under the Freedom \nSupport Act of 1992, which the Iran-Iraq Act of 1992 was intended to \nreinforce, the President must either terminate assistance to Russia or \nformally waive the requirement to invoke sanctions out of concern for \nthe national interest.\n  The State Department informed me in a letter dated April 21, 1995, \nthat ``to the best of its knowledge, Russia has not actually \ntransferred relevant material, equipment, or technology to Iran,'' and \nso there is no need to consider sanctions. I was further informed that \n``they are examining the scope of the proposed Russian nuclear \ncooperation with Iran, and as appropriate, they will thoroughly \nevaluate the applicability of sanctions,'' presumably, if at a later \ndate they can confirm the transfer.\n  I have no reason to question the State Department's evaluation of the \nfacts on the ground. However, I would note that there have been public \nreports of as many as 150 Russians employed at the site of the proposed \nreactor. There seems to be a dangerously fine line in determining when \nmaterial, equipment, or technology useful in the manufacture of nuclear \nweapons has actually been transferred, especially when, as is the case \nwith Iran, the reactor may already be partially complete.\n  At what point in the construction of the reactors does the transfer \nbecome significant? Do we allow the Russians to build portions of the \nreactor which do not strictly involve the transfer of dangerous \nequipment or technology while Iran obtains the most vital assistance \nfrom other sources? Although I cannot make this determination myself, \ncommon sense and an appropriate sense of caution would dictate that any \nassistance provided Iran in its efforts to acquire nuclear technology \nis significant. If the appropriate point to make this decision is not \nwhen technicians have been dispatched to the site and construction may \nhave begun, I hope the administration can identify an equally obvious \npoint at which the transfer has become the grounds for sanctions.\n  More importantly perhaps, I would point out that although the \nadministration may have technical grounds for arguing that it is not \nyet required to invoke sanctions, making a determination on the \napplicability of sanctions sooner, rather than later, would serve as \nnecessary leverage in resolving the issue. My intention is not to gut \nUnited States assistance to Russia. It is to prevent Russia from \nproviding Iran dangerous technology. Waiting to make a determination \nuntil the transfer is complete defeats the purpose of the sanctions.\n  Ultimately, I fear that the reason the administration has not made a \ndetermination is that it does not want to jeopardize our relationship \nwith Russia.\n  Based on this assumption and anticipating that the State Department \nmay at a later date find other ways to avoid compliance with the \nFreedom Support Act, the legislation we are introducing today makes the \nPresident's legal responsibility under the act more explicit.\n  We sent our Armed Forces to war in the Persian Gulf once in this \ndecade. They endured hardship to themselves and their families. Some \nwill live with the injuries they incurred in service to our Nation for \nthe rest of their lives. And as is the case with every war, some never \nreturned. With the cooperation of our friends in Europe, whose own \nsacrifices to the effort to free Kuwait should not be forgotten, we \nmust see that the service of these brave men and women was not in vain.\n  Stability and security in the Persian Gulf is vital to the world \neconomy and to our own national interests. Aggressors in the region \nshould know that if we must, we will return to the Persian Gulf with \nthe full force of Operation Desert Storm. At the same time, our friends \nand adversaries elsewhere in the world should understand that the \nUnited States will do everything in its power to preclude that \nnecessity. It is my sincere hope that this legislation will serve as an \nindication of just how serious we are.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5728]]\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                      The Library of Congress,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 30, 1995.\n     To: Office of Senator John McCain, Attention: Walter Lohman.\n     From: Kenneth Katzman, Analyst in Middle Eastern Affairs, and \n         Elizabeth Dunstan, Foreign Affairs and National Defense \n         Division.\n     Subject: Arms and Technology Transfers to Iran.\n\n       This memorandum responds to your request to provide an \n     unclassified chronology of reported weapons and technology \n     transfers or agreements to Iran. Please call 7-7612 if you \n     have any questions.\n\n\n  Chronology of Weapons and Technology Transfers to Iran Using Press \n                     Reports: October 1992-Present\n\n       10/8/92--The International Institute for Strategic Studies \n     reported that China would supply a nuclear reactor under \n     construction at Qazvin in northwestern Iran.\n       10/24/92--An editorial in the Washington Times reported \n     Iran bought Sukhoi-24 light bombers from Russia and three \n     diesel submarines, for $750 million per submarine. Most other \n     sources cite a figure of $450 million a piece. Also, F-7 jet \n     fighters were purchased from China. China reportedly agreed \n     on September 10, 1992 to sell Iran a large nuclear reactor.\n       11/21/92--According to Defense Weekly, Russia delivered to \n     Iran the first Kilo class submarine with a surface to air \n     missile capacity in the form of manportable SA-14 Gremlin or \n     SA-16 Gimlet.\n       2/10/93--According to the Jerusalem Israel Television \n     Network, Iran recently took delivery of some Scud-C surface \n     to air missiles with a range of about 500 km, as well as a \n     number of launching pods, in accordance with a deal signed \n     with North Korea. These are in addition to about 250 Scud \n     missiles supplied to Iran before the Gulf War.\n       2/17/93--According to the U.S. Director of Naval \n     Intelligence Iran has been negotiating for the purpose of \n     five mini-submarines from an unspecified source to augment \n     its Kilo submarines.\n       4/8/93--According to the New York Times, Iran was close to \n     concluding a deal with North Korea to buy a new intermediate-\n     range missile that the Koreans are developing. (The missile, \n     called Nodong I, is said to have a range of 600 miles, \n     although an extended range version may be able to reach up to \n     about 800 miles).\n       5/11/93--Iran has taken delivery of eight supersonic, sea-\n     skimming cruise missiles from the Ukraine, according to the \n     Washington Times. The Sunburst missiles, to be based in the \n     Strait of Hormuz, have reportedly been bought as part of a \n     $1.5 billion barter agreement between Tehran, Moscow, and \n     Kiev. Also included in the reported deal are 50 MiG-29, and \n     other combat aircraft, more than 200 T-72M1 battle tanks and \n     S-300 air defense system missiles.\n       8/8/93--Iran took delivery of its second Russian made Kilo-\n     class submarine.\n       1/17/94--Defense News reported that Iran was negotiating \n     with China to purchase a rocket-propelled mine called the \n     EM52 that is planted on the sea floor until it detects a \n     target. The report added that Iran had purchased 1,000 modern \n     mines from Russia, including those that detect approaching \n     ships with magnetic, acoustic, and pressure sensors.\n       3/28/94--China's Xian Aircraft Corporation will fly its \n     Jian Hong-7 bomber on March 28, 1994, to Iran for a series of \n     flight demonstrations, according to a Chinese defense \n     industry source.\n       5/7/94--Iran will take delivery of its third Kilo-class \n     diesel-electric submarine within five months, according to \n     Jane's Defense Weekly. Iran reportedly bought an estimated \n     1,800 mines of various types from Russia when it received its \n     first ``Kilo'' in November 1992.\n       9/19/94--Iran has acquired four or five fast attack missile \n     (FACM) boats from China, according to US Vice Admiral Douglas \n     Katz. The Hegu class vessel is 68 tons and is capable of \n     being armed with C-801 and C-802 surface-to-surface missiles \n     (Delivery of the missiles has not been confirmed).\n       9/26/94--Director of Central Intelligence James R. Woosley \n     said Iran had acquired MiG29's, Su 24's, and T-72 tanks, as \n     well as two Kilo-class attack submarines, from Russia. He \n     added that Iran had turned to suppliers in ``both East and \n     West,'' using intermediaries to purchase military technology \n     clandestinely.\n       9/27/94--A senior U.S. official reportedly said in the \n     Washington Post that Russia has given Iran sophisticated \n     aircraft missiles to go along with the jets it sold to Iran.\n       12/14/94--Iran is trying to buy weapons technology in \n     Germany for use in building Scud missiles, according to \n     Reuters. In October 1994, the International Institute for \n     Strategic Studies said Tehran had obtained 20 Chinese CSS-8 \n     surface-to-surface missiles, armed with conventional weapons.\n       1/5/95--The New York Times reported that Russia had entered \n     into a deal with Iran to provide up to four nuclear power \n     reactors at the Bushehr nuclear reactor complex, a deal \n     valued at nearly $1 billion. Later reports said the first \n     reactor would be a water-pressurized reactor with a capacity \n     of 1,000 megawatts. Russia might construct an additional \n     1,000 megawatt reactor and 2,440 megawatt reactors under the \n     deal. The deal, formally announced January 8, 1995, also \n     provides for Russia to train Iranian nuclear scientists and \n     possibly provide research reactors as well. Russia reportedly \n     is also required to recycle nuclear fuel for Iran. The New \n     York Times report added that China has sold Iran two similar \n     reactors and has provided two research reactors, but that \n     those projects have been delayed. China reportedly has also \n     sold several calutrons-magnetic isotope separation devices \n     that can be used to derive uranium for an atomic bomb. In \n     addition, according to the Times, China was setting up an \n     assembly plant in Iran to produce intermediate range \n     ballistic missiles (M-9's and M-11's).\n       1/30/95--The Washington Times reported that Iran has \n     secured the aid of Indian companies in the construction of a \n     poison-gas complex, according to a classified German \n     intelligence report. The Indian companies have told \n     authorities in Europe and elsewhere that they are engaged in \n     building a pesticide factory just outside Tehran.\n       2/1/95--Belgian officials impounded a Russian-built surface \n     to air missile bound for Iraq, according to the Washington \n     Times.\n       3/2/95--The Associated Press said Israel had claimed Iran \n     signed a contract with Argentina to buy fuel rods for \n     reactors and then negotiated over the purchase of heavy \n     water, considered essential for a nuclear weapons program. \n     The report did not make clear whether or not the United \n     States had succeeded in blocking the deal.\n       3/15/95--The New York Times reported that Iran had \n     developed a vast network in Europe, Russia, and the Central \n     Asian Republics to smuggle to Iran weapons parts and nuclear \n     technology.\n       3/17/95--Poland announced that it will honor any existing \n     contracts to supply tanks to Iran. Poland did not reveal the \n     details of any tank sale to Iran, however.\n       4/3/95--The New York Times reported that the United States \n     had provided intelligence to Russia about Iran's nuclear \n     program, as part of any effort to dissuade Russia from \n     providing nuclear technology to Iran. The intelligence \n     reportedly showed that Iran is importing equipment needed to \n     import nuclear weapons, that it has sought to but enriched \n     uranium from former Soviet republics, such as Kazakistan, and \n     that it is using many of the same smuggling techniques and \n     routes that Iraq and Pakistan used in their efforts to \n     acquire nuclear technology.\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of the original \nIran-Iraq Non-Proliferation Act, I am pleased to join Senator McCain as \nwell in this amendment to the 1992 act. Regrettably, Iran and Iraq have \nbecome no more law abiding during the past 2 years than they were when \nthis law was first enacted. On the contrary, Iraq has attempted by \npersuasion or force to get the international community to lift economic \nsanctions while preserving as much as possible its catastrophic weapons \ncapability. Iran, meanwhile, has continued its support for \ninternational terrorism.\n  The United States must remain vigilant in its effort to inhibit the \ndestructive capability of these two renegade states. We must do \neverything we can to prevent them from receiving assistance from any \nsource to pursue international lawlessness.\n  I believe this amendment will strengthen the current legislation and \nsend a strong signal both to the renegade states and to other states \nwhich trade with Iran and Iraq that the United States remains committed \nto tight economic sanctions. There will be consequences for those who \ntrade in embargoed goods with Iran and Iraq, just as there will be \nconsequences for us all if renegade states are able to pursue their \ndestructive objectives without hindrance. I urge my colleagues to join \nus in supporting this amendment to strengthen Iran-Iraq \nsanctions.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution \ncalling for the end of the long-standing dispute on Cyprus. I am \npleased to be joined as original cosponsors by my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senators Simon, Pressler, Sarbanes, D'Amato, and Dodd.\n  Mr. President, last year marked the 20th anniversary of the Turkish \ninvasion of Cyprus. Year after year the political deadlock over Cyprus \nhas endured. But elsewhere in the world these same two decades has seen \nthe end to the Soviet Union, mutual recognition between Israel and the \nPLO, a peaceful transition to majority rule in South Africa, and a \nrenunciation of terrorism by the Irish Republican Army and movement \ntoward an enduring peace in Northern Ireland. It is long past time for \na similar breakthrough for peace on Cyprus.\n  That is the purpose of this resolution. This resolution speaks with \nmoderation with the hope of bringing together all sides to the \nconflict. But despite its moderate tones, the resolution calls for \nlooking at the problem of Cyprus in a radically new way. The \nresolution: declares the status quo on Cyprus to be unacceptable; \nwelcomes President Clinton's appointment of a special emissary for \nCyprus; calls on all parties to seek a solution based on the U.N. \nSecurity Council resolution of \n[[Page S5730]] July 29, 1994, which stated that any solution must be \nbased on a single State of Cyprus with its independence and territorial \nintegrity safeguarded; calls for the withdrawal of all foreign troops; \nstates that proposals for a total demilitarization of Cyprus would \nenhance the security of all the Cypriot people and merits support; and \nurges the Security Council and the United States Government to consider \nalternative approaches to promote a resolution to the long-standing \ndispute, including incentives to encourage progress or sanctions \nagainst recalcitrant parties.\n  Mr. President, two decades ago, Turkey's brutal invasion drove more \nthan 200,000 Cypriots from their homes and reduced them to the status \nof refugees in their own land. More than 2,000 people are still \nmissing, including five American citizens. The Turkish Army seized 40 \npercent of the land of Cyprus, representing 70 percent of the island's \neconomic wealth. Today, Turkey continues to maintain over 35,000 troops \non the island, which forms the bedrock of the continuing political \nimpasse.\n  The phrase ``35,000 Turkish troops'' may sound familiar, because this \nis the number of troops Turkey has used, with tragic sameness, in its \ninvasion last month of U.N.-protected Kurdish areas of northern Iraq. \nFor the benefit of the Kurdish people of Iraq, who have been subject to \ngenocidal attacks by their own government, I only hope that they will \nnot suffer the same fate as the people of Cyprus. On Cyprus, Turkey \ninitially pledged to stay only for a brief time to protect the Turkish-\nCypriot minority on Cyprus. Now, we are beginning the third decade of \nTurkish occupation.\n  In an effort to transform this paradigm of deadlock, last year \nCypriot President Glafcos Clerides offered to totally demilitarize the \nisland of Cyprus in the context of a Turkish military withdrawal and \npolitical agreement to reunify the country. The Government of Cyprus, \nthen, has volunteered to entirely disband its military forces, giving \nup this fundamental sovereign attribute for the purpose of peace.\n  The need to transform the terms of the debate over Cyprus is self \nevident for all who choose to see. I was first elected to the House in \n1978, 4 years after the Turkish invasion. That was the same year that \nPresident Carter succeeded in getting the United States arms embargo on \nTurkey lifted on the promise of an imminent breakthrough on ending the \ntragic and illegal division of the island.\n  Every year I have been in Congress I have noted a sad, cynical \nprocess unfold. Each year, there are hints of movement and glimmering \nhopes of ending the Turkish occupation and reuniting Cyprus. The most \nrecent opportunity has been the U.N.-sponsored talks over ``Confidence \nBuilding Measures,'' which would certainly be constructive if the talks \nhad been undertaken in good faith by all sides and if they could set \nthe stage for moving rapidly toward a final resolution of the dispute. \nBut neither has been the case, so the talks ultimately atrophied into \nendless discussions and disagreements over the same kind of modest \nhalf-measures that have been the subject of endless talk ever since \n1974.\n  Mr. President, we must continue to press for a negotiated settlement \nto the illegal division of Cyprus, and we must neither accept nor \nbecome comfortable with the status quo. This resolution is moderate in \ntone, and refrains from laying blame on any party. I believe that all \nparties can and must take a new look at the problem of Cyprus and work \nin good faith to bring this tragedy to an end. But as this resolution \nmakes clear, our Nation must also be prepared to work alone or through \nthe Security Council to ensure that all parties also understand that a \ncontinued impasse on Cyprus will not be tolerated.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/26/senate-section/article/S5729-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5730-S5732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n           THE COMMONSENSE LEGAL STANDARDS REFORM ACT OF 1995\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n              ABRAHAM (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENTS NOS. 600-601\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. McConnell, and Mr. Kyl) submitted two \namendments intended to be proposed by them to amendment No. 596 \nproposed by Mr. Gorton to the bill (H.R. 956) to establish legal \nstandards and procedures for product liability litigation, and for \nother purposes; as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 600\n\n       Strike out section 109 and insert in lieu thereof the \n     following new section:\n\n     SEC. 109.

Mr. President, on January 12 of this year, the \nIndonesian military tortured and murdered six unarmed civilians in \nLiquisa, near Dili, in East Timor.\n  The Indonesian Army Chief of Staff, while reportedly admitting \n``procedural violations,'' claimed the victims were supporters of the \nguerrillas. However, the National Human Rights Commission of Indonesia, \nwhich released a scathing report on March 2, accused the military of \n``unlawful'' killings of innocent civilians.\n  As anyone who follows events in East Timor knows, the Liquisa \nshootings were not an isolated incident. They were part of a pattern of \npolitical violence on the island in which Indonesian troops have been \nimplicated for decades.\n  However, the fact that the National Human Rights Commission published \nsuch a conscientious report is encouraging. The Indonesian Government \nnow has two choices.\n  One choice is to repeat its mistakes after the November 1991 Dili \nmassacre. Many here will recall how back then, the unarmed \ndemonstrators were sentenced to long prison terms, while a handful of \nlower ranking soldiers who fired the deadly shots went to jail for a \nfew months and the officers who gave the orders and tried to cover up \nthe crime went scot free.\n  The other choice is to take responsibility, and use this opportunity \nto punish severely all those implicated in these crimes, and by doing \nso deter others from committing such atrocities in the future. Only \nwhen the impunity ends will the abuse of human rights end.\n  Let us hope that the Indonesian Government seizes this opportunity to \ndemonstrate that no one is above the law, because it is long overdue in \na country that seeks to be accepted as a respectable world \npower.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/26/senate-section/article/S5732-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5732-S5733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO RAYMOND J. LANDRY\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to one of New \nHampshire's finest law enforcement officials, Raymond J. Landry, chief \nof police of the city of Nashua, on the occasion of his retirement on \nMay 1, 1995.\n  As a veteran of the U.S. Navy, I am particularly proud of the \ndistinguished professional accomplishments of Chief Landry, who is a \nNavy man himself.\n  A Nashua native, Chief Landry has held progressively more responsible \npositions within the Nashua Police Department since he first joined it \nin 1964. After serving as a front line police officer for 7 years, \nChief Landry was promoted to sergeant in 1971.\n  Less than 2 years later, in 1973, Chief Landry became a lieutenant. \nFive years after that, in 1978, Chief Landry was promoted to captain. \nby 1984, he was named major. Finally, Mr. Landry attained his current \nhigh rank as chief of police of the city of Nashua in 1988.\n  By any measure, Chief Landry has had a most impressive career in the \nlaw enforcement field. Throughout his career, he has demonstrated the \ninitiative, dedication, and foresight to gain the best available \ntraining to serve the citizens of Nashua. A graduate of the Federal \nBureau of Investigation [FBI] National Academy, Chief Landry also is an \nalumnus of the Command Training Institute and the Advanced Management \nPractices Program of Babson College. Finally, Mr. President, Chief \nLandry is a graduate of the Police Executive Development Program of the \nPennsylvania State University.\n  Beyond his first-class training and professional development efforts, \nChief Landry has been active in numerous leadership organizations in \nthe law enforcement field. He is a member of the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, the New England State Police \nInformation Network, the New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police, \nthe New England Association of Chiefs of Police, and the Hillsborough \nCounty Chiefs Association. In addition, Chief Landry serves on the \nexecutive board of the drug task force of the office of the attorney \ngeneral of New Hampshire.\n  Mr. President, I understand that there will be a surprise gathering \nof upwards of 700 people in Nashua on May 5 to honor Chief Raymond \nLandry as he retires. Law enforcement officials from throughout New \nHampshire, as well as State and local dignitaries, will be in \nattendance.\n  Mr. President, our Nation's police officers richly deserve the \nrespect in which they are held by our citizens. They serve quietly and \neffectively, protecting the public and keeping the \n[[Page S5733]] peace. All to often, they risk their lives in the line \nof duty. Having risen to the very top of his profession, Chief Landry \ncan take a great measure of pride in his accomplishments and the \nadmiration in which his colleagues and his constituents in Nashua and \nthroughout New Hampshire hold him.\n  So, Mr. President, I salute Chief Raymond Landry. I will be with him \nand his friends in spirit as they celebrate his magnificent career on \nMay 5. May God bless him and grant him a long, happy, and healthy \nretirement.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/26/senate-section/article/S5732-3", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    SOCIAL SECURITY--FAMILY SECURITY\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the real \ncontract with America. This contract was not written last summer, and \nit was not designed to last 100 days. It was written 60 years ago and \nwas designed to last indefinitely. Mr. President, I am referring to \nSocial Security, our primary contract with the American family.\n  There has been a lot of talk recently about Social Security, much of \nit negative. There are many misconceptions about what Social Security \nstands for, what it does, and how it works. Today, I want to set the \nrecord straight.\n  Social Security is a sacred compact between the U.S. Government and \nthe American people. It is a system that gives help to people who \npractice self-help. Since it was created by President Roosevelt during \nthe New Deal, it has provided financial security, and most importantly, \nfamily security for millions of Americans. There are so many problems \nin our Nation today that are robbing our families of their security. \nCrime, violence, drugs and divorce are some of the biggest fears that \nAmerican families face. I do not want to add Social Security to that \nlist of fears.\n  Social Security is family security. If any of my colleagues doubt \nthat, consider this fact: Twenty-four million Americans rely on Social \nSecurity to provide more than half their income. Almost 5\\1/2\\ million \nAmericans rely on Social Security as their only source of income. To \nall those millions of Americans, Social Security means the ability to \nput food on the table, to support their families, and to live \nindependently.\n  Let me address some other misconceptions about Social Security. It is \nnot the cause of our budget deficit. It has never added one penny to \nour deficit or our national debt. It is an independent, self-financed, \nand dedicated fund. Social Security is not welfare either. Today's \nretirees paid into the system and have earned a secure retirement, not \na handout.\n  I will not rob American families of their secure retirement. I will \nnot vote to cut benefits and I will not support legislation that \nthreatens the Social Security trust fund. Throughout my career, I have \nvoted to defend Social Security. I have defended cost of living \nadjustments, which protect against the erosion of benefits by \ninflation. I have opposed a reduction in the Social Security tax, which \nwould jeopardize the trust fund. I supported making Social Security an \nindependent agency, which will ensure that it is run efficiently and \nsmoothly. Finally, I voted to exempt Social Security from the balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution.\n  If we do not exempt Social Security from a balanced budget amendment, \nthe trust fund will be in jeopardy. Right now there is a surplus in the \ntrust fund. In other words, there is more money being paid into the \nsystem by working people than there is being paid out to retirees. By \nlaw, this surplus can only be used to pay benefits, the administrative \ncosts of Social Security, and to buy Government securities. These \nGovernment securities become part of the trust fund and earn interest, \njust like Government bonds that we might purchase as an investment. I \nstrongly believe that without it being exempted, this surplus will be \nraided by politicians in the name of deficit reduction. This would \nresult in emptying the trust fund of the current Government securities, \nwhich must be paid back to Social Security. Make no mistake, this means \ncuts. It means going back on promises we made. It means saying no to \npeople who have spent a lifetime playing by the rules and contributing \nto the success of this country. It means that the Government cannot \nhold up its end of the primary contract with American families. And it \nmeans robbing families of their security.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle said, ``Don't worry. We \nwon't touch Social Security. We want to protect it just like you do.'' \nYet they were not willing to write a protection into the constitutional \namendment. I know I will not vote to raid the trust fund, and it may be \ntrue that my friends on the other side of the aisle won't either. But I \ncannot speak for members of a future Congress, and I don't believe they \ncan either. This is the danger that we faced during the balanced budget \namendment debate. I am happy to say that it is a danger that we have \ntemporarily avoided.\n  I am a middle-class Senator. I have spent my career helping those who \nare not in the middle class get there, and making sure that those who \nare in the middle class have the security to stay there. Social \nSecurity is the linchpin that holds the majority of our retired \ncitizens in the middle class. Promises made must be promises kept. I \nwill continue to fight for the promise of family security that \nAmerica's retirees have earned.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/26/senate-section/article/S5733-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO CENTRAL FALLS (RI) JR./SR.

Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few \nmoments about product liability reform. The bill the Senate is now \nconsidering, the Product Liability Fairness Act of 1995, would \nestablish national standard to be applied by State and Federal courts \nin product liability lawsuits. Let me say at the outset that I do \nbelieve some national product liability standards are needed, for \nreasons I will outline below.\n  This consept--the concept of Federal product liability standards--is \nnot entirely new to Congress; one version or another of the legislation \nhas been pending before this body for the past 15 years. In past years \nthe majority of the product liability debate has focused on whether the \nFederal Government should get involved in this area, rather than on \nwhat the Federal standards should be. This focus has, in my opinion, \nbeen unfortunate.\n  I believe the Senate must begin to focus on the issue of what \nstandards should apply to product liability cases. Indeed, I stood on \nthe Senate floor after the product liability bill failed last year, \nstating my intention not to filibuster this bill again, and stating my \ndesire to debate what alterations the Federal Government should make in \nthe area of product liability law.\n  That is not to imply that determining Federal product liability \nstandards will be easy. It is often said when considering difficult \nlegislation that ``The devil is in the details.'' This is one vote \nwhere the details really do matter. Any bill passed by the Senate must \nbe fair not only to the manufacturers who place products on the market; \nit must also be fair to the workers who help build those products, and \nto the consumers who purchase them.\n  The nature of the American marketplace has changed; commerce is no \nlonger local, but is national and international in scope. American \nmanufacturers ship their goods throughout the 50 States and beyond; \nthis is true not only of our biggest companies, like Motorola, but of \nsmall businesses like Rockwell Graphic Systems in Westmont, IL, or Oxy \nDry Corp. in Itasca, IL.\n  Given the increasingly global nature of the marketplace, I believe it \nmakes sense to have some basic, national \n[[Page S5735]] product liability standards that apply across the board. \nIn the absence of uniform standards, companies find themselves being \nsued in one State for conduct that would not be actionable in another. \nIn States without a statute of repose, for example, companies are \nforced to defend lawsuits for products that are 50 or 60 years old, \nwhile other States limit the right to sue on those products after 15 or \n20 years. In States with vicarious liability statutes, companies that \nrent or lease products may find themselves sued for actions over which \nthey had no control--while in States without vicarious liability, such \nsuits cannot go forward.\n  Holding manufacturers accountable to 50 different standards in 50 \ndifferent States may have been justified when products were shipped \ndown the street to be sold in the corner grocery store; it does not \nmake\n sense when products are shipped for sale throughout the 50 States. The \nConstitution of the United States, in article 1, section 8, grants \nCongress the power to regulate interstate commerce. Enactment of \nproduct liability legislation is nothing more than a valid and \nnecessary exercise of this constitutional power.\n\n  Nor does establishing different standards in different States benefit \nconsumers. There is no reason why a consmer in Massachusetts or Arizona \nshould have greater or lesser rights than a consumer in Illinois. All \nconsumers should have the same ability to access the courts. The bill \nintroduced by Senators Rockefeller and Gorton is not perfect in this \nregard, as I will discuss. But it is a good beginning, and it does, at \nlong last, allow the U.S. Senate to address the product liability \nissue. I would like at this time to congratulate Senator Rockefeller, \nwho recognized years ago that product liability was an issue the U.S. \nSenate had to address. He has worked tirelessly to craft legislation \nthat strikes an appropriate balance between preserving access to the \ncourts on the one hand, and providing a measure of certainty and \npredictability to manufacturers on the other. We owe him a debt of \ngratitude.\n  Mr. President, I know that Senators on both sides of this issue point \nto numerous studies which purport to prove their support or opposition \nto this legislation. Supporters of the bill cite studies which conclude \nthat product liability reform will spur job creation. Opponents of the \nbill, conversely, cite studies which conclude that product liability \nreform will have no effect on job creation. Supporters of the bill cite \nstudies to show that product liability reform will result in lower \nprices to consumers, while opponents cite studies that show the bill \nwill have no effect on consumer prices. I have considered all these \nstudies, and I do not believe that the benefits of product liability \nreform can be proven with studies or statistics.\n  That is not to say, however, that this bill will not make a \ndifference. Based on countless conversations members of my staff and I \nhave had with Illinois manufacturers, with Illinois small business men \nand women, and with major Illinois corporations, I am convinced that \nthe bill being debated by the Senate will help give employers a level \nof certainty, a level of predictability, and will create jobs. As one \nexample, consider the statute of repose. I have talked to manufacturers \nwho have been sued in the 1980's for products their company \nmanufactured in the 1920's. The fact that a manufacturer can be sued in \n1995 for a piece of machinery that was manufactured 50, 75, even 100 \nyears ago, creates a substantial disincentive for manufacturers to \ncreate quality products that will stand the test of time. If American \nmanufacturers do not create quality products, American workers don't \nwork. The U.S. Senate should not be perpetuating a system that acts as \na disincentive to the manufacturing of quality products; the statue of \nrepose in S. 565 will help ensure that we do not.\n  In addition, I think it is important to keep in mind that no \nindividual has just one\n role in this debate, Consumers are not just consumers, they are also \nworkers whose ability to find a job may hinge on how many products are \nmanufactured in this country. They are also small business men and \nwomen, whose ability to keep their firms afloat and meet their payroll \nmay hinge on the amount of money they have to spend on product \nliability insurance. They are retirees, whose pensions are dependent on \nthe solvency of their former employers.\n\n  That being said, it is also true that establishing Federal standards \nfor tort liability represents a fundamental change in the structure of \nthe product liability system, one that Congress must consider very \ncarefully. I am pleased that our focus today is not limited to whether \nthe Federal Government should be involved in product liability reform; \ninstead, we are finally addressing what standards are necessary and \nappropriate to apply in product liability actions. Those standards \nmust, however, be evaluated carefully. The Federal Government must \nstrike an appropriate balance between the right of consumers to access \nthe courts for legitimate lawsuits, and the need for employers and \nmanufacturers to have some predictability about the standards by which \ntheir products will be judged. The Federal Government must strike a \nbalance that prevents manufacturers from placing dangerous products on \nthe market, but that also encourages manufacturers to develop new \nproducts that could save lives. This is not an all-or-nothing debate. \nWe can craft a bill that is fair to everyone.\n  Mr. President, much of the debate that has swirled around S. 565 has \nfocused on provisions that are not included in the Senate bill, but \nwere instead passed by the House of Representatives. As you know, the \nHouse recently passed a series of bills designed to reform the civil \njustice system. A number of Senators have taken to the floor to \ncriticize provisions in the House legislation that are grossly unfair \nto consumers, and would limit the right of ordinary Americans to access \nthe courts. I too would like to address those provisions at this time, \nin the hopes that the U.S. Senate will reject them; if it does not, I \nwill be forced to vote against a product liability bill that I want to \nsupport.\n  First and foremost, I cannot support legislation that imposes any \nform of a loser pays, or English rule system in the U.S. courts. I \nfirmly believe that loser pays provisions run counter to the most \nfundamental notion of American jurisprudence, namely, that our courts \nserve all our citizens, not merely the rich and powerful. Loser pays \nprovisions seriously undermine our efforts to open the courts to all \nAmericans, regardless of income level. Instead, loser pays guarantees a \nsystem of justice where the most important factor is wealth. I cannot \nthink of anything more un-American than charging an entry fee at the \ncourthouse door. For that is what loser pays provisions do--if they are \nenacted, access to the courts will be determined not by who is right \nand who is wrong, but will be determined by how much an individual \nmakes. Americans can and should be proud of the fact that, under the \nAmerican legal system, all individuals have access to\n the courts. In America, the poorest worker who has been wronged by the \nrichest corporation can go to court, can prove the corporation was \nwrong, and can get justice. But if the English rule is adopted, that \nsituation will change. Even those individuals with meritorious claims \ncannot afford the risk of paying not only their own legal fees, but \nthose of the defendant as well. As a result, only those with enough \nfinancial security to risk paying for their own legal fees and those of \nthe defendant--a very small segment of the population indeed--would \nhave the ``luxury'' of pursuing their claim in court.\n\n  I know some have claimed that the loser pays system passed by the \nHouse of Representatives is actually very moderate. Under the House-\npassed bill, plaintiffs in Federal court who reject a settlement offer, \nand then receive a lower award at trial, would be required to bear the \nopposing sides legal fees from the time of the settlement offer. \nSupporters of this provision--what they refer to as a ``modified'' \nEnglish rule--maintain such fee shifting is necessary to deter \nfrivolous lawsuits. In reality, such an amendment would have a much \nmore detrimental effect. The amendment would also deter meritorious \nlawsuits by requiring a party prevailing on the merits to pay the \nlosing side's attorney fees. Think about that for a minute. Under the \nbill passed by the House, a party who wins in court, who proves that \nthe defendant \n[[Page S5736]] manufactured a dangerous product, engaged in employment \ndiscrimination, or was guilty of medical malpractice, could still be \nforced to pay the other side's legal fees. I believe it is bad public \npolicy to allow wrongdoers to escape paying their own legal bills when \nthey are proved on the merits in a court of law to be at fault.\n  I do not disagree that Congress should encourage parties to settle \ntheir claims. Certainly all Americans, including victims of unsafe \nproducts or medical malpractice, prefer a quick and certain resolution \nof their claims. That is why plaintiffs will, in all likelihood, accept \nsettlements offers if they are just and reasonable. There is no need to \nimpose draconian measures that greatly infringe on the ability of all \nindividuals to access the courts. I cannot think of anything in the \nhistory of American jurisprudence that would support the enactment of \nsuch a provision, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to reject this \napproach.\n  Nor do I support efforts to place arbitrary caps on noneconomic \ndamages. The fact that noneconomic damages are difficult to precisely \nvalue does not mean that the losses in those areas are not real. \nNoneconomic damages compensate individuals for the things that they \nvalue most, the ability to have children, the ability to have your \nspouse or child alive to share in your life, the ability to look in the \nmirror without seeing a permanently disfigured face. If a company acts \nin a manner that robs people of these precious gifts, we should ensure \nthat the injured party can recover fully for their loss through the \njury system. We should not limit the ability to recover with an \narbitrary cap.\n  In addition, I will oppose attempts to broaden this bill beyond the \narea of product liability. I know that a number of Senators have \nbroader ``civil justice reform'' amendments, that would extend the \nprovisions of this bill to every civil litigation claim filed in State \ncourt, or medical malpractice amendments. As I mentioned above, my \nsupport for product liability reform is based both on the \nconstitutional power given Congress to regulate interstate commerce, \nand the need that has been demonstrated--after many years of study--for \na uniform approach in the product liability area. The debate on civil \njustice reform and medical malpractice should be left for another day.\n  This is particularly true considering the wide-ranging implications \nthat a number of proposed amendments would have on the enforcement of \nour Nation's civil rights and antidiscrimination laws. Enacting the \nbroader ``civil justice reform'' bills that have been proposed could \ncause title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, or the reconstruction-era civil rights legislation to \nbecome ``toothless tigers.'' We must not stand by and let Congress \nrepeal our Nation's civil rights protections under the guise of civil \njustice reform.\n  Finally, I would like to express my continued opposition to the FDA \nexcuse, a provision that Senator Dorgan and I worked to remove last \nyear. I am pleased that Senator Rockefeller and Gorton did not include \nthe FDA excuse in this year's bill.\n  Mr. President, as I stated at the outset, I do not oppose some \nproduct liability reform at the Federal level. Indeed, I am pleased to \nsee Congress debating the\n standards that should apply in the product liability area, and I hope \nto work with Senators Rockefeller and Gorton to craft moderate, \nbipartisan legislation. I believe the Product Liability Fairness Act \nthat was reported out of the Commerce Committee strikes a reasonable \nbalance between the need to preserve access to the courts, and the need \nto curb frivolous lawsuits.\n\n  That is not to say I believe this bill is perfect. I have a number of \nconcerns with the legislation as currently drafted, concerns that I \nhave raised with Senator Rockefeller, and concerns that my staff has \nmade clear to Senator Rockefeller and Senator Gorton's staff. In the \nfirst instance, I would like to see the punitive damage provisions \naltered to accord equal treatment to noneconomic damages. Under S. 565 \nas currently drafted, punitive damages are limited to $250,000 or three \ntimes economic damages, whichever is greater. By excluding noneconomic \ndamages from this calculation, the bill shortchanges the women who do \nnot work outside the home, children, the elderly, and others who may \nnot have large amounts of economic damages. While I support the notion \nof making punitive damages proportionate to the harm cased by the \nproduct--the goal that the punitive damage limitation is intended to \naccomplish--that harm should not be limited to out of pocket costs or \nlost wages. Noneconomic damages can often be difficult to calculate, \nbut that does not make them any less real. As a notion of fundamental \nfairness, any congressional attempts to create a punitive damage \nstandard should include both economic and noneconomic damages in its \nformula.\n  Nor do I feel the bill as currently drafted strikes the proper \nbalance in the area of creating ``National, uniform standards,'' it \nwill not completely level the playing field in all 50 States. If \nanything, I wish the current bill went farther in pre-empting State law \nin the product liability area. National standards should be just that; \nstandards that apply in all 50 States. For example, if the Federal \nGovernment wishes to establish a 20-year statute of repose, that should \nbe the statute of repose, States should not be allowed to establish a \nlower statute that will prevent consumers from suing after only 12 or \n15 years. Again, I have raised this concern with Senator Rockefeller, \nand I will continue to raise it in the coming days.\n  Yet while S. 565 is not perfect, it represents a good start. If this \nbill remains substantially the same, I intend to vote for cloture, as I \nstated very clearly on the floor of the Senate last year. It is not \nappropriate for the Senate to continue to filibuster an issue that \nclearly needs to be addressed. The current system is too slow. The \ntransaction costs are too high. Given that our markets are now national \nand global in scope, Congress, which has authority over interstate \ncommerce, has a responsibility to examine this problem.\n  The issue of product liability reform has been before the Senate for \nwell over a decade now. I believe that everyone who is interested in \nour Civil Justice System should have come to the table and worked with \nthe Commerce Committee, with Senators Rockefeller and Gorton to address \nand resolve the underlying issues. If you do not feel this bill is the \nright one, submit a counterproposal. If you feel there are still \nchanges that need to be made, put them forward.\n  But to simply refuse to even discuss the issue is, in my opinion, \nirresponsible. It is gridlock. It is not in the best interest of \nconsumers, it is not in the interests of business men and women, it is \nnot in the interests of employees, and it is not in the interest of our \ncountry.\n  I do want to caution, however, that my commitment to vote for cloture \nis limited to the bill as reported by the Senate Commerce Committee. I \ndo not think that I am alone in that respect; indeed, I believe that \nthe prospects of enacting a product liability bill will be vastly \nimproved if the Senate rejects amendments to broaden the bill beyond \nits current scope, or to add the dangerous, anticonsumer provisions in \nthe House legislation. If cloture is not able to be invoked, there will \nbe many who will try to blame the democrats. In truth, however, if this \nbill does not clear the Senate, it will be because the majority on the \nother side of the aisle was more interested in making a political point \nthan in making a law. It will be because they failed to keep the bill \nnarrow enough and fair enough to command the supermajority necessary to \nmove this bill to final passage.\n  So, Mr. President, in conclusion I would just say I hope in the \nensuing weeks we will be able to debate, and I am sure we will debate \nin detail, the particular provisions of S. 565. But at this point, \nbased on the legislation before us, I am prepared to support a vote for \ncloture so we can actually get on the legislation and get beyond \nfilibuster. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/26/senate-section/article/S5734-5", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5736-S5737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, APRIL 27, 1995\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.
