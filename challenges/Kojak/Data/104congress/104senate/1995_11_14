Mr. President, we will have morning business until the hour \nof 12:30 today, and then we will recess from 12:30 to 2:15 for the \nweekly policy conferences.\n  At 2:15, we will begin 2 hours of debate on the conference report to \naccompany S. 395, the Alaska Power Administration bill. There will be a \nrollcall vote on that conference report, and at that time we may be \nable to announce additional items to take up. If not, we will stand in \nrecess subject to the call of the Chair, in hopes that we can work out \nsome agreement on a continuing resolution.\n  I might say, at this very moment, there is a meeting in Senator \nDomenici's office with a number of representatives of the President and \nthe chairman of the House Budget Committee, Congressman Kasich, \nCongressman Sabo, Senator Exon, and Senator Domenici. We will see what \nhappens or what the results of that meeting may be.\n  Hopefully, we can come to some resolution so that we can pass a \ncontinuing resolution and end what has been described as a shutdown of \nGovernment. I think, on the other hand, we should keep in mind that, as \npointed out today in the Washington Post, the issue here is not \nMedicare, Medicaid, welfare reform, the issue is a balanced budget--\nbalanced budget. That is what this confrontation and conflict is all \nabout.\n  Will we balance the budget by the year 2002? Will we keep our word to \nthe American people? Will we get sidetracked with all these little \nsideshows going on about Medicare part B, not an issue.\n  Keep in mind, the taxpayers are picking up the 68.5 percent of \neverybody's premium--the people working in the kitchens, working \neverywhere, are putting money in the general revenues to pay part B \nMedicare premiums for people who have $100,000 a year income, or $1 \nmillion, and the President is trying to defend that. It is very hard to \ndefend.\n  So it is not about Medicare. Medicare is a very sensitive word. We \nwant to strengthen Medicare and preserve it. But this debate and this \nconflict between the White House and the Congress is about a balanced \nbudget amendment, and about whether or not we will keep our word to the \nAmerican people to balance the budget by the year 2002.\n  All the rhetoric, and everything else that has been spoken about on \nthe Senate floor, may resonate well with some people. But most \nAmericans are worried about the future. They are worried about their \nchildren's children. They are worried about what future they will have, \nand they know that unless this Congress--all of us--are willing to make \ntough decisions and balance the budget, we can talk back and forth \nabout all these words that frighten people and all the rhetoric, and we \ncan call people terrorists or refer to Republican leaders as guilty of \nterrorism and extremism and all these things. That is not going to \nchange a thing. Right now, we are doing the heavy lifting on this side \nof the aisle. It is easy when you do nothing but criticize. We are \ntrying to balance the budget. We are going to get it done, and I am \nvery optimistic.\n  I believe the American people see this happening, and we hope to pass \nthe balanced budget act of 1995 either late Thursday night or early \nFriday morning of this week--this week. We will send it to the \nPresident, and he will make a choice.\n  Hopefully, he will sign it, because in that reconciliation package, \ncalled a Balanced Budget Act of 1995, will be a long-term extension of \nthe debt ceiling. \n\n[[Page S 17010]]\n We will also take care of the continuing resolution problem.\n  I am optimistic. I hope if we work on this in a bipartisan, \nnonpartisan way today, we can come together with some agreement.\n  We left the White House last night and we agreed we would be very \npositive in our statements to the media. I must say some of us were and \nsome of us were not. I was a little disappointed in comments from some \nof my Democratic colleagues after we said, very honestly, we had a very \ncandid meeting, we had a very candid discussion and were trying to work \nsomething out.\n  We have made some progress, and I think we have. We will see what \nhappens after the meeting with Chief of Staff Panetta, Senator \nDomenici, and others, and hopefully we will be able to announce to our \ncolleagues sometime tonight or sometime this afternoon or late evening \nthat we have reached some agreement and we can pass a temporary \ncontinuing resolution.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the call of the \nquorum be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, let me share the sentiments offered by the \nmajority leader moments ago that both sides get together early today \nand resolve this issue.\n  Let me also disagree on one statement. This is not about whether \nthere should be a balanced budget. Of course there should be a balanced \nbudget. I think all Members of the Senate agree there should be a \nbalanced budget and a plan to bring the fiscal policies in this country \ninto balance.\n  The question is, how? How do we do that? Where do we make cuts? Who \nbears the brunt of those cuts? Who bears the brunt of the sacrifice?\n  I will read from an editorial written by David Gergen, who served \nboth the Republican and Democratic Presidents. He said, in giving the \nRepublicans credit for pushing for a balanced budget:\n\n       But in their eagerness to satisfy one principle, fiscal \n     responsibility, the Republicans would ask the country to \n     abandon another, equally vital, principle--fair play. This is \n     a false, cruel choice we should not make.\n       When George Bush and then Bill Clinton achieved large \n     deficit reductions, we pursued the idea of ``shared \n     sacrifice.'' Not this time. Instead, Congress now seems \n     intent on imposing new burdens upon the poor, the elderly, \n     and vulnerable children while, incredibly, delivering a \n     windfall for the wealthy.\n\n  That is what this issue is about, not whether the budget should be \nbalanced. Of course it should. It is how it is balanced and whether \nthere is fair play involved.\n\n  I want to make one additional point. We come to a shutdown not by \naccident, in my judgment. Let me read some quotes. We have heard boasts \nin this town about shutdowns for some months. April 3, this year, Newt \nGingrich, Speaker Gingrich, vowed to ``create a titanic legislative \nstandoff with President Clinton by adding vetoed bills to must-pass \nlegislation increasing the national debt ceiling.''\n  April 3, Speaker Gingrich boasted the President will ``veto a number \nof things, and we'll put them all on the debt ceiling. And then he'll \ndecide how big a crisis he wants.''\n  June 3, Speaker Gingrich:\n\n       We're going to go over the liberal Democratic part of the \n     Government and then we will say to them: We could last 60 \n     days, 90 days, 120 days, 5 years, a century. There's a lot of \n     stuff we don't care if it is ever funded.\n\n  June 5, Speaker Gingrich, speaking about the President:\n\n       He can run the parts of the government that are left [after \n     the Republican budget cuts] or he can run no government. \n     Which of the two of us do you think worries more about not \n     showing up?\n\n  September 22, Speaker Gingrich:\n\n       I don't care what the price is. I don't care if we have no \n     executive offices and no bonds for 30 days--not this time.\n\n  Investor's Business Daily, November 8, Gingrich said he would force \nGovernment to ``miss interest and principal payment for the first time \never to force Democrat Clinton's administration to agree to his deficit \nreduction.'' Budget Chairman John Kasich said:\n\n       We'll probably have a few train wrecks, but that's always \n     helpful in a revolution.\n\n  The point I make is we do not arrive at this issue accidentally. This \nis an issue that is planned by persons who, as David Gergen says in his \nanalysis, have decided to balance the budget by adding to the burdens \nof the children, the poor, the vulnerable in society, and incredibly, \nhe says, delivering a windfall for the wealthy.\n  Some of us think that is not the way to do business. Others \napparently think it is a perfect way for the Federal Government to \nbehave and, if it does not behave that way, they want to force the \nFederal Government to shut its doors.\n  That is not, in my judgment, a thoughtful way to do public policy. \nRather, I think, it is a thoughtless, reckless approach to public \npolicy, and I hope that sometime today in some way the leadership of \nboth parties and the President will agree to this bridge or stopgap \nlegislation to get us to December when we then clearly debate the \nlarger reconciliation package.\n\n  This is just the road on the way to the stadium. The main event, the \nmain contest in December over the big reconciliation bill is not what \nthis is about. This is the toll extracted on the road to the stadium. \nIt makes no sense to me to see the Government shut down in these \ncircumstances.\n  I read these quotes from Speaker Gingrich and others to demonstrate \nit is no accident. I am sure there are people who take great delight in \nthe fact that there is no agreement on a continuing resolution or on a \ndebt extension; they take great delight in that because they have \naccomplished what they boasted about to some months.\n  I think there is no credit for anyone in this kind of failure. I hope \nmore thoughtful voices, more responsible voices in both political \nparties today will resolve to decide to bridge this impasse and provide \na continuing resolution and a debt extension to take us into mid-\nDecember when we finally come to grips with the continuing resolution.\n  There is no disagreement among Democrats and Republicans about \nwhether this country ought to balance its budget. There is profound \ndisagreement among many of us in this country who believe you ought not \nkick kids off Head Start and take health money away from old folks so \nwe can build B-2 bombers and Star Wars.\n  There is profound disagreement about priorities, but not about goals \nof balancing the Federal budget. While we have speakers today trying to \ndebate what this debate is about, I want people of this country to \nunderstand this debate is about priorities--not destinations or goals. \nWe all want to balance the Federal budget.\n  There is a right way and a wrong way to do it. On the road to finding \nthe right way to do it, the wrong approach is to shut the Government \ndown as boasted by Speaker Gingrich and others they would do for some \nmonths. That serves no one's interest and does not accomplish any \nuseful purpose for this country, in my judgment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/14/senate-section/article/S17010-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17010-S17011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nHONORING DESMOND AND MARY ANN LEE FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO EDUCATION \n                            IN ST. LOUIS, MO\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today I rise to honor two dear friends \nof mine whose generosity and giving spirit have made a positive impact \non many throughout their home of St. Louis, MO. This week Desi and Mary \nAnn Lee were honored by the Missouri Botanical Garden as winners of the \n1995 Henry Shaw Medal, the highest honor presented by the Garden. The \nLees were honored for their generosity and service to the Botanical \nGarden by their establishment of the E. Desmond Lee and Family \neducation program. The program is designed to improve science education \nfor underserved \n\n[[Page S 17011]]\nschools in the city of St. Louis by giving teachers expanded \nopportunities for training and resources in science education. The \nprogram also increases opportunities available to students using the \nBotanical Gardens, the St. Louis Science Center, and the St. Louis Zoo \ncreating a partnership to improve science education in St. Louis. Desi \nand Mary Ann also gave the gift that allowed the Botanical Garden to \npurchase and renovate a building near the Garden to provide needed \nspace and classroom facilities for the Garden's education program.\n  The Lee's generosity toward the education programs at the Botanical \nGardens is but one of many ways that their commitment to their home of \nSt. Louis is evident. Desmond Lee graduated from the Washington \nUniversity School of Business in St. Louis in 1940 after founding the \nLee/Rowan Co. while still a student. He has served on countless boards \nof directors in the St. Louis area, including the St. Louis Science \nCenter, the St. Louis Symphony, and the St. Louis Zoo. An elder in his \nlocal Presbyterian Church, Desi Lee has also received many awards in \nthe St. Louis community for his service, including an honorary \ndoctorate of humane letters from the University of Missouri at St. \nLouis in 1995, and the 1995 A World of Difference Community Service \nAward.\n  I rise today to salute my good friends for not only their service to \nthe Missouri Botanical Garden for which they received the Henry Shaw \nMedal this week, but for their lifelong dedication to their home of St. \nLouis, where they have worked and given tirelessly to improved life for \nall who call St. Louis home.\n  I yield the floor.

Mr. President, at midnight last night, President Clinton \nthrew in the towel, so to speak, and bailed out on his constitutional \nresponsibility to keep the Federal Government in operation.\n  By vetoing legislation to extend the Federal Government's borrowing \nability, and by vetoing a continuing resolution that would have kept \nthe Federal Government funded, President Clinton set the engine on full \nthrottle and barreled the U.S. Government into the train wreck we have \nbeen hearing so much about over the last several months.\n  And it is all because he is unwilling to follow through on a promise \nto balance the budget. Despite calls from the American taxpayers for a \nlittle leadership from the Nation's Chief Executive.\n  Did you know that every day, the Washington Times prints a little \nchart illustrating exactly how much this Government owes its creditors?\n  This morning's paper, for example, shows the U.S. Government \napproximately $4.984 trillion in debt.\n  In just one 2-day period recently, the national debt increased more \nthan $2.2 billion--enough, estimated the Times, to buy a Big Mac, \nmedium french fries, and medium-sized drink for every person in the \nentire United States and Mexico.\n  Just the interest alone on a debt that massive is accumulating at the \nrate of $4 million an hour.\n  If our national debt were shared equally among all Americans, each of \nus would owe more than $19,000.\n  Every child born today in the United States of America--and that is \ngoing to be about 8,200 children--comes into this world already saddled \nwith more than $19,000 in debt.\n  That is immoral, Mr. President.\n  So the difference between Congress and the President--the difference \nin what we apparently see when we look at those staggering statistics--\nis the difference between passion and politics.\n  Congress is passionate about fulfilling our promise to balance the \nbudget and end the legacy of debt we continue to build for the coming \ngenerations. We cannot imagine what it took to build up a national debt \nof nearly $5 trillion--that is a 5 followed by 12 zeroes--and we cannot \nimagine letting it go on for another day.\n\n  That is passion.\n  The President's guiding force, meanwhile, is politics. For him to \nshut down the Government is nothing more than a political move--an \nattempt to derail all our hard work at balancing the Federal budget \nmerely to satisfy the radical liberal wing of his own party.\n  Congress wants to move forward, while President Clinton wants to stop \nthe people's agenda dead in its tracks.\n  Harry Truman used to have a sign on his desk that read: ``The Buck \nStops Here.''\n  Well, President Clinton ought to have a sign on his that says ``The \nRevolution Stops Here.'' For him, leadership is not about fulfilling \npromises or making change, or principled decisionmaking. It is all \nabout politics.\n  Mr. President, I came to the floor last Tuesday to speak about the \nbudget and the President's unwillingness to work with us, in good \nfaith, toward the goals shared by a majority of all Americans.\n  Immediately afterward, one of my good colleagues from across the \naisle responded with his own thoughts about the budget debate, and he \nchided me for making the Senate what he called ``a political arena.''\n  All I can say is that it is nearly impossible to talk about this \nPresident without somehow mentioning politics.\n  His public comments of the past week have been nothing but political \nrhetoric, and desperate rhetoric, at that. In his Saturday radio \naddress, he asked listeners to:\n\n       Imagine the Republican Congress as a banker, and the United \n     States as family that has to go to the bank for a short-term \n     loan, for a family emergency. The banker says to the family, \n     ``I will give you the loan, but only if you will throw the \n     grandparents and the kids out of the house first.''\n\n  Mr. President, my constituents in Minnesota and the rest of the \nAmerican people asked for fundamental changes last November from their \nGovernment, not empty rhetoric. But President Clinton has made the \ndecision not to climb aboard.\n  Of course, that is his choice, and none of us is apparently going to \nchange his mind.\n  But hear this--Congress will not bow out of its responsibility to \ndeliver to the people a budget that balances within 7 years, that draws \nthe line at tax increases, and in fact cuts taxes for working-class \nAmericans, that preserves and protects Medicare.\n  The question of why the President of the United States of America is \nso vehemently opposed to a balanced budget that does not increase taxes \nthat he would shut down the Federal Government and default on the \nNation's financial obligations, can only be answered by the President \nhimself.\n  And the American people are waiting for an answer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/14/senate-section/article/S17011-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17011-S17012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        WELCOMING CROATIAN-SERBIAN AGREEMENT ON EASTERN SLAVONIA\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, finally, there is good news from former \nYugoslavia. On Sunday in Croatia, Croatian leaders and rebel Serbs \nsigned an agreement ending the territorial conflict over Eastern \nSlavonia, the last part of Croatia still occupied by Serbs. As late as \nlast week, Croatian Government officials, including President Tudjman, \nwere threatening to retake the territory by force. I am pleased that \nCroatia has recognized the folly of carrying out those threats, and has \nopted instead for a diplomatic solution.\n  There are still serious questions about this agreement that need to \nbe answered. For example: Who will participate in the transitional \nadministration to be established by the United Nations to govern the \nregion? Will there be separate military and civilian administrations? \nHow does this agreement relate to the continuing negotiations on \nBosnia? What, if anything, does Serbia get in return for its agreeing \nto this accord?\n  Despite these and other questions, this much is clear: The agreement \nwill avert a military confrontation between Croatia and Serbia over \nEastern Slavonia, and together with last week's agreement on the \nFederation, offer needed momentum to the Dayton negotiations.\n  Our Ambassador to Croatia, Peter Galbraith and U.N. Envoy Thorvald \n\n[[Page S 17012]]\n  Stoltenberg deserve a great deal of credit for their work in bringing \nthe parties to and keeping them at the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/14/senate-section/article/S17011-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

The purpose of the \n     counseling period shall be: to discuss the employee's \n     concerns and elicit information regarding the matter(s) which \n     the employee believes constitute a violation(s) of the Act; \n     to advise the employee of his or her rights and \n     responsibilities under the Act and the procedures of the \n     Office under these rules; to evaluate the matter; and to \n     assist the employee in achieving an early resolution of the \n     matter, if possible.\n       (e) Confidentiality and waiver. (1) Absent a waiver under \n     paragraph 2, below, all counseling shall be strictly \n     confidential. Nothing in these rules shall prevent a \n     counselor from consulting with personnel within the Office \n     concerning a matter in counseling, except \n\n[[Page S 17014]]\n     that, when the person being counseled is an employee of the Office, the \n     counselor shall not consult with any individual within the \n     Office who might be a party or witness without the consent of \n     the person requesting counseling. Nothing contained in these \n     rules shall prevent the Executive Director from reporting \n     statistical information to the Senate and House of \n     Representatives, so long as that statistical information does \n     not reveal the identity of the employees involved or of \n     employing offices that are the subject of a request for \n     counseling.\n       (2) The employee and Office may agree to waive \n     confidentiality of the counseling process for the limited \n     purpose of contacting the employing office to obtain \n     information to be used in counseling the employee or to \n     attempt a resolution of any disputed matter(s). Such a \n     limited waiver must be written on the form supplied by the \n     Office and signed by both the counselor and the employee.\n       (f) Role of Counselor in informing employee of his or her \n     rights and responsibilities.

If the employee executes such a waiver, the \n     counselor may:\n       (1) conduct a limited inquiry for the purpose of obtaining \n     any information necessary to attempt an informal resolution \n     or formal settlement;\n       (2) reduce to writing any formal settlement achieved and \n     secure the signatures of the employee, his or her \n     representative, if any, and a member of the employing office \n     who is authorized to enter into a settlement on the employing \n     office's behalf; and, pursuant to Section 414 of the Act and \n     Section 9.03 of these rules, seek the approval of the \n     Executive Director.\n       (i) Counselor not a representative. The counselor shall \n     inform the person being counseled that the counselor does not \n     represent either the employing office or the employee. The \n     counselor provides information and may act as a third-party \n     intermediary with the goals of increasing the individual's \n     understanding of his or her rights and responsibilities under \n     the Act and of promoting the early resolution of the matter.\n       (j) Duration of counseling period. The period for \n     counseling shall be 30 days, beginning on the date that the \n     request for counseling is received by the Office unless the \n     employee and the Office agree to reduce the period.\n       (k) Duty to proceed. An employee who initiates a proceeding \n     under this part shall be responsible at all times for \n     proceeding, regardless of whether he or she has designated a \n     representative. An employee, however, may withdraw from \n     counseling at any time without prejudice to the employee's \n     right to reinstate counseling regarding the same matter, \n     provided that counseling on a single matter will not last \n     longer than a total of 30 days.\n       (l) Conclusion of the counseling period and notice. The \n     Executive Director shall notify the employee in writing of \n     the end of the counseling period, by certified mail, return \n     receipt requested. The Executive Director, as part of the \n     notification of the end of the counseling period, shall \n     inform the employee of the right to file with the Office a \n     request for mediation within 15 days after receipt by the \n     employee of the notice of the end of the counseling period.\n       (m) Employees of the Office of the Architect of the Capitol \n     and Capitol Police.\n       (1) Where an employee of the Office of the Architect of the \n     Capitol or of the Capitol Police requests counseling under \n     the Act and these rules, the Executive Director may recommend \n     that the employee use the grievance procedures of the \n     Architect of the Capitol or the Capitol Police. Pursuant to \n     Section 401 of the Act and by agreement with the Architect of \n     the Capitol and the Capitol Police Board, when the Executive \n     Director makes such a recommendation, the following \n     procedures shall apply:\n       (A) The Executive Director shall recommend to the employee \n     that the employee use the procedures of the Architect or of \n     the Capitol Police Board, as appropriate, for a period \n     generally up to 90 days, unless the Executive Director \n     determines a longer period is appropriate for resolution of \n     the employee's complaint through the internal procedures of \n     the Architect or the Capitol Police Board;\n       (B) After having contacted the Office and having utilized \n     the grievance procedures of the Architect or to the Capitol \n     Police Board, the employee may return to the procedures under \n     these rules:\n       (i) after the expiration of the period recommended by the \n     Executive Director, if the matter has not been resolved; or\n       (ii) within 20 days after receiving a final decision as a \n     result of the procedures of the Architect or of the Capitol \n     Police Board.\n       (C) The period during which the matter is pending in the \n     internal procedure shall not count against the time available \n     for counseling or mediation under the Act. If the grievance \n     is resolved to the employee's satisfaction, the Office will \n     consider the case to be closed in its official files.\n       (2) Notice to employees who have not initiated counseling \n     with the Office. When an employee of the Architect of the \n     Capitol or the Capitol Police raises in the internal \n     procedures of the Architect or of the Capitol Police Board an \n     allegation which may also be raised under the procedures set \n     forth in this subpart, the Architect or the Capitol Police \n     Board should advise the employee in writing that a request \n     for counseling about the allegation must be initiated with \n     the Office within 180 days after the alleged violation of law \n     occurred if the employee intends to use the procedures of the \n     Office.\n       (3) Notice in final decisions when employees have not \n     initiated counseling with the Office. When an employee raises \n     in the internal procedures of the Architect or of the Capitol \n     Police Board an allegation which may also be raised under the \n     procedures set forth in this subpart, any final decision \n     pursuant to the procedures of the Architect of the Capitol or \n     of the Capitol Police Board should include notice to the \n     employee of his or her right to initiate the procedures under \n     these rules within 180 days after the alleged violation \n     occurred.\n       (4) Notice in final decisions when there has been a \n     recommendation by the Executive Director. When the Executive \n     Director has made a recommendation under paragraph 1 above, \n     the Architect or the Capitol Police Board should include \n     notice to the employee of his or her right to resume the \n     procedures under these rules within 20 days after service on \n     the employee of the final decision and shall transmit a copy \n     of the final decision, settlement agreement, or other final \n     decision, settlement agreement, or other final disposition of \n     the case to the Executive Director.\n     Sec. 2.04  Mediation\n       (a) Explanation. Mediation is a process in which employees, \n     employing offices and their representatives meet separately \n     and/or jointly with a neutral trained to assist them in \n     resolving disputes. As parties to the mediation, employees, \n     employing offices and their representatives openly discuss \n     alternatives to continuing their dispute, including any and \n     all possibilities of reaching a voluntary, mutually \n     satisfactory resolution. The neutral has no power to impose a \n     specific resolution, and the mediation process, whether or \n     not a resolution is reached, is strictly confidential, \n     pursuant to Section 416 of the Act.\n       (b) Initiation. Not more than 15 days after receipt by the \n     employee of the notice of the conclusion of the counseling \n     period under Section 2.03(l), the employee may file with the \n     Office a written request for mediation. The request for \n     mediation shall contain the employee's name, address, and \n     telephone number, and the name of the employing office. \n     Failure to request mediation within the prescribed period \n     will preclude the employee's further pursuit of his or her \n     claim.\n       (c) Notice of commencement of the mediation period. The \n     Office shall notify the employing office or its designated \n     representative of the commencement of the mediation period.\n       (d) Selection of Neutrals; Disqualification. Upon receipt \n     of the request for mediation, the Executive Director shall \n     assign one or more neutrals to commence the mediation \n     process. In the event that a neutral considers him or herself \n     unable to perform in a neutral role in a given situation, he \n     or she shall withdraw from the matter and immediately shall \n     notify the Office of the withdrawal. Any party may ask the \n     Office to disqualify a neutral by filing a written request, \n     including the reasons for such request, with the Executive \n     Director. This request shall be filed as soon as the party \n     has reason to believe there is a basis for disqualification. \n     The Executive Director's decision on this request shall be \n     final and unreviewable.\n       (e) Duration and Extension. (1) The mediation period shall \n     be 30 days beginning on the date the request for mediation is \n     received, unless the Office grants an extension.\n       (2) The Office may extend the mediation period upon the \n     joint request of the parties. The request shall be written \n     and filed with the Office no later than the 28th day of the \n     mediation period. The request shall set forth the joint \n     nature of the request and the reasons therefor, and specify \n     when the parties expect to conclude their discussions. \n     Requests for additional extensions may be made in the same \n     manner. Approval of any extensions shall be within the sole \n     discretion of the Office.\n       (f) Procedures. (1) The Neutral's Role. After assignment of \n     the case, the neutral will promptly contact the parties. The \n     neutral has the responsibility to conduct the mediation, \n     including deciding how many meetings are necessary and who \n     may participate in each meeting. The neutral may accept \n     written submissions from the parties.\n       (2) The Agreement to Mediate. At the commencement of the \n     mediation, the neutral \n\n[[Page S 17015]]\n     will ask the parties to sign an agreement (\"the Agreement to Mediate\") \n     to adhere to the confidentiality of the process. The \n     Agreement to Mediate will also provide that the parties to \n     the mediation will not seek to have the counselor or the \n     neutral testify or otherwise present evidence in any \n     subsequent civil action under Section 408 of the Act or any \n     other proceeding.\n       (g) Who may participate. The covered employee, the \n     employing office, their respective representatives, and the \n     Office may meet, jointly or separately, with the neutral. A \n     representative of an employing office who has actual \n     authority to agree to a settlement agreement on behalf of the \n     employing office must be present at the mediation or must be \n     immediately accessible by telephone during the mediation.\n       (h) Conclusion of the Mediation Period and Notice. If, at \n     the end of the mediation period, the parties have not \n     resolved the matter that forms the basis of the request for \n     mediation, the Office shall provide the employee and the \n     employing office, and their representatives, with written \n     notice that the mediation period has concluded. At the same \n     time, the Office will notify the employee of his or her right \n     to elect to file a complaint with the Office in accordance \n     with Section 405 of the Act and Section 2.06 of these rules \n     or to file a civil action pursuant to Section 408 of the Act \n     and Section 2.11 of these rules.\n       (i) Independence of the Mediation Process and the Neutral. \n     The Office will maintain the independence of the mediation \n     process and the neutral. No individual, who is appointed by \n     the Executive Director to mediate, may conduct or aid in a \n     hearing conducted under Section 405 of the Act with respect \n     to the same matter or shall be subject to subpoena or any \n     other compulsory process with respect to the same matter.\n       (j) Confidentiality. Except as necessary to consult with \n     the parties, their counsel or other designated \n     representatives, the parties to the mediation, the neutral, \n     and the Office shall not disclose, in whole or in part, any \n     information or records obtained through, or prepared \n     specifically for, the mediation process. This rule shall not \n     preclude a neutral from consulting with the Office, except \n     that a neutral shall not consult with a party or witness \n     within the Office when the covered employee is an employee of \n     the Office. This rule shall also not preclude the Office from \n     reporting statistical information that does not reveal the \n     identity of the employees or employing offices involved in \n     the mediation. All parties to the action and their \n     representatives will be advised of the confidentiality \n     requirements of this process and of the sanctions that might \n     be imposed for violating these requirements.\n     Sec. 2.05  Election of proceeding\n       (a) Pursuant to Section 404 of the Act, not later than 90 \n     days after a covered employee receives notice of the end of \n     mediation under Section 2.04(h) of these rules, but no sooner \n     than 30 days after that date, the covered employee may \n     either:\n       File a complaint with the Office in accordance with Section \n     405 of the Act and the procedure set out in Section 2.06, \n     below; or\n       File a civil action in accordance with Section 408 of the \n     Act and Section 2.11 below in the United States District \n     Court for the district in which the employee is employed or \n     for the District of Columbia.\n       (b) A covered employee who files a civil action pursuant to \n     Section 2.11, may not thereafter file a complaint under \n     Section 2.06 on the same matter.\n     Sec. 2.06  Complaints\n       (a) Who may file. An employee who has completed mediation \n     under Section 2.04 may timely file a complaint with the \n     Office.\n       (b) When to file. A complaint may be filed no sooner than \n     30 days after the date of receipt of the notice under Section \n     2.04(h), but no later than 90 days after that notice.\n       (c) Form and Contents. A complaint shall be written or \n     typed on a complaint form available from the Office. All \n     complaints shall be signed by the covered employee, or his or \n     her representative, and shall contain the following \n     information:\n       (1) the name, mailing address, and telephone number(s) of \n     the complainant;\n       (2) the name(s) and title(s) of the individual(s) involved \n     in the action that the employee claims is a violation of the \n     Act;\n       (3) the name, address and telephone number of the employing \n     office involved;\n       (4) a description of the conduct being challenged, \n     including the date(s) of the conduct;\n       (5) a brief description of why the complainant believes the \n     challenged conduct is a violation of the Act and the \n     Section(s) of the Act involved;\n       (6) a statement of the relief or remedy sought; and\n       (7) the name, address, and telephone number of the \n     representative, if any, who will act on behalf of the \n     complainant.\n       (d) Amendments. Amendments to the complaint may be \n     permitted by the Office or, after assignment, by a Hearing \n     Officer, on the condition that all parties to the proceeding \n     have adequate notice to prepare to meet the new allegations, \n     and so long as the amendments relate to the violations for \n     which the employee has completed counseling and mediation and \n     permitting such amendments will not unduly prejudice the \n     rights of the employing office or other parties, unduly delay \n     the completion of the hearing or otherwise interfere with or \n     impede the proceedings.\n       (e) Service of Complaint. Upon receipt of a complaint or an \n     amended complaint, the Office shall serve the employing \n     office named in the complaint, or its designated \n     representative, with a copy of the complaint or amended \n     complaint and a copy of these rules. The Office shall include \n     a service list containing the names and addresses of the \n     parties and their designated representatives.\n       (f) Answer. Within 15 days after service of a copy of a \n     complaint or an amended complaint, the respondent employing \n     office shall file an answer with the Office and serve one \n     copy on the complainant. The answer shall contain a statement \n     of the position of the respondent employing office on each of \n     the issues raised in the complaint, including admissions, \n     denials, or explanations of each allegation made in the \n     complaint and any other defenses to the complaint. Failure to \n     raise a claim or defense in the answer shall not bar its \n     submission later unless to do so would unduly prejudice the \n     rights of the other party or unduly delay or otherwise \n     interfere with or impede the proceedings.\n     Sec. 2.07  Appointment of the Hearing Officer\n       Upon the filing of a complaint, the Executive Director will \n     appoint an independent Hearing Officer, who shall have the \n     authority specified in Section 7.01(b) below. The Hearing \n     Officer shall not be the neutral who mediated the matter \n     under Section 2.04 of these rules.\n     Sec. 2.08  Filing, service, and size limitations of motions, \n         briefs, responses or other documents\n       (a) Filing with the Office; Number. One original and three \n     copies of all motions, briefs, responses, or other documents, \n     must be filed, whenever required, with the Office or Hearing \n     Officer. However, when a party aggrieved by the decision of a \n     Hearing Officer files an appeal with the Board, one original \n     and seven copies of both any appeal brief and any responses \n     must be filed with the Office.\n       (b) Service. The parties shall serve on each other one copy \n     of all briefs or motions filed with the Office, other than \n     the Complaint, which the Office will serve pursuant to \n     Section 2.06(e) of these rules. Service shall be made by \n     mailing or by hand delivering a copy of the motion, brief, \n     response or other document to each party on the service list \n     previously provided by the Office. Each of these documents, \n     other than the Complaint, must be accompanied by a \n     certificate of service specifying how and when service was \n     made. It shall be the duty of all parties to notify the \n     Office and one another in writing of any changes in the names \n     or addresses on the service list.\n       (c) Time limitations for response to motions or briefs and \n     reply. Unless otherwise specified by the Hearing Officer or \n     these rules, a party shall file a response to a motion or \n     brief within 15 days of the service of the motion or brief \n     upon the party. Any reply to such response shall be filed and \n     served within 5 days of the service of the response.\n       (d) Size limitations. Except as otherwise specified by the \n     Hearing Officer or these rules, no brief, motion, response, \n     or supporting memorandum filed with the Office shall exceed \n     35 pages, or 8,750 words, exclusive of attachments. The \n     Board, the Office or Hearing Officer may waive, raise or \n     reduce this limitation for good cause shown or on its own \n     initiative. Briefs, motions, responses, and supporting \n     memoranda shall be on standard letter-size paper (8\\1/2\\'' x \n     11'').\n     Sec. 2.09  Dismissal of complaints\n       (a) A Hearing Officer may, after notice and an opportunity \n     to respond, dismiss any claim that the Hearing Officer finds \n     to be frivolous or that fails to state a claim upon which \n     relief may be granted.\n       (b) A Hearing Officer may, after notice and an opportunity \n     to respond, dismiss a complaint because it fails to comply \n     with the applicable time limits or other requirements under \n     these rules.\n       (c) If any employee fails to proceed with an action, the \n     Hearing Officer may dismiss the complaint with prejudice.\n       (d) Appeal. A dismissal by the Hearing Officer made under \n     Section 7.17 of these rules may be subject to appeal before \n     the Board if the aggrieved party files a timely petition for \n     review under Section 8.01.\n       (e) Withdrawal of Complaint by Complainant. At any time an \n     employee may withdraw his or her own complaint by filing a \n     notice with the Office for transmittal to the Hearing Officer \n     and by serving a copy on the employing office or \n     representative. Any such withdrawal must be approved by the \n     Executive Director.\n     Sec. 2.10  Confidentiality\n       Pursuant to Section 416(c) of the Act, all proceedings and \n     deliberations of Hearing Officers and the Board, including \n     any related records, shall be confidential. A violation of \n     the confidentiality requirements of the Act and these rules \n     could result in the imposition of sanctions. Nothing in these \n     rules shall prevent the Executive Director from reporting \n     statistical information to the Senate and House of \n     Representatives, so long as that statistical information does \n     not reveal the identity of the employees involved or of \n     employing offices that are the subject of a matter.\n     Sec. 2.11 Filing of civil action\n       (a) Filing. Section 4.04 of the Act provides that as an \n     alternative to filing a complaint under Section 2.06, an \n     employee who receives notice of the end of mediation pursuant \n     to Section 2.04(h) may elect to file a civil action in \n     accordance with Section 408 of the Act in the United States \n     district court for \n\n[[Page S 17016]]\n     the district in which the employee is employed or for the District of \n     Columbia.\n       (b) Time for filing. A covered employee may file such a \n     civil action no earlier than 30 days after receipt of the \n     notice under the Section 2.04(h), but no later than 90 days \n     after that receipt.\n\n    Subpart C--[Reserved (part B--Section 210--ADA Public Services)]\n\n           Subpart D--[Reserved (Part C--Section 215--OSHA)]\n\n            Subpart E--[Reserved (Part D--Section 220--LMR)]\n\n                   Subpart F--Discovery and Subpoenas\n\n     Sec. 6.01  Discovery\n     Sec. 6.02  Requests for Subpoenas\n     Sec. 6.03  Service\n     Sec. 6.04  Return of Service\n     Sec. 6.05  Motion to Quash\n     Sec. 6.06  Enforcement\n     Sec. 6.01  Discovery\n       (a) Explanation. Discovery is the process by which a party \n     may obtain relevant information, not privileged, from another \n     person, including a party, for the purpose of assisting that \n     party in developing, preparing and presenting its case at the \n     hearing.\n       (b) Office policy regarding discovery. It is the policy of \n     the Office to encourage the early and voluntary exchange of \n     relevant and material nonprivileged information between the \n     parties, including the names and addresses of witnesses and \n     copies of relevant and material documents, and to encourage \n     Hearing Officers to develop procedures which allow for the \n     greatest exchange of relevant and material information and \n     which minimize the need for parties to formally request such \n     information.\n       (c) Discovery availability. Pursuant to Section 405(e) of \n     the Act, the Hearing Officer in his or her discretion may \n     permit reasonable prehearing discovery. In exercising that \n     discretion, the Hearing Officer may be guided by the Federal \n     Rules of Civil Procedure.\n       (1) The Hearing Officer may authorize discovery by one or \n     more of the following methods: depositions upon oral \n     examination or written questions; written interrogatories; \n     production of documents or things or permission to enter upon \n     land or other property for inspection or other purposes; \n     physical and mental examinations; and requests for admission.\n       (2) The Hearing Officer may make any order setting forth \n     the forms and extent of discovery, including orders limiting \n     the number of depositions and interrogatories and requests \n     for production of documents, and may also limit the length of \n     depositions.\n       (3) The Hearing Officer may issue any other order to \n     prevent discovery or disclosure of confidential or privileged \n     materials or information, as well as hearing or trial \n     preparation materials and any other information deemed not \n     discloseable, or to protect a party or person from annoyance, \n     embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense.\n       (d) Claims of privilege. Whenever a party withholds \n     information otherwise discoverable under these rules by \n     claiming that it is privileged or confidential or subject to \n     protection as hearing or trial preparation materials, the \n     party shall make the claim expressly and shall describe the \n     nature of the documents, communications or things not \n     produced or disclosed in a manner that, without revealing the \n     information itself privileged or protected, will enable other \n     parties to assess the applicability of the privilege or \n     protection.\n     Sec. 6.02  Request for subpoena\n       (a) Authority to issue subpoenas. At the request of a \n     party, a Hearing Officer may issue subpoenas for the \n     attendance and testimony of witnesses and for the production \n     of correspondence, books, papers, documents, or other \n     records. The attendance of witnesses and the production of \n     records may be required from any place within the United \n     States.\n       (b) Request. A request for the issuance of a subpoena \n     requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the \n     production of documents or other evidence under paragraph (a) \n     above shall be submitted to the Hearing Officer at least 15 \n     days in advance of the date scheduled for the commencement of \n     the hearing. If the subpoena is sought as part of the \n     discovery process, the request shall be submitted to the \n     Hearing Officer at least 10 days in advance of the date set \n     for the attendance of the witness at a deposition or the \n     production of documents.\n       (c) Forms and showing. Requests for subpoenas shall be \n     submitted in writing to the Hearing Officer and shall specify \n     with particularity the witness, correspondence, books, \n     papers, documents, or other records desired and shall be \n     supported by a showing of general relevance and reasonable \n     scope.\n       (d) Rulings. The Hearing Officer shall promptly rule on the \n     request.\n     Sec. 6.03  Service\n       Service of a subpoena may be made by any person who is over \n     18 years of age and not a party to the proceeding. Service \n     may be made either:\n       (a) In person,\n       (b) By registered or certified mail, or express mail with \n     return receipt, or\n       (c) By delivery to a responsible person (named) at the \n     residence or place of business (as appropriate) of the person \n     to be served.\n     Sec. 6.04  Return of service\n       When service of a subpoena is effected, the person serving \n     the subpoena shall certify on the return of service the date \n     and the manner of service.\n     Sec. 6.05  Motion to quash\n       Any person against whom a subpoena is directed may file a \n     motion to quash or limit the subpoena setting forth the \n     reasons why the subpoena should not be complied with or why \n     it should be limited in scope. This motion shall be filed \n     with the Hearing Officer within 10 days after service of the \n     subpoena.\n     Sec. 6.06  Enforcement\n       (a) Objections and Requests for enforcement. If a person \n     has been served with a subpoena pursuant to Section 6.03 but \n     fails or refuses to comply with its terms or otherwise \n     objects to it, the party or person objecting or the party \n     seeking compliance may seek a ruling from the Hearing \n     Officer. The request for a ruling should be submitted in \n     writing to the Hearing Officer. However, it may be made \n     orally on the record at the hearing at the Hearing Officer's \n     discretion. The party seeking compliance shall present the \n     return of service and, except where the witness was required \n     to appear before the Hearing Officer, shall submit evidence, \n     by affidavit or declaration, of the failure or refusal to \n     obey the subpoena.\n       (b) Ruling by Hearing Officer. (1)The Hearing Officer shall \n     promptly rule on the request for enforcement and/or the \n     objection(s).\n       (2) On request of the objecting witness or any party, the \n     Hearing Officer shall, or on the Hearing Officer's own \n     initiative the Hearing Officer may, refer the ruling to the \n     Board for review.\n       (c) Review by the Board. The Board may overrule, modify, \n     remand or affirm the ruling of the Hearing Officer and in its \n     discretion, may direct the General Counsel to apply in the \n     name of the Office for an order from a United States district \n     court to enforce the subpoena.\n       (d) Application to an appropriate court; civil contempt. If \n     a person fails to comply with a subpoena, the Board may \n     direct the General Counsel to apply, in the name of the \n     Office, to an appropriate United States district court for an \n     order requiring that person to appear before the Hearing \n     Officer to give testimony or produce records. Any failure to \n     obey a lawful order of the district court may be held by such \n     court to be a civil contempt thereof.\n\n                          Subpart G--Hearings\n\n     Sec. 7.01  The Hearing Officer\n     Sec. 7.02  Sanctions\n     Sec. 7.03  Disqualification of the Hearing Officer\n     Sec. 7.04  Motions and Prehearing Conference\n     Sec. 7.05  Scheduling the Hearing\n     Sec. 7.06  Consolidation and Joinder of Cases\n     Sec. 7.07  Conduct of Hearing; disqualification of \n         representatives\n     Sec. 7.08  Transcript\n     Sec. 7.09  Admissibility of Evidence\n     Sec. 7.10  Stipulations\n     Sec. 7.11  Official Notice\n     Sec. 7.12  Confidentiality\n     Sec. 7.13  Immediate Board Review of a Ruling by a Hearing \n         Officer\n     Sec. 7.14  Briefs\n     Sec. 7.15  Closing the record\n     Sec. 7.16  Official Record\n     Sec. 7.17  Hearing Officer Decisions; Entry in Records of the \n         Office\n     Sec. 7.01  The Hearing Officer\n       (a) Exercise of authority. The Hearing Officer may exercise \n     authority as provided in paragraph (b) of this Section upon \n     his or her own initiative or upon the motion of a party, as \n     appropriate.\n       (b) Authority. Hearing Officers shall conduct fair and \n     impartial hearings and take all necessary action to avoid \n     undue delay in the disposition of all proceedings. They shall \n     have all powers necessary to that end unless otherwise \n     limited by law, including, but not limited to, the authority \n     to:\n       (1) Administer oaths and affirmations;\n       (2) Rule on motions to disqualify designated \n     representatives;\n       (3) Issue subpoenas in accordance with Section 6.02;\n       (4) Rule upon offers of proof and receive relevant \n     evidence;\n       (5) Rule upon discovery issues as appropriate under \n     Sections. 6.01 to 6.06;\n       (6) Hold prehearing conferences for the settlement and \n     simplification of issues;\n       (7) Convene a hearing as appropriate, regulate the course \n     of the hearing, and maintain decorum and exclude from the \n     hearing any person who disrupts, or threatens to disrupt, \n     that decorum;\n       (8) Exclude from the hearing any person, except any \n     complainant, any party, the attorney or representative of any \n     complainant or party, or any witness while testifying;\n       (9) Rule on all motions, witness and exhibit lists and \n     proposed findings, including motions for summary judgment;\n       (10) Require the filing of briefs, memoranda of law and the \n     presentation of oral argument with respect to any question of \n     law;\n       (11) Order the production of evidence and the appearance of \n     witnesses;\n       (12) Impose sanctions as provided under Section 7.02 of \n     these rules;\n       (13) File decisions on the issues presented at the hearing;\n       (14) Maintain the confidentiality of proceedings: and\n       (15) Waive or modify any procedural requirements of \n     Sections 6 and 7 of these rules so long as permitted by the \n     Act.\n     Sec. 7.02  Sanctions\n       The Hearing Officer may impose sanctions upon the parties, \n     under, but not limited to, the circumstances set forth in \n     this Section. \n\n[[Page S 17017]]\n\n       (a) Failure to comply with an order. When a party fails to \n     comply with an order (including an order for the taking of a \n     deposition, for the production of evidence within the party's \n     control, or for production of witnesses), the Hearing Officer \n     may:\n       (1) Draw an inference in favor of the requesting party on \n     the issue related to the information sought.\n       (2) Stay further proceedings until the order is obeyed.\n       (3) Prohibit the party failing to comply with such order \n     from introducing evidence concerning, or otherwise relying \n     upon, testimony relating to the information sought.\n       (4) Permit the requesting party to introduce secondary \n     evidence concerning the information sought.\n       (5) Strike any part of the complaint, briefs, answer, or \n     other submissions of the party failing to comply with such \n     request.\n       (6) Direct judgment against the non-complying party in \n     whole or in part.\n       (7) Order that the non-complying party, or the \n     representative advising that party, pay all or part of the \n     attorney's fees and reasonable expenses of the other party or \n     parties or of the Office, caused by the failure, unless the \n     Hearing Officer or the Board finds that the failure was \n     substantially justified or that other circumstances make an \n     award of attorney's fees and/or expenses unjust.\n       (b) Failure to prosecute or defend. If a party fails to \n     prosecute or defend a position, the Hearing Officer may \n     dismiss the action with prejudice or rule for the petitioner.\n       (c) Failure to make timely filing. The Hearing Officer may \n     refuse to consider any request, motion or other action that \n     is not filed in a timely fashion in compliance with this \n     Part.\n     Sec. 7.03  Disqualification of the Hearing Officer\n       (a) In the event that a Hearing Officer considers himself \n     or herself disqualified, either because of personal bias or \n     of an interest in the case or for some other disqualifying \n     reason, he or she shall withdraw from the case, stating in \n     writing or on the record the reasons for his or her \n     withdrawal, and shall immediately notify the Office of the \n     withdrawal.\n       (b) Any party may file a motion requesting that a Hearing \n     Officer withdraw on the basis of personal bias or of an \n     interest in the case or for some other disqualifying reason. \n     This motion shall specifically set forth the reasons \n     supporting the request and be filed as soon as the party has \n     reason to believe that there is a basis for disqualification.\n       (c) The Hearing Officer shall rule on the withdrawal \n     motion. If the motion is denied, the party requesting \n     withdrawal may take the motion to the Executive Director. The \n     motion to the Executive Director, together with a supporting \n     brief, shall be filed within 5 days of service of the denial \n     of the motion by the Hearing Officer. Upon receipt of the \n     motion, the Executive Director will determine whether a \n     response from the other party or parties is required, and if \n     so, will fix by order the time for the filing of the \n     response. Any objection to the ruling of the Executive \n     Director on the withdrawal motion shall not be deemed waived \n     by further participation in the hearing and may be the basis \n     for an appeal to the Board from the decision of the Hearing \n     Officer under Section 8.01 of these rules. Such objection \n     will not stay the conduct of the hearing.\n     Sec. 7.04  Motions and prehearing conference\n       (a) Motions. When a case is before a Hearing Officer, \n     motions of the parties shall be filed with the Hearing \n     Officer and shall be in writing except for oral motions made \n     on the record during the hearing. All written motions and any \n     responses to them shall include a proposed order, where \n     applicable. Only with the Hearing Officer's advance approval \n     may either party file additional responses to the motion or \n     to the response to the motion. Motions for extension of time \n     will be granted only for good cause shown.\n       (b) Scheduling of the Prehearing Conference. Within 7 days \n     after assignment, the Hearing Officer shall serve on the \n     employee and the employing office and their designated \n     representatives written notice setting forth the time, date, \n     and place of the prehearing conference.\n       (c) Prehearing conference memoranda. The Hearing Officer \n     may order each party to prepare a prehearing conference \n     memorandum. That memorandum may include:\n       (1) The major factual contentions and legal issues that the \n     party intends to raise at the hearing in short, successive, \n     and numbered paragraphs, along with any proposed stipulations \n     of fact or law. For example, in a case of alleged unlawful \n     discrimination, a complainant's statement of legal issues \n     should include that party's statement of the appropriate \n     prima facie case; an employing office's statement should \n     include the alleged legitimate, non-discriminatory reason(s) \n     that the employing office will articulate; and affirmative \n     defenses, if any, which may be raised.\n       (2) An estimate of the time necessary for presentation of \n     the party's case;\n       (3) The specific relief, including the amount of monetary \n     relief, that is being or will be requested;\n       (4) The names of potential witnesses for the party's case, \n     except for potential rebuttal witnesses, and the purpose for \n     which they will be called and a list of documents that the \n     party is seeking from the opposing party, and, if discovery \n     was permitted, the status of any pending request for \n     discovery. (It is not necessary to list each document \n     requested. Instead, the party may refer to the request for \n     discovery.)\n       (5) A brief description of any other unresolved issues.\n       (d) At the prehearing conference, the Hearing Officer may \n     discuss the subjects specified in paragraph 4 above and the \n     manner in which the hearing will be conducted and proceed. In \n     addition the Hearing Officer may explore settlement \n     possibilities and consider how the factual and legal issues \n     might be simplified and any other issues that might expedite \n     the early resolution of the dispute. The Hearing Officer \n     shall issue an order, which recites the action taken at the \n     conference and the agreements made by the parties as to any \n     of the matters considered and which limits the issues to \n     those not disposed of by admissions or agreements of the \n     parties. Such order, when entered, controls the course of the \n     proceeding, subject to later modification by the Hearing \n     Officer by his or her own order or upon proper request of a \n     party for good cause shown.\n     Sec. 7.05  Scheduling the hearing\n       (a) Date, time, and place of hearing. The Office shall \n     issue the notice of hearing, which shall fix the date, time, \n     and place of hearing. In no event, absent a postponement \n     granted by the Office, will a hearing commence later than 60 \n     days after the filing of the complaint.\n       (b) Motions for postponement or a continuance. Motions for \n     postponement or for a continuance by either party shall be \n     made in writing to the Office, shall set forth the reasons \n     for the request and the position of the opposing party on the \n     postponement. Such a motion may be granted upon a showing of \n     good cause. In no event will a hearing commence later than 90 \n     days after the filing of the complaint.\n     Sec. 7.06  Consolidation and joinder of cases\n       (a) Explanation. (1) Consolidation is when two or more \n     parties have cases that might be treated as one because they \n     contain identical or similar issues or in such other \n     appropriate circumstances.\n       (2) Joinder is when one person has two or more claims \n     pending and they are united for consideration. For example, \n     where a single individual who has one appeal pending \n     challenging a 30-day suspension and another appeal pending \n     challenging a subsequent dismissal, joinder might be \n     warranted.\n       (b) The Board, the Office, or a Hearing Officer may \n     consolidate or join cases on their own initiative or on the \n     motion of a party if to do so would expedite processing of \n     the cases and not adversely affect the interests of the \n     parties, taking into account the confidentiality requirements \n     of Section 416 of the Act.\n     Sec. 7.07  Conduct of hearing; disqualification of \n         representatives\n       (a) Pursuant to Section 405(d)(1) of the Act, the Hearing \n     Officer will conduct the hearing in closed session on the \n     record. Only the Hearing Officer, the parties and their \n     representatives, and witnesses during the time they are \n     testifying, will be permitted to attend, except that the \n     Office may not be precluded from observing the hearings. The \n     Hearing Officer, or a person designated by the Hearing \n     Officer or the Executive Director, shall control the \n     recording of the proceedings.\n       (b) The hearing will be conducted as an administrative \n     proceeding. Witnesses shall testify under oath or \n     affirmation. Except as specified in the Act and in these \n     rules, the Hearing Officer will conduct the hearing, to the \n     greatest extent practicable, in accordance with the \n     principles and procedures in Sections 554 through 557 of \n     title 5 of the United States Code.\n       (c) No later than the opening of the hearing, or as \n     otherwise ordered by the Hearing Officer, each party shall \n     submit to the Hearing Officer and to the opposing party a \n     typed list of the witnesses, except rebuttal witnesses, \n     expected to be called to testify.\n       (d) At the commencement of the hearing, or as otherwise \n     ordered by the Hearing Officer, the Hearing Officer may \n     consider any stipulations of facts and law pursuant to \n     Section 7.10, take official notice of certain facts pursuant \n     to Section 7.11, rule on objections made by the parties and \n     hear the examination and cross-examination of witnesses. Each \n     party will be expected to present his or her cases in a \n     concise manner, limiting the testimony of witnesses and \n     submission of documents to relevant matters.\n       (e) If the Hearing Officer concludes that a representative \n     of an employee, a witness, or an employing office has a \n     conflict of interest, he may, after giving the representative \n     an opportunity to respond, disqualify the representative. In \n     that event, within the time limits established by the Act, \n     the affected party will have a reasonable time to retain \n     other representation.\n     Sec. 7.08  Transcript\n       (a) Preparation. An accurate electronic or stenographic \n     record of the hearing shall be kept and shall be the sole \n     official record of the proceeding. The Office shall be \n     responsible for the cost of transcription of the hearing. \n     Upon request, a copy of a transcript of the hearing shall be \n     provided to each party, provided, however, that such party \n     has first agreed to maintain and respect the confidentiality \n     of such transcript in accordance with the applicable rules \n     prescribed by the Office or the Hearing Officer in order to \n     effectuate Section 416(c) of the Act. Additional copies of \n     the transcript shall be made available to a party upon \n     payment of costs. Exceptions to the payment requirement may \n     be granted for good cause shown. A motion for an exception \n     shall be made in writing and \n\n[[Page S 17018]]\n     accompanied by an affidavit or declaration setting forth the reasons \n     for the request and shall be granted upon a showing of good \n     cause. Requests for copies of transcripts shall be directed \n     to the Office. The Office may, by agreement with the person \n     making the request, make arrangements with the official \n     hearing reporter for required services to be charged to the \n     requester.\n       (b) Corrections. Corrections to the official transcript \n     will be permitted. Motions for correction must be submitted \n     within 10 days of service of the transcript upon the party. \n     Corrections of the official transcript will be permitted only \n     when errors of substance are involved and only upon approval \n     of the Hearing Officer. The Hearing Officer may make \n     corrections at any time with notice to the parties.\n     Sec. 7.09  Admissibility of evidence\n       The Hearing Officer shall apply the Federal rules of \n     evidence to the greatest extent practicable. These rules \n     provide that the Hearing Officer may exclude evidence if, \n     among other things, it constitutes inadmissible hearsay or \n     its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger \n     of unfair prejudice, by confusion of the issues, or by \n     considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless \n     presentation of cumulative evidence.\n     Sec. 7.10  Stipulations\n       The parties may stipulate as to any matter of fact. Such a \n     stipulation will satisfy a party's burden of proving the fact \n     alleged.\n     Sec. 7.11  Official notice\n       The Hearing Officer on his or her own motion or on motion \n     of a party, may take official notice of a fact that is not \n     subject to reasonable dispute because it is either: (a) A \n     matter of common knowledge; or (b) capable of accurate and \n     ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy \n     cannot reasonably be questioned. Official notice taken of any \n     fact satisfies a party's burden of proving the fact noticed.\n       Where a decision, or part thereof, rests on the official \n     notice of a material fact not appearing in the evidence in \n     the record, the fact of official notice shall be so stated in \n     the decision, and any party, upon timely request, shall be \n     afforded an opportunity to show the contrary.\n     Sec. 7.12  Confidentiality\n       Pursuant to Section 416 of the Act, all proceedings and \n     deliberations of Hearing Officers and the Board, including \n     the transcripts of hearings and any related records, shall be \n     confidential, except as specified in Section 416(d), (e), and \n     (f) of the Act. All parties to the proceeding and their \n     representatives, and witnesses who appear at the hearing, \n     will be advised of the importance of confidentiality in this \n     process and of their obligations, subject to sanctions, to \n     maintain it.\n     Sec. 7.13  Immediate Board Review of a Ruling by a Hearing \n         Officer\n       (a) Review strongly disfavored. Board review of a ruling by \n     a hearing officer while a proceeding is ongoing (an \n     ``interlocutory appeal'') is strongly disfavored. In general, \n     a request for interlocutory review may go before the Board \n     for consideration only if the Hearing Officer, on his or her \n     own motion or by motion of the parties, determines that the \n     issue presented is of such importance to the proceeding that \n     it requires the Board's immediate attention.\n       (b) Standards for review. In determining whether to forward \n     a request for interlocutory review to the Board, the Hearing \n     Officer shall consider the following:\n       (1) Whether the ruling involves a significant question of \n     law or policy about which there is substantial ground for \n     difference of opinion; and\n       (2) Whether an immediate review of the Hearing Officer \n     ruling by the Board will materially advance the completion of \n     the proceeding; and\n       (3) Whether denial of immediate review will cause undue \n     harm to a party or the public.\n       (c) Time for Filing. A motion by a party for interlocutory \n     review of a ruling of the Hearing Officer shall be filed with \n     the Hearing Officer within 5 days after service of the ruling \n     upon the parties. The motion shall include arguments in \n     support of both interlocutory review and the determination to \n     be made by the Board upon review. Responses, if any, shall be \n     filed with the Hearing Officer within 3 days after service of \n     the motion.\n       (d) Hearing Officer Action. If the conditions set forth in \n     paragraph (b) above are met, the Hearing Officer may forward \n     a request for interlocutory review to the Board for its \n     immediate consideration. Any such submission shall explain \n     the basis on which the Hearing Officer concluded that the \n     standards for interlocutory review have been met.\n       (e) Grant of Interlocutory Review Within Board's Sole \n     Discretion. The Board, in its sole discretion, may grant \n     interlocutory review.\n       (f) Stay pending review. Unless otherwise directed by the \n     Board, the stay of any proceedings during the pendency of \n     either a request for interlocutory review or the review \n     itself shall be within the discretion of the Hearing Officer.\n       (g) Denial of Motion not Appealable; Mandamus. The grant or \n     denial of a motion for a request for interlocutory review \n     shall not be appealable. The Hearing Officer shall promptly \n     bring a denial of such a motion, and the reasons therefor, to \n     the attention of the Board. If, upon consideration of the \n     motion and the reason for denial, the Board believes that \n     interlocutory review is warranted, it may grant the review \n     sua sponte. In addition, the Board may in its discretion, in \n     extraordinary circumstances, entertain directly from a party \n     a writ of mandamus to review a ruling of a Hearing Officer.\n       (h) Procedures before Board. Upon its acceptance of a \n     ruling of the Hearing Officer for interlocutory review, the \n     Board shall issue an order setting forth the procedures that \n     will be followed in the conduct of that review.\n       (i) Review of a Final Decision. Denial of interlocutory \n     review will not affect a party's right to challenge rulings, \n     which are otherwise appealable, as part of an appeal to the \n     Board from the Hearing Officer's decision issued under \n     Section 7.17 of these rules.\n     Sec. 7.14  Briefs\n       (a) May be filed. The Hearing Officer may permit the \n     parties to file posthearing briefs on the factual and the \n     legal issues presented in the case.\n       (b) Length. No principal brief shall exceed 50 pages, or \n     12,500 words, and no reply brief 25 pages, or 6,250 words, \n     exclusive of tables and pages limited only to quotations of \n     statutes, rules, and the like. Motions to file extended \n     briefs shall be granted only for good cause shown; the \n     Hearing Officer may in his or her discretion also reduce the \n     page limits. Briefs in excess of 10 pages shall include an \n     index and a table of authorities.\n       (c) Format. Every brief must be easily readable. Briefs \n     must have double spacing between each line of text, except \n     for quoted texts and footnotes, which may be single-spaced.\n     Sec. 7.15  Closing the record\n       (a) The record shall be closed at the conclusion of the \n     hearing. However, when the Hearing Officer allows the parties \n     to submit additional evidence previously identified for \n     introduction, the Hearing Officer may allow an additional \n     period before the conclusion of the hearing as is necessary \n     for that purpose.\n       (b) Once the record is closed, no additional evidence or \n     argument shall be accepted into the record except upon a \n     showing that new and material evidence has become available \n     that was not available despite due diligence prior to the \n     closing of the record. However, the Hearing Officer shall \n     make part of the record any motions for attorney fees, \n     supporting documentation, and determinations thereon, and any \n     approved correction to the transcript.\n     Sec. 7.16  Official record\n       The transcript of testimony and the exhibits, together with \n     all papers and motions filed in the proceeding, shall \n     constitute the exclusive and official record.\n     Sec. 7.17  Hearing Officer decisions; entry in records of the \n         Office\n       (a) Pursuant to Section 405(g) of the Act, no later than 90 \n     days after the conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing Officer \n     shall issue a written decision.\n       (b) Upon issuance, the decision and order of the Hearing \n     Officer shall be entered into the records of the Office.\n       (c) The Office shall promptly provide a copy of the \n     decision and order of the Hearing Officer to the parties.\n       (d) If there is no appeal of a decision and order of a \n     Hearing Officer, that decision becomes a final decision of \n     the Office, which is subject to enforcement under Section \n     8.01 of these rules.\n\n                Subpart H--Proceedings before the Board\n\n     Sec. 8.01  Appeal to the Board\n     Sec. 8.02  Compliance with Final Decisions, Requests for \n         Enforcement\n     Sec. 8.03  Judicial Review\n     Sec. 8.01  Appeal to the Board\n       (a) No later than 30 days after the entry of the decision \n     of the Hearing Officer in the records of the Office, an \n     aggrieved party may seek review of that decision by the Board \n     by filing with the Office a petition for review by the Board. \n     The appeal must be served on the opposing party or its \n     representative.\n       (b) Unless otherwise ordered by the Board, within 21 days \n     following the filing of a petition for review to the Board, \n     the appellant shall file and serve a supporting brief.

Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of November 6, 1995.)\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senator \nfrom Washington, who is here, has agreed to 2 hours equally divided on \nthis issue. \n\n[[Page S 17020]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the order.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate the conference \nreport on S. 395, historic legislation that our State has sought for \nover a decade. Our citizens will no longer be discriminated against and \nkept from selling the State's most valuable resource in the world \nmarket. Working with small and integrated oil producers, with \nindependent tanker operators, and with maritime labor, we have \ndemonstrated that it still is possible to get something good done for \nthe country.\n  Title I of the conference report provides for the sale of the Alaska \nPower Administration's assets and the termination of the Alaska Power \nAdministration once the sale is completed.\n  The Alaska Power Administration is unique among the Federal power \nmarketing administrations. First, unlike the other Federal power \nmarketing administrations, the Alaska Power Administration owns its \npower generating facilities, which consists of two hydroelectric \nprojects. Second, these single-purpose hydroelectric projects were not \nbuilt as the result of a water resource management plan, as is the case \nwith most other Federal hydroelectric dams. Instead, they were built to \npromote economic development and the establishment of essential \nindustries. Third, the Alaska Power Administration operates entirely in \none State. Fourth, the Alaska Power Administration was never intended \nto remain indefinitely under Government control. That is specifically \nrecognized in the Eklutna project authorizing legislation.\n  The Alaska Power Administration owns two hydroelectric projects, \nSnettisham and Eklutna. Snettisham is a 78-megawatt project located 45 \nmiles south of Juneau. It has been Juneau's main power source since \n1975, accounting for 80 percent of its electric power supply. Eklutna \nis a 30-megawatt project located 34 miles northeast of Anchorage. It \nhas served the Anchorage and Matanuska Valley areas since 1955, \naccounting for 5 percent of its electric power supply.\n  The Alaska Power Administration's assets will be sold pursuant to the \n1989 purchase agreements between the Department of Energy and the \npurchasers. Snettisham will be sold to the State of Alaska, and Eklutna \nwill be sold jointly to the municipality of Anchorage, the Chugach \nElectric Association, and the Matanuska Electric Association. For both, \nthe sale price is determined under an agreed-upon formula. It is the \nnet present value of the remaining debt service payments that the \nTreasury would receive if the Federal Government had retained ownership \nof the two projects. The proceeds from the sales are currently \nestimated to be about $85 million, however, the actual sales price will \nvary with the interest rate at the time of purchase.\n  S. 395 and a separate formal agreement provide for the full \nprotection of fish and wildlife. The purchasers, the State of Alaska, \nthe U.S. Department of Commerce National Marine Fisheries Service, and \nthe U.S. Department of the Interior have jointly entered into a formal \nbinding agreement providing for post-sale protection, mitigation, and \nenhancement of fish and wildlife resources affected by Eklutna and \nSnettisham. S. 395 makes that agreement legally enforceable.\n  The Alaska Power Administration has 34 people located in Alaska. The \npurchasers of the two projects have pledged to hire as many of these as \npossible. For those who do not receive offers of employment, the \nDepartment of Energy has pledged that it will offer employment to any \nremaining Alaska Power Administration employees, although the DOE jobs \nare expected to be in the lower 48.\n  Title II of the bill would at long last allow exports of Alaska's \nNorth Slope crude oil when carried in U.S.-flag vessels. This \nlegislation will finally allow my State to market its most valuable \nproduct in the global marketplace, letting the market determine its \nultimate usage.\n  So that my colleagues will better understand the provisions of title \nII, let me expand on the description provided in the ``Statement of \nManagers.'' Section 201 of the conference report authorizes ANS \nexports, making inapplicable the general and specific restrictions in \nsection 7(d) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, section 28(u) of \nthe Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, section 103 of the Energy Policy and \nConservation Act, and the Department of Commerce's short supply \nregulations, unless the President determines that they would not be in \nthe national interest. The conference report negates, as well, any \nother existing law, regulation, or executive order that might otherwise \nbe interpreted to block ANS exports.\n  Before making his national interest determination, the President must \nconsider an appropriate environmental review. Because questions were \nraised when the bill was first before the Senate, I want to assure my \ncolleagues that the conferees have recommended a provision fully \nconsistent with the National Environmental Policy Act. Under the \nconference report, the administration is directed to conduct an \n``appropriate environmental review.'' As my colleagues may know, \n``appropriate environmental review'' is not a term defined in NEPA. \nBecause it is unique to this legislation and was not given a statutory \ndefinition, I think I should explain what the conferees meant through \nthe selection of this term and how it will operate consistently with \nNEPA.\n  In its comprehensive report on the costs and benefits of exporting \nANS crude oil, the Department of Energy found ``no plausible evidence \nof any direct negative environmental impact from lifting the ANS crude \nexport ban.'' In fact, the Department concluded that, ``[w]hen indirect \neffects are considered, it appears that the market response to removing \nthe ANS export ban could result in a production and transportation \nstructure that is preferable to the status quo in certain respects.'' \nThe Department found, for example, that ``[l]ifting the export ban will \nreduce overall tanker movements in U.S. waters.'' The Department also \nfound that the ``[i]mported oil that would substitute for ANS crude \nexports would have a lower sulfur content than ANS crude, thereby \nlowering the average sulfur content of the crude processed in \nCalifornia refineries.'' The weight of the testimony taken before my \ncommittee and the House Resources Committee affirmed the \nappropriateness of the Department's ultimate finding that enactment of \nthis legislation would not have any direct negative effect on the \nenvironment.\n  In light of the work already done and the conclusions reached by the \nDepartment of Energy, the conference report directs, as the \n``appropriate environmental review,'' an abbreviated 4-month study. The \nenvironmental review is intended to be thorough and comprehensive. \nGiven the Department's findings and the compressed time frame, neither \na full environmental impact statement nor a more limited environmental \nassessment is contemplated. NEPA is satisfied because the conference \nreport directs that, if any potential adverse effects on the \nenvironment are found, the study is to recommend ``appropriate \nmeasures'' to mitigate or cure them. This procedure tracks the well-\nrecognized procedure whereby an agency may forego a full EIS by taking \nappropriate steps to correct any problems found during an EA. Under \ncurrent law, if an EA reveals some potentially adverse environmental \neffects, an agency may take mitigating measures that lessen or \neliminate the environmental impact and, thereupon, make a finding of no \nsignificant impact and decline to prepare a formal EIS. Similarly, as \nlong as potentially adverse impacts can be mitigated by conditions on \nexports included in the President's national interest determination, \nNEPA is satisfied.\n  In making his national interest determination, the President may \nimpose--with one significant exception--appropriate terms and \nconditions on ANS exports. As set forth in the original Senate bill and \nthe House companion measure, the President may not impose a volume \nlimitation of any kind. We want the market given a chance to work. \nHaving been discriminated against for so long, we fought hard to ensure \nthat our oil could be sold under free market conditions. The conference \nreport is intended to permit ANS crude oil to compete with other crude \noil in the world market under normal market conditions. \n\n[[Page S 17021]]\n\n  To facilitate competition and in recognition that the conference \nreport precludes imposition of a volume limitation, the conferees \nintend that the President direct exports to proceed under a general \nlicense. Although crude oil exports historically have been governed \nthrough the use of individual validated licenses, this type of before-\nthe-fact licensing procedure would not be appropriate here. Like the \nrule governing exports of refined petroleum products, which are \npermitted under a general license, the rule governing ANS exports \nshould permit use of a general license for at least three reasons.\n  First, the conference report explicitly negates the short supply \nregulations and the statutory authority underlying them as they relate \nto ANS exports. Our intent was to clear away two decades of accumulated \nobstructions to ANS exports.\n  Second, the conference report specifically precludes the President \nfrom imposing a volume limitation. In almost every instance today, \nindividual validated licenses on crude exports are necessary because of \nthe need to deal with volume limitations, such as those imposed on \nexports of California heavy crude oil or ANS crude to Canada. Finally, \nit is our intent that the market finally be given an opportunity to \noperate. We do not want unnecessary paperwork to impede proper \nfunctioning of the market.\n  We understand that some information is needed to monitor exports. We \nhave looked at the model for exports of refined petroleum products as a \nguide. Refined petroleum product exporters submit export declarations \nto the U.S. Customs Service at the time or after they export. The \nDepartment of Commerce compiles this information for trade statistics \npurposes. Similarly, exporters of ANS crude under a general license \nwould routinely file export declarations contemporaneously or after the \ntime of export. These filings will provide any information needed for \nmonitoring ANS crude exports.\n  In view of the anticipated substantial benefits to the nation of ANS \nexports, the President should make his national interest determination \nas promptly as possible. Moreover, given the exhaustive DOE study and \nthe long time that has been available since the bill cleared the Senate \nto study any potential adverse environmental effects, we believe the \nPresident should soon have at hand the necessary information to \npromptly make the necessary affirmative determination. Because any \ndelay will only delay the benefits the Nation will reap through \nexports, we hope the President will act as quickly as may be \npracticable.\n  As many Members of this body know, there has long been concern in the \ndomestic maritime community that lifting the ban would force the \nscrapping of the independent tanker fleet and would destroy employment \nopportunities for merchant mariners. There can be little doubt that \nCongress has a compelling interest in preserving a fleet essential to \nour Nation's military security, especially one vital to moving an \nimportant natural resource such as my State's oil. In recognition of \nthis, the conference report requires that ANS exports be carried in \nU.S.-flag vessels. The only exceptions are exports to Israel under a \nbilateral treaty and to others under the International Emergency Oil \nSharing Plan of the International Energy Agency.\n  Prior to our taking the underlying bill to the floor, the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative assured my committee that this provision would not \nviolate our GATT obligations. As made clear in the statement of \nmanagers, the conferees concur with the administration's view that this \nprovision is fully consistent with our international obligations. \nMoreover, it is supported by ample precedent, including in particular a \ncomparable provision in the implementing legislation for the United \nStates-Canada Free Trade Agreement.\n  The conference report also directs the Secretary of Commerce to issue \nany rules necessary to govern ANS exports within 30 days of the \nPresident's national interest determination. In light of the \noverwhelming benefits to the Nation of ANS exports, the Secretary \nshould promulgate any rules necessary contemporaneously with the \nPresident's national interest determination.\n  Title III of the bill would provide royalty relief for leases on \nOuter Continental Shelf tracts in deep water in certain areas of the \nGulf of Mexico. Deep water royalty is an issue I have been working on \nwith the ranking member of the Energy Committee for some time.\n  I support measures to stimulate oil and gas exploration and \nproduction on the Outer Continental Shelf [OCS] and the deep water \nroyalty provisions in S. 395 would be an important step in stimulating \nenergy exploration and development and reducing our reliance on foreign \noil.\n  A report released earlier this year by the Commerce Department \nsuggests that our national security is at risk because we now import \nmore than 50 percent of our domestic petroleum requirements. Department \nof Energy [DOE] figures predict that crude oil imports will hit 65 \npercent in the year 2000, and by the year 2005 we will be importing \nover two-thirds--68 percent --of our crude oil.\n  The OCS is an invaluable oil and natural gas resource and a prolific \nsource of revenue to the U.S. Treasury, having generated more than $100 \nbillion in revenues over the years. The OCS could play a major role in \nreducing the amount of dollars we send overseas to import oil and \nnatural gas. In 1993, our energy deficit was $46 billion--roughly 40 \npercent of the total U.S. merchandise trade deficit of $116 billion.\n  OCS production from deep water areas could help improve energy \nsecurity, reduce our deficit in our balance of payments, create jobs, \nstimulate demand for related goods and services, and provide needed \nrevenue through bonus bids, royalties, and ripple effect tax benefits.\n  The basic need for this legislation is very easy to justify: oil and \ngas reserves nearest to shore or with easiest access are being \ndepleted, and as this happens companies are forced to look in deeper \nwater for more reserves. That is especially true in the Western and \nCentral Gulf of Mexico, where oil and gas exploration and production \nactivity has declined and it is now necessary for companies to move \nfurther and further offshore into water depths previously thought to be \nprohibitive, both economically and technologically.\n  I believe the deep water royalty provisions are necessary to \nstimulate OCS oil and gas production and reduce our reliance on foreign \nimports. I support the deep water provisions and urge adoption of the \nconference report on these important provisions.\n  Mr. President, let me give a brief outline of the legislation that is \nbefore us, S. 395, title I, called the Alaska Power Administration \nsale. Title I of S. 395 provides for the sale of the Alaska Power \nAdministration's assets and the termination of the Alaska Power \nAdministration once the sale occurs.\n  The sale of the Alaska Power Administration has been a bipartisan \neffort on the part of both the House and the Senate and the culmination \nof the efforts of three administrations. It has been some time in the \nprocess. It was initiated during the Reagan administration, it was \nsigned during the Bush administration, and the implementing legislation \nwhich is contained in this bill was proposed by the current \nadministration.\n  On September 29 of this year, the Department of Energy, Secretary \nO'Leary, wrote in support of this legislation, and on October 10 of \nthis year, the Edison Electric Institute wrote in support of the \nlegislation on behalf of the investor-owned electric utility industry.\n  Mr. President, this organization, known as the Alaska Power \nAdministration, is really unique among the Federal marketing \nadministrations. First of all, unlike the other Federal power marketing \nadministrations, the Alaska Power Administration owns its power \ngenerating facilities. These are two hydroelectric projects, one in \nAnchorage and another near Juneau. They are approximately 600 to 700 \nmiles apart.\n  Second, the single-purpose hydroelectric projects were not built as a \nresult of water resource management plans. Instead, they were built to \npromote economic development and the establishment of essential \nindustries within the areas that they serve.\n  Third, the Alaska Power Administration operates entirely within one \nState. These services do not cross State lines. And because of the \ndistance between the two areas; namely, \n\n[[Page S 17022]]\nAnchorage and Juneau, there is no opportunity for an intertie. These \nfacilities are separate and distinct.\n  Furthermore, the Alaska Power Administration was never intended to \nremain indefinitely under Government control. This is specifically \nrecognized in the Eklutna project authorization legislation.\n  Fifth, the sale terms of the Alaska Power Administration that were \nspecifically negotiated between the Federal Government and the \npurchasers are memorialized in the purchase contract.\n  So for those who might be concerned that this sets precedent, Mr. \nPresident, for PMA's, this is clearly not the case, as it is applied to \nthe Alaska Power Administration.\n  Now, as I have indicated, these two hydroelectric projects in \nAnchorage and Juneau are known as Snettisham in Juneau and Eklutna in \nAnchorage. Snettisham is a 78-megawatt project located about 45 miles \nsouth of Juneau. It has been in Juneau, which is the capital city's \nmain power source, since 1975, accounting for approximately 80 percent \nof the electric supply utilization in that area. Eklutna is a smaller \nplant, a 30-megawatt project, located 34 miles northeast of Anchorage. \nIt has served that area since 1955, accounting for about 5 percent of \nthe electric supply in the Anchorage area.\n  The Alaska Power Administration's assets will be sold pursuant to the \n1989 purchase agreement between the Department of Energy and the \npurchasers. Snettisham will be sold to the State of Alaska. Eklutna \nwill be sold jointly to the municipality of Anchorage, the Chugach \nElectric Association, and the Matanuska Electric Association.\n  The sales price is determined by calculating the net present value to \nthe remaining debt service payments that the Treasury would receive if \nthe Federal Government had retained ownership of the two projects. It \nis anticipated that the sale proceeds will be in the area of $85 \nmillion. Actual sales price will vary with the interest rate at the \ntime of purchase.\n  I might add, the bill and separate formal agreements provide for the \nfull protection of fish and wildlife on each of these hydroelectric \nprojects. The purchaser, the State of Alaska, U.S. Department of \nCommerce, National Marine Fisheries Service, and U.S. Department of the \nInterior have jointly entered into a formal binding agreement providing \nfor post-sale protection, mitigation, and enhancement of fish and \nwildlife resources affected by the Eklutna and Snettisham projects. S. \n395 makes that agreement legally enforceable.\n  As a result of this formal agreement, the Department of Energy, \nDepartment of the Interior, and the Department of Commerce all agree \nthat the two hydroelectric projects warrant exemption from FERC \nlicensing under the Federal Power Act.\n  The August 7, 1991, purchase agreement states in part,\n\n       The National Marine Fisheries Service and U.S. Fish and \n     Wildlife Services in the State agree that the following \n     mechanisms to protect and implement measures to protect and \n     mitigate damages to and enhance fish and wildlife, including \n     related spotting grounds and habitat, obviate the need for \n     Eklutna purchasers to obtain FERC licensing.\n\n  Further, the Alaska Power Administration has some 34 people located \ncurrently in Alaska. The purchasers of the two projects have pledged to \nhire as many of these individuals as possible. For those who do not \nreceive offers of employment, the Department of Energy has pledged that \nit will offer other employment.\n  Let me return at this time briefly to title II, known as the Alaska \nNorth Slope crude oil exports. Title II of Senate bill 395 would allow \nthe exports of Alaska North Slope crude oil, limited to U.S.-flag and \nU.S. crude vessels.\n  The export restrictions were first enacted shortly after the \ncommencement of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war and the first Arab oil \nboycott. Following the second major oil shock in 1979, Congress \neffectively imposed a ban on exports. Much has changed since then.\n  Last year, for the first time, imports met more than half of our \ndomestic consumption because domestic consumption production has \ndrastically declined.\n  By precluding the market from operating normally, the export ban has \nhad the unintended effect of discouraging further energy production.\n  With this market disorientation eliminated, producers will make \nsubstantial investments in California and other areas that would lead \nto additional production on shore.\n  Every barrel of additional oil produced in California and on the \nNorth Slope is one less that would have to be imported from the Middle \nEast or anywhere else in the world, where currently our imports are \nabout 51 percent of our total consumption.\n  Some Senators have expressed concern that lifting the ANS export oil \nban would jeopardize the supply of U.S. crude on the west coast. It is \nimportant to recognize that Washington and California are the closest \nand are natural markets for ANS crude because of the transportation \ndistance. Washington and California ports are the closest to Alaska, \nand the ANS crude will continue to be supplied to their refineries \nbecause of the cost and proximity.\n  Furthermore, the only major refinery that previously opposed the \nlifting of the ban, Tosco, has a 5-year contract with one of the major \noil companies to keep the refinery in Washington supplied. There is \nstill nearly 4 years to run on that contract.\n  Further, the lifting of the oil export ban would relieve the pressure \nthat forces some of the ANS crude oil down to Panama where it is \nunloaded and transported across Panama via pipeline and then reloaded \nonto vessels to take it into the gulf coast.\n  It no longer makes economic sense to handle the oil that many times \nand transport it the long distance. That is the oil that will be \navailable for export.\n  Let me elaborate a little more on this because there has been concern \nexpressed in this body, and by others, as to the merits of why we would \nattempt to increase development of oil on the west coast of the United \nStates and Alaska, from the standpoint of exploration, at the same time \nwe are authorizing the export of Alaskan oil that previously has been \nprecluded from export.\n  Again, let me ask the Chair to visualize the circumstances. The oil \nthat is produced from Alaska initially was 2 million barrels a day--now \n1\\1/2\\ million barrels a day--moves down the west coast and is dropped \noff at Puget Sound, or San Francisco Bay, or the Los Angeles area for \ntheir refineries to refine that oil. There is some excess. That excess, \nfor the last 17 to 18 years, has been going down to Panama.\n  In Panama, there is a pipeline across the isthmus, and that excess \noil is unloaded off United States-flag vessels from Valdez, AK, moving \nthrough the pipeline across the Isthmus of Panama and then is required \nto be reloaded on a smaller United States tanker and taken into the \ngulf ports of Galveston and other areas, where the oil is refined.\n  Because of the double handling, it is no longer economic to take that \noil in that rather cumbersome process. This is the oil that we would \nanticipate that would be marketed into primarily the Pacific rim ports. \nAnd one has to consider the merits of taking oil that is excess to the \nwest coast and transporting it over the Pacific, across the Pacific to \nJapan, Korea, and Taiwan, in United States-flag vessels with United \nStates crews, when indeed that oil can be imported into those \ncountries, the Mideast or whatever, in foreign-flag vessels.\n  So I want to put to rest the thought that there would be any \nsignificant amount of oil moved that would be detrimental to the \nconcentration of where the oil is currently consumed; namely, the West \nCoast of the United States. What we are really looking at is that oil \nthat is excess to the west coast, currently moving through the Panama \nCanal at substantial costs, that it simply makes sense to move that oil \nto the markets where that oil can be consumed in a more economic, \nviable manner.\n  So, Mr. President, the current prohibition just does not make \neconomic sense. For too long it has hurt the citizens of my State of \nAlaska. It has certainly damaged the California oil and gas onshore \nindustry and precluded many of the small stripper wells from producing \nin the market and from functioning normally and freely.\n  I might add, a recently released Department of Energy report \ndetermined that lifting the Alaska crude oil export ban would \nspecifically: First, add as \n\n[[Page S 17023]]\nmuch as $180 million in tax revenue to the U.S. Treasury by the year \n2000; second, allow California to earn as much as $230 million during \nthat same period; third, increase U.S. employment somewhere between \n11,000 and 16,000 jobs by 1995, and perhaps 25,000 jobs by the year \n2000.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I want to ask my colleague what the vote was in the \nenergy committee on this bill, the Alaska North Slope bill, when it \ncame out?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I can respond just very briefly, the energy \ncommittee, Energy and Natural Resources Committee, voted to support \nthat. It would take me a moment to look at the exact vote, but it was \noverwhelming in support. I want to acknowledge that my good friend from \nLouisiana, who is the ranking member of that committee, perhaps he has \nthe exact figure available to him.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. My recollection was that it came out without \nopposition. I do not recall precisely.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Louisiana is almost correct. Since \nthis is government business, it is close enough for government work, \nbut it was 17 to 4.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. What was the position of the administration on this \nbill?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. As I indicated in my remarks earlier, the \nadministration does support the bill. The Secretary of Energy supports \nthe bill, and I know of no opposition within the administration to the \nbill.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. When the bill came up on the floor here for a vote, \ndoes the Senator recall that was cleared on the hotline and passed on a \nvoice vote? Am I correct on that?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If my memory serves me correct, it was voted on and it \npassed. I think we had about 70 votes, but I have to defer to the \nrecord.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I stand corrected. I am advised it was 74 yeas and 25 \nnays.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. And if I may correct the record in response to the \nSenator from Louisiana, the vote in question in the Energy Committee \nwas 14 to 4.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. It was 14 to 4. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I would like to offer my strong support and \nendorsement of the conference report on S. 395, the Alaska Power \nAdministration sale and exports of Alaskan North Slope oil. This \nlegislation is supported by the President, was passed with an \noverwhelming margin by the House last week and should be passed with a \nsimilar margin in the Senate.\n  Title III of S. 395 is the Outer Continental Shelf [OCS] Deep Water \nRoyalty Relief Act. This provision is straightforward. For the next 5 \nyears, deep water leases will be offered for sale under the following \nterms: First, payment of an upfront bonus bid, and second, waiver of \nthe royalty on a fixed volume of oil and gas based on the water depth \nof the lease. In addition, this provision provides for royalty relief \nto encourage production on existing leases only if the Secretary of the \nInterior determines the leases would not be drilled but for the relief. \nIt only affects leasing and development in oil and gas producing areas \nof the central and western Gulf of Mexico west of the Alabama-Florida \nborder. This provision does not in any way affect leasing or \ndevelopment off the coast of Florida or any other region of the Outer \nContinental Shelf, nor does it affect any areas or leases subject to \nmoratorium.\n  The Treasury will gain in two ways from these leases that otherwise \nwould never have been developed--from current tax revenues and from \nroyalties once the waiver volume has been produced. This provision will \ngenerate substantial revenues over the next 5 years as companies bid \nmore for deep water leases and risk investing in leases that are \ncurrently too marginal to even consider. The revenues received by the \nTreasury for oil and gas leases are the combination of bonus bids \nreceived at the time of lease sales and royalties paid in the event a \nlease is developed and brought into production. Since the Federal \nleasing system began in 1954, $56 billion in bonus payments have been \ngenerated versus $47 billion in royalty revenues. In other words, we \nhave received more money from producers paying for the option to \nproduce leases than from actual production royalties. This is \nespecially true in deep waters where only one out of 16 leases ever \nproduce and pay royalties.\n  The Congressional Budget Office [CBO] estimated the Outer Continental \nShelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act, introduced in the Senate as S. \n158, would generate additional revenues of $100 million over 5 years. \nThe Minerals Management Service [MMS] of the Department of Interior has \nestimated that bonus bids would increase by $485 million over 5 years \nas a direct result of enactment of this legislation. In particular, MMS \nstated that the leases sold over the next 5 years ``could be expected \nto rise by 150 percent, with higher percentage increases at greater \nwater depths.''\n  It is essential that the United States remedy this inane policy of \nchronic reliance on oil imports when we can more effectively develop \nour domestic resources in areas such as the central and western gulf. \nThe United States is currently importing 50 percent of its oil at a \ncost of over $50 billion per year. By the year 2010, the Department of \nEnergy predicts imports will have risen to 60 percent of consumption. \nIn February of this year, the President announced that the current \nlevel of oil imports ``threaten[s] the Nation's security because they \nincrease U.S. vulnerability to oil supply disruptions.'' Some 4.2 \nmillion of the 8 million barrels per day of oil imports are from OPEC \ncountries.\n  Major deep water development projects are funded with international \ncapital. Failure to invest in the Gulf of Mexico is a lost opportunity \nfor the United States. Those dollars will not move into other domestic \ndevelopment; they will move to Asia, South America, the Middle East, or \nthe former Soviet Union. In 1985, the domestic producers capable of \ndeveloping projects of this magnitude were investing two-thirds of \ntheir exploration and production capital in the United States. This \nfigure has been on a steady downward trend, currently only one-third of \nthose dollars are being invested in the United States. Due to the high \ncost of development in deep waters, currently only 6 percent of the \nleases sold are ever developed. The Department of the Interior projects \nthis provision will more than double production otherwise expected to \nbe brought on line. One deep water platform costs upward of $1 \nbillion--this translates directly into jobs. According to the Bureau of \nLabor statistics each $1 billion invested in the oil and gas extraction \nindustry generates 20,000 new jobs.\n  This provision will improve our energy security situation, create \njobs, and benefit the Treasury.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I add, from the standpoint of the ranking member, \nSenator Johnston, his position has always been in support of this \nlegislation covering all aspects of title I, title II, and I have not \nmentioned title III, but that is the deep-water royalty, which I know \nthe Senator from Louisiana supports as well.\n  May I take this opportunity to thank him and his colleagues on the \nEnergy Committee for their continued support.\n  Let me just very briefly conclude a couple points on title II and a \nfew remarks very briefly on title III.\n  I was recounting the Department of Energy report determining that the \nlifting of the Alaska crude oil ban would accomplish some specific \nobjectives and inject an economic impact of substance. First was to add \nas much as $180 million in tax revenue to the U.S. Treasury by the year \n2000; second, to allow California to earn as much as $230 million in \nthe same period; third, increase U.S. employment by 11,000 to 16,000 \njobs by 1995, and up to 25,000 by the year 2000; preserve as many as \n3,300 maritime jobs; increase American oil production by as much as \n110,000 barrels a day by the year 2000; add 200 to 400 million barrels \nof Alaska oil reserves.\n  Another point I think deserves mentioning is some Members have \nexpressed concern that gas prices might go up on the west coast if \nexport of ANS oil is authorized. That is a legitimate concern, but it \nis simply not the case. The Department of Energy studied this issue and \nconcluded that customers and consumers would not see a discernible \nincrease at the gas pump.\n  Another concern you might hear today is that the crude oil exports \nwill \n\n[[Page S 17024]]\ncreate some increased hazards, including increased chances of oil \nspills. I think that needs some definitive identification. The \nDepartment of Energy carefully studied this issue and found that \nexports of Alaskan oil will actually decrease--decrease, Mr. \nPresident--tanker traffic in the U.S. waters.\n  Furthermore, any tankers exporting ANS oil exported from Alaska will \nproceed over 200 miles off the coast of Alaska--over 200 miles \noffshore--while proceeding overseas. In other words, the oil has all \nbeen moving off the coast of Alaska, off the coast of British Columbia \nand the Queen Charlotte Islands, off the coast of Washington, Oregon, \nand California.\n  That will not be the case with that portion of the oil that will be \nexported. It will move in larger vessels, hence reducing the number of \nvessels, and it will move across the ocean as compared to moving \nparallel to our west coast of the United States and Canada.\n  There are other concerns that exporting oil will decrease work for \nU.S. shipyards. However, I think it will have the reverse effect. Most \ntankers in the trade will stay in the U.S. trade and therefore be \nrepaired in U.S. yards.\n  If Alaska crude oil production continues to decline in part because \nof the depressed prices caused by the export ban, why, then, there \nwould be less tankers in service to put in and available for repair.\n  One should remember that any U.S.-flagged tanker that is repaired in \na foreign yard is subject to a 50-percent fee that is paid to the \nFederal Government as a penalty for repair in those foreign yards. \nClearly, there is enough opposition and enough economic detraction to \nensure that those tankers will not be repaired in U.S. yards.\n  Finally, of course, what we are doing is ensuring that more vessels \nwill be employed in the trade because what we are doing is moving some \nof this oil--not very much, but some of it--further. If you move it \nfurther, it takes more time. It takes more time, you need more ships.\n  So it is anticipated more steps would be taken on a lay up with U.S. \ncrews. So we are putting U.S. sailors to work in the international \ntrade.\n  Finally, title III, which is part of the Senate bill, is entitled \n``deep-water OCS royalty relief.'' I know my good friend from Louisiana \nhas worked very hard, and his colleagues, to ensure that we had \nadequate support in both the Senate and the House on this portion. It \nis in the energy security interests of our Nation to do so.\n  It would encourage oil and gas exploration and production in the deep \nwaters of the western and central Gulf of Mexico. It would offer the \nincentive to drill in deep-water areas defined as those being in water \ndepths greater than roughly 200 meters, or 600 feet, by exempting \nincreasingly larger amounts of new production as water depths increase. \nWith modern technology, we will be able to allow oil and gas extraction \nin deep-water areas in excess of this 2,000 to 3,000 feet, but the cost \nwould be tremendous, Mr. President.\n  Stimulus is needed to recover oil resources believed to lie in the \ndeep-water areas of the central and western Gulf of Mexico. It would \nnot cost the American taxpayer a cent, but would cause oil to be \nproduced that otherwise would remain in the ground without this relief.\n  This legislation is necessary as a consequence of the recent Commerce \nDepartment report indicating the United States is importing now more \nthan half of its domestic crude oil needs, and this presents a \npotential threat to our national security.\n  Further, the Department of Energy figures predict the crude oil \nimports will hit some 65 percent by the year 2000, and by the year 2005 \nwe could be exporting more than two-thirds or 68 percent of our crude \noil. Two-thirds of our crude oil would be imported in less than 10 \nyears.\n  The OCS is an invaluable oil and natural gas resource and prolific \nsource of revenue to the U.S. Treasury which has generated historically \nmore than $100 billion in revenues. The OCS could play a major role in \nreducing the amount of dollars spent overseas to import oil and natural \ngas. We import dollars and export our jobs, Mr. President. In 1993, it \nwas important to note the energy deficit ran as high as $46 billion, \nroughly 40 percent of the total U.S. merchandise trade deficit of $116 \nbillion.\n  If we look at our trade deficit, Mr. President, half of it primarily \nwith our trade inequity with Japan and the other half is imported oil. \nOCS production for deep-water areas could help improve energy security, \nreduce the deficit and balance of payments, create jobs, stimulate \ndemand for related goods and services, and provide needed revenue \nthrough bonus bids, royalty, ripple effects, and so forth.\n  Mr. President, I might add again that President Clinton has indicated \nthat he will sign this legislation, and I know there are concerns that \nwere concerns expressed by my good friend, the junior Senator from \nWashington, relative to ensuring adequate safeguards be implemented in \nregard to tankers in Puget Sound. I am sure she is prepared to speak on \nthat.\n  I know my colleague, the senior Senator from Oregon, is concerned \nabout the effect that this activity would have on his shipyard on the \nColumbia River.\n  So I am sure that we will have some debate on the Senate bill, and I \nlook forward to that.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nconference report, and ask how much time I have taken on my hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 36 minutes 40 seconds \nremaining.\n  The yeas and nays have been requested.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I stand here today concerned, anxious, \nand worried. Along with all Americans, we have nervously waited as this \nbudget impasse puts every citizen in a precarious situation.\n  It seems incredible to me on a day where the Government is shut down \nand the budget is in crisis we are on the floor of the Senate debating \na major giveaway to foreign oil companies. I must say that I am deeply \nconcerned that in the midst of a national catastrophe we may pass \nlegislation that begins another national crisis.\n  I know that not all of my colleagues understand the ramifications of \nS. 395. I realize that many feel this is an Alaskan issue and, because \nof that, some have questioned my intense interest in this issue. For \nnearly 2 days this past spring I held the Senate floor expressing my \ndissatisfaction with this bill. I often stood alone. But in the end \nseveral of my colleagues came forward to express concerns of their own. \nAll of the arguments raised on each side of this issue are, \nunfortunately, based on assumptions, and that remains the crux of our \nproblem in this debate. Those in favor of exporting Alaskan North Slope \noil say it will increase production, promote jobs, and raise revenues \nfor the State of Alaska. These are positive possibilities that \ncertainly help my neighboring State of Alaska, and if the impact of \nexporting that oil stops within Alaska's boundaries, I would have \nwholeheartedly accepted this legislation and would have wished my \nneighbor success. However, that additional income for a few of our \ncitizens must be weighed by a body charged with addressing the concerns \nof an entire nation.\n\n  After 8 months of intense scrutiny of this issue, I am still \nconvinced that the exporting of American oil can only lead to job \nlosses, price increases, a dependence on foreign oil, and great \nenvironmental risks.\n  I know that my colleagues from Alaska can show stunning charts that \npredict differently. However, these are merely predictions. We do not \nknow that tankers heading to Asia with Alaskan oil will not stay in \nAsia for ship repair. This means 5,000 jobs within our region and $160 \nmillion in annual employment income--more than half of the marine \nindustry's west coast employment.\n  We do not know that Alaskan oil, once bound for independent \nrefineries within Puget Sound will now steer for Far-Eastern markets \nthrowing 2,000 refinery workers out on the streets. We do not know that \nexports of our oil will not lead to price increases at the pump for our \ncitizens.\n  And perhaps most importantly to me and the millions of residents of \nWashington State that live, play, and work \n\n[[Page S 17025]]\nalong the beautiful waters of Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de \nFuca, we have no guarantee that exporting U.S. oil will not lead to \nincreased oil imports on environmentally risky, foreign ships. The \nCoast Guard rates as high risk one half of the current foreign tanker \nfleet that carries crude through Puget Sound.\n  This is why I have stood for so long. I have remained stubborn and \nangered some of my colleagues for concerns that I truly believe \noutweigh the benefits garnered by a single State.\n  I was able to include several amendments that I thought would attempt \nto address these concerns. Knowing that a Senate cloture vote was \nimpossible, I relented on this legislation with the assurance that my \namendments would be included. These amendments included a thorough GAO \nstudy that examines job, price, and environmental changes before oil \nexports may begin. I was also able to include language that mandated an \nescort vessel, dedicated at the entry to Washington State waters and \navailable 24 hours a day to assist tankers that have run adrift.\n  For the first time, we had created legislation that proactively \nfought oilspills. This amendment would have prevented the spill before \nit occurred rather than focusing on the millions spent on cleanup of \nthese spills once the damage is done.\n  Unfortunately, even this was too much for House conferees concerned \nmore with overmanagement of the Coast Guard rather than the protection \nof our fragile coast. The current language adopted by the House \nmandates a 15-month plan that would implement a private-sector tug-of-\nopportunity system. This system utilizes current vessels already in \noperation, coordinated to provide timely emergency response to vessels \nin distress. It also directs the Coast Guard commandant to work with \nthe Canadian Government in implementing this plan and making available \nCoast Guard equipment for purposes of response.\n  I am pleased that this language incorporates the private industry. I \napplaud the proactive segments of this community who came forward to \nseek a compromised solution. Our intent was never to tax cargo and \ngrain shippers, but to impose a fee on those who stand to gain millions \nfrom these oil exports--the oil companies themselves. This new \namendment does clarify that U.S. shippers will not be taxed and their \ncontinued desire to meet these environmental concerns is commendable.\n  I still feel this language does not go far enough, though. I am \nconcerned that without a dedicated vessel at one location, the \navailability of an operating tug may put them out of reach of the \ndistressed vessel. I am also concerned that once that tug reaches the \ndistressed tanker, it may not have the capability to tow that large \nvessel, or in the least hold it from running aground.\n  Sadly, we may not know the answers to all of these questions until \noil is exported, foreign tankers are moving through our waters and we \nexperience a major oilspill. None of us, particularly my colleagues \nfrom Alaska, ever want to relive the Valdez situation. None of us want \noil on our hands under our watch. When and where it will happen remains \nthe paramount question. I only hope that all in this body can head home \nat night knowing that we did all within our power to decrease that \nrisk. The White House has committed to me that they will proactively \nseek out these risks, even before the 15-month study expires. They are \nprepared to conduct hearings in the State that address these issues and \nwill enter into the Record a letter from the White House stating these \nactions. I appreciate that commitment and hope I can count on the \nAlaskan leadership to do all that they can to meet these environmental \nconcerns before exports begin.\n  I realize that I can stand again for 2 days or 2 weeks and try to \ndelay this legislation. However, I am a realist who knows that this \nlegislation could be attached to reconciliation without amendments, and \nI understand that the votes to stop these exports that were there for \ndecades have now been reversed. I only ask my colleagues to try to \nunderstand some of the logic that has motivated the debate to export \noil. It is truly in our national interest to produce our own oil, and \nif we agree that the North Slope of Alaska has a finite amount of oil \nleft, why must we send our oil overseas and more quickly dry up our own \nwells? There are certainly projected increases, but to whose benefit?--\nexecutives of British Petroleum and car owners in Tokyo.\n  Further, it will only lead us closer and much more quickly to the \nopening of ANWR. More U.S. oil can be expected to be exported, and will \nagain pit profits of international interests against environmental \nconcerns.\n  I ask everyone to consider the implications of exporting our oil: the \npolicy implications, job risks, price concerns, and environmental \nrisks. If you truly believe that these questions pale in comparison to \nthe profits of a very few, then support 395. Otherwise, vote with a \nclear conscience that errs on the side of people and the world we are \nentrusted to protect. I urge my colleagues to vote against this \nconference report.\n  Again, Mr. President, I must say that it does seem very disconcerting \nto me when my office phones are ringing off the hook with my \nconstituents who are saying this Government is shut down, it is hurting \nme, and it is hurting our country. It is not the right direction that \nwe are standing in front of this body debating a bill that will benefit \nan oil company, a special interest.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. I believe my senior colleague from \nAlaska would like time on this bill. I yield 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, let me ask the Senator from \nMassachusetts. Is he going to make a statement on this? Does the \nSenator from Massachusetts seek time on this bill, or another matter?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Senator sought time on the bill but not \nspeaking specifically to the subject matter.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, in February, Senator Murkowski and I introduced this \nbill, the Alaska Power Administration Sale Act. There are several bills \nput together here. I am very pleased to be here today to congratulate \nSenator Murkowski and to speak in support of this conference report. \nThe House has agreed to this bill, and the President said that he would \nsign it. I urge the Members of the Senate to support the conference \nreport.\n  For Senators not familiar with the Alaska Power Administration, I \nwould like to point out that Congress authorized the Eklutna and \nSnettisham hydroelectric projects in 1950 and in 1962, respectively. \nThose were to encourage and promote economic development and to foster \nestablishment of essential industry in Alaska. The projects have \nprovided, at moderate prices, substantial amounts of hydroelectric \nenergy for marketing in our area. There are no other proposed Federal \nprojects in Alaska.\n  As Alaska's economy has grown, the relative importance of the Federal \npower program in Alaska has decreased. This is a bill that is long \noverdue. The idea to privatize the Alaska Power Administration is not \nnew. During the Nixon administration, I introduced the bill that \nproposed to sell the Federal energy project in Alaska, and in the last \n20 years, during three administrations, there have been 14 different \nstudies of whether or not this APA, as we call it, should be \nprivatized.\n  Today, more than 90 percent of the State's electric power needs are \nprovided by non-Federal power plants. Federal operations such as the \nAlaska Power Administration can be managed more efficiently by non-\nFederal public or private entities. The State of Alaska and the local \nelectric utilities which have entered into formal agreements to \npurchase these projects are capable of planning, building, and managing \nour State's power facilities in a manner that is consistent with our \nfuture energy needs.\n  We are concerned about the people who work for the Alaska Power \nAdministration, and we should be. Today, \n\n[[Page S 17026]]\nthere are 34 people who still work in the Federal Government for the \nAPA. The project purchasers have pledged to hire as many of these \nemployees as possible, and the Department of Energy has pledged that it \nwill offer employment to any Alaska Power Administration employee who \ndoes not receive offers, although the Department jobs are probably \ngoing to be in what we call the lower 48 States.\n  The sales of Eklutna and Snettisham are expected to generate Federal \nproceeds now of about $73 million. That is nearly a total recovery of \nthe original investment in these projects, and there have been payments \nmade over the period of their use.\n  The sale and termination of the Alaska Power Administration now is \nsupported by each of the Alaska Power Administration's utility \ncustomers, the municipalities of Juneau and Anchorage, Alaska's \nGovernor, and the administration here in Washington.\n  I do support that portion of this conference report and urge the \nSenate to approve the report that recommends the privatization of the \nAPA.\n  Let me now just mention briefly title II, which is the Trans-Alaska \nPipeline Authorization Act amendment, which will permit the export of \nAlaska's North Slope crude oil carried in U.S.-flag vessels.\n  This legislation will create jobs and economic wealth around the \nNation and increase oil production in Alaska and in California. It will \nensure the survival of an independent U.S. tanker fleet manned by U.S. \ncrews, a critical component I believe of our national security.\n  This legislation eliminates the discrimination that has persisted \nexclusively against our State of Alaska for over 20 years, and the \ncitizens of Alaska have waited for this day. They have waited too long.\n  For those who may have forgotten, who were not around then, the first \nexport restrictions of Alaska North Slope crude oil were enacted after \ncommencement of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War and the first Arab boycott. \nMany believed that enactment of these restrictions would enhance our \nnational security. Congress effectively banned export of Alaska crude \noil in 1979, following a second major oil shock. But times have \nchanged, and I have argued for a long time that the ban itself was and \nis unconstitutional.\n  We have discovered that the ban has had the unintended effect of \nactually threatening our energy security by discouraging further energy \nproduction and creating unfair hardships for the struggling oil \nindustry, particularly in the Southwest. Fundamentally, the existing \nexport restriction distorts the crude oil markets in Alaska and the \nwest coast. The ban has created a glut of oil on the west coast, and \nfaced with glut-induced prices small independent producers have been \nforced to abandon wells, the so-called stripper wells, particularly in \nCalifornia.\n  In 1994, for the first time in history, more than half of the oil \nused in the United States was imported at a cost of over $50 billion a \nyear. By the year 2010, we will be importing over 60 percent of our oil \nneeds but part of the reason is the reason for this legislation itself. \nWe have in our increased reliance on foreign oil brought about the \nsituation where it is not profitable to drill and produce new \ndiscoveries in our own country. We are importing over half of our \nNation's oil not because consumption is rising but because domestic \nproduction is declining so significantly and this legislation will \nprovide the incentive to domestic producers to correct that situation.\n  Currently, most North Slope crude oil is delivered to the west coast, \nespecially California, on U.S.-flag vessels. The existence of a single \nmarket for Alaskan oil drastically reduces the value of the oil and \ncreates an artificial surplus on the west coast. This depresses the \nproduction and development of both North Slope crude and the heavy \ncrude produced by small independent producers in California.\n  As existing oil fields become depleted, the domestic oil industry \nmust find new sources of oil and new technologies of production if they \nare going to stay in business. But they don't have the incentive.\n  In June 1994, the Department of Energy issued a comprehensive report \nas part of the administration's ``Domestic Natural Gas and Oil \nInitiative.'' The Department concluded in this report that the export \nban is an artificial subsidy that has depressed the price that west \ncoast refiners pay for crude oil. A key conclusion of the report is \nthat the national economic and energy benefits of permitting export of \nAlaska North Slipe crude oil would be significant. It would create new \njobs, stimulate onshore production, and increase State and Federal \nrevenues.\n  Oil production-related employment would increase by up to 25,000 jobs \nnationally by the end of the decade; many would be in California oil \nproduction.\n  The export of Alaskan oil would boost production in Alaska and \nCalifornia by 100,000 to 110,000 barrels per day by the end of the \ncentury.\n  Federal receipts would total between $99 and $180 million in 1992 \ndollars.\n  Alaska and California would also gain. Alaska would gain $700 million \nto $1.6 billion in taxes and royalties, while California's return would \nbe as much as $230 million. These are net gains.\n  The Department of Energy also found that there would be no \nsignificant environmental implications from the export of Alaskan oil.\n  Mr. President, in addition to creating jobs and economic wealth for \nthe Nation at little cost to the environment, this legislation will go \na long way toward helping to preserve our U.S. tanker fleet. Congress \nhas a compelling interest in preserving a fleet essential to the \nNation's military security, especially one which transports such a \nvaluable commodity as oil. This bill requires that Alaskan oil exports \nbe carried in U.S.-flag vessels. The only exceptions are exports to \nIsrael under a bilateral treaty and to others under the international \nemergency oil sharing plan of the International Energy Agency.\n  Finally, as I have said before, the prohibition on the export of \nAlaskan North Slope crude oil is unfair. Alaska is the only State \nprohibited from exporting its most marketable product.\n  Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity to speak in support of \nthis legislation. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I do again congratulate the chairman of the Energy Committee, my good \nfriend and colleague, Senator Murkowski, for his persistence, and I \nthank him for the opportunity to speak in support of this conference \nreport. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  If I have any further time, I yield it back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I did want to enter into the Record a statement from the \nWhite House at this point stating their plans to evaluate the \nenvironmental problems including holding field hearings in my State. \nIronically, due to the Government shutdown, the Council of Economic \nAdvisers and other White House staff working on that letter had to go \nhome at noon today, so I will have to submit it when I get it. I guess \nirony goes to show it is extremely incredible to me that we are \ncontinuing to talk about this bill at a time when our budget is in \ncrisis.\n  I yield to my colleague from Massachusetts 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                       Shutdown of the Government\n\n  Mr. President, I had hoped to have time later today to talk about the \nsituation we find ourselves in with respect to the budget and the so-\ncalled shutdown of Government. Regrettably, we hear that the majority \nleader is going to, at least it appears, put the Senate into recess \nafter the discussion on this bill. I think it would be unfortunate to \ndeprive the Senate of the debate it is supposed to have on issues of \ngreat concern, and I hope it is not true that the majority leader \nintends to recess the Senate as a way of silencing voices that want to \ntalk about what is happening to this country.\n  Mr. President, what we find ourselves in is a moment of entirely \npredictable, crass, brazen, craven, basic political trickery.\n  What we are living out at this moment is a simple choice by the \nSpeaker of the House to confront America, and to confront the Senate, \nwith either \n\n[[Page S 17027]]\nbowing to the will of one group of people, without the legislative \nprocess duly working its will, or suffering the consequences of a \nshutdown. That is what has happened. It is fundamentally a form of \nblackmail. It is a hard term. It is a tough term. But that is exactly \nwhat is happening. It is either, you accept our way or everybody is \ngoing to pay a big price. Either you buy on to those things, which we \nare not able to pass through the normal legislative process, or we're \nwilling to shut the Government down.\n  Now, our colleague from North Dakota shared with us earlier this \nmorning some very important statements that simply document what I have \njust said. If you do not want to believe the partisan words of a \nDemocrat, fine. But listen to what Newt Gingrich himself said. On April \n3, in the Washington Times, Newt Gingrich vowed to ``create a titanic \nlegislative standoff with President Clinton by adding vetoed bills to \nmust-pass legislation, increasing the national debt ceiling.''\n  On April 3, again the Washington Times, Speaker Gingrich boasted that \nthe President ``will veto a number of things, and we'll then put them \nall on the debt ceiling. And then he'll decide how big a crisis he \nwants.''\n  On June 3, Speaker Gingrich, in the Rocky Mountain News, said, :\n\n       We're going to go over the liberal Democratic part of the \n     government and then say to them: `We could last 60 days, 90 \n     days, 120 days, five years, a century. There's a lot of stuff \n     we don't care if it's ever funded.\n\n  What is the ``stuff'' they do not care if it is ever funded? Well, \nevidently it is money for veterans because $15 billion is going to be \ncut right after we just marched around and celebrated Veterans Day. \nPerhaps as many as 35 out of 172 hospitals will be shut over the next 7 \nyears; 5 in the next year. I have veterans all over my State saying to \nme, ``What are you guys doing? Don't you remember the contract, the \nreal contract with America?''\n  Evidently, what they are willing to shut down is education, making it \nmore expensive for kids to go to school, at the same time as they give \npeople earning more than $300,000 a tax break; a fundamental breach of \nfairness.\n  Now, I am not the only one who feels that fundamental breach of \nfairness. Let me read what one of their own, David Gergen, wrote just \nyesterday in the U.S. News & World Report. The headline: ``The GOP's \n`Fairness Doctrine'.'' And what he says is:\n\n       U.S. News reported last week that internal studies by the \n     executive branch estimate that the lowest 20 percent of the \n     population would lose more income under these spending cuts \n     than the rest of the population combined. At the other end, \n     the highest 20 percent would gain more from the tax cuts than \n     everyone else combined.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Ronald Reagan is often invoked as the patron saint of this \n     revolution. How soon we forget that as president, Reagan \n     insisted that seven key programs in the safety net--Head \n     Start, Medicare, Social Security, veterans, Supplemental \n     Security Income, school lunches, and summer jobs for youth--\n     would not be touched; now, six of those seven are under the \n     knife.\n\n  So, Mr. President, what we have here is a fundamental confrontation \nwith fairness, a fundamental confrontation with how we should do our \nlegislative business.\n  We Democrats are prepared to vote for a temporary extension \nimmediately and are prepared to negotiate a fair budget. But Newt \nGingrich and his soul mates want to come down here and say, ``Oh, no, \nno, no, no, that is not good enough. You're going to have to accept \nprograms that we want to pass that we're not able to pass through the \nnormal process. And if you don't do that, we're willing to continue to \nkeep the Government shut down.''\n  So, they have huge Medicare cuts included in here.\n  Mr. President, I ask for 2 additional minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senator is recognized for 2 \nadditional minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, here are these massive Medicare cuts, the \nlargest ever in recent--I think ever in American history, $270 billion, \nso you can have a $245 billion tax cut. We have had 1 day of hearings \non the impact of those cuts, and yet we have had in the House 42 days \nof hearings on Whitewater, Waco, and Ruby Ridge, and in the Senate we \nhave had about 48 days of hearings on Whitewater and Ruby Ridge. One \nday of hearings on Medicare, which will affect millions of citizens, \nand day after day after day of hearings on Whitewater and Ruby Ridge. \nAnd now they are trying to ram that through with increases in Medicare \npayments on senior citizens by holding the entire Government hostage.\n  Mr. President, it just violates most Americans' sense of fairness. It \nviolates the tradition in this institution of legislating and of \nletting the votes fall where they may in trying to decide something. It \nreally violates, I think, everybody's sense of how we ought to do \nbusiness here. I tell you, as you look around the country, this is a \nvery different revolution from what most Americans wanted.\n\n  Most Americans voted for common sense. We are prepared to balance the \nbudget. We are prepared to try to do it in 7 years or whatever. We are \nprepared to do that, Mr. President. But we are not prepared to succumb \nto a kind of political blackmail that forces people to do things that \nare against the Constitution of this country. And I hope that in the \nhours ahead, we will get back to a levelheadedness, a reasonableness \nthat is the higher standard of how we should do business in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield back, if there is any time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is my hope that later today we will \nhave an opportunity to have a discussion with our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle about the issues that have brought us to this \npoint. I must say that I think today describes for all the American \npeople why it is important, even in the Contract With America, to \nunderstand what the fine print in the contract really means.\n  We are starting now to discover that something that is high sounding \nand was put together through polls and focus groups that looked \nattractive to the American people has some fine print that causes some \ndilemma.\n  My colleague just read an analysis of this by David Gergen. David \nGergen has worked in two Republican administrations: President Reagan \nand President Bush. He also worked in the Clinton administration. He \ndescribed our circumstances this way: He said, ``The Republicans should \nget some credit for wanting to balance the budget.'' I agree. So should \nDemocrats. In 1993, when we had a bill on the floor of the Senate that \ncut $500 billion from the deficit and led us to a position from having \na $270 billion yearly deficit down to a $160 billion yearly deficit, I \nvoted for that. That was heavy lifting because a lot of it was not very \npopular.\n  We did not get one Republican vote, not even by accident. You would \nthink occasionally someone would make a mistake here and vote for \nsomething good. But we did not even get one Republican vote for that. \nWe passed it with all Democratic votes. The fact is, the deficit \nsubstantially reduced from $270 billion down to $160 billion.\n\n  There is a lot of work left to do. I agree with that. And I think \nboth parties ought to roll up their sleeves and get it done. But David \nGergen is absolutely correct when he describes the problem with the \nContract With America and the imposition of this so-called solution on \nthe country at this point.\n  What he describes is this: He says that a study that was developed \nlast week shows the lowest 20 percent of the population would lose more \nincome from these spending cuts. The lowest 20 percent would \nessentially lose more income than the top 80 percent. And he says the \ntax cuts--the top 20 percent will gain more from those tax cuts than \nthe entire bottom 80 percent.\n  Let me frame it a little differently. The priorities here are what is \nat odds. It is the disagreement; it is not the goal. All of us think we \nought to balance the budget. The question is how? My hometown has about \n400 people. Let us assume we had a town meeting in my hometown in North \nDakota and said, ``All of you take chairs.'' So we sat them all down. \nWe sat them down. \n\n[[Page S 17028]]\n\n  We say, ``All right, those in here with the least income, the 20 \npercent of you with the least income, we would like you to stand up.'' \nSo 20 percent of the population with the lowest income in my town \nstands up. And we say, ``All right, we've got a deal for you. We have \nall these spending cuts. You 20 percent with the lowest income in our \ntown, you get 80 percent of the spending cuts. You are going to lose 80 \npercent of the income from these spending cuts.'' Then we say, ``All \nright, you sit down.''\n  Now, how about the 20 percent with the highest incomes in my \nhometown? ``Why don't you all stand up?'' And so the 20 percent with \nthe highest incomes in my hometown stand up, and we say, ``We've got a \ndeal for you. We're going to give you 80 percent. You 20 percent with \nthe highest incomes, we're going to give you 80 percent of the tax \ncut.''\n  Does anybody think there is any reasonable standard of fairness by \nwhich you could suggest that makes sense; the bottom 20 percent of the \nincome earners take 80 percent of the spending cuts and the top 20 \npercent of the income earners take 80 percent of the tax breaks? Well, \nthat is what the Contract With America gives us.\n  We come to a debate about priorities. It is a worthy debate to have. \nSome say, ``Let's build star wars. Let's buy B-2 bombers. Let's have \nmore F-15's and F-16's than the Pentagon ordered and, by the way, even \nthough we can afford all that, let's kick 55,000 kids off Head Start. \nLet's decide not to provide the kind of resources necessary to help \nlow-income people stay warm in the winter. Let's decide we have low-\nincome veterans with disabilities that are not going to get all they \nshould get. Let's decide to make it harder for middle-income families \nto send their kids to college.''\n  Those are enormous differences in priorities. The debate is about \npriorities, not the goal, and the priorities are important. We do not \ncome to this point by accident, the point of a shutdown.\n  Last April, Speaker Gingrich started to boast about this. On April 3, \nhe vowed ``to create a titanic legislative standoff with President \nClinton by adding vetoed bills to must-pass legislation increasing the \nnational debt ceiling.''\n  I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 1 minute.\n  Mr. DORGAN. He boasted that the President ``will veto a number of \nthings, and we'll then put them all on the debt ceiling. And then he'll \ndecide how big a crisis he wants.''\n  Speaker Gingrich says: ``I don't care what the price is. I don't care \nif we have no executive offices and no bonds for 30 days--not this \ntime.''\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. What was the date of those remarks?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Some were April. The last one was September 22.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The early one you quoted was April?\n  Mr. DORGAN. April 3.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So this is not a recent thing Speaker Gingrich said.\n  Mr. DORGAN. No. The point of all this is, this is not a train wreck \nthat ought to surprise everybody. This is the engineer of a locomotive \nwho predicted in April he is going to cause a train wreck, boasted \nabout it. I do not think anybody ought to take great credit for \nshutting down the Federal Government, all because the priorities are to \nsay we would like to give the poorest people in town all the spending \ncuts and the richest people in town all the tax breaks.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield, the Senator has made a very \nimportant point here. This is something that has been planned for some \nmonths.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield my colleague from North Dakota 3 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think the Senator from North Dakota is making a very \nimportant point. I think a lot of people are confused who think this \nhas happened over the last couple of days and it just sort of happened \nbecause things did not work out right.\n  If I understand what the Senator from North Dakota is saying, and \nreading the quotes of Speaker Gingrich as long ago as April, this has \nsort of been a plan to create this kind of train wreck, and the Senator \nquoted Speaker Gingrich saying this back in April.\n  I think the American people ought to understand that this is not \nsomething that just happened; that because the Speaker and his allies \nhave not been able to get their work done in time--I will ask the \nSenator, is it not true that we did not filibuster, we did not stop \nthese bills from going through?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Iowa is correct. In fact, only three \nappropriations bills have been signed by the President because he has \nnot gotten the rest of them. The work was not done on time. In fact, \nthe reconciliation bill is due on June 15. It is now 5 months later. It \nis scheduled to come to the floor later this week, but it is 5 months \nlate.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield further. Watching and observing \nthe flow of legislation through here during the spring and summer and \nhow it was slowed down, we did not filibuster. Things just did not \nhappen. Like in the Agriculture Committee, we could not get our ag bill \nthrough. We still do not have an ag bill this late in the year. Now it \noccurs to me perhaps this was a design all along to create this \nimpasse; to create an impasse so that we would have the kind of train \nwreck that we are looking at here with the shutting down of the \nGovernment. Just too many of these things fit together. It indicates to \nme that this has been part of an overall plan for some time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might say, this is not a search for villains, it is \na search for solutions. This country has vexing problems, and we have \nto address the problems, but we do not solve problems by deciding to \ncreate train wrecks.\n  I will say again, Speaker Gingrich on November 8 said ``he would \nforce the Government to miss interest and principal payments for the \nfirst time ever to force Democrat Clinton's administration to agree to \nhis'' deficit reduction plan. That is November 8, Investor's Business \nDaily. The point is, this is not an accident.\n\n  In the Chaplain's prayer this morning at the start of the Senate \nsession, he talked about the need for people to come together and to \nreason together. That is the basis of 200 years of democratic \nGovernment.\n  We must find a compromise. We have people of vastly different views \nin a representative democracy. How do you resolve those? Over 200 \nyears, you resolve them by coming together and reasoning and reaching a \nreasonable compromise.\n  The American people have a good sense of what is fair, a good sense \nof what a good compromise ought to be. What the American people have \nsaid clearly in the last couple of months is they are worried about the \nextremes here. People who never cared much about Medicare now pretend \nthey want to save it. They do not want to save it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Washington, \nand I join my colleagues in regretting that it has been the decision of \nthe majority leader not to permit those of us who want to be able to \nspeak to the Senate and to talk with our colleagues about the current \ncrisis that is affecting so many families, not only here in Washington \nbut all across this Nation with all of the uncertainty it brings, to \ntry to at least address that issue and to try and find some common \nground in terms of how to avoid this current situation.\n  I am grateful to the Senator from Washington for letting me speak \nbriefly on the issue of where we are at this time and what we must look \nat.\n  Madam President, the fundamental issue that divides the Democrats and \nRepublicans is how to balance the budget. Only a few moments ago, the \nPresident of the United States, in an excellent address, restated his \nstrong commitment to a balanced budget and challenged our Republican \nfriends to work with him to try and achieve that in a way that is going \nto be fair and \n\n[[Page S 17029]]\nwhere the issues of equity are going to be addressed.\n  It is reckless and wrong for the Republicans to effectively shut down \nthe Federal Government because they cannot get their way in balancing \nthe budget. The Democrats categorically reject the Republican \npriorities that balance the budget on the backs of senior citizens, \nstudents, working families, and the environment.\n\n  I, too, was a candidate in 1994. When I traveled around \nMassachusetts, my Republican opponents were not saying we are treating \nour elderly too well; we think that their copays and deductibles and \npremiums ought to go up; we think that we ought to tighten the belt on \nthose who have contributed so much to making this a great country, who \nworked their way through the Great Depression and fought in the wars, \nthat was never mentioned by my Republican opponent.\n  We have to tighten the belt on education. Under this proposal, they \nare cutting 40 percent of all the education programs--all the education \nprograms--$36 billion in cuts over the next 7 years under the \nRepublican opposition, and about $30 billion in higher education. I did \nnot travel around Massachusetts and hear we are doing too much in the \neducation of handicapped children, or we are doing too much in terms of \nfeeding children, or we are doing too much in taking down the dollar \nsign for the schools and colleges.\n  We do not want signs on the schools and colleges of Massachusetts \nsaying: ``Wealthy only need apply.''\n  In the course of that campaign, I did not hear Republicans use the \nargument that working families of this country that are making up to \n$28,000, $29,000 and have several children and are able to have the \nEITC, have too much disposable income. We always hear on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate, ``Well, let's give the money back to the individuals \nwho spend it. They can make a better judgment about how to spend their \nmoney than the Federal Government.''\n  That seems to be a good enough rule for the wealthy individuals in \nthis country but not for the working families, those that are making up \nto $30,000 a year. This Republican budget is saying that they are going \nto have their taxes increased. No one was talking about that in 1994 \nand no one was talking about putting additional kinds of pressures on \nthe needy, particularly the children. The belt is going to be tightened \non the children of this country perhaps more severely than anyone else.\n  No one was talking about our air was too clean, our water was too \npure, that what we have to do is make way to limit the kinds of \nregulations and protections on legislation that, by and large, were \nsigned by Republican Presidents and worked through this Congress in \nbipartisan ways.\n  No one was talking about those particular issues in 1994, but I can \ntell you something, they will be talking about it in 1996, because \nthose are the issues that are being addressed. And on each and every \none of those issues, the Republican budget flunks every responsible \ntest. The current Republican strategy is a serious mistake. If they \nwant to enact priorities like this, they are going to have to elect a \nRepublican President in 1996, and that is not going to happen.\n\n  In sum, the current shutdown of the Federal Government is taking \nplace, just as Speaker Gingrich has been planning and boasting about \nall year. My colleague from Massachusetts and my colleague from North \nDakota have made that case here this afternoon. The shutdown is \nentirely unnecessary. We are at this point because the Republicans, who \ncontrol the Congress, have passed only 4 of the 13 annual bills \nnecessary to appropriate the funds to keep the Federal Government open \nfor the coming year--only 4 of the 13 annual bills. They have failed to \nmeet their responsibilities in this whole appropriations process.\n  Those bills should have been passed by October 1, 6 weeks ago. We are \n6 weeks into the new fiscal year, and the Republicans in Congress have \nnot done their job.\n  The Government shutdown is part of a long-term strategy by the \nSpeaker and the radical Republicans in Congress to force President \nClinton to approve their extreme measures to destroy Medicare. Let it \nwither on the vine, as Gingrich said, cut education, limit the health \nand safety protections that have been built up over 30 years.\n  The Democratic plan is based on genuine American values and \npriorities. It is a plan to balance the budget fairly, not at the \nexpense of families and the environment, and it deserves to be passed \nby the Congress.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time is left on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 29 minutes, 45 seconds, and \nthe Senator from Alaska has 27 minutes, 51 seconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Does the Senator from Alaska wish to take some time?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would like to continue to hold my time because \nseveral Senators are coming. So I will defer to the Democratic side.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nIowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. To follow up on my colloquy with the \nSenator from North Dakota, let me just state that today the Republican \nleadership has put our country into an artificial crisis--an artificial \ncrisis--which is a very cynical act, and I think a very shameful act.\n  Let us make no mistake about what is going on. The Republican \nleadership is holding a gun to the head of the President and the whole \nGovernment, saying that if they are not able to get their way by \ncutting Medicare, by putting an additional $130-a-year burden on our \nseniors, on their part B premiums, they are going to shut the \nGovernment down.\n  Let me repeat that. The Republican leadership is saying that unless \nyou let us put an additional tax on seniors of $130 per senior, per \nyear for Medicare part B, we are going to shut the Government down.\n  I do not know what they could possibly be thinking about. The \nAmerican people have said, very loudly and clearly, that they do not \nwant to cut Medicare. Our elderly are saying, look, we have enough \nbills to pay, and now you want us to pay more? It is $132 a year--what \na ransom; holding the elderly ransom to get their way, and shutting \ndown the Government.\n  Madam President, 50 percent of the elderly in the State of Iowa have \nan annual income of less than $12,000 a year. Eighty percent of the \nelderly have an income of less than $25,000 a year. Now they are being \ntold they have to pay an additional $130 a year for Medicare part B \npremiums. That is the rider that is on the continuing resolution.\n  The President of the United States has said, ``You take that off and \nwe will negotiate.'' He is right. That is nonnegotiable, especially on \na continuing resolution. If the Republicans want to put it on \nlegislation and pass it, as they try to do through the reconciliation \nprocess, that is fine. But to use a short-term resolution to keep the \nGovernment operating is really a cynical and a shameful act.\n  It also really amazes me that Republicans are willing to go after the \nseniors to raise the money for Medicare before they go after waste, \nfraud and abuse. This Senator offered an amendment on the \nreconciliation bill that would have saved billions of dollars by \ncutting out waste, fraud, and abuse. It would have provided, for the \nfirst time, competitive bidding for durable medical equipment and \nmedical supplies in Medicare.\n  Madam President, I had one of my staff people go to several \ndrugstores in Iowa to get the price of a bandage. The average price, \nretail, was 17 cents. The same bandage cost the Veterans' \nAdministration 4 cents. That same bandage costs Medicare 86 cents. Why \nMedicare 86 cents, and the Veterans' Administration 4 cents for the \nsame bandage? Because the Veterans' Administration uses competitive \nbidding; Medicare does not.\n  My amendment was simply to do what I thought most of my fellow \nSenators on the other side of the aisle speak so loudly about--``free \nenterprise, capitalism, competitive bidding, that is the way to go.'' \nYet, every single Republican voted against my amendment to provide for \ncompetitive bidding. I do not know why because we have it in the \nVeterans Administration, and it works well. But, for some reason, we \ncannot apply it to Medicare.\n  My amendment would have provided for better computers and software to \ncatch more fraud. But, no, we could not do that. But we can tell the \nseniors to \n\n[[Page S 17030]]\npay $130 more a month. But, no, we cannot have competitive bidding, you \nsee.\n  Why is this so important, Madam President? Last year, I asked the GAO \nto do an investigation on medical supplies, and here is what they \nfound. They took a sample of high dollar claims that Medicare had paid, \nand they went behind the bills to get an itemized statement. This is \ngoing to shock you. I have stated it many times on the floor, so maybe \nyou know the figures already. GAO found that 89 percent of the claims \nshould have been totally or partially denied; 61 percent of the dollars \nspent by Medicare should never have been spent; 61 percent paid out \nwasted.\n  What does that amount to? Well, last year, Medicare was billed $6.8 \nbillion for medical supplies--$6.8 billion. If you take 61 percent and \nsay it should have been paid out, you are talking about $4 billion a \nyear. Just take 50 percent and you are talking about $3 billion a year. \nBut, no, no, we cannot go after that, you see. There are a lot of big, \npowerful medical supply companies in this country making a lot of money \non that. We cannot go after that. But we can go after the seniors in my \nState who make $10,000 a year.\n  So what the Republicans are doing, I think, is a very shameful act in \ntrying to force onto the continuing resolution the $130 more.\n  Last, Madam President, here is another quote. The Senator from North \nDakota read some quotes. Here is a quote by Representative Kasich:\n\n       I do not see the Government shutdown as a negative; I see \n     it as a positive, if things get righted.\n\n  Congressman Christensen said:\n\n       If we have to temporarily shut down the Government to get \n     people's attention to show that we are going to balance the \n     budget, then so be it.\n\n  What are we talking about? Madam President, 800,000--I am told--\nGovernment workers went home today because the Government shut down. \nWho are these people? Madam President, they are people like you and \nme. These are mothers and fathers. These are people with children. \nThese are people that have illnesses at home. These are people that \nhave mortgages to pay and car payments to pay, maybe have one or two \nkids in college that are trying to get through college.\n\n  These are not some kind of people that are not part of our American \nfamily of workers. Yet somehow we are being told they are worthless--\nsend them home, we do not care.\n  What a hard-hearted, cruel approach to take, that somehow these \nGovernment workers who are outstanding upright taxpaying God-fearing \nAmericans who do their job for the American people, that somehow they \nare not worth anything and they can go home.\n  It is cruel and it is heartless. I think the American people \nunderstand that. That is why I hope that we can reason together, get \nthe Medicare off the table, have a short-term CR. We can get together.\n  I add one thing. I happen to sit on the Agriculture Committee. I \npicked up the paper this morning and I found out the chairman of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee has announced that the conferees have \nreached an agreement on an agriculture bill, and this Senator has never \neven been invited to one meeting. What does that say for trying to work \ntogether?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 22 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Is anyone seeking recognition? How much time would the \nSenator from North Carolina require?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I request 10 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n             Balanced Budget Lacks Presidential Commitment\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Just a few minutes ago the President spoke to the \nNation in a press conference. I watched his speech and was amazed at \nthe sincerity, that he appears to really believe what he was saying. \nCertainly what he has been doing does not match what he was saying.\n  Madam President, last night the Federal Government ran out of money \nand thousands of Federal workers were sent home. The question on \neveryone's mind is, why will Bill Clinton not agree to a balanced \nbudget? Why will Bill Clinton not agree to a balanced budget?\n  He has flipped and flopped so many times on the budget that it is \nhard to know where he stands on the issue. It should be perfectly clear \nthat the blame for this shutdown can be traced directly to the White \nHouse and not anywhere else, and to the President's new imagemakers at \nthe House. They are determined that he appear strong, regardless of the \nconsequences to the Nation.\n\n  As a candidate for the Presidency, Bill Clinton promised to balance a \nbudget in 5 years. However, once in office, he flipped on the campaign \npromise. In fact, Bill Clinton has never submitted to Congress a plan \nfor balancing the budget. The first budget which he submitted this year \nnever reached balance, and he knew it when he submitted it.\n  After consulting with pollsters and realizing that Congress was \nserious about reaching a balanced budget in 7 years, Bill Clinton \nflipped again and submitted a second budget which he claimed would \nbalance the budget in 10 years. However, that was not true and he knew \nit when it was submitted.\n  For all the flipping and flopping, Bill Clinton is not making any \nheadway on the budget. In fact, in this very body, not a single Member \nof the Senate--Democrat or Republican--voted for his budget--not one. \nRealizing the American people knew that he was not serious about a 10-\nyear budget plan, he flipped again and accepted a congressional \ntimeframe of 7 years.\n  We are now hours away from having a conference report on a balanced \nbudget. Congressional leaders have invited the President to begin \nworking with us. For 26 hours last week he was on the same plane with \nSpeaker Newt Gingrich and Majority Leader Dole. A captive audience--no \nnegotiation. Madam President, 26 hours of prime time and he did not use \nit.\n  Last Friday he told Congress to remain in session as he got into a \nGovernment limousine and rode off to the golf course. No negotiation.\n  The fact of the matter is that Bill Clinton just is not serious about \nbalancing the budget. However, he is very serious about improving his \nimage. His campaign advisers tell him a balanced budget is popular with \nAmerica's voters and therefore he is trying desperately to get on \nboard. So he gives press conferences and issues press releases \nproclaiming his support for a balanced budget. But there simply is not \nany commitment or substance to back up what he is saying.\n  Bill Clinton pretends that he vetoed a temporary spending measure \nbecause he wanted to protect Medicare. Just as the President has no \ncredibility on the budget, he has no credibility on Medicare. His own \nMedicare trustees informed him earlier this year that Medicare \nbankruptcy is imminent. Bill Clinton's response was to do nothing.\n  The Republican continuing resolution maintains secure Medicare \npremium percentage that recipients pay. It maintains the current \npremium, that Medicare premium percentage, that recipients pay. It says \nthat we need to hold off on decreasing premiums until we implement a \ncomprehensive plan to save Medicare. It does not cut the premium. It \ndoes not raise the premium 1 percentage. It simply keeps it the same. \nVery simply, no change.\n\n  Dick Morris, the President's new top adviser, calls the President's \nplan triangulation. In Washington language, this is supposed to mean \nthat Bill Clinton is a moderate. In North Carolina we speak more \ndirectly. This triangle of Bill Clinton's consist of no leadership, no \nprinciple, and no negotiation. That is the triangulation.\n  Medicare is going broke. The Government is trillions of dollars in \ndebt. The Government is shutting down and the President is concerned \nabout triangulation. Deficits and the national debt are a tax on future \ngenerations. That has been said many times in this Chamber but the fact \nthat it has been repeated does not lessen its truth or its value or its \nimpact upon the American people.\n  In 1975 the debt ceiling was $595 billion. Today, it is right at $5 \ntrillion. Every child born today faces $187,000 interest bill on the \ndebt incurred by past Congresses.\n  The issue before the country is a balanced budget. That is what the \nbill is \n\n[[Page S 17031]]\nabout. That is what we are talking about. The current stalemate will \nnot end until Bill Clinton stops being a candidate for President and \nstarts being President. He needs to work with the Congress for the good \nof this country.\n  I end this short speech where it began, with the simple question: Why \nwill Bill Clinton not agree to a real balanced budget as he pledged to \ndo when he was running for President? When he was running for President \nhe pledged to the voters and the people of this country a balanced \nbudget within 5 years. Why will he not come forth and agree to a \nbalanced budget now in 7 years?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n\n\n                        The Government Shutdown\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I thank the Senator for yielding. \nPeople across America are looking at this Government shutdown and \nsaying, what on Earth are those people thinking? What is this all \nabout? And why is it necessary to furlough 800,000 workers?\n\n  The Baltimore Sun said today that people are no longer mad as hell. \nThey are scared to death. I can tell you there are people around here \nwho are getting anxious. Why are we doing this? I have been in the \nSenate 21 years. This is the most bizarre time I have ever witnessed. I \nassumed, just as in the past, that reasonable heads would prevail, the \nthing would be worked out last night, everybody would come to work \ntoday, and we would get on with our legitimate business. But that has \nnot happened.\n  One group of people say, ``Why doesn't the President sign that \nbill?'' What is wrong with that? And other people say, ``I am with the \nPresident. I hope he will hang tough.'' That is where I come down. It \nis not that big a deal in some ways. But it is essentially an intrusion \non the President's authority. It is an intrusion on our turf, too, to \nattach something like regulatory reform to the debt extension bill. Not \nour version of regulatory reform, the House version, which could not \nsee the light of day in the U.S. Senate. It would never pass the U.S. \nSenate. And where is it? On the debt ceiling bill. Why on Earth do we \nput regulatory reform and habeas corpus reform on the debt ceiling?\n  The debt ceiling is designed to provide the full faith and credit of \nthe United States to people who buy our bonds. Twenty-five percent of \nour national debt, Madam President, is owned by the Western Europeans \nand the Japanese, and they do not think this is fun and games. I heard \na young Congressman on the ``Jim Lehrer Show'' say last night that this \nis ``where the rubber hits the road. This is fun.'' It is a lot of \nthings, but fun is not one of them.\n  What if the Japanese and Western Europeans decide to start pulling \nout of American securities, our bonds and our T bills. Where are we \ngoing to pick up 25 percent, or over $1 trillion of new investment? Are \nwe going to get it from the American people? We do not have that kind \nof savings in this country. So what happens? Interest rates start \nskyrocketing. What happens then? It costs us billions and billions to \nfinance the national debt at a time when we say our whole raison d'etre \nis to balance the budget.\n  What else? To provide for a $245 billion tax cut. Do you want to \nbalance the budget in 7 years? I do not know whether it should be 7 \nyears or 8 years or some other period, nor does anybody in America. But \nI can tell you one thing. A $245 billion tax cut is not consistent with \nbalancing the budget. Any tax cut--any tax cut--should be postponed \nuntil the budget is balanced. And who gets it? You know the rest of \nthat story.\n  The $500 per child tax credit would not be for everybody; not for the \npeople who make less than $30,000 a year with two or three children. \nThey get no part of the child tax credit. Instead, they get a cut in \nthe earned income tax credit. That is a tax increase. Some 49.5 percent \nof the people in this country get nothing but a tax increase out of \nthis budget bill. But if you happen to be wealthy and have three or \nfour kids, you get $500 for each one.\n  So this morning I read where the Republicans are trying to make this \n$500 per child credit retroactive to the year just gone by. They cannot \npay for the full $500 per child for 1995, but they want to come up with \n$125 per child. Of course, the 1995 tax returns have already been \nprinted, and there is no place for $125 credit on the return. So guess \nwhat? It will be payable with a green check from the U.S. Treasury next \nOctober 1, 30 days before the election. How cynical can you get to take \n$125 for all these children out of the Treasury 30 days before the \nelection? Talk about buying an election. It is one of the most \nhypocritical things I have ever read in my life.\n  Colleagues, why did you run for this office? Do you have any values? \nDo you care about the fact that children are not going to be educated? \nDo you care about the fact that my State is going to lose 40 percent of \nits Medicaid funds? We will not have a Medicaid program. Do you care \nabout elderly people? Seventy-five percent of the people over 65 live \non less than $25,000 a year. So what do you do? You savage them to pay \nfor a tax cut for the wealthy.\n  I am sorry I do not have more time. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island has 5 minutes.\n\n\n                          A Plea for Civility\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, like most of my colleagues, I am deeply \ndistressed and, indeed, saddened that the legislative and executive \nbranches of our Federal Government have reached an impasse over the \nfuture funding of Federal activity, as embodied in the continuing \nresolution for the current fiscal year and in the temporary debt limit \nextension bill, with the debate over the long-term budget \nreconciliation bill still to come.\n  While it is not surprising that we should arrive at this point--\nconsidering the differences in philosophy which are at stake--it does \nseem to me that deadlock could have been avoided, and still can be, if \nonly more respect can be granted to the traditional norms of behavior \nthat are the underpinning of our democratic system.\n  Comity and civility, transcending differences of party and ideology, \nhave always been crucial elements in making government an effective and \nconstructive instrument of public will. In times such as these, when \nthe pendulum of history seems to be reversing its swing and when there \nis so much fundamental disagreement about the role of government, it is \nall the more essential that we preserve the spirit of civil discourse.\n  Last year, before retiring from the Senate to become president of the \nUniversity of Oklahoma, David Boren sent a letter to his colleagues \nlamenting the fact that ``we have become so partisan and so personal in \nour attacks upon each other that we can no longer effectively work \ntogether in the national interest.'' It was a thoughtful warning that \nhas meaning far beyond the U.S. Senate.\n  The fact is that the democratic process depends on respectful \ndisagreement. As soon as we confuse civil debate with reckless \ndisparagement, we have crippled the process. A breakdown of civility \nreinforces extremism and discourages the hard process of negotiating \nacross party lines to reach a broad-based consensus.\n  The Founding Fathers who prescribed the ground rules for debate in \nCongress certainly had all these considerations in mind. We address \neach other in the third person with what seems like elaborate courtesy. \nThe purpose, of course, is to remind us constantly that whatever the \ndepth of our disagreements, we are all common instruments of the \ndemocratic process. That process is not well served by spin doctors and \nsound bytes. Nor is it well served by blustering assertions of no \ncompromise.\n  This certainly should be kept in mind with respect to the current \ndispute over the continuing resolution. This legislation is \nnecessitated by the failure of this Congress to enact appropriation \nbills in a timely fashion, and President Clinton has every right to \ninsist that a temporary continuation of spending authority come to him \nunencumbered by an extraneous policy matter. Whatever the level of \nfuture Medicare premiums is to be, it should be determined by reasoned \ndebate and \n\n[[Page S 17032]]\nnot be set by the forced process of a take-it-or-leave-it add-on to a \ncontinuing resolution.\n  Similarly, with respect to the debt limit extension, no amount of \npartisan oneupmanship is worth the cost of bringing the credit rating \nof the U.S. Government to the brink of world-wide doubt and disrepute. \nThe way to curb future borrowing is through reduction of deficits, \nwhich we are all committed to accomplishing. But in the meantime, the \nUnited States must honor its commitments, and it seems to me highly \nirresponsible to attach any conditions to an extension that would limit \nthe Government's ability to do so.\n  It does seem to me, Mr. President, that there are the makings of \nnegotiated agreement on these issues, and on the larger issues that \nface us in the reconciliation bill, if only we can return to the basic \nground-rules of civil discourse and reasoned deliberation. President \nClinton for his part has long since indicated his commitment to the \ngoal of a balanced budget. So the differences between the two sides are \ndifferences of degree--quantitative questions of how many dollars will \nbe cut over what span of years--which certainly are susceptible to \ncompromise.\n  Edmund Burke, the eloquent British statesman whose 18th century \ncomments are so often relevant to democratic government today, once \nsaid that ``All government is founded on compromise and barter.'' Those \nwords have meaning for us all today, including those who feel they have \na mandate for radical change.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 5 minutes.\n\n\n                        A Realistic Budget Plan\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I thank the Chair and I thank the \nSenator from Washington.\n  I join my colleagues from both sides of the aisle in deploring the \ncircumstances that have brought us to this situation where the Federal \nGovernment is basically shut down because of the failure of the \nCongress and the White House to reach agreements over the Nation's \nfiscal needs.\n  Each side of this abysmal impasse has a somewhat different \nperspective on where the fault lies. Ultimately, neither side can win \nthat debate because the American public sees this kind of problem as a \nfailure of both sides. This kind of gamesmanship simply serves to \nundermine public confidence in public officials, and that does not \nbenefit the Nation either in the long term or the short term.\n  Shutting down the Federal Government and jeopardizing the credit of \nthe United States by allowing us to move to the brink of a default in \nour obligations is irresponsible.\n  According to OMB and GAO, shutting down the Federal Government will \ncost the Federal Treasury millions and millions of dollars. At a time \nwhen we are working to bring down the Federal deficit, we can certainly \nnot afford that. There is no need for this shutdown to have occurred.\n  I must say there is no justification for trying to use emergency \nlegislation to continue Government functions as a vehicle for \nextraneous policy issues, issues like weakening environmental \nprotection laws, undermining the writ of habeas corpus, or ramming \nthrough increases in Medicare premiums.\n  I note today some of the leadership on the other side is saying, \nwell, this is really about a 7-year balanced budget. But the fact is \nthe reason we are here now is not the 7-year balanced budget issue; it \nis inclusion of these extraneous matters that have nothing to do with \nbalancing the budget.\n  Congress ought to get serious and pass a clean continuing resolution \nand debt ceiling extension so that we can move on with the pressing \nbusiness of reaching agreement on long-term deficit reduction \nlegislation and actually achieve a balanced budget. I think the \nPresident is correct that these negotiations should take place without \nthe threat of budget blackmail hanging over the negotiating table. We \nought to be able to reach the agreements needed without this needless \ndisruption of Government services and the undermining of public \nconfidence.\n\n  Let me also focus for a moment on what I mean by the threat of budget \nblackmail hanging over the negotiating table.\n  At the heart of this impasse is an effort driven primarily by the \nHouse backers of the Republican contract to force through a budget \nreconciliation bill that is predicated in large part on delivering what \nthe Speaker of the House has called the crown jewel of the Republican \nContract With America, and that crown jewel is this massive tax cut.\n  In other words, it is not just an issue of whether we should balance \nthe budget in 7 years or earlier, with which I do agree. It is a goal \non the part of those pushing that Contract With America that we balance \nthe budget but also find enough money in there to provide a $245 \nbillion tax cut, particularly for those in the upper income brackets. \nSo there is no legitimacy to the claim that the dispute today is only \nabout whether we do this in 7 years. It is about doing it in 7 years \nand letting these cuts occur to human service programs and safety net \nprograms and delivering a significant tax cut to upper income folks in \nthis society. That is what is really at stake here today.\n  The deep cuts in Medicare and Medicaid and education and \nenvironmental protection programs and other vital domestic programs are \ndriven by the need to provide offsets for the $245 billion tax cut \nwhich the Republican leadership seems absolutely determined to protect.\n  I have opposed this tax cut from the beginning. It is bad economic \npolicy, bad public policy, and bad judgment by the political leadership \nin Congress.\n  There is a simple solution to this crisis. Drop the $245 billion tax \ncut. Use it to cut back on some of the significant cuts in Medicare and \nMedicaid and other programs and still balance the budget by the year \n2002.\n  That is the true answer to this dilemma, and I believe, if both \nparties are serious about this matter at this point, we would realize \nthat that is the crux of the issue. A $245 billion tax cut skewed \ntoward those in upper income brackets is not the same as saying we have \nto balance the budget in 7 years. That is the problem. That is what is \nholding this up, and that is what would solve the problem.\n  Madam President, I will conclude by simply saying that I hope we can \nget a clean resolution and stop this shutdown at this point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 20 minutes and 9 \nseconds, and the Senator from Washington has 6 minutes and 11 seconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. I am going to yield myself a few \nmoments because I think it is appropriate to recognize that we have \nbeen talking about S. 395, which is the pending business before the \nbody. That is the bill that passed including sale of the Alaska Power \nAuthority, moving some of our excess oil off the west coast.\n  Instead, we have been hearing the spin doctors of the Senate, spin \ndoctors criticizing the Republican plan to balance the budget. They \nsuggest that we are putting this on the backs of the seniors, the \nworking families, the children, reducing our educational commitments. \nCome on. We are trying to save a program, save a system.\n  To suggest that the Republicans have no compassion in this area is \nabsolutely ludicrous. What are we doing on Medicare? We are responding \nto the Democratic alarm that Medicare is going to be broke by the year \n2002. So what we are doing is not cutting it. We are reducing the rate \nof growth from 10 to 6 percent.\n  Is that irresponsible? I suggest it is responsible. Shut down \nGovernment? That is not our objective. Our objective is to balance the \nbudget. This is not a continuing resolution. This is a commitment, a \ncommitment to balance the budget, the 1995 balanced budget amendment. \nThat is the issue before this body, and that is the issue down at the \nWhite House, to balance the budget.\n  Why do we need to balance the budget? Because we have a $4.9 trillion \naccumulated debt. And the American people have said that that is \nenough.\n  What are we spending for interest on the debt? What is the interest \ncost of \n\n[[Page S 17033]]\nthat? About 14 percent of our total Federal budget. Canada is nearly at \n20 percent. What happens when you have to spend 14 percent of your \nbudget on interest on a $4.9 trillion accumulated debt? That means less \nmoney for our social responsibilities, less money for our seniors, less \nmoney for education.\n  You have not heard one Democratic Member of this body say how you are \ngoing to balance the budget. They simply criticize our plan. You have \nto cut. You have to cut Government or you have to increase revenues.\n  There is no magic to it. We have heard the Democrats say that the \nMedicare Program would be broke by the year 2002, and they are right. \nWe are doing something about it. They are criticizing us for what we \nare doing about it, but they do not say what they would do about it. We \nhave heard today that, yes, they want to balance the budget. The \nPresident said 10 years. Now he says maybe 9 years. One Senator in the \nChamber today said 7 years. But that Senator did not say how we were \ngoing to do it.\n  The reason Government is shut down is because the President of the \nUnited States will not agree on a plan to balance the budget. He will \nnot come before this body or the House or the leadership and tell us \nwhat his plan is to balance the budget.\n\n  Madam President, this is important. This is the most important thing \nwe could be doing because we are talking about the survival of our \nGovernment, the survival of our fiscal system. Make no mistake about \nit, Madam President, this is historic. This is a historic attempt to \nturn around Government so that we can survive under our Democratic \nsystem as we know it today, because, Madam President, this is the first \ntime in 35 years, since 1969, that we have imparted on a path to \nbalance the budget. The last budget balance we had was back in 1969. It \nhas been 35 years. We have accumulated $4.9 trillion in accumulated \ndebt. That is the legacy we are passing on.\n  So it is historic, Madam President, you bet. And we propose a \ncommitment and a plan and a responsible roadmap to get it done. We have \na pledge to the American people to do it. The American people expect \nthe Republican-controlled Congress to get the job done and stay the \ncourse. And this is indeed a very historic moment, Madam President.\n  I am going to give some time to my colleague from the State of \nLouisiana. How much time might he like?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Four minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Four or five minutes.\n  I ask the Chair, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator has 14 minutes 7 \nseconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate my colleagues on this side of the aisle \nfor using this opportunity to debate this question of a shutdown of the \nGovernment which, in my view, is unnecessary. In my view, this debate \nreally is not about a balanced budget in 7 years; the question is \nwhether you want a deep tax cut which costs a great deal of money and, \nin the process, socks it to the seniors through the Medicare trust \nfund.\n  But, Mr. President, as strongly as I believe that our colleagues on \nthis side of the aisle are making the correct statement, correct \narguments, to which I subscribe and to which I heartily agree, I just \nwant to put in context what the measure is that we are debating just so \nwe do not lose sight of the fact that this is the conference report on \nthe Alaskan North Slope oil and to tell my colleagues what is involved.\n  Initially, Mr. President, we required that Alaskan North Slope oil \ndestined for the gulf coast go all the way, by tanker, to the Panama \nCanal where it was offloaded, pipelined across the isthmus and then \nreloaded and then transported to the gulf coast. Why did we do that? \nBecause of seamen's jobs, because of the Jones Act which required that \nAmerican seamen pilot those ships.\n  Of course, it was economically not feasible to do that. It did not \nmake economic sense except in the context of American seamen and the \nJones Act. And the reason that the law so said that all those years \nreally had nothing to do with energy security; it had to do with \nAmerican seamen's jobs. It has taken all this time, all these years, to \nget it worked out for American seamen and the Jones Act to make our \ngrand compromise on this question of seamen's jobs.\n  That now having been done, virtually all sides support this \nlegislation in this conference report. There is, of course, some \nopposition. I think when it originally came up, the conference report \npassed by a vote of 74 to 20 something. The deport of royalty part of \nthis legislation was part of that conference report at that time or \npart of the Senate bill at that time, which got 74 votes. The deport of \nroyalty came up again and passed by 71 to 28.\n\n  The administration supports this legislation. It is economically \nefficient, saves the country money, is good for the economy of America. \nAnd for those reasons, there is virtually no opposition. I simply say \nthat, Mr. President, not because there has been any argument here today \nto speak of on this conference report, but just so that my colleagues \nwill know that this conference report has nothing to do with the \nbalanced budget or tax cuts for the rich or any of those grand and \nwonderful subjects. This has to do only with the Alaskan North Slope \noil and whether it can be exported in the most efficient way. And it \nalso has to do with deport of royalty. Both parts of that have been \noverwhelmingly approved here on the floor of the Senate. The deport of \nroyalty was approved here twice, and the Alaskan North Slope was \napproved by a margin of 74 to 25.\n  So, I simply say that, Mr. President, so that my colleagues will know \nthat the conference report ought to be approved however you feel about \ntax cuts for the rich, Medicare cuts and all the rest of the subjects \nthat are so much on everyone's mind. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, the events in the past few days are disheartening. \nCongress passed two bills that should provide stopgap measures for the \nGovernment to operate, both the debt extension and the continuing \nresolution. These bills are necessary to buy time to work out \ndifferences that we have on the budget. But both were loaded down with \npolitical baggage, and the President has been forced to veto both.\n  Now here, amazingly, today we are talking about exporting Alaskan \noil. The Government is shut down, the budget is in crisis, and we are \ndebating a major giveaway to foreign oil companies at the expense of \nWashington State refinery workers.\n  Mr. President, it does not have to be this way. We have a job to do. \nWe passed a budget resolution months ago. We passed a budget \nreconciliation 3 weeks ago. And we literally have been sitting here \nsince then. We have a responsibility to problem solve, to work out our \ndifferences and send a package to the President. Yet here we are \ndrawing lines in the sand and wasting time. I think everyone looks bad \nif we do not keep the budget process moving.\n  Mr. President, when I came to Washington in 1993, I was excited, \nmotivated, and ready to make a change. I was ready to make Congress \nwork for average people. I was driven to restore common sense to this \ninstitution. And in large part I acted on that impulse by becoming a \nmember of the Budget Committee, which put together the Budget \nReconciliation Act of 1993. We all remember the 1993 budget debate. It \nwas intense, but yet it was productive. Not everyone liked it, but we \ngot the job done. We had no debates about continuing resolutions or \ndebt limits. There were no discussions of Government shutdowns and work \nfurloughs. Instead, we simply worked hard and we beat every deadline \nwith room to spare.\n  I understand the new majority's enthusiasm and in many ways I share \ntheir interest in changing the way this place works. And, believe me, I \nunderstand how difficult it is to put together a comprehensive budget \npackage.\n\n  But, Mr. President, what I do not understand is the new majority's \ninability to do so. Here we are, November 14, and there is no light at \nthe end of the tunnel. This body passed a budget way back on October \n27, but we still have not seen a House-Senate compromise \n\n[[Page S 17034]]\npackage. More importantly, this Congress still has not passed 8 of its \n13 appropriations bills. That astounds me.\n  Our constituents expect us to pass appropriations by September 30. In \nfact, we passed the Senate budget plan 3 weeks ago and literally have \ndone nothing since. People do not want to hear about Government \nshutdowns. And they certainly do not like it when Congress plays \npolitical games with their lives. How do we explain the pending \nGovernment shutdown without admitting our inability to do what is asked \nof us? We cannot; it is impossible. We cannot explain this stalemate \nwithout telling the public that the last 2 weeks have seen nothing but \narguing, posturing, and finger pointing from one end of Pennsylvania \nAvenue to the other. I do not like to say it, but this behavior reminds \nme of the preschool classes I used to teach.\n  Mr. President, we have to be responsible. We should not risk our \nNation's creditworthiness and its ability to borrow. We should not \nshock the bond market, raise long-term interest rates and hurt American \ninvestors and consumers. We must understand the ramifications of our \nactions and our inactions. I urge my colleagues to consider my words. \nThe American people do not care about who wins and who loses in this \nbudget battle, let alone the continuing resolution battle. They simply \ncare about results. They want to feel secure, and they want to know \nthis Congress is up to its job.\n  Mr. President, our goal should be to restore faith in Government, to \ndemonstrate progress, action, and change. People want to see us working \nand working hard just like they do. But if the Government shuts down, \nall they are going to know is the politicians in Washington, DC, \ndropped the ball again. It is time to put aside the brinkmanship and \ngive people what they want. I hope we can move quickly to enact a \nreasonable continuing resolution that has no strings attached.\n  Budget negotiations will come soon enough once we resume work on the \nbudget bill. In the meantime, let us be responsible legislators. Let us \nlive up to our responsibilities and the expectations of our \nconstituents.\n  As far as the pending legislation is concerned, again I am amazed \nthat we are debating this bill when this Government has come to a \nstandstill. But I want my colleagues to know, I think that this bill is \nnot a good one. It does not favor my constituents or the Nation. It \ngives away precious oil resources when our own country is 50 percent \ndependent on foreign oil. It threatens the healthy water of Puget Sound \nwith unsafe, single-hull oil tankers. And most importantly, if this \nbody actually takes a step to opening ANWR to drilling, it is possible \nthat that oil also will be exported. This makes no sense at all to me, \nMr. President, and I urge my colleagues to vote no on the conference \nreport.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I inquire how much time is remaining on \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 10 minutes, 25 \nseconds, and the other side has 38 seconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this has been an extraordinary debate. \nWe started out debating the Alaska Power Authority moving excess oil \nfrom the west coast of the United States and deep-water royalty relief \nunder S. 395. A good part of the conversation has involved a spin on \nthe balanced budget amendment and the continuing resolution.\n  I think that has been identified by both sides relative to the \nmerits. But, again, I remind my colleagues that the reason the \nGovernment is shut down today is because the President and the White \nHouse cannot come to grips with a Republican plan for a balanced \nbudget, and it is just that simple.\n  I have listened intently to my good friend from the State of \nWashington relative to her concerns about the Alaska oil export portion \nin title II. I can assure you that, indeed, we do not contemplate a \ngiveaway of American oil. We are talking about selling that portion of \noil that is excess to the west coast and, in so doing, that will \nstimulate jobs in California and stimulate jobs in my State of Alaska. \nAs the Senators from Washington know, anything that is good for Alaska \nis good for the State of Washington, because most of our supplies go \nthrough their State.\n  Furthermore, to suggest that somehow this is going to be detrimental \nto Puget Sound, I remind those who are somewhat familiar that we are \nnot talking about oil being exported from the State of Washington. What \nwe are talking about ultimately is the State of Washington having to \ndepend more on imported oil coming into that State if, indeed, it \ncannot rely on a continuing supply of oil from Alaska.\n  But in concluding remarks, I wish to reflect for a moment on the \ngreat relationship which we have had over the years with the State of \nWashington, her citizens and the congressional delegation. Since the \nvery first days of our statehood upon entering the Union, we in Alaska \nhave had vibrant economic, cultural, and close political ties to \nWashington. I guess that began some three decades ago. Perhaps Senator \nStevens, the senior Senator, could comment a bit more precisely on the \nhistory, but our two congressional delegations have worked together.\n  We have created new economic opportunities for citizens of both our \nStates. Indeed, we look back with fondness to the efforts of Scoop and \nMaggie, as they were fondly known, to nurture the development of both \nour States economically. We have accomplished much since statehood, in \nlarge part because our delegations have worked together to promote \ncommon interests.\n  We have differences of opinion, as evidenced by this, but as a result \nof our State's geographic location, we always depended heavily on two-\nway commerce with the State of Washington. Ships carrying the produce \nand consumer goods of Washington State regularly enter our ports. In \nreturn, we continue to share our great mineral wealth, including much \nof the crude oil that fuels Washington State's transportation system \nand supports her economy, and we want to do that in the future.\n  In fact, development of our natural resources have been of immense \nbenefit to Washington State. Between 1980 and 1991, North Slope oil \nproduction generated approximately $1.35 billion in revenues for the \nState of Washington. Only my State, California, Texas, and Pennsylvania \ngenerated greater revenues in providing supplies needed to sustain oil \nproduction on the North Slope.\n  So we look forward to the future. We see vast economic benefits \nthrough development of our State's bountiful resources. Opening the \nCoastal Plain of ANWR to prudent, environmentally sound oil production, \nfor example, would create up to 12,000 new jobs in the State of \nWashington, ensure the continuity of her refineries, and, as a \nconsequence, we feel we can do it safely.\n  So, this is, indeed, an important relationship. I have worked hard, \nalong with Senator Stevens and others, in the conference to ensure that \nSenator Murray's safety and environmental concerns would be addressed. \nWhen some of our House colleagues suggested deleting section 206 in its \nentirety, Congressman Young, from Alaska, and I insisted that efforts \nbe undertaken to find a meaningful compromise. Although I understand my \ncolleague wishes the original language could have been maintained, I \nbelieve we did develop a sound alternative.\n  Let me tell you what that is, because under title IV of the \nconference report, we have mandated that the Coast Guard examine the \nmost cost-effective methods of using existing towing vessel resources \nto respond to any vessel in distress. We adopted this alternative \nbecause in part we believe that, on the best information available and \nevidence, that the marine environment of Puget Sound is adequately \nprotected under existing response plan requirements mandated by the Oil \nPollution Act of 1990 and other statutory provisions.\n  OPA is applicable to major oil ports. Puget Sound is one. It requires \ndouble-hull tankers over a period of time, inspections, higher \nliability, response plan and escort vessels and mandates that the Coast \nGuard be given the discretion relative to escort vessels.\n  We believe the Coast Guard's existing authority to prevent and \nrespond to oilspills, as well as to impose vessel operating \nrequirements, is fully sufficient to address the needs of all Pacific \n\n[[Page S 17035]]\nNorthwest waterways. It is an obligation of the Coast Guard to address \nthat.\n  Nonetheless, in recognition of the interest among the citizens of \nWashington State in a so-called tug-of-opportunity system and given our \nstrong desire to ensure that cost-effective measures are adopted to \nenhance the safety in these waters, the committee of conference \nincluded title IV.\n  With respect to Senator Murray's general concerns about the impact of \nANS exports on her State, let me offer a few thoughts. We firmly \nbelieve, as the weight of the testimony before my committee \ndemonstrated, that the Pacific Northwest will continue to be the most \nnatural market for ANS crude.\n  Given its geographic proximity and relatively low cost of \ntransporting crude to refiners in Puget Sound, there is no sound \neconomic reason why any oil now coming to Washington would be exported. \nIn fact, the largest independent refiner in the area has a long-term \nsupply contract with the largest North Slope producer. Moreover, some \nof the owners of the largest refineries in Washington State, in fact, \nsupport this legislation. There is, thus, no reason to fear oil \nshortages or higher prices.\n  Nor, might I add, is there any basis for the concern expressed that \nenactment of the legislation will lead to a sudden influx of \nsubstandard or environmentally unsound foreign-flag tankers in the \nwaters of Puget Sound. Under OPA 1990, all tankers--American flag and \nforeign flag--are subjected to the same rigorous safety standards by \nthe U.S. Coast Guard. Environmentally safe foreign-flag tankers today \ndeliver imports to refineries in Puget Sound, as a matter of fact. \nFinally, along with the American-flag tankers, with some of the best \nsafety records in the world, these tankers will continue to deliver the \ncrude that helps fuel the State's economy.\n  We have carefully considered all the potential negative implications \nof the ANS export.\n  We have given the President all the authority he needs to ensure the \nexports do not pose negative environmental risks for anybody in the \nPacific Northwest. Having done so, we want to share the benefits of \nexport. Like Washington State, which for so long has thrived because of \nfree trade--you can imagine what would happen if the State of \nWashington was precluded by this body from, say, exporting their \napples. We feel that way about our oil, Mr. President. We in Alaska \nwant the chance to sell our most precious resource into the world \nmarkets. We in the Alaska delegation have fought so hard for so long to \nmaintain free and open trade opportunities for others, and we now ask \nthat our colleagues help us end the discrimination that has kept our \nmost valuable resource from being freely traded in a competitive \nmarket. It has been unfair to the State of Alaska. I thank Senator \nStevens, Representative Young, Senator Bennett Johnston, and other \nmembers of the Energy Committee, who worked so hard to bring this \nlegislation together, S. 395, covering the sale of the Alaska Power \nAuthority, and the export of excess oil from the west coast of the \nUnited States in U.S.-flag vessels with U.S. crews. This means more \nU.S. ships and more jobs.\n  Finally, on the benefits of deep water royalty, I had the pleasure of \nworking with Senator Bennett Johnston to bring together, with my \ncolleagues in the House, this legislation before us. I believe the time \nhas about expired. The yeas and nays have been ordered. I do not know \nif there is further time.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, 800,000 Federal workers were furloughed \nwithout pay today as a result of our inability to resolve our \ndifferences on the continuing resolution. It could have been avoided. \nIt is as unnecessary as it is unfortunate.\n  Morale among Federal employees is at one of the lowest points ever. \nThey face great uncertainty, while many are being told they are not \nessential. It is sad but avoidable. It represents not only a cost to \nfamilies working for the Federal Government but a huge cost to \nGovernment itself. It may cost the Federal Government as much as $150 \nmillion a day, costing taxpayers as well.\n  While it may have been avoidable, it was also predictable, given \nstatements by the Speaker of the House throughout the year. It was on \nApril 3 when the Speaker pledged to ``create a titanic legislative \nstandoff with President Clinton by adding vetoed bills to must-pass \nlegislation.''\n  It was on November 8 that the Investors Business Daily reported that \nthe Speaker would force the Government to miss interest and principal \npayments for the first time ever to force the administration to agree \nto his 7-year deficit reduction.\n  While failure to pass a continuing resolution costs a great deal, \nfailure to pass a debt limit is costing even more. Officials at \nStandard & Poor's recently noted, ``The willingness of American \nofficials to talk about the possibility of default has already done \nlasting harm to the United States international image as a country \nwilling to pay back what it borrows.'' Standard & Poor's President Leo \nO'Neill argued, ``Even if the issue is resolved in the 11th hour, the \n59th minute, in some respects the damage has already been done.''\n  Mr. President, we can resolve these matters now. In fact, we must do \nso. \n\n[[Page S 17036]]\n Let the negotiations continue. Let us resolve our differences. If the \nMedicare premium increase is taken off the resolution and addressed in \nthe overall context of reform, there is no reason we cannot find \nagreement on a balanced budget by a date certain.\n  That will take some time. We are not going to do it today; we are not \ngoing to do it tomorrow; but we are going to do it. In the meantime, we \nought to agree to a clean continuing resolution for several more days \nto reduce the real harm to Federal employees, to reduce the harm to the \nU.S. taxpayer, to allow us to do our real work and resolve our \ndifferences on reconciliation and the budget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/14/senate-section/article/S17035-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MAKING FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS, 1996\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, as we speak, they are meeting now in S-207. \nThe President's Chief of Staff, as I understand; the Secretary of the \nTreasury; and the OMB Director, Alice Rivlin, are meeting with \nRepublicans and Democrats, members of the Budget Committee, in an \neffort to see if there can be some resolution.\n  I am not an advocate of Government shutdowns. I have been here when \nthey have been shut down when we had Republican Presidents in the White \nHouse and a Democratic Congress and the Democrats were insisting on \ncertain things, and the Government shut down. So this is not without \nprecedent. But I have never thought it was the best way to do business, \nand I hope it can be resolved very quickly.\n  I hope that while they are trying to negotiate, hopefully, some \nagreement, that we would not engage in debate on the Senate floor that \nmight drive us apart. I do not have any quarrel with what the \ndistinguished Democratic leader has said. I do not share every view he \nhas expressed. And, again, I would say that when the President talks \nabout Medicare, I hope that the people understand we are talking about \npart B; we are talking about that part of Medicare where the persons \nout there working every day making $15,000 $20,000, $30,000 a year are \nputting money into the general revenues to pay 68.5 percent of \nsomeone's part B premium, whether they are worth $50,000, $100,000, $1 \nmillion or $1 billion. If the President is trying to protect those \npeople, then I fail to understand why in this case.\n  All we want to do is just freeze that until we have a negotiated \nsettlement, because sooner or later we are going to have to address \nMedicare in order to save it, protect it and strengthen it. That is \nwhat it was about, and that issue will not go away.\n  But I think, as I watched the President today very carefully, he \nshifted his stance today. Yesterday it was Medicare, Medicare and \nMedicaid. Today it was balance the budget, balance the budget, balance \nthe budget.\n  I would again say, if the President wants to balance the budget, I am \nprepared to call up the motion to reconsider the constitutional \namendment for a balanced budget. I just need one vote. One of those \nSenators, one of the six who voted ``no'' who voted ``yes'' previously, \ncould change their vote at this moment and send a message across \nAmerica that we want a balanced budget. And I call upon the President \nto get the six of his colleagues together and see if he cannot persuade \none or two to vote for a constitutional amendment for a balanced \nbudget. That, I think, would let the American people know that this is \na bipartisan effort and that we do search for a balanced budget.\n  Failing that, I think the only recourse we have on this side, and one \nwe are certainly going to pursue, is to balance the budget by the year \n2002, balance the budget by the year 2002. Eighty-three percent of the \nAmerican people want to balance the budget. You cannot balance the \nbudget by adding new programs. We are going to spend more, even with \nthe balanced budget by the year 2002, spend more for Medicare, more for \nMedicaid, and more for all these programs.\n  But I happen to believe that we are on the right track. We are doing \nthe heavy lifting now. We are taking the hits on this side of the \naisle. We know it is easy--we read the numbers-- it is easy to say, \n``Let's keep hammering those Republicans.'' But sooner or later the \nPresident must recognize that he is the President, he has to provide \nleadership, he has to make tough choices. The tough choices are not to \nsay, ``I'm not going to tolerate any tinkering with this program or \nthat program or that program.'' That may be the political easy choice, \nbut it is not going to solve our problem.\n  Unless we balance the budget, we are not being fair to children, \nchildren who are 1 year old or 2 years old or 5 years old, who have to \nlook at the future, where they are going to be when they are 20 years \nof age or 25 years of age. I really believe that it is in our mutual \ninterest to try to work this out. We are talking about an 18-day CR. It \nis not the end of the world. I hope we can find some resolution.\n  I am also sympathetic with reference to extension of the debt \nceiling. I have seen that over the years used as a vehicle for riders. \nI remember managing a debt ceiling when I was chairman of the Finance \nCommittee many years ago. We had foreign policy amendments offered and \nadopted by my colleagues on the other side. We had all kinds--I think \nwe ended up with 19 amendments on the debt ceiling that we had to take \nto conference with the Ways and Means Committee. And most of it was, of \ncourse, completely outside the jurisdiction of the Ways and Means \nCommittee.\n  So, I do not want anybody to misunderstand this has never happened \nwhen we had Republicans in the White House and a Democratic Congress. \nIt has happened. And it probably will happen in the future. Maybe it \nshould not happen. Maybe we ought to do something to prevent it from \nhappening, but we have not done that yet.\n  I think on that basis, since they are, right within 20 yards of here, \ntrying to reach some agreement, I hope that we will be permitted to \nstand in recess subject to the call of the Chair. And if we cannot \nreach some agreement--well, if we hear no agreement can be reached, \nthen we will have to decide what to do for the rest of the evening. But \nif an agreement can be reached, I hope the House would take it up and \nsend it over here tonight and pass it, and then do precisely what the \nDemocratic leader wishes to do, and that would be to end the shutdown \nand get people back to work.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Would the distinguished majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished minority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me say that I am disappointed that we could not get \nagreement on this resolution. I think the colloquy we have just had, \nMr. President, demonstrates, regardless of what may have happened in \nthe past, why it is so important to have a clean continuing resolution \nso that we can negotiate a balanced budget, so that we can negotiate \nwhatever it is we may do with regard to Medicare.\n  We recognize that Medicare is going to have to be reformed. But to \nsingle \n\n[[Page S 17037]]\nout Medicare and tell seniors that they are the ones who are going to \nhave to be the first to sacrifice before we come to any other \nconclusion does not make a lot of sense to most Democrats, and that is \nwhy we object to having it in the continuing resolution. To say that \nsomehow we cannot resolve these matters one by one in an overall \nnegotiation is to admit failure before we have begun. We are not \nprepared to do that.\n  That is why having a continuing resolution that is clean, as we call \nit, is so important, so that we can get the business of negotiation \nunderway and do it in a much more comprehensive and meaningful way. \nSooner or later we are going to have to come to that conclusion. As we \ndeliberate, 800,000 Federal employees continue to wonder what will \nhappen to them next. Taxpayers pay $150 million a day, according to \nestimates, that is unnecessary. The creditworthiness of the United \nStates is being debated. So we are acquiring additional costs. We are \nfacing additional uncertainty, simply because we have no continuing \nresolution today.\n  That can be avoided, Mr. President. We want a balanced budget. We \nwant a date certain by which the budget is balanced. We can negotiate \nthat. We can come to some conclusion on all of that. But we have to \ndeal with first things first. And the continuing resolution is the \nissue that we have to face if we are going to resolve the short-term \ncrisis for so many Federal employees and the taxpayers.\n  I have no reservations at all about the continued negotiations that \nare going on right now. I hope that the majority leader might be \nwilling to allow us to stay in morning business so that we might \ndiscuss these and other matters. I know that there are people on our \nside of the aisle who would like very much to have the opportunity to \ndebate and discuss some of these issues, and, for that reason, Mr. \nPresident, I would have to object to going into recess at this time.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as the Senator knows, we had a meeting last \nnight at the White House. We all agreed when we left there, at least I \nthought we had, that it had been a good meeting, some progress was \nmade, and we had not reached an agreement. And I, along with the \nSpeaker, went out and dutifully reported that to the press. Then I \nlater heard we were getting dumped on about Medicare. Then I watched \n``Nightline,'' and we were getting dumped on about something else.\n  Then the President this morning, right after negotiations ended, was \nsaying it was all the Republicans' fault. It makes it rather difficult, \nto be very frank about it. I know people want to get up and speak and \nhammer away for another 2 hours. That will not happen. We will have a \nquorum call. I was trying to save from keeping the staff here. But if \nthat is the desire of the other side, we will have a quorum call, a \nvery slow quorum call, that may take hours.\n  But my view is this: I have made the same speech that the Democratic \nleader made when we had Republican Presidents in the White House. I \nnever prevailed, but I made the same speech, I made the same request. I \nasked unanimous consent that it be extended. Never got it; but I tried. \nSo I am going to commend the Democratic leader for doing what he should \ndo. And if he finds out a way to do it, then I missed something when I \nwas trying to do the same thing.\n  But the bottom line is that, if we cannot work it out--and this is a \nconfrontation between a Republican Congress and a Democratic White \nHouse, and it has been reversed many times. We have stood on the floor \nwhile things were going back and forth. In fact, we have had Medicare \nproposals on CR's before.\n  But I guess if the President wants to protect the rich, those who \nonly pay 31.5 percent of their premiums even though they are \nmillionaires, that is his prerogative. If he wants to sock somebody to \npay it who is making $25,000, that is his prerogative. That is his \nprerogative. We are trying to make Medicare fair. I think once the \nAmerican people understand he is talking about part B, part B, which is \nnot means tested, and we just keep shoveling money out of general \nrevenues, taking somebody's money out there making $25,000 or $30,000 \nand paying 68.5 percent of the premium for somebody who might be well \noff, it does not make any sense to me.\n  We ought to means test part B premiums. I think everybody agrees. \nJust use the word ``Medicare,'' cut Medicare. Do not tell them that you \nare cutting, because they are going to find out you are not cutting \nanything.\n  So I just suggest if the President wants to balance the budget, boy, \nhe is right on track. He said balance the budget in 5 years when he was \nrunning. Since then, he has said balance it in 10, 9, 8, or none of the \nabove. So take your pick. He is for 5 years when he is running; he is \nfor 10 years when he is thinking about running for reelection; and he \nhas been for 9 years, for 8 years, for 7 years, or for never.\n  We are going to find out. The President said he wanted to balance the \nbudget about 10 times in a press conference. We ought to give him that \nopportunity. We ought to send him a CR, and it ought to say in the CR \nwe will balance the budget in 7 years--7 years--the year 2002, using \nupdated CBO numbers which he asked us to use in 1993, as I recall, when \nhe addressed the joint session of Congress, and then send that to the \nCongress. Then he can have the CR, and he can also tell the American \npeople he is serious about a balanced budget amendment.\n  But until that time, I do not know how we are going to resolve it, \nunless they can figure out something in the other room, because you \nhave a question whether you use the CBO numbers, OMB numbers, whether \nit is going to be 7 years, 8 years, 9 years, 10 years.\n  Most Americans do not understand why we are waiting 7 years. They \nthink we ought to do it in a year, 2 years, or 3 years. We believe \nseven is the right number. In fact, we will have on the floor, \nhopefully on Friday, a balanced budget called the reconciliation \npackage. We call it the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which does balance \nthe budget in 7 years. He will have a clean CR in it. He will have a \nclean debt ceiling in it. It will all go to the President of the United \nStates, and he can get everything he talked about this past week: He \ncan get a clean debt extension; he can get a clean CR; and he can get a \nbalanced budget; and he only has to sign once. One time--not three \ntimes, but one time--and he gets the whole package.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from the State of \nColorado, I object.

               ______\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO PRIME MINISTER YITZHAK RABIN\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in deep sorrow to \npay a tribute to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was \nassassinated in Tel Aviv 10 days ago.\n  It is difficult to imagine the State of Israel without Yitzhak Rabin. \nHis last years as Prime Minister were so momentous that it is easy to \nforget that Yitzhak Rabin was not just present, but played a central \nrole, in virtually every major event in Israel's brief, but dramatic, \nhistory.\n  For many Israelis, Yitzhak Rabin was a father figure--a constant \npresence throughout their lives, and a source of strength. The profound \nlove, admiration, and respect that his compatriots felt for him was \nmade clear by the tremendous, spontaneous outpouring of grief upon his \nsudden death: Candlelight vigils cropped up all across the country; men \nand women stood crying in the streets in shock and disbelief; and 1 \nmillion Israelis--20 percent of the population--filed past his coffin \nin a 24-hour period to pay their last respects.\n  For Israelis, Yitzhak Rabin had simply always been there.\n  Born in 1922 in Jerusalem to recent immigrants to Palestine, the \nyoung Yitzhak Rabin was part of the generation that built the \nfoundation of the Jewish state. He studied in an agricultural school, \nwith the expectation of working the land with his bare hands.\n  But Rabin felt a sense of duty to the cause of building Israel, and \nhe put his own ambitions aside to fight for its birth. He joined the \nPalmach, the forerunner of the Israel defense forces, to fight for \nIsrael's establishment. A fine soldier, he was quickly elevated to \ncommand-level positions, and he led the battalion that secured the \ncrucial Jerusalem-Tel Aviv road during Israel's War of Independence in \n1948.\n  After Israel's founding, Rabin rose through the ranks of the Israel \ndefense forces, finally being named Chief of Staff. To Israel's good \nfortune, he held that position in June of 1967, when he led Israel to a \nstunning victory in the Six-Day War over three Arab armies threatening \nthe Jewish State. He was one of the first Israelis to walk the streets \nof the reunited city of Jerusalem, and the pictures of him arriving at \nthe Western Wall of the Temple are to this day among the most moving \nimages in Israel's history.\n  In the aftermath of this great victory, he retired from the military \nand became Israel's Ambassador to the United States. He sought this \npost, he explained, because he felt that Israel's future could best be \nsecured by a strong partnership with the United States. More than any \nother individual in either country, Yitzhak Rabin envisioned the deep \nfriendship that now exists between the United States and Israel, and \nworked to make it a reality. It is fitting that in his final years as \nPrime Minister, he enjoyed a relationship with an American President \nthat surpassed perhaps what even he had imagined possible.\n  In 1974, in the aftermath of the Yom Kippur War that brought down the \ngovernment of Golda Meir, Yitzhak Rabin became Prime Minister of \nIsrael. During his tenure in office, he forged an early path in Middle \nEast peacemaking by negotiating disengagement agreements with both \nEgypt and Syria. Following the Labor party's defeat to Likud in 1977, \nPrime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat built \non the successful disengagement negotiations to reach a full peace \ntreaty.\n  In 1984, Yitzhak Rabin returned to the Cabinet as Israel's Defense \nMinister. In the first year, he helped to arrange the withdrawal of the \nIsraeli Army from most of Lebanon, following a costly and painful \ninvasion. In 1987 and 1988, he was confronted by the Palestinian \nuprising, or intifada, and the daily battles between Israeli soldiers \nand Palestinian youths.\n  Finally, in 1992, Yitzhak Rabin returned victorious to the Prime \nMinistership. He quickly recognized the opportunity to achieve a \nbreakthrough in the stalled negotiations between Israel and its \nneighbors. The results included the historic agreements between Israel \nand the Palestinians, the peace treaty with Jordan, and many \nunforgettable images, such as the famous handshake with Yasser Arafat \non the White House lawn, and the appearance with King Hussein of Jordan \nat a joint session of Congress.\n  The common thread through all these various experiences was an \nunshakable commitment to the security and well-being of the State of \nIsrael. At every stage of his life--from young soldier fighting for his \nnation's survival, to confident commander of a strong army, to diplomat \nreaching out to broader ties with the world, and finally to statesman \nleading his nation to make peace with old foes--he was motivated by a \ndesire to build a better, more secure, more peaceful life for his \npeople.\n  Yitzhak Rabin was a man of great integrity. He spoke plainly and made \nno pretense about his overriding concern: the security of the State of \nIsrael and its people. But, blessed with strength of character and a \nkeen intellect, he was able to adjust his understanding of what \nIsrael's security required according to changing conditions.\n  In 1948 and 1967, for example, he knew that Israel's survival \nrequired an all-out military effort. In later years he understood the \nneed to maintain Israel's world-class military and the imperative of a \nstrong alliance with the United States.\n  For many years after the Six-Day War, he had been an advocate of \nIsrael retaining all of the West Bank and Gaza. But as the intifada \nwent on, the destructive effects of the continuation of Israeli control \nover a hostile, embittered population of nearly 2 million Palestinians \nbecame clearer to him.\n  Over time, and not without difficulty, he came to the understanding \nthat Israel's long-term survival as a Jewish state would be jeopardized \nby the continued domination of another people. He was not naive. He \nrecognized that there were risks involved with reaching out to old \nenemies. But his pragmatic understanding of Israel's own needs led to \nthe historic agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.\n  In his final speech to the Israeli people, at the peace rally where \nhe was cut down, Yitzhak Rabin explained how he had come to reassess \nIsrael's situation. He said:\n\n       I was a military man for 27 years. I fought so long as \n     there was no chance for peace. I believe that there is now a \n     chance for peace, a great chance. We must take advantage of \n     it for the sake of those standing here and for those who are \n     not here--and they are many.\n       I say this to you as one who was a military man, someone \n     who is today Minister of Defense and sees the pain of the \n     families of the Israel Defense Forces soldiers. For them, for \n     our children, in my case for our grandchildren, I want this \n     government to exhaust every opening, every possibility to \n     promote and achieve a comprehensive peace.\n\n  Yitzhak Rabin was a pragmatist, not a starry-eyed idealist. But \nthrough his pragmatism, he reached a visionary conclusion. This man, \nwho cared so deeply for every Israeli soldier who fell \n\n[[Page S 17040]]\nin battle, for every victim of terror, knew that when an opportunity \nfor peace presented itself, he must seize it. A pragmatic conclusion to \nbe sure, but also a morally-centered one.\n  I was privileged to attend Yitzhak Rabin's funeral last week in \nJerusalem, the city of his birth. He is buried among Israel's fallen \nheroes on Mount Herzl, and there could be no more appropriate place. He \nwas a patriot and hero for Israel as a soldier and a leader, in wars of \nsurvival and in the struggle for peace.\n  The funeral was a powerful testimony to his achievements. Yitzhak \nRabin, the military hero, was saluted by weeping soldiers, and buried \nwith full military honors. Yitzhak Rabin, the peacemaker, was honored \nby the entire world. Dozens of heads of state and foreign dignitaries, \nfrom every corner of the globe, came to pay their respects. There could \nbe no greater evidence of the incredible progress made by Yitzhak Rabin \ntoward peace and ending Israel's isolation.\n  Most inspiring of all was the presence of leaders from seven Arab \ncountries--Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Qatar, Oman, and \nMauritania--and the Palestinian Authority. Such a thing could not have \nhappened even 3 years ago. The peace that Yitzhak Rabin was striving to \nbuild was brought to life by the presence of President Mubarak of \nEgypt, on his first visit to Israel, and by Jordan's King Hussein, who \ncalled Rabin ``my brother.''\n  It now falls to Shimon Peres, Israel's acting Prime Minister, to \ncontinue the work of his partner, Yitzhak Rabin. Israel is fortunate to \nhave such a wise and capable leader ready to step in to the void \ncreated by this tragedy. Shimon Peres has served Israel with \ndistinction over many years as Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, \nDefense Minister, and many other posts.\n  Shimon Peres is in many ways the architect of the Israeli-Palestinian \nagreements, and his commitment to achieving a comprehensive peace that \nprotects Israel's security is unquestioned. If there is any consolation \nin this time of grief, it is that Yitzhak Rabin's partner, Shimon \nPeres, who shared Rabin's vision, will be able to carry that vision \nforward.\n  As the tributes to Yitzhak Rabin continue to flow forth from around \nthe world, we must rededicate ourselves to supporting Israel in its \npursuit of peace. It is a sad irony that at the moment of Yitzhak \nRabin's death, Congress had allowed the Middle East Peace Facilitation \nAct--which Rabin considered essential to the success of his peace \npolicies--to lapse.\n  While this problem was rectified following the funeral, we know that \nCongress will have many future opportunities to express support for the \npeace process. When we fail to do so, we undermine Israel's peace \nefforts and dishonor Yitzhak Rabin's legacy.\n  Let us commit to one another and to the memory of Yitzhak Rabin, that \nwe will place support for Israel's peace efforts above partisan or \npolitical disputes. Bringing peace to Israel and the Middle East--which \nwas Rabin's life's work--deserves to be such a priority. If we fail to \ndo this, all our words and tributes in praise of Yitzhak Rabin will \nring hollow.\n  Let us also commit ourselves to condemning violence and the \nincendiary rhetoric of extremists, wherever we find it. The painful \nlesson of Rabin's death is that violent words can indeed have violent \nconsequences. Tragically, ``Death to Rabin'' was not just a slogan. It \nis up to all of us to isolate those who use such words.\n  Israel and the world have lived 10 days without Yitzhak Rabin, and we \nare far poorer for his loss. While the pain does not fade easily, his \nmemory can be a source of comfort. This past Sunday night, at the \nconclusion of the 7-day mourning period, tens of thousands of Israelis \nreturned to the site of his assassination--renamed Yitzhak Rabin \nSquare--and sang songs of peace in his honor.\n  For Israel, for the Jewish people, and for all who loved and \nrespected Yitzhak Rabin, may his memory be a blessing. In death as in \nlife, may he give hope and strength to his people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/14/senate-section/article/S17039-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNITION OF MINNESOTA TEACHER OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. GRAMS.

From the jungles of Vietnam to the sands of Kuwait, \nGeneral Keys answered the call to duty, and today, on behalf of all \nSenators, I pause to thank him.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of his \naward citation be printed in the Record.\n  The text of the citation follows:\n\n Citation To Accompany the Award of the Defense Distinguished Service \n                        Medal to William M. Keys\n\n       Lieutenant General William M. Keys, United States Marine \n     Corps, distinguished himself by exceptionally distinguished \n     service as Commander, United States Marine Forces, Atlantic, \n     from June 1991 to July 1994. General Keys displayed dynamic \n     leadership, doctrinal and operational boldness, and dogged \n     determination in aggressively pursuing initiatives that \n     enhanced the Force's ability to successfully prevail on the \n     joint battlefield. He significantly improved the Commanders-\n     in-Chiefs ability to best utilize the operational \n     capabilities of all the forces available. With the \n     establishment of the United States Atlantic Command (USACOM) \n     as the joint force integrator for CONUS-based forces, General \n     Keys' leadership was crucial in shaping and defining many \n     joint warfare concepts, including the standardized \n     development of the Joint Air Force Component Commander \n     (JFACC) concept within USACOM and United States Pacific \n     Command. As Joint Task Force Commander for Ocean Venture 92, \n     he built upon improved communications capabilities and better \n     joint tactics, techniques, and procedures within the JFACC/\n     JTCB. He also played a key role in the development of joint \n     training concepts and exercise schedules currently emerging \n     from USACOM. The distinctive accomplishments of General Keys \n     culminate a distinguished career in the service of his \n     country and reflect great credit upon himself, the United \n     States Marine Corps, and the Department of Defense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/14/senate-section/article/S17040-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17040-S17041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           LIECHTENSTEIN-BASED LOTTERY ROLLS OUT ON INTERNET\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask that the following article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From Reuters News Service, Oct. 3, 1995]\n\n           Liechtenstein-Based Lottery Rolls Out on Internet\n\n       London.--A new international lottery, licensed by the \n     government of the tiny European principality of \n     Liechtenstein, was launched via the Internet Tuesday.\n       InterLotto will give the world's 50 million Internet users \n     the opportunity every week to win a jackpot of at least $1 \n     million by dialling up a new World Wide Web page on the \n     Internet computer network.\n       ``It is the first government-licensed lottery on the \n     Internet,'' David Vanrenen, chairman of the International \n     Lottery in Liechtenstein Foundation, told a news conference.\n       The launch in London, headquarters of the computer services \n     firm Micro Media Services Ltd, which provides the hardware \n     and technology for InterLotto, came on the heels of \n     controversy over Britain's National Lottery.\n       The opposition Labor Party Monday criticized the National \n     Lottery for making profits and there have been jibes that the \n     lottery funds elitist causes.\n\n[[Page S 17041]]\n\n       Interlotto officials said players could nominate charities \n     to receive awards. At least five percent of InterLotto \n     revenues will go to charity initially with 65 percent going \n     in prize money and the rest going toward paying costs.\n       ``Every time you book a ticket, you enter a nomination for \n     a charity,'' Vanrenen said.\n       The foundation, authorized and controlled by the \n     Liechtenstein government, is operating InterLotto.\n       Liechtenstein, a tax-free country of 30,000 residents \n     wedged between Switzerland and Austria, will not receive any \n     money from the lottery which is non-profit-making.\n       The government will select charities to receive donations. \n     Ticket purchasers will then vote to decide which of the \n     selected groups receive funds. Organizers hope to sell one \n     million tickets a week by the end of the year.\n       The British National Lottery donates 28 percent of its \n     revenues to good causes and charities. Like most other \n     government-run lotteries in Europe, the British lottery pays \n     out 50 percent of revenues in prize money.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/14/senate-section/article/S17040-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17041-S17042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BUDGET RECONCILIATION VOTES\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, during consideration of the Budget \nReconciliation Act of 1995, the Senate conducted a remarkable number of \nrollcall votes, including a record 39 votes on Friday, October 27. I \nwant to take some time now to discuss several of the more critical \nvotes about which I was unable to comment at the time.\n  First of all, Mr. President, I generally voted against motions to \nwaive the Budget Act for amendments that resulted in higher deficits \nand amendments to strike budget savings in the bill because they would \nhave moved us away from the goal of balancing the budget by the year \n2002. These amendments included the Jeffords amendment on two-part \ndairy, the Specter amendment to strike all of the savings derived from \nthe Medicare disproportionate share payments, and the Moynihan \namendment to strike the indirect medical payments provisions. Aside \nfrom the respective merits of each amendment, their adoption would have \nresulted in a deficit in the year 2002, taking the reconciliation \npackage out of balance and causing us to miss our primary goal in this \nbudget process--enactment of a balanced budget.\n  Second, I voted against amendments to roll back the $245 billion in \ntax relief for middle-class families and small businesses. As I have \nnoted previously, as a consequence of the $900 billion in savings \ngenerated from our budget over 7 years, the Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that an economic dividend will accrue to the Federal \nGovernment. In my mind, this tiny surplus belongs to the taxpayers who \nmake all the other Government programs possible, and for that reason, I \nopposed all amendments to reduce the size of the tax cut. These \namendments included the Rockefeller motion to reduce the savings from \nMedicare to $89 billion and to offset this reduction by reducing the \ntax cuts by a like amount; the Bumpers amendment to delay the tax cut \nfor 7 years; the Dorgan-Harkin-Kennedy amendment to limit the capital \ngains tax reduction; the Lautenberg amendment to prohibit high-income \npeople from benefiting from the lower taxes; the Baucus amendment to \nstrip out the tax cuts in order to avoid any reductions in spending \nthat might impact rural America; the Simon-Conrad substitute amendment \nto strike the tax cuts and entitlement reforms; and the Byrd amendment \nto strike the tax cuts altogether.\n  As I have said previously, I fully support providing American \nfamilies and businesses with this modest tax cut. The Republican budget \nprojects that the Federal Government will spend about $12 trillion over \nthe next 7 years. The tax cut included in this bill would return to the \ntaxpayers just a fraction of that amount. This is certainly reasonable, \nespecially considering the primary beneficiaries of these tax cuts are \nlow- and middle-income families--families that have seen their Federal \ntax burden rise dramatically over the past 40 years.\n  Mr. President, let me comment on the Rockefeller motion in \nparticular. The effort to tie the tax cuts included in the budget \nreconciliation bill with the necessary reforms made to Medicare is \ndisingenuous. With or without tax cuts, the Medicare trustees have \nstated in no uncertain terms that the Medicare trust fund will go \ninsolvent in 2002. The Senate reconciliation bill makes the fundamental \nreforms necessary to keep Medicare solvent and it lays the foundation \nfor long-term reform of the Medicare system. These reforms have nothing \nto do with any tax cuts included in the bill and everything to do with \npreserving Medicare for future generations.\n\n  Mr. President, there were a few amendments offered that pertained to \nthe treatment of low-income families. I opposed Senator Bradley's \nmotion to increase spending for the earned income tax credit by raising \nunspecified taxes. While the basic premise and goals of the earned \nincome tax credit are sound, it is apparent that the program is in need \nof reform. As was stated clearly during the debate, the EITC has \nsuffered in recent years from fraud and abuse. According to the \nGovernmental Accounting Office, the EITC has an error and fraud rate of \nbetween 30 and 40 percent. Aside from cheating the taxpayers, this \nproblem is also cheating deserving families from receiving payments for \nwhich they are eligible.\n  Under this budget, spending on the ETIC Program will continue to \nincrease, from $19.8 billion this year to $22.8 billion in 2002. As a \nresult, the maximum credit available to low-income families with two \nchildren will increase from $3,110 this year to $3,888 in the year \n2002. Contrary to what was argued during debate, EITC payments don't go \ndown under this legislation, they go up.\n  Another amendment worth commenting upon was the Breaux amendment to \nmake the $500 per child family tax credit refundable against employee-\npaid payroll taxes by limiting the tax credit to children under 16 \nyears of age and phasing it out to families with incomes between \n$60,000 and $75,000. As I noted at the time, I support making the $500 \nfamily tax credit refundable against employee-paid payroll taxes. \nNevertheless, I opposed this amendment because it would unfairly \nexclude many middle-class families who also need this relief. In my \nState of Michigan, there are many families where both the husband and \nthe wife work. It's not hard to imagine a family where the husband is \nan auto worker, the wife is a teacher, and their combined incomes are \nwell above the arbitrary cutoff established by the Breaux amendment. \nFurthermore, there are many families with children aged 16 or 17 who \nwill also lose out under the Breaux amendment. I should point out that \nteenagers are just as expensive as younger children--if not more; I \ndon't need to remind anyone just how much college costs these days, or \ncar insurance for that matter. Parents of children aged 16 and 17 are \nstruggling to make ends meet too, and they need the tax relief the \nBreaux amendment would take from them. It is my hope that FICA \nrefundability will be raised during conference and that a solution will \nbe adopted to provid tax relief to as many American families as \npossible.\n  Another group of amendments related to Medicare, Medicaid, and other \nhealth related matters. Senator Graham of Florida offered a motion to \nrecommit the reconciliation bill to the Finance Committee in an effort \nto reinstate the Federal entitlement and reduce the level of savings \nfrom the Medicaid program proposed in the Republican bill. This was, in \nessence, a killer amendment. As with the Rockefeller Medicare motion to \nrecommit, the Graham amendment struck at the core of our efforts to \nbalance the Federal budget by the year 2002.\n  Republicans believe it is time to end the Washington knows best \nmentality that dominates our budget policies and programs. Under \nour budget, we want to give the States more control over the Medicaid \nProgram in exchange for an overall reduction in the growth rate of the \nprogram. The States have proven that they can deliver government \nservices more efficiently and at less cost if they are given the \nfreedom to do so. The Republican bill does that by placing fewer \nstrings on the funds it provides to the States while focusing its \nresources on those workers on the frontlines--providing direct \nassistance to the needy.\n\n  There were separate amendments offered by Senators Chafee and Dodd \nrelated to Medicaid eligibility issues. I voted to maintain the \nMedicaid eligibility criteria already included in the reconciliation \nbill by the Finance Committee. The Chafee and Dodd amendments would \nhave mandated to the \n\n[[Page S 17042]]\nStates to cover certain classes of individuals under the State-run \nMedicaid Program. Again, this runs counter to our effort to provide \nStates with more flexibility--not less.\n  A similar amendment was offered by Senator Pryor. His amendment would \nhave extended existing Medicaid standards with regard to nursing home \nfacilities. At the time of the vote, it was my understanding that the \nSenate leadership would offer a subsequent amendment addressing the \nconcerns raised by the Senator from Arkansas. This amendment was \noffered and accepted, and it ensures that Federal nursing home \nstandards remain the minimum protection level afforded to nursing home \nresidents. Under this amendment, States may receive a waiver from \nFederal requirements, but only if the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices determines that the State's regulations are as tough--or \ntougher--than Federal regulations. With the understanding that this \namendment would be offered, I voted against the Pryor amendment.\n  Mr. President, another amendment worthy of note was the Kassebaum \namendment to restore funding to the school loan program. I had an \nopportunity to address these issues first as a member of the Senate \nLabor Committee. At that time, we were confronted with the need to meet \nour reconciliation instructions by reducing the cost of the school loan \nprogram. While the committee met its instruction by choosing the most \nacceptable of undesirable alternatives, several of my colleagues and I \npromised to work to reduce the impact these cuts would have on students \nand their parents. The result of this effort was the Kassenbaum \namendment to strike provisions eliminating the 6-month grace period for \nstudent, imposing a loan fee on institutions, and increasing the \ninterest rate on PLUS loans. This amendment effectively shielded \ncollege students from increased out-of-pocket costs, and I was pleased \nto see it adopted.\n  Senator Biden offered President Clinton's education tax credit \nproposal as an amendment to the bill. I voted against it because the \nreconciliation bill already includes a student loan tax credit of up to \n$500 for middle-class families. Our plan also provides considerable \nadditional relief to those families struggling to find enough resources \nin their limited family budget to cover the rising costs of college.\n  Senator Baucus offered an amendment to strike the ANWAR provisions of \nthe bill. I support responsible, environmentally controlled efforts to \nexplore and develop certain wilderness areas and, for that reason, I \nvoted to table this amendment.\n  It is important to note that, on this issue, the State of Alaska and \nits citizens have spoken out. The Eskimos and Alaska's elected \nrepresentatives recognize the potential benefits of development and \nsupport exploration of the region. The Inupiat Eskimos are the historic \nresidents of Alaska's North Slope; they are subsistence hunters who \nlive off the land. Proceeds from oil production means good schools, \nmedical services, and a better standard of living for them and their \nchildren.\n  Furthermore, responsible development of these oilfields is in \nAlaska's and the Nation's best interest. Alaska's current production \nfacility at Prudhoe Bay, which provides more than 20 percent of \ndomestic oil, is in decline. The State's revenues from oil are \nprojected to fall from more than $2 billion today to $700 million in \n2010. This could cause a grave fiscal crisis for Alaska. By contrast, \nif a commercial field is discovered projected Federal revenues could \napproach $40 billion.\n  Finally, it should be noted that the Eskimos, who are dependent on \nthe Caribou, fish, and other wildlife, believe that opening the refuge \nis compatible with their lifestyle and crucial to their survival.\n  For these reasons, I support the exploration of the coastal plain. I \nbelieve exploration can be done in a manner that protects the \nenvironment and also provides needed economic development.\n  A final tax matter which was addressed during debate was the Specter \namendment supporting replacing the current Tax Code with a flat tax. As \nan extraneous matter, this amendment was subject to a point of order. I \nvoted to sustain this point of order, but I want to emphasize that this \nvote should not be interpreted as opposition to the idea of the flat \ntax--but rather opposition to including it on this vehicle at this \ntime. I agree with Senator Specter that our current Tax Code is too \ncomplex and inefficient and needs to be replaced, and I support \ninvestigating the benefits of all of the proposed reforms that have \nbeen put forward, including a flat tax.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/14/senate-section/article/S17041-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WOMEN OF DISTINCTION--1995\n\n Mr. INOUYE.

Mr. President, I would like to bring to the \nattention of my Senate colleagues an important article prepared by \nStuart Anderson and Steve Moore of the Cato Institute entitled ``GOP \nBreaches of Contract.'' This piece explains why the immigration reform \nbill moving through the House violates the core principles of more \nfreedom and less government that form the basis of the GOP's Contract \nWith America. I would also like to highlight a recent statement signed \nby several business leaders on the need to maintain America's historic \ncommitment to legal immigration. As we begin debate on immigration \nlegislation here in the Senate, I would urge my colleagues to consider \nthis information carefully. I ask that these materials be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Nov. 6, 1995]\n\n                      GOP Breaches of `Contract'?\n\n                 (By Stuart Anderson and Stephen Moore)\n\n       The ``Contract With America'' was not simply a list of 10 \n     bills to be voted upon, but rather it represented the \n     governing philosophy of the Republican Party. Unfortunately, \n     the immigration bill recently voted out of the House \n     Judiciary Committee, with unanimous Republican support, \n     violates the four key precepts of the ``Contract with \n     America.''\n       (1) Family values. The Contract states: ``The American \n     family is at the very heart of our society. It is through the \n     family that we learn values like responsibility, morality, \n     commitment, and faith.'' The House immigration bill, H.R. \n     2202, strikes at the heart of family unification by \n     preventing brothers, sisters and nearly all adult children \n     from joining their families here in the United States.\n       A guarantee to admit 25,000 eligible parents annually (half \n     the current yearly total) was included in the bill, but only \n     after an outside analysis confirmed that no parents could \n     have immigrated if the bill had passed without amendment. But \n     the bill contains a new obstacle for parents--only those who \n     purchase nursing home and Medicare-comparable health \n     insurance will be allowed to \n\n[[Page S 17043]]\n     immigrate. That leaves only spouses and minor children, who could \n     immigrate only if their sponsors meet new income \n     requirements.\n       (2) Fiscal responsibility. ``Controlling spending is the \n     primary means to controlling the deficit,'' states the \n     Contract, yet the House immigration bill carries several big \n     ticket items. First, up to $80 million would be needed to \n     return fees paid by petitioners whose siblings or adult \n     children have received permission to immigrate but who will \n     be cut off the waiting list if the bill passes in its present \n     form. Second, estimates by the Cato Institute, the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the Social \n     Security Administration reveal that hundreds of millions of \n     dollars would eventually be needed to pay new and current \n     federal bureaucrats to staff, maintain and clean up the \n     proposed computer verification system. The system is designed \n     to check the legal status of new private and public sector \n     hires via telephone or modem. Third, the federal government \n     will assume the potentially quite large liability for \n     compensating any individual who loses a job or wages from \n     being wrongfully denied employment due to an error under the \n     new employment verification system.\n       (3) Rolling back government regulations. The Contract \n     notes, ``To free Americans from bureaucratic red tape, we \n     will require every new regulation to stand a new test: Does \n     it provide benefits worth the cost? To help our cities and \n     states, we will ban unfunded mandates.'' The bill's various \n     new mandates on cities, counties and states, including \n     requiring such entities to verify new hires through a federal \n     computer system, violate the intent of the recently passed \n     Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, which requires that new \n     mandates be paid for.\n       According to the Justice Department report on the nine-\n     company pilot project that the bill's new computer system is \n     based upon, compliance cost for companies using the system \n     has averaged $5,000 annually. During the Judiciary Committee \n     markup, Republicans defeated an amendment to stop the \n     computer system if a GAO study found the new program cost \n     small businesses more than $5,000 a year to implement. \n     However, even this figure understates the true cost to \n     businesses, since the pilot project allowed companies to \n     check the legal status of only self-identified immigrants, \n     while the House bill requires companies to check citizens as \n     well. As for the cost-benefit analysis for new regulations \n     recommended in the Contract, any benefit from this new system \n     is only hypothetical, since there is no evidence this new \n     mandate on businesses will reduce illegal immigration.\n       (4) Individual liberty. The Contract criticized the \n     ``Clinton Congress'' when it argued, ``Big Brother is alive \n     and well through myriad government programs.'' In committee, \n     Ohio Republican Rep. Steve Chabot attempted to delete the \n     computer system from the bill, calling it 1-800-BIG BROTHER, \n     but his effort lost on a 17-15 vote. He promises to fight the \n     measure on the House floor.\n       Advocates of individual liberty should at least question \n     any program that would centralize data on all Americans in a \n     place where future social engineers can wreak havoc on the \n     citizenry. Senate legislation attempts to ensure that only \n     Americans and legal residents are listed in the computer \n     system by requiring that everyone be fingerprinted or provide \n     other biometric data (such as a retina scan) to \n     ``personalize'' birth certificates by age 16. The House bill \n     moves in that direction by mandating a study of \n     ``counterfeit-resistant'' birth certificates. Moreover, at \n     least one computer system supporter in the House has said the \n     system will not work without some type of national ID card.\n       Supporters of smaller government and family values will \n     find that the House immigration bill violates the spirit, \n     indeed the essence, of the Contract. It also contradicts \n     Majority Leader Dick Armey's vision of a freedom revolution \n     and Speaker Newt Gingrich's desire to create a ``Conservative \n     Opportunity Society.'' The immigration bill's provisions \n     against families, the mandates on businesses, cities and \n     states, and the specter of creating yet another \n     uncontrollable government program should give pause to \n     reformers. These measures would represent business as usual, \n     not the Republican Revolution promised by the ``Contract With \n     America.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n      [From the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, Arlington, VA]\n\n                 Business: Immigration Helps Not Hurts\n\n       We are concerned that legislation on immigration before the \n     Congress will significantly damage U.S. economic growth, \n     jobs, and competitiveness. It seems to proceed from the \n     assumption that immigration is a mild ill which can only be \n     tolerated to a degree. Yet far from being a drain on U.S. \n     society or the economy, immigrants are a vital engine.\n       Immigrants generally pay more to the U.S. government in \n     taxes than they use in services, as a number of studies have \n     shown. In fact, a sudden drop in immigration levels would \n     sharply reduce Social Security revenues.\n       Immigrants play a key role in product and technological \n     development, the cutting edge of U.S. industrial growth. Many \n     of our fastest-growing firms, and largest exporters, employ a \n     significant share of immigrants in research and overseas \n     marketing. Most of them cannot be replaced, and their loss \n     would mean the loss of thousands of other jobs for Americans. \n     Each year, many immigrants, some of them at our firms, obtain \n     patents for products and processes that generate jobs, \n     growth, indeed entire industries.\n       Immigrants own a significant share of small businesses. \n     These small businesses are the engine of jobs growth in the \n     U.S.: As a number of studies have shown, a large number of \n     new jobs are generated by the smallest U.S. firms. Often \n     these small operations become the driving force by which \n     whole communities and cities are revived: Cuban renewal of \n     Jersey City; the Vietnamese corridor of Arlington, Virginia; \n     prosperous Asian communities throughout California.\n       On balance, a survey of Nobel economists released by the \n     Alexis de Tocqueville Institution showed near-unanimous \n     agreement immigration is a major economic plus.\n       Of course, we believe measures to increase the costs and \n     complexity of hiring immigrants, and to reduce ceilings on \n     such hirings, and other measures pose a special threat to \n     American competitiveness. But we recognize that restrictions \n     on family re-unification, refugees, and other categories not \n     labeled as economic are vitally important as well. Workers \n     have husbands, wives and children. Many present employers \n     came to this country not as major business executives, but as \n     victims of persecution, famine or civil war. If these \n     categories, or general immigration levels, are reduced, \n     economic immigration will suffer, too.\n       U.S. immigration policy could certainly be improved, and \n     illegal immigration brought under more reasonable control \n     (without national databases and i.d. cards). But the core of \n     any reform should involve extension and refinement of present \n     immigration levels, not tighter restrictions. And it should \n     be based on the understanding that high levels of immigration \n     are no liability; they are part of America's strength.\n       John Whitehead, former co-chairman, Goldman Sachs, former \n     deputy secretary of state\n       George Soros, president, Soros Fund Management\n       Kenneth Tomlinson, editor-in-chief, Reader's Digest, former \n     Director, Voice of America\n       Richard Gilder, Gilder, Gagnon and Howe\n       Lewis Eisenberg, co-chairman, Granite Capital International \n     Group\n       Cliff Sobel, CEO, Bon Art International\n       Ed Zschau, International Business Machines\n       Donna Fitzpatrick, president and CEO, Radiance Services \n     Company\n       Dr. J.

Mr. President, we hope to turn to S. 908 tomorrow, the \nState Department reorganization bill, under a 4-hour time limitation. \nIt is also possible that the Senate may consider a continuing \nresolution or debt limit extension, if received from the House. The \nSenate may also turn to any available appropriations conference \nreports.\n  I hope that we can go to S. 908. Certainly, it has been \ncontroversial, and it has been discussed and discussed. I think now we \nhave some agreement between the Senator from North Carolina, Senator \nHelms, and the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry. If we can \ncomplete that, it might free up some of the nominations and also some \n\n[[Page S 17044]]\nof the conferees that I understand are being held because this has not \nbeen disposed of. We can check on that tomorrow.\n  I also indicate that, as far as this Senator knows--we have checked \non the House side--there will not be a reason to stay in this evening. \nSo there will not be a CR coming to us from the House. There was an \noffer made by Senator Domenici and Congressman Kasich to members from \nthe White House representing the President earlier today. I am not \ncertain if that offer has been rejected.\n  In any event, we will be back tomorrow. It is my hope that we will \ncontinue to work, as we have today and yesterday and through the \nevening and past midnight last night, to come to some agreement and \npass a continuing resolution, which will avoid any longer shutdown of \nthe Government.\n  I believe much of what transpired, of course, will be up to the \nPresident of the United States. If he is prepared to sign on to a 7-\nyear balanced budget, then we can do business very quickly.\n  As I said earlier, in a brief 5-minute appearance at the White House, \nI think the President used the term ``balanced budget'' at least five, \nsix, seven, eight times, about how strong he was for it, and that he \nwanted a balanced budget. Well, if he wants a balanced budget, then I \nsee no reason he cannot accept our proposal, which would eliminate the \nMedicare provision and keep some of the spending restraints and also \nadd balanced budget language.\n  I hope the President would look at it carefully. He has indicated in \nthe past, in 1992, he was for a 5-year balanced budget; since then, for \n10 years, 9 years, 8 years, or 7 years, or maybe none of the above, but \nhe has indicated flexibility.\n  If he is serious about a balanced budget amendment or getting a \nbalanced budget by the year 2002, I see no reason we cannot only pass a \ncontinuing resolution, but the debt ceiling extension very quickly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/14/senate-section/article/S17043-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. DOLE.
