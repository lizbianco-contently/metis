In Your Word You consistently \ncall those who believe in You to reach out to the poor and those who \nsuffer. But Lord, You know there is sharp division on how to implement \nYour admonition.\n  As this Senate considers welfare reform measures, we ask for Your \nwisdom to discern how best to care for those in need. Help us to listen \nfor the echo of Your truth as Senators speak from the several different \napproaches to the role of government in welfare programs. May what is \ndone be more than a hand out, but a hand up to lift people from the \nvicious cycle of poverty or a life of habitual dependence on \ngovernment. Show us the most creative balance of responsibility between \nthe Federal Government and the States.\n  Lord, we believe there is a workable solution for the future, and \nthat during the hours of discussion and debate, You will guide the \nSenators to a way to unite in creative legislation. To this end we \ncommit our work this week.

Mr. President, over the next hour, a number of Senators \nwill be presenting a very simple message. That message is that we, \ntogether, must work to save Medicare for the current generation, to \nstrengthen it for all future generations, and to simplify it for \neveryone to make it easier to use and easier to understand.\n  I now turn to the Senator from New Mexico to make an opening \nstatement on our efforts to preserve Medicare.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this morning I want to continue our \nMedicare discussion with the American people.\n  For 30 years, Medicare has provided health protection to the elderly \nand disabled citizens. Medicare has been a successful program. It has \nprovided an important source of health security and needed benefits to \nmillions of Americans since its inception 30 years ago. Today, 37 \nmillion Americans receive the benefits and health security that \nMedicare provides. \n\n[[Page S 11716]]\n\n  Medicare has become an expensive program, and everyone, including the \nPresident, agrees that the system needs fundamental structural reform.\n  Medicare is running out of money. Unless we make changes now, \nMedicare will not continue to provide the same level of health security \nin the future.\n  Nevertheless, 1 week ago, the President held a rally for Medicare. \nAll he talked about was the past. The President forgot the most \nimportant element of an anniversary celebration--he forgot to look \nforward to the next anniversary and the next anniversary after that. If \nthe President fights the reforms necessary to save Medicare's future, \nthen in just 7 years, on the 37th anniversary of Medicare, the program \nwill be bankrupt.\n  In the President's first budget, which he sent to us in February, \nMedicare would go bankrupt in the year 2002. Seven more years--that is \nall we would give the Medicare Program in terms of its existence. After \nthat, there would be no money to pay Medicare hospital benefits. The \nPresident would let you choose your doctor, he says, but there would be \nno money to pay your hospital bills.\n  The President's original Medicare proposal was great--for the next 7 \nyears. But the 37th anniversary of Medicare would be its last. Under \nthe President's original plan, if you are on Medicare, you better not \nget sick 8 years from now.\n  Back in January, the President did not listen to his own Cabinet \nSecretaries. Three of his own Cabinet officers--Secretaries Bentsen, \nShalala, and Reich--are trustees of the Medicare system. Along with two \npublic trustees they told the President and the Congress that the \nMedicare hospital insurance trust fund had only enough money to pay \nbenefits for the next 7 years.\n  The President chose to ignore that. The Republicans in the Congress \ndid not. We invited the public trustees up to Capitol Hill to tell us \nwhat needs to be done. We listened carefully. Now we are taking their \nadvice.\n  Let me read from the summary of the trustees' report. The full board \nof trustees says:\n\n       The Hospital Insurance Trust fund * * * will be able to pay \n     benefits for only about 7 years and is severely out of \n     financial balance in the long range.\n\n  This is the report, the summary of it, ``Status of Social Security \nand Medicare Programs.'' It clearly indicates:\n\n       We strongly recommend that the crisis presented by the \n     financial condition of the Medicare Trust Funds be urgently \n     addressed on a comprehensive basis, including a review of the \n     program's financing methods, benefit provisions, and delivery \n     mechanisms.\n\n  This is what the public trustees of Medicare recommend that we do so \nthat we can strengthen Medicare and have many, many, anniversaries to \ncome. This is exactly what we are trying to do now.\n  There are those who claim, Mr. President, that we are making changes \nto Medicare for other reasons. They say we are changing Medicare to \nbalance the budget. We are changing Medicare to lessen the tax burden \non working families. That is what some people say.\n  Both of those claims are false. We are making changes to the Medicare \nsystem to save the program, to strengthen Medicare so it can survive \ninto the next century. Even if we are not going to balance the budget, \nMr. President, even if we are not going to balance the budget, we need \nto save Medicare. And whether or not we cut taxes, we still have to \nsave Medicare.\n  Any attempt to link the two is no more than blue smoke and mirrors \nfrom the opponents of reform who think the status quo will last \nforever,\n and that we will have a 40th anniversary of Medicare by just leaving \nit alone, when it is patent it will not be there in 10 years.\n\n  The Republicans in Congress have chosen to look toward Medicare's \nfuture. We decided this spring that we would save Medicare from \nbankruptcy, control the growth of costs of the program, and ensure that \nthe program would survive past its 40th anniversary. We developed and \npassed a budget plan in June that guaranteed a strong Medicare into the \nnext century.\n  Suddenly--and to some extent we are grateful for this--the President \ndecided to join us. In June, he submitted the outlines of a new budget \nproposal, one which he claimed would save Medicare.\n  In June, the President made a good start. His budget would save $127 \nbillion from Medicare over the next 7 years. He is now comparing that \nwith our budget, which will slow the rate of growth by $270 billion \nover the next 7 years.\n  If I believed that we could save Medicare by doing what the President \nwants to do, I would do it in a second. But after a long hard look at \nthe numbers and the program, and after extensive discussions with the \nCongressional Budget Office, I do not think the President's plan will \nsave Medicare.\n  You see, the President assumed that the costs of the program would \nnot grow as fast as projected by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  The President's June budget outline assumes that a serious Medicare \nproblem does not exist. He says the problem is not as hard to solve as \nthe neutral Congressional Budget Office says. The President, therefore, \nis much more optimistic in his assumptions than the Congressional \nBudget Office.\n  I wish it were true, but I am afraid it is not. As much as the \nPresident wishes it would, the problem will not go away.\n  The President has come a long way since his first budget in January. \nNow all he has to do is use the Congressional Budget Office numbers, \nand we will have an excellent starting point for discussions.\n  All he has to do is live up to the commitments that he made in his \nfirst State of the Union Address, his promise that we would use the \nCongressional Budget Office as the neutral analyst of budget \ninformation.\n  We in Congress use that neutral body. The honest, responsible way to \nbudget is to rely on one single source of assumptions, and that is what \nwe did, both in our budget plan and in our Medicare estimates. We did \nnot make the problem go away by wishing that it would go away. We asked \nthe Congressional Budget Office and the trustees what it would take to \nsave Medicare, to keep it alive to its 40th anniversary.\n  The trustees have told us what we must do. The Congressional Budget \nOffice has told us what we must do. And now we have to get on with \ndoing it.\n  We are going to slow the rate of growth of the program. Medicare \nspending will grow 6.4 percent per year under the reform plan. Over the \nnext 7 years, Medicare spending is going to increase from $4,800 per \nperson to $6,700 per person. Let me repeat. Medicare spending in the 7 \nyears of the budget plan is going to increase from $4,800 per person to \n$6,700 per person--$1,900.\n  I know older Americans are seriously concerned about the future and \nwhat it will bring to them and what it will bring to their children and \ngrandchildren. I have found that senior citizens are extremely \nconcerned about the crushing burden of the debt that our current \npolicies will place on their grandchildren. All I know is that they \nalso want a Medicare Program that is fair, both for them and for \ngenerations yet to come.\n  I also know that a 65-year-old couple that starts receiving Medicare \nthis year will, over their lifetimes, receive $117,000 more in Medicare \nbenefits than they will put into the system in payroll taxes and \npremiums. I know that this will concern many seniors, who want Medicare \nto be there in the future for them, for their children, and for their \ngrandchildren. We are going to spend nearly 5 percent more per year on \nMedicare beneficiaries in this budget. So anyone who says we are \ncutting Medicare is just not telling the truth.\n  What, honestly, should scare America's senior citizens and disabled \ncitizens is the prospect that we will do nothing. For if we do nothing, \nseniors will have a hospital benefit plan for only 7 more years. If we \ndo nothing, seniors will be able to keep their doctors but only for the \nnext 7 years. After that, you will still have your doctor, but he will \nnot be able to treat you in a hospital. After that, the hospital \ninsurance trust fund will run out of money and Medicare will not be \nable to pay hospital benefits.\n  I want to make sure that our seniors can keep their existing \ncoverage. I want to give them the opportunity to choose other health \nplans, just like my colleagues and I in the Senate can choose our own \nhealth plans. And I believe this is exactly what the Republicans in the \nSenate want to see happen. They want to give the seniors the \nopportunity to choose other health plans just like we choose every \nyear. \n\n[[Page S 11717]]\n\n  Most important, I want to make sure that they can do all of these \nthings for more than just 7 years. In September we are going to report \nlegislation that will strengthen Medicare. We are going to simplify \nMedicare, and we are going to make sure that every Medicare beneficiary \nhas the right to choose his or her health plan, just like my fellow \nSenators and I have. We need to strengthen Medicare. And to do that we \nhave to control the program's rate of growth.\n  The first thing we are going to do is to attack the waste and fraud \nin the system. Every senior recently receiving Medicare knows the \nsystem is inefficient, complex, and filled with opportunities for waste \nand fraud. We are going after that money first.\n  But all experts tell us that will not be enough. We are going to do \nthat, but then we are going to have to look at changes to the program, \nin both the short and the long term.\n  In the short run, we are going to have to look at how much we pay \ndoctors and hospitals--that is in the short term-- and the way we pay \ndoctors and hospitals for the services seniors receive. We are going to \ncreate the right incentives, so that doctors and hospitals are smart \nabout how they spend your money.\n  Most importantly, we are going to offer seniors more choices. As a \nSenator, I have, as has everyone in this body, an opportunity to choose \nmy health plan once a year. If I want a generous program with lots of \nbenefits and no deductibles, I pay a bit more.\n  In some of the areas of the country, Medicare already is \nexperimenting with this, and seniors have a choice. But that is a very \nsmall portion. For the most part, the Medicare Program is stuck in the \nrigidities of a 30-year-old program while health delivery in America \nhas moved strongly away from that to various choices for our people, \nnot just one choice.\n  We are going to expand this program and gradually change the system \nso that all seniors will have choices like we have in the Senate. Some \nseniors are going to have to pay a little more. There is no way we can \nget around that. But we going to come to seniors last after we have \nattacked fraud and waste and after we have made changes to the way we \npay doctors and hospitals and after we have started to phase in changes \nthat provide seniors with many choices.\n  Any changes are going to be phased in gradually over time. We are \nconcerned and considerate with seniors. They do not want rapid changes. \nWe do not think that is necessary. We know that seniors who are on \nfixed incomes have difficulty adjusting to dramatic changes, and we are \ntaking that into account.\n  We are not going to let Medicare go bankrupt. Yes, I too celebrate \nthe 30th anniversary of Medicare. It has been an important program \ncritical to health of America's older and disabled people. But right \nnow I am thinking about how we are going to make sure that Medicare has \na 40th anniversary and beyond.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to continue our discussion \nthis morning on Medicare and our efforts to save it, to strengthen it \nand to simplify it for the current generation.\n  As the distinguished Senator from New Mexico just said, this is the \n30th anniversary of the Medicare system, a program, a system that is \nbeloved by over 37 million Americans.\n  Mr. President, a birthday celebration is--by definition--a \nrecognition of the past and not the future. In commemorating the birth \nof a loved one, we honor all that he is and has done to earn our \nesteem. As much as we may wish it, however, whether that person lives \nto celebrate future birthdays, is out of our hands.\n  Perhaps that is why when President Clinton celebrated the 30th \nanniversary of the birth of Medicare last Saturday--a system beloved by \nmore than 37 million Americans--he spent the day reminiscing about its \npast, and ignoring its future.\n  But just as blowing out all the candles will not guarantee that your \nwish comes true, closing our eyes to the facts about the health of the \nMedicare system will do nothing to prolong its life.\n  Mr. President, on April 3 of this year, Medicare was diagnosed as \nterminal. Unless Congress takes ``prompt, effective, and decisive \naction''--we were told--Medicare will be dead in 7 years.\n  Who made this diagnosis? Not a band of wild-eyed, budget-cutters on \nCapitol Hill. Not a horde of Robin Hood-like raiders who want to steal \nfrom the old to give to the rich, as the President and some in his \nparty would like the American people to believe.\n  No, Mr. President, it was the bipartisan board of Medicare trustees--\na board which includes the Commissioner of Social Security, two public \ntrustees appointed by Democrats and Republicans, and three members of \nMr. Clinton's own Cabinet: Robert Rubin, the Secretary of the Treasury; \nRobert Reich, the Secretary of Labor; and Donna Shalala, the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services.\n  It has already been pointed out in this report by the Medicare \ntrustees.\n  So why is the President ignoring their advice? Perhaps because the \nPresident has no plan of his own to save Medicare. Perhaps because he \nbelieves that if he just ignores the problem long enough, it will go \naway. More likely, Mr. President, it is because he hopes that senior \ncitizens will simply be too scared to understand that they can take \ncontrol of their own health care without the Government telling them \nwhat to do.\n  Mr. President, Medicare's impending bankruptcy is not a Republican \nnor a Democrat issue--neither one. It is just a plain fact. It is a \nfact because the average 65-year-old couple retiring today will consume \nabout $120,000 more in Medicare benefits than they paid into the \nsystem, than they paid into this trust fund, in terms of premiums, in \nterms of taxes over their lifetime.\n  It is a fact because it now takes the taxes of more than three and a \nhalf workers to pay for one retiring couple's health care regardless of \nthat couple's income. It is a fact because before long the number of \nsenior citizens on Medicare will far exceed the number of tax-paying \nworkers. And it is a fact because for years Congress has been putting \noff reform, ignoring the warning signs and tinkering around the edges \nby raising payroll taxes and by cutting payments to providers. Well, we \ncan tinker no longer.\n  It is a fact because next year for the first time in its history \nMedicare will be spending more that year than it takes in. And once \nthat happens, the trust fund begins to go broke. Once that happens, the \ntrust fund will be bankrupt in 7 years.\n  Mr. President, when it goes bankrupt, when that happens under Federal \nlaw, no hospital bills can be paid. In just 7 years seniors will not \nhave less Medicare; they will have no Medicare.\n  Mr. President, unlike President Clinton and some other Members of the \nDemocrat Party, Republicans simply are not willing to abandon 37 \nmillion Americans to a wish and a prayer.\n  Our birthday present to Medicare will be a plan to save it, to \nstrengthen it, and to simplify it--to save it for every citizen who \ndepends upon it now today, to strengthen it for every person who is \ncounting on it in the future, and to simplify it for everyone to make \nit easier to use and easier to understand.\n  Let me make three points very quickly.\n  First, under the Republican plan, Medicare will continue to grow. \nYes, it will be at a slower but a more sustainable rate that will \npreserve it, that will save it over time.\n  Today, Medicare spending is growing at the rate of 10.4 percent per \nyear--that is more than three times the rates of inflation, and more \nthan twice the rate of private health care spending.\n  Under the Republican plan, Medicare spending will continue to grow--\nat the rate of 6.4 percent per year--which is still more than twice the \nrate of inflation.\n  Spending per beneficiary will increase from $4,800 per senior this \nyear to $6,700 per senior by the year 2002--an increase of more than \n$1,900 per beneficiary, and\n  Under the Republican plan, by the year 2002, the Federal Government \nwill have spent $96 billion more on Medicare beneficiaries than it \nspent in 1995.\n  Mr. President--any way you slice it--that is not a cut.\n  The second point: The Republican plan will also guarantee that every \nsenior citizen will have the right to choose:\n\n[[Page S 11718]]\n\n  The same traditional fee-for-service Medicare insurance they have \nright now; the same insurance as any Member of Congress; the same \ninsurance their children have; and preretirees will have the right keep \ntheir current benefit package, without having to change to a Government \nsystem that offers them less care than they had in the private sector.\n  Mr. President, under the Republican plan, seniors will not lose their \nMedicare entitlement. They will continue to be entitled to the right to \nreceive all of Medicare's benefits--including inpatient hospital care, \nskilled nursing facility care, home health care, hospice, care, \nphysician services, laboratory and diagnostic tests, and x ray and \nradiation therapy.\n  They will continue to be entitled to the right to remain in the \ncurrent Medicare system that they know today.\n  But they will also be entitled to a right that is denied them today \nunder the current Medicare system, the right to choose insurance that \nis available to other younger Americans, insurance that may offer them \nmore benefits, be it prescriptions, be it eyeglasses, than they have \ntoday, and quite possibly at lower costs.\n  The third point is that we must take time to do it right. Mr. \nPresident, Medicare is just too critical. As a physician, I have had \nthe opportunity to see it work, doctor to patient, every day for the \nlast 18 years. It is too important to apply politics as usual. It must \nbe a bipartisan effort. But the longer we do nothing, the worse \nMedicare's financial status becomes.\n  We must act now--act now to save Medicare for those who are on it \ntoday.\n  We must begin that process today of strengthening the Medicare system \nfor those who will be counting on it in the future. We must work \ntogether, and we must do it right.\n  Mr. President, in closing, just as every birthday offers a new \nopportunity to change in many ways to a healthier lifestyle and a \nreminder of what will happen if we do not change, so too does this \nMedicare anniversary, this Medicare birthday provide us with the \nincentive we need to begin the process, a process that, indeed, will \nguarantee Medicare not just a 7-year survival but a long life and many \nhappy returns of the day.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I look forward to continuing the \ndiscussion over the next 30 minutes or so, and at this juncture I would \nlike to turn to the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, who has \ncoordinated much of what we call the freshman focus which reflects what \nmany of us in the freshman class, the 11 new Senators, want to \naccomplish, and that is significant change, effective change, because \nthat is what our mandate was from the American people.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                       Strengthening of Medicare\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the strengthening of \nMedicare, to continue some of our dialog this morning about this \nimportant issue. As my friend from Tennessee said, those of us who came \nto the Senate this year I think have been particularly interested in \ndealing with those questions that require change. I think we all came \nwith a renewed idea of the feeling of voters because we were elected in \nthis last election, a feeling of voters that there does need to be a \nchange; that there does need to be an honest evaluation of programs; \nthat we do need to react to the needs of programs, to change them when \nthey need to be changed, and not simply seek to apply some sort of \npolitical remedy that makes everybody feel good. So we have found \nourselves dealing with some pretty tough issues and intend to continue.\n  So I rise in support of strengthening Medicare, of course. I think \nmost everybody at this point understands that there has to be change. \nEverybody I know of wants to strengthen the Medicare Program. Everybody \nI know of thinks that there is value in this program, thinks it is a \nprogram that needs to be maintained, one that needs to continue to be \navailable, not only for the 37 million people who currently participate \nbut, frankly, it means a lot to some of us who do not yet participate, \nyet who have mothers, as in my case, who do participate, and I feel \nvery good about that. She feels good about it as well. She feels \nconfident that there will be care for her as she grows older.\n  So it is not a question of whether we want the program or whether we \nlike the program. We do. The question is, How do we preserve it? The \nquestion is, Do we respond to the facts that are readily available, \nmost graphically portrayed in the trustees' report, that you have to do \nsomething or the program goes broke? That is fairly clear. Or I suppose \nyou can seek to use it as sort of a political tool and then spin it \ninto a protectionist sort of thing and try to use it in 1996.\n  I hope that is not the case. In fact, Mr. President, that causes me \nto reflect just a moment on something that bothers me quite a little \nbit, in that this issue has become something of a victim of that \ntendency to spin and merchandise issues for their political value \nrather than really being willing to deal with them as the facts \ndictate.\n  That is not something unique to the Democrats or unique to the \nRepublicans or, indeed, unique to groups that are outside of the \nparties that deal in political issues. Frankly, it troubles me a great \ndeal. If we are, as we are, a Government of the people and by the \npeople and for the people, then the people who are going to ultimately \nmake the decisions need to make those decisions based on facts.\n  It is almost an irony that the technology of information has changed \nso much that we have more information available to us, more quickly, \nwherever we live. In Wapiti, WY, where I come from, people can see when \nYeltsin gets up on the tape 10 minutes after it happens. Imagine this \ncompared to 50 years ago or 100 years ago when issues and facts and \nGovernment only came to people after months of communications.\n  So it is an irony to me that we now have for each of us as voters the \nbest opportunity to know facts and to know them quickly. However, we \nare faced with this notion of a continuing growth in the idea of \nspinning issues so that the facts are not there.\n  It is legitimate to have a different view as to how you solve \nproblems. It is legitimate to have great debates. It is legitimate to \nsay I wish to go this way and you want to go that way, but they ought \nto be based on facts. In this instance, the facts are before us. The \nfacts are put forth by a bipartisan group, not only bipartisan but made \nup a majority of this administration's Cabinet. So there are facts \nthere.\n  I do not know what there is new to say except to reiterate the 30th \nbirthday of Medicare. Two weeks ago, the Democrats flocked to \nIndependence, MO, to celebrate, as they should, a successful program, \nbut there were two words missing. One was bankruptcy and the other was \n2002 which the facts tell us should be what we are really concerned \nabout in making the changes necessary to strengthen Medicare.\n  My colleague from Tennessee mentioned 37 million people by whom the \nprogram is beloved. It is also beloved by many others who feel \nconfident that their mothers and fathers are going to be taken care of. \nUnfortunately, the program has major financial concerns and the \nadministration has chosen to ignore them. The administration has chosen \nto attack those who want to strengthen the program by making some \nchanges.\n  The fact is there are two choices that will be available if we do not \ndo something. One is we will have to eliminate the coverage for \nhospital services and home care and the other is raise taxes by $711 \nbillion. Neither option is acceptable. Seniors cannot afford to go \nwithout health care and no one suggests that they should. Indeed, we \nare here to strengthen it. The payroll tax needed to make the part A \nhospital insurance trust fund permanently sound would be an increase of \nover 3 percent on top of the 2.9 percent that is now paid. This would \nmore than double the withholding. It means the payroll tax for a worker \nearning $45,000 would be increased by $1,584, nearly $1,600 a year.\n  One of the interesting notions is the attempt to tie the tax \nreduction proposal to the changes being proposed in Medicare, but it \nreally does not fit there at all. Part A of this program, which \nprovides coverage for hospital, home health care, and skilled nursing \nfacility services, is financed by Social Security payroll taxes, not by \ngeneral \n\n[[Page S 11719]]\nfunds. And for the first time next year, we will be digging into the \nreserves to pay for that.\n  So those are the options that are before us. While it has already \nbeen described, we need to make a change that reduces the annual rate \nof growth from 10 percent to roughly 7 or 6.5 percent. This will allow \nspending to increase from $4,800 to over $6,700 per individual. That \ntakes into account the growing number of individuals. We also must \nchange from a defined benefit program to a defined contribution \nprogram. Older people come in all kinds of financial conditions. They \nwant to make choices with regard to the type of coverage they want and \nshould be able to do that.\n  We had hearings last year in the House, specifically in the Committee \non Government Operations which I was a member of, on fraud and abuse. \nThe witnesses testified that fraud represented 10 percent of overall \ncosts in terms of the amount of money that is spent on health care. \nThat is almost $90 billion. Clearly, we must do something about fraud \nand abuse.\n  Another change that must be made is to encourage all of us, and the \nelderly in particular, to look at their bills to see if double-billing \nor over-billing exists. Taxpayers should no longer tolerate the \nresponse, ``What do you care? You don't have to pay for it anyway.'' I \nran into this in a nursing home in Cheyenne, WY, where the materials \nthat were sent there just happened to be a mechanical thing that cost \nabout three times what it ought to cost them. The answer was, ``It \ndoesn't matter because you don't have to pay for it.'' I disagree \nbecause it does matter.\n  So, Mr. President, I am pleased Medicare is high on our agenda. I am \npleased we are focusing on a problem that needs to be fixed. I am \npleased that we are trying to strengthen the program so it may continue \nto exist and provide benefits not just on the 30th anniversary, but the \n40th, and the 50th. That is our goal.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. I see that the distinguished Senator from Arizona is here \nas we continue our discussion to save Medicare and to strengthen it for \nthe current seniors, individuals with disabilities, as well as for the \nnext generation.\n  I should also thank the Senator from Wyoming for his statements and \nsimply add that, if we were to do nothing--when he brought up taxes and \nhow Medicare is paid for--by the year 2020, we would have to pay twice \nas much in taxes, in payroll taxes, as we pay now to keep that trust \nfund afloat.\n  We must act and we must act now.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Crisis In Medicare\n\n  Mr. KYL. I would like to thank the Senator from Tennessee for \nyielding this time. I think it is fortunate that in the Senate now we \nhave a distinguished surgeon, someone very familiar with the delivery \nof health care, who can help us in the crafting of legislation to deal \nwith this important problem that faces us today, the reform of our \nMedicare system to preserve and to protect and to strengthen Medicare. \nThat is the challenge that faces us today. And I appreciate the time to \ntalk on that.\n  Before I begin that discussion, however, I would like to ask \nunanimous consent that, after my remarks, there be printed in the \nRecord a copy of an editorial that was carried this morning in the Wall \nStreet Journal dealing with the subject we debated much last week and \nwhich, hopefully, will be concluded this week. The editorial is \nentitled ``GOP Stakes Missile Defense.'' It is about our missile \ndefense program and the work that the Senate has done to foster that \nprogram.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, my colleague, John McCain, and I have been \nconducting a series of townhall meetings in the State of Arizona for \nthe last several months to talk about this question of how we preserve \nand protect and strengthen Medicare. We have listened to our \nconstituents. And I think the first thing we ought to do here, when we \nbegin to craft solutions, is to find out what they think is important \nto retain and what needs to be fixed and how to do that.\n  So I am hoping that our colleagues will utilize what little time \nmight remain of the August recess to hold such meetings with \nconstituents, come back with new ideas about how to address the problem \nwhen we really begin work on this in September.\n  People might wonder why we are talking about this particular subject \nthis morning. Of course, the reason we are doing it is because, \nhopefully, at the end of this week we will be leaving Washington for 3 \nweeks or so for the so-called recess. And it does offer us that \nopportunity to begin to talk to people about it. We want to begin that \nconversation right now.\n  There has been much conversation already about the Medicare trustees' \nreport. I do not think that anyone now who is familiar with the problem \nwill deny that there is a problem, that we have to do something right \naway to fix that problem, to take quick action. If we do not, as has \nbeen noted before, Medicare will be bankrupt beginning in the year \n2002. Let me quote one small portion from the Medicare trustees' \nreport.\n\n       We strongly recommend that the crisis presented by the \n     financial condition of the Medicare Trust Funds * * * be \n     urgently addressed on a comprehensive basis, including a \n     review of the program's financing methods, benefits \n     provisions, and delivery mechanisms.\n\n  Mr. President, that is something that I like to begin meetings with \nwhen I talk to my constituents in Arizona, because the Medicare \ntrustees say we need to look at all three of these aspects.\n  First, a review of the program's financing aspects. This means \ntalking about taxes and premiums primarily, as my colleague from \nWyoming just pointed out. The Medicare part A payroll tax paid by \nworkers would have to be increased by up to 600 percent if we are going \nto solve the financial condition of Medicare by a payroll tax increase. \nIf we are going to deal with it by increasing the premiums, the part B \npremiums, they would have to be increased by up to 700 percent. I ask \nseniors in Arizona, ``Is anybody here in favor of raising taxes or \npremiums?'' It might not be surprising that no hands go up, at least \nvery few hands go up on that.\n  All right. Let us turn then to the second thing that the trustees say \nwe have to review, a review of the program's benefits provisions. \nLikewise, it might not surprise anyone here that when you ask whether \nor not anyone would like to see benefits reduced, you see very few \nhands go up in the audience. And, indeed, limiting benefits would \nmerely exacerbate the Medicare coverage limitations that force seniors \nto spend millions per year on MediGap supplemental insurance.\n  If we are talking, on the other hand, about restricting Medicare \nreimbursements to providers, that has been tried in the past. That is \nhow we have tried to deal with this problem so far. And it has not \nworked. It only increases the incentives for rationing. We have seen \nthe results of that because Medicare pays only between 60 and 70 \npercent of the cost of care. More and more providers have decided not \nto provide that kind of care. So that limits the choice for seniors.\n  Well, the third thing that can be done in dealing with Medicare \nreform, according to the trustees, is review of the delivery \nmechanisms. And that is where the real savings are to be found. That is \nwhere the real incentives for providing better care at an ultimately \nreduced cost is going to be found, I think.\n  I think review of delivery mechanisms divides itself into two \nconvenient ways of discussing the problem. The first are specific \nthings that we can do in the delivery of this care, that we know will \nsave money and will not at all adversely affect the care that seniors \nreceive. When we hold these townhall meetings, we like to ask the \npeople in attendance, ``Has anybody here ever reviewed a bill for \nsomething that they received and had Medicare pay for and found a \nmistake in the bill?'' Well, almost every hand goes up. And as a matter \nof fact, during the question and answer period, again, it is not \nsurprising that you have tens of seniors coming up telling their \npersonal stories about the surgery that they had to have or their \nspouse had to \n\n[[Page S 11720]]\nhave and the bill, and they cannot believe what they charged. They \nasked about it, and it was, ``Yes, it is an overcharge, but we do not \nhave the mechanism for trying to deal with that. Somebody else is \npaying for it. Do not worry about it.''\n  That frustrates seniors very greatly because they saved all their \nlives, paid taxes and they see the waste and abuse and, yes, sometimes \nfraud. And it makes them mad. It ought to make all of us mad. They want \nthat dealt with. Before there is any talk about increasing any \ncontribution that they may want to make or having to deal with the \ndelivery of health care differently, they want to know that we have \nsqueezed every dime of savings that can be squeezed out of this program \nin eliminating the waste and the fraud and even the abuse.\n  One of the ideas we talked about to deal with this is some kind of \nreward whereby those who find the mistakes receive, let us say just \nhypothetically, 10 percent of all of the mistakes that have been \ncertified to have existed or the fraud that has resulted in \noverpayments. So that is one way to deal with the problem.\n  There is also a need, obviously, for tort reform, because there is \ntoo much excess spending in the program that results from the necessity \nof physicians and hospitals having to practice what we call defensive \nmedicine, having to protect themselves from liability lawsuits and, \ntherefore, ordering extra, unnecessary, and costly tests and \nprocedures. So we need to have tort reform as a part of this overall \nreform.\n  There are other things like computerized billings and some other \nthings that we know will save a lot of money and does not affect the \ndelivery of care at all.\n  But we also know the second part of this discussion has to involve \nactual changes in the way that the various health care options are \npresented to seniors so that they can then have a wider array of \nchoices and, with that wider array of choices being presented, the \ncompetition by the providers will naturally result in driving costs \ndown.\n  We also know that if they have the option of making choices \nthemselves, where they may be able to keep some of the savings that \nresult, there will necessarily be savings because it is no longer a \nthird party paying it without consequence, it is rather the seniors \nbeing able to exercise a choice and save some of the money that is \nsaved in the system.\n  So we think these are additional ways by which we can save money.\n  Now, we do not have a secret plan out there as to how to do this. \nThat is why we want to talk to our constituents to find out what they \nthink is the best way to do this. But there have been some pretty good \nideas out there. And they basically enhance choice. They say, if you \nlike the current kind of system, you can keep that. If you think it \nwould be beneficial to you to go to an HMO, you can do that, although \nthere should not be any disincentives for those who do not want to go \nto an HMO.\n  Some people like the idea of going to PPO's and some like the idea of \nthe medisave account. Frankly, I think this presents a great \nopportunity for us because, as I said a moment ago, with a medisave \naccount you basically provide seniors with an amount of money they can \nspend so long as they can buy a major medical policy that can take care \nof their major medical expenses.\n They then have enough money left over to pay the out-of-pocket \nexpenses that they have to pay until they reach the limit that would \nthen kick into a major medical or a catastrophic policy. But if they do \nnot spend that money, they get to keep what is left over and that \nprovides a powerful incentive not to be spending as much on health \ncare. That is the bottom line.\n\n  We have to decrease the rate of growth from about 10 percent down to \nabout 7 percent, which is still twice the rate of increase in the \nprivate sector and twice the rate of inflation increase.\n  So as we go out to visit with our constituents this August, Mr. \nPresident, I suggest we visit with them about some of these options, \nask them what is on their minds, how they would see the solution to the \nproblem being developed. And when we come back in September, hopefully \nwe will have developed some kind of consensus so we can present the \nplans, debate them, have a good, thorough debate around the country, \nbut eventually this fall come up with legislation that can preserve, \nprotect, and strengthen Medicare for the seniors who are currently \nbeneficiaries and all of us in the future.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for conducting this \nimportant discussion this morning.\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Aug. 7, 1995]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                       GOP Stakes Missile Defense\n\n       Missile defense is back. In an important 51-48 vote last \n     week, largely upon party lines, the Senate approved \n     construction of a system to defend the nation against attack \n     by ballistic missile. The House approved a similar bill this \n     spring. Beyond taking a crucial step to ensure the country's \n     future security, the Republican Senate has thrown down a huge \n     political marker for the coming presidential campaign.\n       The part of the bill that has gotten the most attention is \n     the plan to build a network of land-based missile-defense \n     sites over the next eight years. Even more important is its \n     increased funding for an upgrade of the Navy's Aegis air-\n     defense system, which could provide a rough defensive \n     capability for the continental U.S. by the year 2000. It also \n     ups the spending for Brilliant Eyes, a space-based sensor \n     capable of detecting missile launches and tracking missiles \n     in flight. In the long run, space-based defenses--Star Wars--\n     are the most efficient and effective way to defend against \n     missile attack.\n       It's hard to overstate the significance of the Senate vote. \n     It is a long-delayed recognition of the need to prepare now \n     for a future threat. This is not a bad lesson to remember in \n     the month that we are commemorating the 50th anniversary of \n     the end of a terrible war that we were unprepared to fight. \n     It's a lesson, however, that the Administration rejects; it's \n     threatening to veto the Senate bill, so the campaign issue is \n     clearly drawn.\n\n                    Nations with ballistic missiles\n\n     Afghanistan\n     Argentina\n     Brazil\n     Britian\n     Belarus\n     China\n     Egypt\n     France\n     India\n     Iran\n     Iraq\n     Israel\n     Kazakhstan\n     Libya\n     North Korea\n     Pakistan\n     Russia\n     Saudi Arabia\n     South Africa\n     South Korea\n     Syria\n     Taiwan\n     Ukraine\n     U.S.\n     Vietnam\n     Yemen\n\n     Sources: Heritage Foundation; other sources.\n\n       As to the threat, consider the nations on the nearby list \n     that already possess ballistic missiles with conventional \n     weapons capabilities of some range (either developed \n     indigenously or bought from a superpower). It's hardly \n     difficult to imagine that once some madman gains this power \n     in one of the Bagdhdads or Pyongyangs of the world, he'll be \n     sorely tempted to threaten a San Francisco or New York with \n     it.\n       ``Already North Korea is developing missiles that could \n     attack the military installations in Alaska,'' warned Senator \n     Ted Stevens of Alaska in Thursday's debate. When that \n     capability eventually exists, it will of course be too late \n     for the U.S. to start cobbling together a national missile \n     defense.\n       A more immediate reminder of the need for a national \n     missile defense comes from China. Two weeks ago in a \n     ``routine test,'' it launched six missiles that splashed down \n     in the Taiwan Strait. China already has an ICBM capable of \n     reaching California. The Taiwan ``test'' didn't cause a big \n     news stir, but imagine what would be our response if someday \n     it ``tested'' one of those unarmed missiles by lobbing it \n     into San Francisco Bay, say, during the visit of a Taiwan \n     official to Ithaca, New York? There would be a popular \n     upheaval in this country.\n       Apart from the welcome attention it gives to the need for a \n     national missile defense, the second significance of the \n     Senate vote lies in the message it sends about arms control. \n     The Senate has said, in effect, that it no longer is going to \n     let the tail wag the dog. From now on, it's going to tailor \n     arms-control treaties to suit national security policy, not \n     the other way around.\n       That ultimately means the demise of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic \n     Missile Treaty, in which the U.S. made the reckless promise \n     not to defend itself against missile attack. The \n     Administration is screaming that the Senate bill would \n     violate that treaty, and put in jeopardy the two Start \n     treaties, under which the U.S. and Russia are dismantling \n     their nuclear arsenals. Just so. Those treaties have always \n     been invoked as the reason for according the ABM treaty \n     sacred status, thereby foreclosing any intelligent debate on \n     missile defenses themselves. While Republicans are talking \n     publicly about modifying the ABM Treaty, many have come to \n     the private conclusion that it has to go.\n       As a technical matter, that is easier said than done. There \n     is a withdrawal clause, but it's up to the executive branch \n     to exercise it. That's something that will almost certainly \n     have to wait until the next President because this one \n     subscribes to the ancient arms-control dogmas. We wonder how \n     that will play in the summer of 1996.\n       The pro-missile defense group, Committee to Defend America, \n     has been raising that issue in focus groups around the \n     country in recent months. Along the way it has discovered \n     that most citizens think we now can shoot down an incoming \n     ballistic missile. \n\n[[Page S 11721]]\n     When they find out we have the ability to develop such a capability but \n     choose not to exercise it, the overwhelming response is \n     outrage--and a demand that we build it immediately.\n       Ultimately, of course, the Republican candidates also have \n     to credibly convince voters they recognize the modern \n     realities. But if the party's candidates hold to the position \n     staked out by the Senate last week, this will be one issue on \n     which Bill Clinton will be sounding like a very old Democrat.\n\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as we continue our discussion this morning, \nthere have been four central things: First is that Medicare will be \nbankrupt in 7 years; second, under the GOP plan, Medicare spending will \ncontinue to rise; third, that seniors truly deserve the right to \nchoose, to have more than they have today, though they can preserve \ntheir traditional fee-for-service system; fourth, we must take time to \ndo it right, but we need to act and to act now.\n  To continue our discussion this morning on how best to save and \nstrengthen Medicare, I turn to the distinguished Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague for yielding, but \nalso let me thank him for taking out this special order to discuss with \nthe Senate and those who might be watching this morning the \ntremendously important issue of Medicare.\n  I think I, along with him and many others, are dismayed and amazed at \nthe recent attempts to attack the integrity of the Medicare trustees' \nreport on the status of the Medicare trust fund.\n  There has been a great deal of partisan rhetoric on the validity of \nthe report, as well as criticism of the budget resolution the Congress \nhas adopted this year in reflection of that report in an attempt to \nhandle it in an up-front way.\n  When you look at those who are members of the board of trustees, it \nbecomes clear that the report is certainly not a partisan effort to \nspin one idea or another about Medicare. The Medicare trustees are \nRobert Rubin, the Secretary of the Treasury; Robert Reich, the \nSecretary of Labor; Donna Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human \nServices; Shirley Chater, Commissioner for Social Security; Stanford \nRoss; and David Walker.\n  These six people serve on the Social Security and the Medicare boards \nof trustees. The last two members, Stanford Ross and David Walker, were \nappointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate to represent the \npublic. The boards are requested by law to report to the Congress each \nyear on the operation of the trust funds and to project the financial \nstatus of those funds.\n  The Medicare trustees, in their annual report on the Medicare trust \nfund released in April of this year, concluded that action is needed to \nbe taken if Medicare is going to operate after the year 2002. The \nfollowing is an excerpt that other Senators this morning may have \nmentioned, but I think it is clearly noteworthy and ought to be a part \nof the Record. Let me read from that trust fund report:\n\n       The Federal hospital insurance--\n\n  HI as it is known.\n\n     trust fund which pays inpatient hospital expenses will be \n     able to pay benefits for only about 7 years and is severely \n     out of financial balance in the long range. The trustees urge \n     the Congress to take action.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       The trustees urge the Congress to take action.\n\n  That is their job, Mr. President, to tell us what is wrong and to \nsuggest to us what we ought to do, and they urge us to take action \ndesigned to control the Federal hospital insurance trust fund to \naddress the projected financial imbalance in both the short range and \nthe long range through specific program legislation as part of a broad-\nbased health care reform. The trustees believe that prompt, effective \nand decisive action is just critically necessary.\n  So some people will say this is not an urgent issue because the \ntrustees have reported these concerns of solvency, or lack thereof, \nover the past and it still continues to exist today. We hear Members of \nthe other body shrugging their shoulders and saying, ``This isn't big \nnews. This isn't important news. We've heard these reports before.''\n  It is because the Congress in the past has heard those reports, Mr. \nPresident, and has micromanaged making the minor adjustments over the \nyears to control the costs that have allowed us to maintain the trust \nfunds.\n  However, those artificial cost controls, lower reimbursement rates, \nthe growing paperwork that has been a result of these reactions to \nreports and the solutions now no longer work, or at least that is what \nthe trust funds are saying, that we have to make the adjustments and we \nhave to do it now or the Medicare beneficiaries in rural States like \nmine are simply not going to be served as they have been served in the \npast.\n  At or below-cost reimbursement rates have made it difficult to \nrecruit new physicians in my State of Idaho and have forced many \ndoctors to limit the number of Medicare patients they will treat. In \nother words, our actions of the past, while trying to save the system, \nhave now squeezed it into a situation where doctors are dividing and \nsorting out and saying, ``We will, but we won't, and we'll limit our \npractices and we'll limit our ability to receive and care for Medicare \npatients.''\n  As I said many times both on the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives when I served there and now in the Senate, rural Idaho \nis not just 20 miles down the interstate. It is something that \nsometimes requires hundreds of miles of distance and time. Of course, \nif it is the middle of the winter, it may be that very difficult \npassage over a snowbound pass that results in the care or lack of care \ndelivered, and that is all a part of this Medicare equation that we \nhave to talk about.\n  I will say that even the President realizes this is a problem now \nthat he cannot walk away from and it is why he dealt with it in his own \nbudget. Although his rhetoric does not match up with the figures of his \nown budget, he, too, unlike a lot of other Members of his party, \nrecognizes the critical nature Medicare is in and has to be addressed.\n  President Clinton has launched a number of attacks on the Congress \nfor spending too little on Medicare. However, when you start comparing \nnumbers, there is little difference between the President's plan for \nMedicare over the next 7 years and the budget targets set in the \ncongressional budget resolution. They are just a little ways apart.\n  According to the Office of Management and Budget, President Clinton \nproposes to spend $1.697 trillion on Medicare over the next 7 years. \nThat figure is very close to the $1.62 trillion--and I said \n``trillion''--that was targeted for Medicare spending under the \ncongressional budget resolution.\n  In real money terms, Mr. President, the difference is less than a \nnickel on the dollar between the President and the Congress. On some of \nthe graphs I have seen, it is almost nondiscernible.\n  In addition, the spending targets in both the Congress' and \nPresident's budgets are not cuts in spending, as others would like to \nhave us believe. Rather, they are lower rates of growth. Under the \nRepublican plan, Medicare's annual spending will increase by $178 \nbillion this year to $274 billion in the year 2002. That is an annual \ngrowth rate of 6.4 percent, and yet, there is this wringing of hands to \nsuggest that we are severely slashing Medicare to its recipients.\n  Let me suggest that it is a 6.4-percent growth, and that is \nsubstantially larger than current rates of health care increases on a \ncost annualized per patient.\n  Right now we are spending over $4,816 a year per Medicare recipient \nand, by 2002, under the Republican plan to strengthen and maintain \nMedicare, we would be spending $6,732.\n  Regardless of which figure you use, both represent increases in \nspending about one and a half times higher than the rate of growth in \nprivate sector health care spending.\n  That level of growth can be achieved without breaking the trust. \nHowever, the trust cannot continue to grow more than twice as fast, \nbecause that path leads us to bankruptcy.\n  Mr. President, just 19 months ago, the President proposed major \nreductions in Medicare in order to pay for his Government-run health \ncare proposal. He said at that time that those reductions were not \ncuts:\n\n       Today, Medicaid and Medicare are going up at three times \n     the rate of inflation. We propose to let it go up at two \n     times the rate of \n\n[[Page S 11722]]\n     inflation. That is not a Medicare or a Medicaid cut. So when you hear \n     all this business about cuts, let me caution you that is not \n     what is going on.--President Bill Clinton, speech to the \n     AARP.\n\n  So, what is all this rhetoric about? It's about politics. Not policy. \nNot the future of Medicare, Mr. President. And, certainly not about \nmeeting the needs of America's seniors. The facts are pretty clear: No \none is cutting Medicare; the proposed spending levels are very similar; \nand, Clinton's proposal doesn't protect, preserve or improve Medicare.\n  Mr. President, another accusation I have heard about the spending \ntargets proposed over the next 7 years is that they are being made to \npay for a tax break for the wealthy. Reading the summary of the 1995 \nannual report will dispel that story.\n  Mr. President, this is not about tax cuts or spending cuts. This is \nabout bankruptcy. The President agreed, and said so on June 11 of this \nyear.\n\n       We cannot leave the system the way it is--when you think \n     about what the baby-boomers will require--that's going to \n     require significant long-term structural adjustment. We'll \n     just have to look at what we can do there. But the main thing \n     we can't do--we can't have this thing go broke in the \n     meanwhile.\n\n  In addition, three members of president Clinton's Cabinet and the \nCommissioner of Social Security were in agreement and said so on April \n3 of this year.\n  The Medicare trustees stated in their report issued on the third of \nApril that, ``under all sets of assumptions, the trust is projected to \nbecome exhausted even before the major demographic shift begins.''--\nPage 3 of the report.\n  Some people will avoid responsibility, and will say that there is no \nproblem. They are wrong. Next year, for the first time in the history \nof the Medicare Program, more money will go out of the trust fund than \nwill come in. The debt will continue to grow until the trust fund is \ncompletely depleted.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned that the trustee's annual report is no \nlonger in print.\n  In addition, Mr. President, I hope my fellow Idahoans will take the \ntime to review this summary.\n  I will be sending copies of today's Congressional Record to each of \nmy State offices and will have it available for review in the office. \nThe summary is not very long, but speaks volumes about this problem.\n  I hope my colleagues will do the same to make sure that this document \ngets out and the American people can read for themselves the financial \nproblems that the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust fund faces.\n  Mr. President, to cast stones and ignore this problem is not an \noption. Regardless of age, we all need to be concerned about the \nsolvency of Medicare. We must act now.\n  Mr. President, I had the pleasure of celebrating my 50th birthday in \nJuly of this year. As I embark on my second half century, a few harsh \nrealities are drawing near. I may not be knocking on the door of my \nretiring years, but they are coming fast.\n  Issues like health care are of interest and concern to me, like all \nAmericans. I want Medicare to continue to exist for those who are now \nbeneficiaries.\n  I also want it around for my wife and me. But, more importantly, I \nwant the program to be there for my children, and my children's \nchildren, and so on.\n  An individual from Idaho that I know fairly well contacted me \nrecently, to let me know that I would be in big trouble if anything \nwere done to Medicare. The conversation progressed and finally, this \nindividual told me they didn't care if Medicare went bankrupt in 7 \nyears because there was no way in the world they'd still be alive.\n  Well, Mr. President, we laughed a little at that. And, then, it was \nas if it were finally becoming clear. This individual realized that \nwhen he was gone, someone else would be in his situation, that the need \nwould still exist, and the situation, if not addressed would be far \nworse. After all, the baby-boomers are no longer thirty-somethings. I \nknow, because I am a baby-boomer.\n  In the end, my caller agreed that what we needed to focus on was \nlong-term solutions that would reform Medicare in a way that will shore \nup the solvency of the trust fund. Mr. President, it is a tall order, \nbut there is no alternative. It must be done.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the executive summary, the 1995 annual \nreport of the Social Security and Medicare board of trustees also be \nprinted in the Record immediately following my comments.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Status of the Social Security and Medicare Programs\n\n\n                  a summary of the 1995 annual reports\n\n                        A message to the public\n\n       The Boards of Trustees are pleased to present this Summary \n     of the 1995 Annual Reports of the Social Security and \n     Medicare trust funds. The reports include extensive \n     information about these important social programs and, we \n     believe, fully and fairly present their current and projected \n     financial condition.\n       In particular, we encourage current and future \n     beneficiaries to consider what the reports mean for them as \n     individual citizens. Based on the Trustees' best estimates, \n     the reports show:\n       The Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust \n     Fund, which pays retirement benefits, will be able to pay \n     benefits for about 36 years. The Board believes that the \n     long-range deficit of the OASI Trust Fund should be \n     addressed. The Advisory Council on Social Security is \n     currently studying the financing of the program and is \n     expected to recommended later this year ways to achieve long-\n     range actuarial balance in the OASI fund.\n       The Federal Disability Insurance (DI) Trust Fund, which \n     pays disability benefits, is projected to be exhausted in \n     2016. The Board believes that the long-range deficit of the \n     DI Trust Fund should be addressed. The Advisory Council on \n     Social Security currently also is studying the financing of \n     the DI program and is expected to recommend later this year \n     ways to achieve long-range actuarial balance in the DI fund.\n       The Federal Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund, which pays \n     inpatient hospital expenses, will be able to pay benefits for \n     only about 7 years and is severely out of financial balance \n     in the long range. The Trustees urge the Congress to take \n     additional actions designed to control HI program costs and \n     to address the projected financial imbalance in both the \n     short range and the long range through specific program \n     legislation as part of broad-based health care reform. The \n     Trustees believe that prompt, effective, and decisive action \n     is necessary.\n       The Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust \n     Fund, which pays doctor bills and other outpatient expenses, \n     is financed on a year-by-year basis and, on this limited \n     basis, is adequately financed. The Trustees urge the Congress \n     to take additional actions designed to more effectively \n     control SMI costs through specific program legislation as \n     part of broad-based health care reform. The Trustees believe \n     that prompt, effective, and decisive action is necessary.\n       Pubic discussion regarding the financing of the Social \n     Security and Medicare programs needs to take account of the \n     critical differences among the four individual trust funds \n     and, at the same time, the important relationships among \n     them. A key aspect of thinking about future financing of \n     these trust funds is recognition that under current law the \n     timing and magnitude of the financing problems facing the \n     programs are distinctly different. This summary presents the \n     current and projected financial status of these four programs \n     both separately and together in the hope that it will enhance \n     public understanding of them and encourage necessary program \n     reforms.\n       By the Trustees:\n     Robert E. Rubin,\n       Secretary of the Treasury, and Managing Trustee.\n     Robert B. Reich,\n       Secretary of Labor, and Trustee.\n     Donna E.

For Social Security, the Federal Old-Age \n     and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fund pays retirement and \n     survivors benefits; and the Federal Disability Insurance (DI) \n     Trust Fund pays benefits after a worker becomes disabled. \n     When both OASI and DI are considered together, they are \n     called the OASDI program.\n       For Medicare, the Federal Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust \n     Fund pays for hospital and related care (often called ``Part \n     A'') for people over 65 and workers who are disabled. The \n     Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust Fund pays \n     for physicians and outpatient services (often called ``Part \n     B'') for people over 65 and workers who are \n\n[[Page S 11723]]\n     disabled. These two trust funds are not usually considered together, \n     because they are funded differently.\n       Who Are the Boards of Trustees?--Six people serve on the \n     Social Security and Medicare Boards of Trustees: the \n     Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Commissioner of \n     Social Security and two members appointed by the President \n     and confirmed by the Senate to represent the public. The \n     Boards are required by law to report to the Congress each \n     year on the operation of the trust funds during the preceding \n     years and the projected financial status for future years.\n       What Were the Trust Fund Results in 1994?--Assets of all \n     trust funds except SMI increased during calendar year 1994. \n     At the end of the year, 42.9 million people were receiving \n     OASDI benefits and about 37 million people were covered under \n     Medicare. Trust fund operations, in billions of dollars, were \n     (totals may not add due to rounding):\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   OASI     DI    OASDI     HI      SMI \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAssets (end of 1993)............   369.3    9.0    378.3   127.8    24.1\nIncome during 1994..............   328.3   52.8    381.1   109.6    55.6\nOutgo during 1994...............   284.1   38.9    323.0   104.5    60.3\nNet Increase....................    44.1   14.0     58.1     5.0    -4.7\nAssets (end of 1994)............   413.5   22.9    436.4   132.8    19.4\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       What Were the Administrative Expenses in 1994?--The cost of \n     administrative expenses in fiscal year 1994, shown as a \n     percentage of benefit payments from each trust fund, was:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                         OASI    DI   OASDI    HI   SMI \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdministrative Expenses (FY 1994).....     0.7  2.8      0.9  1.2    3.0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       How Are the Trust Funds Financed?--Most OASDI and HI \n     revenue consists of taxes on earnings that are paid by \n     employees, their employers, and the self-employed. The tax \n     rates are set by law and, for OASDI, apply to earnings that \n     do not exceed a certain annual amount. This amount, called \n     the earnings base, rises as average wages increase. In 1995, \n     the earnings base for OASDI is $61,200. Beginning with 1994, \n     HI taxes are paid on total earnings. The tax rates for \n     employees and employers each under current law are:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n               Year                 OASI     DI    OASDI     HI    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1990-93..........................    5.60   0.60     6.20   1.45    7.65\n1994-96..........................    5.26   0.94     6.20   1.45    7.65\n1997-99..........................    5.35   0.85     6.20   1.45    7.65\n2000 and later...................    5.30   0.90     6.20   1.45    7.65\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       People who are self-employed are charged the equivalent of \n     the combined employer and employee shares, but only on 92.35 \n     percent of net earnings, and may deduct one-half of the \n     combined tax from income subject to Federal income tax.\n       All the trust funds receive income from interest earnings \n     on trust fund assets and from miscellaneous sources. The \n     OASI, DI and, beginning in 1994, HI Trust Funds also receive \n     revenue from the taxation of Social Security benefits.\n       The SMI or Part B program is financed similarly to yearly \n     renewable, term insurance. Participants pay premiums that in \n     1994 covered about 30 percent of the cost; the rest is paid \n     for by the Federal Government from general revenues. The 1995 \n     monthly premium is $46.10.\n       In all trust funds, assets that are not needed to pay \n     current benefits or administrative expenses (the only \n     purposes for which trust funds may be used) are invested in \n     special issue U.S. Government securities\n      guaranteed as to both principal and interest and backed by \n     the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.\n       How Are Estimates of Trust Fund Balances Made?--Short-range \n     (10-year) estimates are reported for all funds, and, for the \n     OASI, DI, and HI Trust Funds, long-range (75-year) estimates \n     are reported. Because the future cannot be predicted with \n     certainty, three alternative sets of economic and demographic \n     assumptions are used to show a range of possibilities. \n     Assumptions are made about economic growth, wage growth, \n     inflation, unemployment, fertility, immigration, and \n     mortality, as well as specific factors relating to \n     disability, hospital, and medical services costs.\n       The intermediate assumptions (alternative II) reflect the \n     Trustees' best estimate of what the future experience will \n     be. The low cost alternative is more optimistic; the high \n     cost alternative is more pessimistic; they show how the trust \n     funds would operate if economic and demographic conditions \n     are better or worse than the best estimate.\n       What Concepts Are Used to Describe the Trust Funds?--The \n     measures used to evaluate the financial status of the trust \n     funds are based on several concepts. Some of the important \n     concepts are:\n       Taxable payroll is that portion of total wages and self-\n     employment income that is covered and taxed under the OASDI \n     and HI programs.\n       The annual income rate is the income to the trust fund from \n     taxes, expressed as a percentage of taxable payroll.\n       The annual cost rate is the outgo from the trust fund, also \n     expressed as a percentage of taxable payroll.\n       The percentage of taxable payroll is used to measure income \n     rates and cost rates for the OASDI and HI programs. Measuring \n     the funds' income and outgo over long periods of time by \n     describing what portion of taxable earnings they represent is \n     more meaningful than using dollar amounts, because the value \n     of a dollar changes over time.\n       The annual balance is the difference between the income \n     rate and the cost rate. If the balance is negative, the trust \n     fund has a deficit for that year.\n       The actuarial balance is the difference between the annual \n     income rates and cost rates summarized over a period of up to \n     75 years, and adjusted to include the beginning fund balance \n     and the cost of ending the projection period with a trust \n     fund balance equal to the next year's outgo; if the balance \n     is negative, the fund has an actuarial deficit.\n       The trust fund ratio is the amount in the trust fund at the \n     beginning of a year divided by the outgo for the year. It \n     shows what percentage of the year's expenditures the trust \n     fund has on hand. For example, a trust fund ratio of 100 \n     percent would reflect an amount equal to 1 year of projected \n     expenditures.\n       The year of exhaustion is the first year a trust fund is \n     projected to run out of funds and to be unable to pay \n     benefits on time and in full.\n       How Is the Financial Status of the Trust Fund Tested? \n     Several tests, based on the intermediate assumptions, are \n     used to review the financial status of the trust funds.\n       The short-range test is met if, throughout the next 10 \n     years, the trust fund ratio is at least 100 percent. Of, if \n     the trust fund ratio is initially less, but reaches 100 \n     percent within the first 5 years and stays at or above 100 \n     percent, and there is enough income to pay benefits on time \n     every month during the 10 years, the short-range test is met.\n       The long-range test is met if a fund has an actuarial \n     deficit of no more than 5 percent of the cost rate over the \n     75 years, and if the actuarial deficit for any period ending \n     with 10th year or later is a graduated amount of 5 percent. \n     If the long-range test is met, the trust fund is in close \n     actuarial balance.\n       The test for SMI actuarial soundness is met for any time \n     period if the trust fund assets and projected income are \n     enough to cover the projected outgo and there are enough \n     assets to cover costs incurred but not yet paid. The adequacy \n     of the SMI Trust Fund is measured only for years for which \n     both the beneficiary premiums and the general revenue \n     contributions have been set.\n       What Is the Future Outlook for the Trust Funds?--The status \n     of the OASI, DI, and HI Trust Funds is shown together on \n     charts because they are financed the same way. SMI is \n     financed differently, so its status is described separately.\n\n                  The short-range outlook (1995-2004)\n\n       Chart A shows the projected trust fund ratio under the \n     intermediate (alternative II) assumptions for OASI, DI, and \n     HI separately. It also shows the ratio for the combined OASI \n     and DI trust funds. (Chart not reproducible in Record.)\n       The OASI trust fund ratio line is over the 100 percent \n     level at the beginning of the 10-year period and stays over \n     that level through the year 2004. Therefore, the OASI Trust \n     Fund meets the short-range test of financial adequacy.\n       The trust fund ratio line for DI starts at 54 percent, \n     reaches 100 percent in 1996, and remains above that level \n     throughout the remainder of the period. Thus, the DI fund \n     also meets the short-range test.\n       The trust fund ratio line for the combined OASI and DI \n     Trust Funds begins above the 100 percent level and stays over \n     that level throughout the 10-year period; therefore, the \n     OASDI program, as a whole, meets the short-range test of \n     financial adequacy.\n       Although the trust fund ratio line for HI is over the 100 \n     percent level at the beginning of the 10-year period, it \n     falls below that level in 1995. As a result, it does not meet \n     the short-range test. Under the intermediate assumptions, the \n     projected year of exhaustion for the HI Trust Fund is 2002; \n     under more adverse conditions, as in the high cost \n     alternative, it could be as soon as 2001.\n       The financing for the SMI Trust Fund has been set through \n     1995, and the projected operations of the trust fund meet the \n     test of SMI actuarial soundness.\n\n                   The long-range outlook (1995-2069)\n\n       Chart B shows the actuarial balance, as a percentage of the \n     cost rate, for OASI, DI, and HI separately under the \n     intermediate (alternative II) assumptions, as well as for the \n     combined OASI and DI Trust Funds. (Chart not reproducible in \n     Record.)\n       For a trust fund to meet the long-range test of close \n     actuarial balance, the actuarial balance line for that trust \n     fund must stay above the shaded area throughout the 75-year \n     period. The triangle above the shaded area but below the zero \n     percent level shows the range of allowable deficits a fund \n     can have and still be in close actuarial balance.\n       None of the three trust funds is in close actuarial balance \n     over the next 75 years. However, the chart shows that the \n     actuarial balance line for OASI, as well as for the OASDI \n     program as a whole, stays above the shaded area for many \n     years to come.\n       The actuarial balance line for DI alone starts above the \n     shaded area but declines below it in about 2009 and continues \n     to decline significantly for about an additional 25 years \n     before the rate of decline slows. The actuarial balance line \n     for HI starts well into the shaded area and declines \n     continuously over the long-range period.\n       The year of exhaustion for the OASI Trust Fund under \n     intermediate assumptions does not occur until 2031--36 years \n     from now. For the combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, the year \n     of exhaustion would be 2030--in 35 years. However, combined \n     OASDI expenditures will exceed current tax income beginning \n     in 2013. Thus, as Chart C illustrates, current tax income \n     plus a portion of annual interest income will be needed to \n     meet expenditures for \n\n[[Page S 11724]]\n     years 2013 through 2019, and current tax income, annual interest \n     income, plus a portion of the principal balance in the trust \n     funds will be needed for years 2020-2029. (Chart not \n     reproducible in Record.)\n       Another useful way to view the outlook of the trust funds \n     is to compare the income rate for each fund with its \n     estimated cost rate. Over the 75-year period the income rates \n     for OASI, DI and HI remain relatively constant, while the \n     cost rates generally rise steadily.\n       For OASI, the income rate is projected to remain \n     significantly above the cost rate for a number of years. \n     Starting in about 2010, however, the OASI cost rate will \n     begin increasing rapidly as the baby boom generation begins \n     to reach retirement age. In 2014 and later, the cost rate for \n     OASI will exceed the income rate.\n       The income rate for DI is slightly higher than the cost \n     rate only until 2004, after which the annual shortfall of tax \n     income is projected to increase slowly over the entire 75-\n     year period.\n       The cost rate for HI is higher than the income rate, by \n     rapidly growing amounts, throughout the 75-year projection \n     period--by the end of the period, the HI cost rate is \n     projected to be roughly 3 times greater than the HI income \n     rate. Chart D shows the virtually level income rates and \n     rising cost rates for OASI, DI and HI. (Chart not \n     reproducible in the Record.)\n       An additional way to view the outlook for the trust funds \n     as projected under current law is in relation to the economy \n     as a whole. The table below shows the estimated outgo from \n     each trust fund as a percentage of estimated gross domestic \n     product (GDP) from 1995 to 2069. OASI and DI increase at \n     about the same rate over this period, while the increases in \n     HI and particularly in SMI are much greater.\n\n   OASI, DI, HI, AND SMI OUTGO AS A PERCENT OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                 Percent\n            Trust fund               1995   2020   2045   2069  increase\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOASI..............................   4.18   5.05   5.72   5.98        43\nDI................................   0.60   0.87   0.87   0.86        44\nHI................................   1.62   2.83   4.05   4.46       175\nSMI...............................   0.99   3.18   4.01   4.29       333\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                              Conclusions\n\n       The status of the Social Security and Medicare programs can \n     be summarized by looking at the results of the tests used to \n     evaluate the financial status of the trust funds and at the \n     number of years before each trust fund is expected to be \n     exhausted under the intermediate assumptions:\n\n         FINANCIAL STATUS OF THE OASI, DI, HI, AND SMI PROGRAMS         \n                 Is the test of financial adequacy met:                 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   Short-range   Long-range  Years until\n            Trust fund               10 years     75 years    exhaustion\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOASI.............................

In view of the lack of actuarial \n     balance in the OASDI program over the next 75 years, the \n     Board believes that the long-range deficits in the OASI and \n     DI programs should be addressed. Accordingly, the Board \n     recommended last year that the 1995 Advisory Council on \n     Social Security conduct an extensive review of Social \n     Security financing issues and develop recommendations for \n     achieving long-range financial stability for the OASDI \n     program. The Council will submit its report later this year.\n       The HI Trust Fund will be able to pay benefits for only \n     about 7 years and is severely out of actuarial balance over \n     the next 75 years. Because of the magnitude of the projected \n     actuarial deficit in the HI program and the high probability \n     that the HI Trust Fund will be exhausted just after the turn \n     of the century, the Trustees urge the Congress to take \n     additional actions designed to control HI program costs and \n     to address the projected financial imbalance in both the \n     short range and the long range through specific program \n     legislation as part of broad-based health care reform.\n       The SMI program, though actuarially sound, has experienced \n     rapid growth in costs: program outlays have increased 53 \n     percent in the last 5 years and grew 19 percent faster than \n     the economy as a whole. Because this growth shows little sign \n     of abating, the Trustees urge the Congress to take additional \n     actions designed to more effectively control SMI costs \n     through specific program legislation as part of broad-based \n     health care reform.\n\n                   A message from the public trustees\n\n       This is the fifth set of Trust Fund Reports on which we \n     have reported as Public Trustees. It is also, under the terms \n     of our appointment, our last report, and we use this occasion \n     to summarize our views on some major aspects of the Social \n     Security and Medicare programs. As representatives of the \n     public, our efforts have been to assure the American public \n     of the integrity of the process and the credibility of the \n     information in these reports. We feel privileged and honored \n     to have been able to take part in this important exercise in \n     public accountability, and want to provide our best advice on \n     directions for change of these important programs in the \n     years ahead.\n\n                          The Need For Action\n\n       During the past 5 years there has been a trend of \n     deterioration in the long-range financial condition of the \n     Social Security and Medicare programs and an acceleration in \n     the projected dates of exhaustion in the related trust funds. \n     To some extent, this has been predictable because when doing \n     annual 75-year projections, an additional deficit year in the \n     2060s is being added with each new projection. But to some \n     extent, the increasingly adverse projections have come from \n     unforeseen events and from the absence of prompt action in \n     response to clear warnings that changes are necessary. These \n     adverse trends can be expected to continue and indicate the \n     possibility of a future retirement crisis as the U.S. \n     population begins to age rapidly. We urge that concerted \n     action be taken promptly to address the critical public \n     policy issues raised by the financing projections for these \n     programs.\n\n                    Projections As A Guide To Action\n\n       We believe it is important for the public and the Congress \n     to understand more about what the projections in the Trust \n     Fund Reports really mean and how they are intended to be \n     used. These projections represent the best estimates the \n     Trustees can make based on the best available information and \n     methodologies. We have, during our period of service, \n     attempted to test assumptions, question methodologies and \n     work with the Offices of the Actuary of SSA and HCFA and \n     others in and out of government to seek improvements in the \n     projections. We have also stimulated thought through a \n     symposium and publication of papers on how methods and \n     assumptions might be improved to better estimate the future \n     income and health care needs of the elderly and disabled. \n     Action should be taken to continue and extend survey and\n      other data development efforts and to improve modeling \n     capability regarding the income and health circumstances \n     of future retirees. Such information is critical to the \n     legislative and regulatory activity that will be required \n     for both public and private income security and health \n     care programs in future years.\n       However, with even the best data and models, projections \n     ultimately are only estimates and must necessarily reflect \n     the uncertainties of the future. They are useful if \n     understood as a guide to a plausible range of future results \n     and if acted on in a timely and responsible manner. They are \n     not helpful if ignored, or if used improperly, or if \n     distorted. We hope that more policymakers will come to grips \n     with the strengths and limitations of projections such as \n     those in the Trust Fund Reports and how those projections can \n     be used most productively.\n\n                        Social Security Program\n\n       The Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund shows a \n     deficit of 1.87 percent of payroll in the long run. It is by \n     far the best financed of the trust funds, and we believe \n     strongly that the OASI program can and should be maintained \n     over the long term. Yet even here reforms should be \n     undertaken sooner rather than later to ease the transition to \n     providing financial stability in the next century. We note \n     the recent work of the Bipartisan Entitlement Commission and \n     the current work of the Advisory Council on Social Security \n     regarding the long-term financing of the OASI program. We \n     hope that this kind of work will continue and that this \n     problem will be addressed in a timely fashion.\n       The condition of the Disability Insurance Trust Fund is \n     more troublesome. While the Congress acted this past year to \n     restore its short-term financial balance, this necessary \n     action should be viewed as only providing time and \n     opportunity to design and implement substantive reforms that \n     can lead to long-term financial stability. The research \n     undertaken at the request of the Board of Trustees, and \n     particularly of the Public Trustees, shows that there are \n     serious design and administrative problems with the DI \n     program. Changes in our society, the workforce and our \n     economy suggest that adjustments in the program are needed to \n     control long-range program costs. Also, incentives should be \n     changed and the disability decision process improved in the \n     interests of beneficiaries and taxpayers. We hope that this \n     research will be completed promptly, fully presented to \n     Congress and the public, and that the Congress will take \n     action over the next few years to make this program \n     financially stable over the long term.\n                            Medicare Program\n\n       The most critical issues, however, relate to the Medicare \n     program. Both the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the \n     Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund show alarming \n     financial results. While the financial status of the HI \n     program improved somewhat in 1994, the HI Trust Fund \n     continues to be severely out of financial balance and is \n     projected to be exhausted in about 7 years. The SMI Trust \n     Fund, while in balance on an annual basis, shows a rate of \n     growth of costs which is clearly unsustainable. Moreover, \n     this fund is projected to be 75 percent or more financed by \n     general revenues, so that given the general budget deficit \n     problem, it is a major contributor to the larger fiscal \n     problems of the nation.\n\n[[Page S 11725]]\n\n       The Medicare program is clearly unsustainable in its \n     present form. We had hoped for several years that \n     comprehensive health care reform would include meaningful \n     Medicare reforms. However, with the results of the last \n     Congress, it is now clear that Medicare reform needs to be \n     addressed urgently as a distinct legislative initiative. We \n     also believe strongly that Medicare reform should be included \n     as an integral part of any broader health care reform \n     initiative which may be considered in the future.\n       There are basic questions with the scale, structure and \n     administration of the Medicare program that need to be \n     addressed. For example, is it appropriate to have a Part A \n     and Part B today, or should this legacy of the political \n     process that enacted Medicare in the mid-1960s be revised to \n     create a unified program? Is it appropriate to combine \n     participants' social insurance tax contributions for Part A \n     and premium payments for approximately one-quarter of Part B \n     with general revenues? If so, what should be the proper \n     combination of beneficiary premiums, taxpayer social \n     insurance contributions, and general revenues? How are each \n     of these kinds of revenue sources to be justified and what \n     rights to benefits and responsibilities to pay benefits are \n     thereby established? How can the program become more cost-\n     effective? How can fraud, abuse and waste be better \n     controlled?\n       We feel strongly that comprehensive Medicare reforms should \n     be undertaken to make this program financially sound now and \n     over the long term. The idea that reductions in Medicare \n     expenditures should be available for other purposes, \n     including even other health care purposes, is mistaken. The \n     focus should be on making Medicare itself sustainable, making \n     it compatible with OASDI, and making both Social Security and \n     Medicare financially sound in the long term.\n       We strongly recommend that the crisis presented by the \n     financial condition of the Medicare Trust Funds be urgently \n     addressed on a comprehensive basis, including a review of the \n     program's financing methods, benefit provisions, and delivery \n     mechanisms. Various groups should be consulted and reform \n     plans developed that will not be disruptive to beneficiaries, \n     will be fair to current taxpayers who will in the future \n     become beneficiaries, and will be compatible with government \n     finances overall.\n\n                      Institutional Considerations\n\n       We have as Public Trustees tried over the past 5 years to \n     provide continuity and improve the institutional framework \n     surrounding the Social Security and Medicare programs. We \n     have bridged two Administrations (one Republican and one \n     Democratic), two Advisory Councils (one appointed by a \n     Republican Administration and one by a Democratic \n     Administration), and many changes in the ex officio Trustees. \n     We have consulted with each of the Advisory Councils, as well \n     as the working group of the prior Public Trustees, the \n     Bipartisan Entitlement Commission, the Notch Commission and \n     many other government entities. We have testified before both \n     the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance \n     Committee and held regular briefings for Congressional staff \n     on the Trust Fund Reports. We know that with the advent of \n     the new Social Security Administration as an independent \n     agency, many of the institutional relationships in these \n     areas will change. We hope that the Public Trustees in the \n     future will continue to make a contribution towards a \n     coherent institutional structure that serves the interests of \n     the public.\n       Finally, we note that although the statute provides that \n     one of the Public Trustees must be from each of the major \n     political parties, we have operated as independent \n     professionals on a nonpartisan basis. Every statement we have \n     made over 5 years has been joint and consensual, and without \n     partisan content or political dissonance. We believe these \n     programs are too important to be politicized and urge that a \n     highly professional, nonpartisan approach continue to be \n     followed in future reports to the Congress and the public.\n     Stanford G. Ross,\n     David M. Walker,\n       Trustees.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield whatever time there may be to the organizer of the \nspecial order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in closing out our special order this \nmorning, our message has been very simple: to strengthen and to \nsimplify.\n  In our remaining 2 minutes, we will have a closing statement by the \nSenator from Maine. I yield to him for that purpose.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, last April the trustees of the Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds issued a stark warning that the trust \nfund that pays Medicare benefits will be bankrupt by 2002, and that \n``the Medicare Program is clearly unsustainable in the present form.''\n  In his speech a few weeks later to the delegates at the White House \nConference on Aging, President Clinton echoed the trustees' warning \nabout the pending Medicare crisis, saying that he ``cannot support the \nstatus quo, and neither can you.''\n  The Medicare trustee's report sounds an alarm that we simply cannot \nafford to ignore. Medicare is on a collision course toward bankruptcy. \nThe longer we wait to change this course or apply the brakes, the more \ncertain we are to crash.\n  Mr. President, last week, the House minority leader, Mr. Gephardt, \ncirculated a letter characterizing the pending Medicare crisis as \n``more fiction than fact.'' Apparently, those who are dedicated to \nwaging class warfare are prepared to resort to the tactic of treating \nfact as fiction. It is not a novel tactic, but ironically, one that is \ndrawn from a novelist's nightmare vision of the future: Repeat a \nfalsehood often enough and the people eventually will accept it as \ntruth.\n  The truth is that the 1995 trustees' report paints a bleak picture \nfor the future of Medicare. Next year, the trust fund will start paying \nout more in benefits than it gets in revenues from the payroll tax.\n  To quote Franklin Delano Roosevelt:\n\n       Any government, like any family, can for a year spend a \n     little more than it earns. But you and I know that a \n     continuance of that habit means the poorhouse.\n\n  Right now, Medicare is on a sure path to the poorhouse. By 2002--less \nthan 7 years from now--the Medicare trust fund will be totally \nbankrupt. By law, it will be unable to pay benefits, leaving 36 million \nof our most vulnerable Americans--the aged and disabled--without \ncoverage to pay their hospital bills.\n  Politically, it would be easy to ignore the pending crisis and \ncontinue with business as usual. However, as Samuel Johnson once wrote:\n\n       When a man knows he is to be hung in a fortnight, it \n     concentrates his mind wonderfully.\n\n  Reforming Medicare is not about providing tax cuts, nor is it about \nbalancing the budget. Even if the Federal budget were in balance, the \nMedicare trust fund would still be in jeopardy and the same reforms \nwould be necessary to preserve and improve the program.\n  Let there be no mistake--Medicare needs reforming for Medicare's \nsake. Let us also be clear that no one is talking about cutting \nMedicare spending. Under the budget resolution passed last June, \nMedicare spending will continue to grow at an average rate of 6.4 \npercent over the next 7 years and will increase to $273.3 billion in \n2002. That's $92.2 billion more than the $181.1 billion that will be \nspent in 1995.\n  So far most of the focus has been on resolving Medicare's short-term \nbankruptcy crisis. However, we cannot ignore the fact that Medicare's \nreal problems begin in about 2010, when the baby boomers begin to \nretire, dramatically increasing the numbers of people eligible for \nMedicare and reducing the size of the work force.\n  The demographics of the next century are daunting. Today there are 33 \nmillion Americans 65 and over. But the aging of the baby boom \ngeneration will swell the number to 70 million by 2030, imposing new \nburdens and challenges for the Medicare and Social Security systems.\n  Today, it takes four workers to support a Medicare beneficiary. By \nthe middle of the next century, there will only be two workers \navailable to support each beneficiary, greatly increasing the amount \neach will have to pay in taxes to support the program. Medicare must \ntherefore undergo\n significant structural changes if it is to survive to meet the health \ncare needs of future retirees.\n\n  The ability to change is key to survival, and the fact is that the \nMedicare Program has changed very little in the 30 years since its \ncreation.\n  While private health care systems have evolved over the years, \nMedicare has remained stagnant. We must find ways to make the program \nsensitive to the needs of older persons while at the same time making \nit more cost-effective.\n  Sixty-three percent of working Americans get their health care \nthrough some kind of managed care program. By contrast, only 90 percent \nof Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in the kinds of managed care \nplans that have become a way of life for their children and \ngrandchildren.\n  Most care continues to be provided on a fee-for-service basis, which \noffers \n\n[[Page S 11726]]\nno incentives for efficiency and, in fact, encourages higher costs and \noverutilization of services. As a consequence, Medicare costs are \nrising in excess of 10 percent a year, while private health spending is \ngrowing at less than half that rate.\n  There continues to be gaps in Medicare coverage. Medicare generally \ndoes not pay for preventive care and beneficiaries do not have access \nto benefits like prescription drugs that are routinely provided through \nprivate health plans. Many Medicare beneficiaries would gladly elect to \ntrade their current fee-for-service coverage for a more coordinated \nsystem of care that gives them expanded coverage for prescription drugs \nand other benefits they currently do not enjoy.\n  Americans in the private health care system generally have some \nchoice about the kind of health plan they are enrolled in. Most \nMedicare beneficiaries do not. Congress should consider giving Medicare \nbeneficiaries a full range of choice of health care plans, with \nincentives for beneficiaries to choose cost-efficient coverage.\n  We should also consider allowing people to stay in their employer's \nhealth plan when they turn 65, even after they have retired. Medicare \ncould reimburse employers for the cost of the premiums and perhaps \nprovide a tax break as an additional incentive for them to continue \ncoverage. This would not only allow Medicare beneficiaries to remain in \na health plan they are comfortable with, but it would also keep them in \na pool with younger, healthier people to lower the cost of their \ncoverage.\n  And, finally, we must rid Medicare of the fraud and abuse that robs \nthe program of as much as $18 billion a year. Medicare has become a \nprime target for opportunists who bilk the system by overbilling, \nunbundling services, and doublebilling. I have introduced legislation \nfor the past 2 years to crack down on fraud and abuse, and it is time \nto pass these reforms.\n  There are no easy answers--either substantively or politically--to \nMedicare's financial problems in either the short or long term. If we \nare to summon the political will to overcome the current crisis and \nrevitalize Medicare to meet the needs of the future generations, we \nmust abandon the politics of fear and take up the politics of trust.\n  This should not be a partisan issue. Those who hold a fiduciary duty \nto oversee the Medicare system say that immediate action is necessary, \nand the President apparently agrees. Given the sheer magnitude of the \nfinancing shortfall, bipartisan cooperation is essential if we are to \nestablish the kind of lasting reforms that will be necessary to keep \nthe promise of Medicare for not just current but future generations.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week during debate on the defense \nauthorization bill, I came to the floor to point out that someone on \nthe Armed Services Committee had written into the bill a special little \ndeal that no one had asked for. It was $60 million to buy blimps. Yes, \nblimps. Airbags. Airships. I asked the question, Who wrote this in? Who \nwants to buy blimps? Who decides that the Hindenburg is important for \nAmerica's defense?\n  I did not find out who did it, but there were no hearings, no \ndisclosure--they just wrote in $60 million to buy blimps. Now I \ndiscover that hot airbags are not limited necessarily to the Defense \nDepartment authorization bill.\n  I have listened this morning to a substantial amount of discussion \nabout Medicare. I will tell you, some of it really surprises me.\n  Let me talk first about the issue of Medicare going broke. We were \ntreated this morning to a half dozen folks who say: ``Did you know that \nMedicare is going to go bankrupt in 7 years? We Republicans called the \nMedicare trustees up to the Capitol for a special meeting because we \nwere so concerned about their report.'' And the President is not \nconcerned, they say. He does not care. ``But we are concerned, so we \ncalled the trustees up here to the Capitol and had a visit, because we \nRepublicans care.'' I will bet you that I am safe in saying this is the \nonly meeting of trustees the other side has ever had in this Capitol.\n  Well, here is a list of the trustees' reports for the last 15 years. \nEvery single year since 1979, save two--in fact, 23 out of 25 years--\nthe boards of trustees have sent a report to this Capitol and this \nSenate telling us when the Medicare system is going to run out of \nmoney.\n  In 1982, while Ronald Reagan was President, the trustees sent a \nreport up to the Capitol that said in 1987 Medicare is going to be \ninsolvent. In 1986, they sent up a report that said in 1996 it is going \nto be broke. The list goes on. That is in 23 out of 25 years.\n  Why have the Republicans invented this as a crisis when 23 out of 25 \nreports have described the time when Medicare is going to become \ninsolvent? Every time this happens, Congress makes adjustments to make \nsure that Medicare will not go broke.\n  Why have the Republicans decided to invent this as a crisis? It is \nbecause the Republicans, under the guise of a budget they say will be \nbalanced, also wanted to put up the center tent pole in this giant tent \ncalled the Contract With America. What is that center pole? It is a tax \ncut for their wealthy friends--a $245 billion tax cut, 80 percent of \nwhich will go to those taxpayers with incomes over $100,000 a year.\n  Now, how do you pay for a tax cut? How do you pay for a tax cut if \nyou are up to your neck in debt and have all kinds of budget problems? \nYou take a look at another big part of the Federal budget and say, let \nus cut that in order to make room for our tax cut. Ergo, they have \nproposed $270 billion in cuts to Medicare in order to accommodate a \nsimilar sized proposal to cut taxes, the bulk of which goes to the \nwealthiest Americans.\n  Those are the facts. There is no one in this body who does not want \nto make sure that Medicare exists for the long term. So to those who \ncame out here this morning with a hot iron and ironing board trying to \niron out the President on this issue because, somehow, the Democrats do \nnot believe in Medicare, I say, just look at the record. The first time \nMedicare was on the floor of the Senate was in August 1960, and 97 \npercent of the Republicans voted against it. Democrats helped create \nMedicare, and I am proud of it. When we enacted Medicare, less than \nhalf of America's elderly had health insurance coverage. Now 97 percent \ndo. I am proud of that.\n  Are there some problems with Medicare? Yes, there are. America is \ngraying and getting older. Each month, over 200,000 more Americans \nbecome eligible for Medicare because they reach retirement age. That \nputs a strain on the system. So we have to continue to make adjustments \nto make Medicare solvent.\n  For people to come to this floor and suggest that somehow the \nDemocrats are the problem and the Republicans are going to save \nMedicare, I am sorry, but this is just at odds with the facts. The fact \nis that Democrats helped create Medicare.\n  There is an old saying that ``the lion and the lamb might lay down \ntogether, but the lamb ain't going to get much sleep.'' I would \nobserve, after what I heard this morning, that the Republicans and \nMedicare might lay down together as well, but I do not think Medicare \nis going to get much sleep either. The fact is, we must make Medicare \nsolvent for the long-term, and we will. But we must not ever decide to \ngo to the health care portion of the Federal budget and try to find \nmassive Medicare savings that will result in higher Medicare costs for \nolder Americans and reduced access to health care for senior citizens, \nin order to accommodate a big tax cut mostly for the wealthy.\n  Now, I know that those who are out here spinning this morning like a \nball of yarn were accusing the other side of \n\n[[Page S 11727]]\nspinning on Medicare. Well, you do not have to spin at all to simply \nopen the budget proposals and find out who gets what. The budget \nproposals are simple. The budget plan provides for a very significant \ntax cut, going largely to the most affluent Americans, and it provides \nfor by far the largest cut in Medicare expenditures in the history of \nthis program.\n  We have had speakers say the cuts in Medicare are simply a cut in the \nrate of growth. If you have more and more seniors becoming eligible for \nMedicare, then the size of the program increases. If health care--not \nonly for Medicare recipients but for all Americans--increases in price \nevery year, and it does, then that increases the cost of the program.\n  Now, if you have those two facts--more elderly being covered by \nMedicare and higher health care prices--and you say we are not going to \npay, we are going to cut way back, what that means is that those senior \ncitizens who rely on Medicare will pay higher prices and get less care. \nI do not think there is any question about that.\n  They talk about experts. Most of the experts look at the numbers and \nsay, ``Yes, it is true we will spend more on Medicare, but we will \nstill not meet the needs of older Americans because there is a graying \nof America'' and because health care costs are going to continue to \nincrease.\n  The fact is that what the Federal Government will spend is not going \nto meet the needs and the result will be that the elderly will receive \nless health care and pay more for it. That is just a fact.\n  Now, my own view of Medicare is, I suppose, fashioned at least in \npart by where I grew up. I grew up in a town of 300 people. There are a \nlot of elderly folks in my hometown. I saw a lot of folks when I was a \nteenager who reached the end of their lives and did not have anything--\nno money, no assets--who worried, who lived in desperate fear that they \nwould get ill and would not have the ability to afford health care.\n  I saw that, as did most other people. It is nice to know that today, \nat least, most of those people do not live in that kind of fear because \nMedicare helps them. Medicare helps provide for them.\n  I had a woman in my home county, whom I told the Senate about some \nwhile ago, who showed up at a town meeting, stood up and said, ``I have \nnew knees, a new hip, and I had cataract surgery. I am 75 years old and \nfeel like a million bucks.'' What a remarkable thing. Fifty years ago \nshe would not have had new knees and a new hip, and she would have been \nin a wheelchair. If she came to the meeting, she would not have been \nable to see me.\n  With the breathtaking achievements in medical care, plus the program \ncalled Medicare, this woman has a good life. At age 75, she tells us \nshe feels like a million dollars.\n  I am enormously proud of what we have done. I think what is important \nas we talk about reform these days is that we not start to take apart \nthe things that make this country good. I am perfectly willing to sit \ndown with anybody in this Chamber and say, ``All right, we will decide \nto work on this particular issue. We will make sure that Medicare is \nsolvent for the long term.''\n  We have done that before. We will always do that. We will always make \nadjustments to make Medicare financially sound. Mr. President, 23 of 25 \ntrustees' reports in the last 25 years have described a date by which \ninsolvency would occur, and we made adjustments and stretched that out.\n  I am willing to do that. But I am unwilling, under any conditions, to \njoin hands with those who say, ``Let's make room for a big tax cut.'' \nYes, we are up to our neck in debt. We want to build Star Wars. Yes, we \nwant to go out and buy blimps, but then make room for a big tax cut. \nHow do we pay for that?\n  There is an easy way: Take it out of Medicare and Medicaid over here \nand invent something that you want to foist upon the American people as \nnew--a trustees' report that says Medicare will be insolvent.\n  If this truly was new, then I suppose I could understand their angst. \nBut the fact is, they have had 25 trustees' reports in 25 years and 23 \nof those have said Medicare is going to have an insolvent period. Yet \nthey have never had a meeting of the trustees until this year, when \nthey began to spin their ball of yarn about saving Medicare.\n  If the folks who want to give a tax cut to the rich believe older \nAmericans will swallow the minnow that they are the ones who will save \nMedicare, after they have proposed big Medicare cuts in order to \naccommodate their tax cut for the wealthy, well, then, excuse me, but I \nguess I am somehow naive about the art of spending.\n  Perhaps they are much better, much more clever, much more artful than \nI ever believed possible at spinning a tale of complete, total, \nfiction.\n  It is time just to strip all of this aside and just strip the budget \nand all the other questions aside and ask ourselves in the sober light \nof day, as Americans--not as Democrats or Republicans, but as \nAmericans--what works in this country and what does not work.\n  What should we save and what should we get rid of? What should we \nfight for and what should we decide to scrap? If we do that, we will \nall conclude, it seems to me, not that we will try to follow the string \nof some constituency out there, but that we will aggressively put our \nnose to the grindstone here and work to reduce the Federal budget \ndeficit.\n  We will aggressively decide to ask the American people, yes, to pay \nthe current taxes in order to reduce the Federal budget deficit. Pay \nthe taxes that now exist in the current tax law, and we will \naggressively will protect those things that make this country a better \ncountry, and make life in this country better for all Americans, \nespecially those Americans who have gone before us in the work force, \nwho have built this country, who survived the Depression, who fought \nthe wars, who beat back the oppression of Hitler's nazism.\n  To those folks in this country who helped build and make this a great \ncountry, we are now saying to them, well, we are sorry, you will have \nto pay a little more for your health care. We will threaten Medicare \nbecause we want to give wealthy people a tax break. There is nothing \nwrong with being wealthy, but I am saying those priorities are out of \nwhack.\n  I finish with one more point. I think the opportunity to do well, be \nsuccessful, and make money is a terrific thing in this country. I wish \neverybody could achieve those things. But in my hometown, one person \ndecides that he will commit his life to making as much money as he can \nand does so and is enormously successful as a business person. And \nthere is another couple living on the other end of the street. He \ndecides he will be a minister in a small rural church. Of course he \ndoes not get paid very much. So his wife teaches piano lessons to make \nends meet, and they reach age 65 or 70. They have worked very hard \ntheir entire lives, but they do not have anything. No assets, no \npension, no retirement system, no income.\n  I just ask the question, did they contribute less to their community? \nDid they contribute less, ministering in a rural church, giving piano \nlessons, helping children? Did they contribute less than the people who \ndecided to, in every way every day, make as much money as they could?\n  No, both contributed to this country. That is why the things that \nmake life better to people who contribute in that way, such as the \nMedicare Program, are important.\n  That is why we fight for them and why I am proud to say it is my \nparty that created this program. I think it will be our party, by \nreaching out and joining hands with others, who will make sure this \nprogram is around for the long-term in this country's future. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Chair inform the Senator when he has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig).

Mr. President, Guy Pence is a Federal employee and a public \nservant in the true sense of the word. He is a forest ranger.\n  Mr. President, I became acquainted with Guy Pence about 3 or 4 years \nago at this same time of the year when he took me on a pack trip into a \nplace in Nevada called Table Mountain. It is a Forest Service \nwilderness area. There \n\n[[Page S 11728]]\nmay be places as nice, as beautiful, but no place is any more beautiful \nthan Table Mountain.\n  It is an area with alpine meadows, beaver dams, eagles floating \nthrough the sky, deer, elk, all kinds of wildlife.\n  Mr. President, I came to Table Mountain as one person and left as \nanother. I became more acquainted with a part of Nevada that I had only \nseen from the air. I became more acquainted with the problems of a \nForest Service ranger, as to what should be done with grazing, what \nshould be done with the infusion of elk into that area, what should be \ndone in regard to mining operations, and the overuse and underuse of \npublic lands. I learned a lot about that part of Nevada.\n  But I learned as much about Guy Pence and those other rangers who \nwere with us on the street. Guy Pence is truly a fine man in any sense \nof the word,\n he is the father of three young girls and a volunteer who has a \nprogram where he acquaints the people in the Carson City, NV, area with \nwildlife and the wild generally.\n\n  The reason I mention Guy Pence's name this morning is because last \nFriday night, in the dark of the night, as Guy Pence was hundreds of \nmiles away in the wilds of Nevada, leading another trip as he led me, a \ncoward, or a number of cowards, in the middle of the night, came to his \nhome and placed a bomb near his home. That bomb--I spoke to Guy Pence--\nwas 10 to 12 feet away from his wife and three children. The bomb blew \nup, totaled his car, blew out the windows of his house. But for the \nfact that his wife and children were making pickles they would have all \nbeen either dead or injured severely, because less than a minute prior \nto the explosion, around 10 o'clock at night, the buzzer went off in \nthe kitchen, the mother said the pickles were ready and the children \nand mother went into the kitchen. Within seconds the explosion took \nplace.\n  In the dark of the night an unknown person or persons planted a bomb \nbeneath his van as it sat about 10 feet away from his house, away from \nhis wife and his children. I do not know who committed this crime or \nwhy it was committed. The facts are still being investigated.\n  But whether it was related to the controversial job that Guy Pence, \nforest ranger, has to do, or whether it was unrelated, the timing of \nthis act could not have been more prominent. This bombing--by whomever \nperpetrated it--comes at a time when our Federal land managers are \nunder assault. Not in name only, but actually under assault. This \nbombing comes at a time when extremists are destroying the very fabric \nof our democracy. We have only to look at Oklahoma City to appreciate \nthe threat of this extremism.\n  The rule of law must apply to everyone. The alternative is anarchy. A \nred light at a corner is, at best, a useless decoration unless it is \nobeyed. There are those who think they are above or beyond the law, \nthat they represent a cause so just that it justifies any harm to \nothers. Those who stray from law to violence are people too unsure of \ntheir cause to believe they can sway the Nation, the State, or a \ncounty, by any means other than force. There is no difference, moral or \nphilosophical, between the Weathermen of the 1960's, the Symbionese \nLiberation Army of the 1970's, the Pan American bombing terrorists of \nthe 1980's, or the Oklahoma City bombers of the 1990's.\n  There is no distinction, logical or analytical, between Lee Harvey \nOswald, who killed President Kennedy, John Wilkes Booth, who killed \nPresident Lincoln, Sirhan Sirhan, who killed Senator Kennedy, Arthur \nBremmer who tried to assassinate George Wallace, and whoever planted \nthe bomb in Carson City. All were anarchists. Each was a coward wishing \nto substitute the power of tooth and claw for the rule of law. They \nwish to abolish the ability of the Nation to govern its citizens and \ninstead permit the citizenry to settle its own scores on the spot, \nwithout regard to right or justice or principle. A coward is someone \nwho has not the decency to stand up for what he believes: The stab in \nthe back, the bullet in the night, the bomb on a doorstep of a woman \nand children's home--that is the way of a coward. When you combine \nanarchy and cowardice, you get what happened in Carson City.\n  I grew up in a small town in southern Nevada, rural by any \ndefinition--no telephones, very few homes that had inside plumbing, no \ntelevision. We were rural to the core. But the place where I was \nraised, people were friendly to one another. We depended on one \nanother. Neighbors had a sense of community. That was part of our \ntradition.\n  But the West that I loved my entire life has been sullied. There is \nnow a pattern of lawlessness that has raised its ugly head in the \nWestern United States. For the sake of debate, let us set aside the \ncase of Guy Pence, even though it is hard for me to do. We do not know \nwhether it will ever be solved or even whether it is connected with the \nrising tide of anti-Government rhetoric which is placing families like \nthose of Ranger Pence in terrible circumstances.\n  Let us address, instead, other instances that illustrate what I have \ncalled the ugly underbelly of a movement called County Supremacy.\n  I will be the first to acknowledge that there are a wide variety of \nviews about how we should manage the lands owned by the people of this \ncountry, lands available for a multitude of uses: cross-country skiing, \nskiing, grazing cattle, mining, off-road vehicle adventure, hunting and \nfishing, camping and hiking.\n  The pressures in the rapidly growing West are enormous. I understand \nand appreciate the views of those who suggest that perhaps these lands \nshould be turned over to the Western States. In Nevada, 87 percent of \nthe land is owned by the Federal Government. Some in our State feel \nthat we need more. Some less. But I would also point out that the \nFederal Government has been flexible in meeting Nevada's needs.\n  Recently, I participated in a ceremony where we turned over to \nBoulder City, NV, more than 100,000 acres. Public land is now part of \nBoulder City. I introduced a bill that eventually gave Mesquite, NV, \n4,400 new acres to develop their airport and a golf course. I was city \nattorney in Henderson, NV, now the third largest city in Nevada, when \nit got over 100,000 acres of Federal land.\n  So it is not as if there is not land being turned over to the private \nsector. But I do not agree with the wholesale turnover of some of the \nmost scenic lands in our country, owned by all Americans. Land in \nNevada that is public in nature is owned by people in Idaho, owned by \npeople in Minnesota, owned by people in Nevada. I do not agree that \nthese scenic lands should be turned over wholesale to what inevitably \nwould turn out to be a sweetheart deal for developers, where only the \nmost wealthy could own and lock up streams, valleys, mountains, \nmeadows--the outdoors that we all cherish so much. I do not agree with \nthe ultimate end advocated by the County Supremacist Movement and I am \nnot afraid to say so.\n  I am not here to suggest that all those with strongly held views in \nthe anti-Federal movement advocate violence. They do not. Over the \nweekend in Nevada a person who is a member of one of these groups--I \nbelieve there were probably others, but I read where there was one \nperson, and I appreciate that--spoke out that she did not believe in \nviolence after the bombing of Guy Pence's home and van.\n  Any movement must be concerned about the fringe elements within it--\nin this case, fringe elements who live a paranoid life of conspiracy, \nwho threaten revolution, who threaten violence as a means to achieve \ntheir agenda.\n  Eric Hoffer said,\n\n       When cowardice is made respectable its followers are \n     without number, both from among the weak and the strong. It \n     easily becomes a fashion.\n\n  And it has.\n  Madam Chiang Kai-shek, who recently was here in the United States, \nsaid,\n\n       Every clique is a refuge for incompetence. It fosters \n     disruption, disloyalty, it begets corruption and cowardice, \n     and consequently it is a burden upon and a drawback to the \n     progress of the country. Its instincts and actions are those \n     of the pack.\n\n  And they are.\n  In the Western United States, Federal land managers have been \nthreatened and attacked. In California, a Forest Service employee was \nshot at. In Oregon, a Bureau of Land Management employee was assaulted. \nIn Nevada, the day the bomb severely damaged the office of the Forest \nService, the Forest Service supervisor received a call saying he was \nnext. \n\n[[Page S 11729]]\n\n  Two years ago, a Bureau of Land Management building in Reno, NV, was \nblown apart, the roof blown off, among other things. Gate and fee \ncollection boxes have been booby-trapped with explosives in the West. \nAgency employees were told by a man that they could have his guns, he \njust wanted to pull the trigger one more time--at them.\n  In my county, a group of armed citizens stood by as a Forest Service \nemployee helplessly tried to stop the illegal opening of a road with a \nbulldozer. A county official later said publicly that if the Forest \nService officer had reached for his gun, 50 people would have shot him.\n  In Garfield County, MT, a group called The Free Men set up their own \ncounty government, declared the existing one illegal, and offered a \ncash bounty for the arrest of legitimate law enforcement officials.\n  In New Mexico, a Fish and Wildlife employee was told that he would \nhave his head blown off. The manager of the Malheur National Wildlife \nRefuge in Oregon was threatened with death, and his family was \nharassed.\n  In the West, antigovernment activity has spread like a prairie fire. \nProperty rights activists in Nevada, New Mexico, Montana, and Idaho \nregularly drown out Federal officials who speak at public meetings. Yet \nthese same activists illegally graze cattle on Federal lands.\n  Worried Government agents such as Tom Dwyer, a U.S. Forest Service \nofficial, whose encounter with a property rights leader ignited a court \nbattle, said, ``There are times when I was driving back from being out \nof town when I wondered if my house would still be there.''\n  Yes, Mr. President, Guy Pence wonders also.\n  Mr. President, this is not the America that we believe in. It is as \nif some sickness has swept our country, as if we are living in a \ndifferent age, as if we have been transported in a time warp back to \nthe barbarism and violence of previous civilizations like ``Back to the \nFuture,'' I guess.\n  I am here today to denounce violence and extremism in any form, \nwhether it is clinic violence at an abortion office, or whether it is \ndomestic violence in a home. It does not matter who committed an act \nagainst Guy Pence, it is violence, and we have to speak out against it.\n  Acts like this, and others which have been cited, have been \nlegitimized by anti-Government rhetoric of those in positions of \nresponsibility who should know better.\n  In my own State, elected officials have rejected the authority of \nFederal land managers to do their job on public lands--not land owned \nby the counties or the States, but land owned by all the people, \nincluding the urban residents of Reno and Las Vegas.\n  Mr. President, we must speak out. We must recognize that some Members \nof this body and in the other Chamber have all but advocated violence \nagainst established law and order and sympathize and apologize for gun-\nthreatening supremacists. There is legislation pending in both Houses \nof Congress that enshrines and advocates some of these principles.\n  One of the problems in our society today is that people are unwilling \nto speak out, are unwilling to speak out against violence, are \nunwilling to speak out against sexual depravity conveyed to our \nchildren through the mass media, and are unwilling to speak out against \nlawlessness, generally.\n  I am speaking out. I call upon my colleagues in this Chamber, the \nelected officials of the country and the Western United States, and the \npeaceful advocates of the county supremacist movement to decry \nviolence. I would challenge the leaders of this movement to write their \nmembers, to speak out publicly, to let everyone know that while they \nmay disagree with the policies of the Federal Government that they do \nnot advocate violence.\n  We must get the message out that, while they may not like certain \nFederal policies, they do not advocate violence against innocent people \nwhose job it is to enforce it.\n  Teddy Roosevelt said, ``No man is above the law, and no man is below \nit.'' He also said, ``Nor do we ask any man's permission when we \nrequire him to obey the law.'' We must obey the law.\n  Mr. President, I also would like to express publicly my appreciation \nto my friend from Minnesota for allowing me to go out of order.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me just say to my colleague from \nNevada before he leaves that, after having heard his statement, it was \nreally kind of my pleasure to defer to the Senator from Nevada. That \nwas a very, very courageous, and powerful statement.\n  I would like to join him in condemning this extremism and violence. \nMurder is never legitimate. Attempted murder is never legitimate. There \nis no place for this in this country.\n  I think the Senator's statement is national in significance. I think \nwhat he said today on the floor of the Senate is needed to be said. \nThere comes a point in time when silence is betrayal. And the Senator \nfrom Nevada clearly is not silent. I thank him for his courage. Mr. \nPresident, my understanding is I have 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes and 46 seconds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/07/senate-section/article/S11727-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11729-S11730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all let me ask unanimous \nconsent that the editorial today in the Washington Post entitled \n``Cutting Medicare'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Cutting Medicare\n\n       A new report suggests the congressional goal of cutting \n     Medicare costs by a quarter of a trillion dollars over the \n     next seven years could be even harder to achieve than \n     previously believed. The theory had been that large savings \n     could be had if only the government would begin to manage \n     Medicare the way the private sector has been managing its \n     health care costs in recent years. The commonly cited \n     evidence was that Medicare costs were rising much more \n     rapidly than the health care costs of private employers, \n     which were showing signs of being brought under control. The \n     principal explanation was that Medicare remained essentially \n     an old-style fee-for-service system while the private sector \n     was turning more and more toward some form of managed care.\n       But the new study by Urban Institute researchers says that, \n     properly accounted for, Medicare and private sector costs \n     have been rising at pretty much the same speed in recent \n     years. The suggestion is that there aren't large, painless \n     savings available simply by shifting the system by which care \n     is delivered. It's true, the study found, that in the past \n     few years aggregate Medicare costs have been rising faster \n     than the aggregate cost of private insurance. But a major \n     reason has been that Medicare enrollment has been steadily \n     rising--there are more older people in the society--while the \n     number of privately insured has been declining.\n       If you look, however, at per capita costs for the same \n     kinds of basic health care services, there's been little to \n     choose between Medicare and private-sector growth rates, the \n     study says. In the private sector there have been some one-\n     time-only gains by virtue of shifts to managed care; the \n     private sector is becoming a shrewder buyer of health care. \n     But it isn't clear those gains can be sustained--and Medicare \n     is already a better buyer of health care than the \n     government's reputation might suggest. The government has \n     used its buying power to force down what it pays providers, \n     so that Medicare already pays hospitals less than the cost of \n     treating many Medicare patients. In some respects, the \n     private sector is catching up with cost-cutting steps that \n     Medicare already has taken.\n       Just about everyone agrees that (a) there's a need to \n     reduce the rate at which Medicare costs are rising, and (b) \n     there's room for significant reform in the program. And, yes, \n     a shift toward managed care can help. But there isn't a magic \n     wand that can be waved to achieve large and lasting cost cuts \n     painlessly. In the long run, if the government is going to \n     pay appreciably less, the program is likely to provide less \n     or the recipients will have to pay more.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, what the Urban Institute has come out \nwith really should not surprise anyone who is a student of health care. \nAnd what the urban institute has said is that the kind of conventional \nwisdom in Medicare costs have been rising at a faster rate than private \nhealth insurance costs is simply not true once you look at the capital \nexpenditure.\n  That is, a matter of fact, what is happening with Medicare which is, \nof course, part of the success of Medicare--that more and more people, \nthank God, live to be 65, and more and more people, thank God, live to \nbe 80. That is really what you have to look at.\n  So it is not this sort of promise of shifting everything from fee for \nservice to managed care and, therefore, reducing the costs, which needs \nto be questioned. \n\n[[Page S 11730]]\n\n  The conclusion of this editorial is that in the long run, if the \nGovernment is going to pay appreciably less, the program is likely to \nprovide less, or the recipients will have to pay more.\n  Mr. President, let me just be clear about this in response to so much \nof what I heard this morning on the floor of the Senate about Medicare.\n  The Medicare Program, which passed in 1965, and the Medicaid Program, \nwhich passed in 1965, made the United States of America a better \ncountry. And this legislation, this public policy, was a response to \nthe real pain of elderly people in our country. Half of the elderly \npopulation prior to Medicare had no health insurance. It is that \nsimple. People are no longer working. They do not have their jobs. So \nthey do not have their coverage. In addition, when people are not \nworking their employment earnings drop precipitously.\n  Today 36 million elderly and disabled Americans, including more than \n630,000 Minnesotans, are protected by Medicare.\n  Mr. President, I only have about 8 minutes. But I just want to kind \nof respond to some of what I heard said this morning in one, two, \nthree, four fashion.\n  First, the concern of my colleagues about the Medicare trust fund and \nthe need to finance Medicare would be more credible to me if we were \nnot juxtaposing with the $270 billion in cuts in Medicare the $245 \nbillion of tax cuts for wealthy people. It is a little bit suspicious, \nespecially since the vast majority of the tax cuts--some 80 percent--go \nto families with incomes of over $100,000 a year.\n  Mr. President, there is an important change being proposed here. As \nopposed to Medicare being a universal health insurance program--that is \nwhat it has been about for elderly people, senior citizens--now the \nproposal is to have a fixed amount of cash for each Medicare \nbeneficiary that they can use to purchase coverage in the marketplace. \nAnd the difference between the value of that voucher and what happens \nwith medical inflation, that needs to be made up by the recipient.\n  Mr. President, there is something profoundly wrong with the direction \nwe are going in. First of all, understand that what has made this \nprogram so successful--and it has been a huge success--is that it is \nuniversal for all citizens 65 years of age and over.\n  Understand, second of all, that we are not talking about a high \nincome profile. Elderly people pay four times as much out of pocket as \nthose 65 years of age and less. Some 75 percent of the Medicare \nexpenditures go to families or households with incomes of $25,000 a \nyear or less. And I am not even talking about the, roughly speaking, \n$40,000 a year that have to be paid for nursing home expenditures which \nis the catastrophic expenses that so many elderly people have to phase \nin at the end of their lives which wiped out savings.\n  Mr. President, the other point that my colleagues did not want to \nmake is that while, on the one hand, we have the Medicare per person \nexpenditure inflated to rise under 5 percent per year, the private \nhealth insurance expenditures are slated to go up over 7 percent a \nyear. Who makes up the difference? Mr. President, there are some \nproblems with this proposal that are really quite profound. And they \nought to be laid out, and I have yet to hear anybody on the other side \nof the aisle respond adequately.\n  No. 1, if you are going to cut $270 billion a year, then quite \nclearly beneficiaries are going to have to pay more, and many cannot \nafford to pay more. In addition, you are going to have, roughly \nspeaking, 50 percent of those cuts go in the form of less reimbursement \nfor the care givers or for the providers. But, Mr. President, No. 1, \nmany elderly people cannot afford to pay more. And, No. 2, in greater \nMinnesota or greater Idaho where 70 or 80 percent of the patient mix \nare elderly people, those hospitals and clinics which have a tough time \nmaking a go of it right now will go under. That is the case in \nMinnesota. That is the case in rural America.\n  This policy will not work. This is slash and burn.\n  Third of all, Mr. President, what will happen is it is the same shell \ngame. We have talked about this over and over again. I can assure you \nthat when the providers can transfer the costs--and they can do that in \nsome of the metropolitan areas--they will do so.\n  So if the doctors or clinics or hospitals get less in reimbursements \nthan the cost of providing care, shifting it to private health \ninsurance, premiums go up for employers, who then in turn drop \nemployees, and we have more employees dropped from coverage--hardly a \npositive change, hardly a reform for health care.\n  Mr. President, we do not know how we are going to finance medical \neducation since that right now, much of it, is out of Medicare. What \nhappens to our hospitals, our teaching hospitals?\n  Mr. President, as a Senator from Minnesota, what happens to my State, \nwhich is a State which has already reduced much of the fat in the \nsystem, which has weeded out many of the inefficiencies? We are at rock \nbottom. This slash-and-burn approach will not work for rural Minnesota \nand it will not work for metropolitan Minnesota.\n  Mr. President, the fact is we are not talking about reform. If we \nwant to talk about reform, I say to my colleagues, do not have the tax \ncuts, $245 billion.\n  Second, why are we spending $7 billion more on the Pentagon budget, \nbut we are going to cut health care for the elderly people?\n  Third, why are we leaving all the subsidies for the oil companies, \nthe pharmaceutical companies, the tobacco companies, but we are going \nto cut benefits for Medicare recipients?\n  And finally, if you want to have cost containment, do it systemwide. \nWhy not get back to health care reform. Why not move forward. This is \nnot an effort to take us into the 21st century. This is an effort to \nmove us back into the 19th century.\n  Systemwide cost containment? Yes. Universal health care coverage? \nYes. Focus on home-based health care so elderly people and people with \ndisabilities can live at home in as near normal circumstance as \npossible with dignity? Yes. Health care reform but with financing for \nmedical education? Yes.\n  We can have health care reform, colleagues, but this is slash and \nburn. And no set of speeches will be able to ignore that reality.\n  And so, Mr. President, this morning was the beginning of the debate. \nI look forward to much more of that debate, but I wish to be crystal \nclear what is at stake here. This is a program which made a huge \ndifference in our country. As a Senator from Minnesota, I am going to \nfight very hard to maintain the integrity of this program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/07/senate-section/article/S11729-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11730-S11731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LEWIS A. ENGMAN\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on July 12, I lost a friend.\n  And the country lost a man who had served with energy and integrity, \nin both the public and private sectors.\n  Lewis A. Engman, ``Lew'' to the many friends he leaves from 25 years \nin Washington, was taken suddenly by stroke.\n  He left life well before his time. Had he lived longer, I know Lew \nwould have used it fighting for the strong principles that guided all \nhis professional life.\n  Lew believed in competition and free markets.\n  An antitrust lawyer and economist by training, Lew saw competition \nand free markets as the consumer's most efficient and effective \nprotection.\n  As Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission in the early 1970's, Lew \nwas one of the first Government officials to observe that some Federal \nregulatory agencies had become servants of the industries they \nregulated, that they were more adept at propping up prices than \nprotecting the consumer.\n  As much as anyone, Lew Engman was responsible for setting in motion \nthe current movement against overregulation.\n  While a prophet of deregulation, Lew never took a doctrinaire, anti-\nGovernment stance. He liked to distinguish between regulations that \nimprove competitive markets rather than those which substitute for the \nmarket--supporting the former, opposing the latter.\n  Another principle that guided Lew was his commitment to full \ndisclosure, accuracy, and truthfulness. Information, in Lew's view, \nmade markets function. Without full, dependable price and product \ninformation, consumers were defenseless, Lew often said. Lew never \nwavered--not at the Federal Trade Commission, nor later as \n\n[[Page S 11731]]\npresident of two pharmaceutical associations--in his defense of the \nconsumer's right to know.\n  Lew and I became friends during the negotiations that led to \nenactment of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act \nof 1984, a bill I was proud to author with Representative Henry Waxman.\n  The 1984 law addressed two seemingly competing needs: The need for \nbrand name pharmaceutical companies to regain the patent life they had \nlost awaiting FDA approval of their products; and the interests of the \nfledgling generic drug industry in speeding their products to market as \nsoon as the innovator patent had expired.\n  We faced this challenge--how to balance the research-based drug \nindustry's desire for patent lives adequate to encourage research \nagainst the generic industry's desire to put competing copies on the \nmarket as soon as possible--we faced this challenge head-on.\n  It was a complicated issue, and indeed a challenge. The public wants \nnewer and better drugs, and that necessitates adequate research, which, \nquite simply, is costly. At the same time, consumers also want less \nexpensive drugs.\n  Lew represented the research firms. It was not easy--they had varying \ninterests. But his political acumen, and his personal belief in \ncompetition, got the job done.\n  In short, Lew had a fine line to walk, and he walked it with honor \nand courage.\n  In the end, Lew's refusal to break his promise to support a \ncompromise, a compromise that had been worked out between the House, \nSenate, and industry, cost Lew his job. He left it head high, integrity \nintact.\n  It would take pages to list all Lew's achievements, from selection by \nTime magazine in 1974 as one of the country's young men to watch, \nthrough a career as a top Washington official. But Lew's was not a life \nto measure in jobs and titles, but rather by the thread that ran \nthrough it all.\n  It is a comfortable thing for a man to know who he is and what he \nbelieves. No one who knew Lew could believe he died anything but \ncomfortable.\n  I will miss Lew Engman. My heart goes out to his wife, Pat, to whom \nhe was devoted, and to his three boys.\n  They have lost a loving husband and father.\n  We all have lost a man of principle and a fine American.\n  I know that Lew will be missed by all of us.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/07/senate-section/article/S11730-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11731-S11732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   IN RECOGNITION OF THOSE WHO SERVE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in Chapter 9 of the Book of Ecclesiastes, we \nfind the following portrait in verses 14 and 15: ``There was a little \ncity, and few men within it; and there came a great King against it, \nand besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it. Now there was \nfound in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; \nyet, no man remembered that same poor man.''\n  This is a lesson that is often repeated, and, in fact, it is \nconstantly being played and replayed all about us, if we but pause to \nobserve it.\n  As a former welder in the shipyards on the east and gulf coasts, and \nas a Senator who has witnessed the christening of great oceangoing \nvessels, I have attended the splendorous pageantry that accompanies the \nlaunching of a ship, as have many of my colleagues. The scene is one in \nwhich great crowds gather, bands fill the air with their martial music, \nthe trumpets blare, the banners fly, dignitaries are assembled, orators \ndeclaim, the champagne sparkles and flows, and shouts and cheers ring \nout as the ship slowly glides into the channel. The program ends, ``the \ntumult and the shouting dies, the Captains and the Kings depart'', and \nin the pause that lingers in the human contemplation, one may perhaps \nreflect upon the hours of toil that were spent by the welders, the \nriveters, the pipefitters, the mechanics, the ironworkers, and the \nscores of other crafts that went into the building of the ship. The men \nwho operated huge cranes, the carpenters who drove the nails, the \nworkers who pulled the cables and lifted huge burdens and swept the \ndecks--the sweat and labor of thousands of men and women, working with \ntheir hands and minds through long days and nights--all these made it \npossible. Yet, in the glittering pageantry of the launch, who \nremembered these unsung workers whose work made the dream become a \nreality?\n  As a politician, I have attended many banquets, many church suppers, \nmany enjoyable evening repasts, as I am sure all of my colleagues have \ndone. Often, I have reflected upon the words of Ecclesiastes on my way \nhome after such a delightful event. Long after the program has ended, \nand the echoes of the speaker's voice have faded away, and the \nhandshakes and the goodbyes have been overtaken by the darkness that \nfalls from the sable-vested wings of night, there are those who are \nstill working in the grimy kitchen, cleaning the silverware and the \ndishes and the pots and the pans, and putting away the linens, mopping \nthe floors and disposing of the garbage so that the kitchen and the \nmeeting hall will be polished and clean and ready for the next church \nsupper. It was an enjoyable feast, the laughter and the pleasant \nconversations will long be recalled, but who will remember the \ncalloused hands of toil that prepared the delectable dishes, that \ncooked the food, that washed and dried the dinnerware? Who will \nremember those men and women who gave up the pleasant hours of rest \nfollowing the epicurean delights? Who will remember those who stayed \nand turned out the lights and locked the doors and saw to it that \neverything was in order before returning to the humble cottage and a \nbed of hard-earned rest from the difficult chores?\n  Mr. President, these are the kinds of people who go about daily and \ndo the hard work that makes the world go around. They are unobtrusive, \nthey are unassuming, they quietly do their duty and earn, in the sweat \nof their brow, their daily bread. The farmer at the plow, the fisherman \non the stormy deep, the miner toiling in the bowels of the Earth, the \nsweating ironworker at the blast furnace, the herdsman on the hills and \nplains, the lowly private at his station, the helmsman of the ship on \nthe rolling waves, the policeman on his lonely beat, the mother who \nspends a sleepless night by the side of her fevered child, the \nhousewife who mends and sews and keeps the home fires burning--these \nare the unsung heroes who make the world go around. They are not often \nremembered, but too often forgotten.\n  Many times, Mr. President, in my 43 years of working in this Capitol \nbuilding, after a long day at the office, upon leaving the Capitol,\n\n     I heard the trailing garments of the Night,\n       sweep through her marble halls,\n     I saw her sable skirts all fringed with light,\n     from the celestial walls.\n\n  Yet, in our meditations seldom, perhaps, do we reflect upon those who \nsweat and toil to make these walls and halls beautiful--the charwomen, \nthe janitors, the people who mop and wax and polish the floors of \nMinton tile. I have seen them in the wee hours of the morning polishing \nthe brass rails that go up and down the marbled stairs. I have seen \nthem dusting the artistic works of the great Brumidi. I have seen them \ncarting the desks, moving the chairs, and carrying the dishes of food \nas dinners and luncheons are served. They make and keep these elegant \nsurroundings clean and attractive for the tourists and for those of us \nwho work here. Yet, how often do we remember them? How often do we \npause to thank them, to give them a pat on the back, and to express \nwords of appreciation for the services they perform? The contributions \nof these dedicated workers allow the essential work of this body and \nmuch of America to proceed. We are in their debt. I take these few \nmoments to salute them here today.\n  Likewise, we seldom talk to acknowledge and appreciate the essential \nlabor of the excellent staffers who serve us here in the Senate. During \nthe course of my, as I say, nearly 43 years in this building, I have \ncome to appreciate and respect the contributions and dedication that \nour staff bring to this institution. Behind much of the work that is \nconducted in committee hearings and on this floor there are many staff \npeople who have toiled for hours and days and weeks to make it all \npossible. While we, as the elected officials, carry the ultimate \nresponsibility for the legislation and policy that are set by the \nSenate, the input from our staffs is considerable and valuable. \n\n[[Page S 11732]]\n\n  I have been disturbed by the recent articles in the press which have \nfocused on the reputation of certain Senate staff and of one staff \nperson in particular. It appears that there are those individuals in \nthe political arena who have determined that, in order to promote their \nparticular agendas, it is necessary to excoriate and vilify any person \nwho represents a different point of view. The criticisms leveled have \nbeen vicious and unrelenting. Theirs is a take-no-prisoner, scorched-\nearth attitude, with little concern for the individuals who are wounded \nas part of this guerilla-style rhetoric.\n  Mr. President, Sheila Burke has worked for the Senate since 1977. \nSince joining the staff of Senator Dole, Sheila has proved to be a \nsuperb employee. She has represented the interests of Senator Dole and \nthose of the Republican Conference in a way that they all can be proud. \nI have always found Sheila to be fair and even-handed. When I was the \nleader of my party in the Senate, I had the occasion from time to time \nto talk with Sheila Burke. I never came to know her well, but I did \ncome to admire her greatly. Her abilities have benefited both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  The Senate can only operate in an atmosphere of compromise and \nconciliation. There is no place for the slings and arrows of fortune \nthat have been directed at Mrs. Burke. Frankly, many of her critics \nseem to be more concerned with the operations of the White House in \n1997 than of the Senate of 1995. My feeling is that we ought to be more \nconcerned with the difficult issues that face us here and now. The \nmassive problems facing this nation demand all of our attention. We \nought to be working together to address these concerns instead of \nworrying about who may occupy the position of White House Chief of \nStaff in some future administration.\n  Sheila Burke is a most capable individual. She has a family. She is a \nmother. She has three children. She has a husband who commutes back and \nforth to Connecticut. Yet, she finds time to be a good mother, a good \nwife, and to be a good chief of staff of a Senator--in this case, the \nmajority leader. She is a registered nurse. She is a very disciplined, \nprofessional woman. That is my perception of Sheila Burke.\n  She has to be tough. She has to be tough. She represents her boss and \nshe does it well. I have a chief of staff. I have loyal members on my \nstaff, many of whom have been with me for years. I know that a chief of \nstaff has to be dedicated, has to be very capable, and has to represent \nthe viewpoints of the Senator who employs her.\n  It must be very difficult to do the job and do it well, and \nespecially if one is criticized in the public press for doing that job \nand doing it well.\n  I consider Sheila a loyal and trusted employee of the Senate. I think \nit is time for the cowards who would hide behind the uncalled for \ncriticism of a Senate staffer to direct their venom- enhanced energy \ntoward becoming constructive players of the legislative process. As a \nstaff person, she cannot very well defend herself in the press. It must \nbe pretty hard for her, with the stresses that are upon her as a chief \nof staff, to bear up under such unfair and unwarranted criticism.\n  I admire her courage.\n  Plutarch tells us, of Aristides, who was one of the 10 Athenian \ngenerals at the Battle of Marathon in 490 B.C. Aristides was also at \nthe Battle of Salamis in 480, B.C.\n  And as one of the archons, Aristides conducted himself in such a way \nand with such a high sense of justice and with such great virtue that \nhe was given the surname, Plutarch tells us, ``the Just,'' ``Aristides \nthe Just.'' Themistocles sought to undermine Aristides' standing with \nthe people, and spread the word that Aristides was assuming to himself \nthe work of the adjudicator and making the decisions himself, and so \nstirred up the people.\n  Plutarch tells us that the Ostracism was a process by which those \nindividuals who excited envy in the minds of others might be banished. \nIt was not a punishment for a crime or misdemeanor but just a way of \nlessening and humiliating, making more humble those who were achievers.\n  The process worked something like this, according to Plutarch. The \ncitizens throughout Attica came to Athens and they took earthen shells, \nor pieces of pots and other earthenware, and wrote the name of an \nindividual on those shells--an individual they wished to see banished. \nThey took the shells to the marketplace where there was an enclosure \nbehind a wooden rail, and the magistrates, then, would count the \nshells. And if there were less than 6,000 shells with names, the \nOstracism failed. But if there were 6,000 or more of these shells, then \nthe individual whose name appeared on most of the 6,000 shells would be \nbanished.\n  So, upon this occasion as Aristides was walking about the \nmarketplace, witnessing the goings on, a certain illiterate rustic \napproached him, Aristides, and asked Aristides to write on the shell \nthe name ``Aristides.'' Aristides was somewhat surprised and curious, \nand he asked the individual if Aristides had ever done him, the \nindividual, a wrong?\n  The rustic replied, ``No, nor do I even know him; but it vexes me to \neverywhere hear him called the Just.''\n  I wonder sometimes if this is not what we see all too often, by those \nwho envy the achievers.\n  The scriptures say, ``Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but \nwho is able to stand before envy?''\n  Mr. President, it is the same story with anyone who accomplishes \nthings and in some way establishes a good name for himself. There will \nalways be those who will criticize the achievers among us. The world \nwill always be divided into two classes: those who go ahead and do \nthings, and those who sit on the sidelines and say, ``Why was it not \ndone the other way?''\n  Alexander the Great bore the censures of his critics with great \nmoderation and used to say, ``There was something noble in hearing \nhimself ill spoken of while he was doing well.''\n  And Voltaire says somewhere that it is a noble thing to make \ningrates.\n  I think it best to heed Polonius' advice to Laertes, as given to us \nin Hamlet,\n\n     Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment\n     . . . this, above all: to thine ownself be true,\n     and it must follow, as the night the day,\n     thou canst not be false to any man.\n\n  So, if I may close with a few words of comfort and encouragement to \nSheila, they would be these: You have shown that you ``can keep your \nhead when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you.'' \nContinue on this path of duty.\n  I say to Senators, I think we err if we do not encourage those who \nachieve. So I want to add my words of encouragement to Sheila Burke.\n  Continue on the path of duty. Do not be turned aside by the skeptics, \nthe doubters, the cynics. Satisfaction will come in the serenity of a \nclear conscience and the knowledge that:\n\n     Tired of the Senate's barren brawl,\n     An hour with silence we prefer,\n     Where statelier rise the woods than all\n     Yon towers of talk at Westminster.\n     Let this man prate and that man plot,\n     On fame or place or title bent:\n     The votes of veering crowds are not\n     The things that are more excellent.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/07/senate-section/article/S11731-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11732-S11735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   THE DEFENSE MODERNIZATION ACCOUNT\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, on Saturday, August 5, 1995, I offered an \namendment in the nature of a substitute to section 1003 of S. 1026, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1996. My amendment, \ncosponsored by Senator Roth and Senator Grassley, was accepted by \nunanimous consent of the Senate. At this time I would like to make some \ncomments about my amendment. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the \namendment be printed in the Record following my remarks, along with \nsome relevant correspondence on this issue between Senator Levin and \nOffice of Management and Budget Director Rivlin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GLENN. I would like to say at the outset that I share Senator \nNunn's concerns that the military departments--indeed, I would say, all \nagencies of Government--should have incentives to find savings within \nthe programs under their jurisdiction. I would further agree with the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Armed Services Committee that one \nof the flaws of our current budget and appropriations process is that, \nrather than encouraging cost-savings efficiencies, it induces \n\n[[Page S 11733]]\nagencies to spend whatever money is left before their authority expires \nat the end of a fiscal year. So, in this sense, I support the \nunderlying purpose of the committee in developing innovative methods \nfor providing such incentives, including the defense modernization \naccount DMA.\n  As a long-time member of both the Armed Services Committee and the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee--which I chaired for 8 years--I know \nfull well, however, the significant problems and difficulties with \nDOD's financial management and controls systems. DOD has over 260 \ndisparate accounting systems which are not yet integrated. Despite the \nefforts of John Hamre, the DOD comptroller, we have not yet reached the \nday when DOD can produce accurate, reliable, and auditable financial \nstatements. In fact, I can tell you it will not even be in this \ncentury.\n  These problems have led to over $20 billion worth of unmatched \ndisbursements, where money has been paid out without proper and \nsufficient documentation. We do not know what it was used for. \nMoreover, DOD has been overpaying its contractors by the hundreds of \nmillions of dollars each year, much of that discovered and returned by \nthe contractors themselves, not through DOD followup. I will not bother \nto put everyone to sleep here by discussing negative unliquidated \nobligations--NULO's, as they are called.\n  These financial management problems should make anyone familiar with \nDOD pause before we give new and additional authorities in this area--\nhowever important the goal.\n  Perhaps the most relevant example to this proposal of DOD financial \nmanagement problems is the infamous M accounts, or merged surplus \naccounts. A few years back, in 1991, I was one of the first in Congress \nto uncover this problem and help close these funds down. In layman's \nterms, M accounts had all the features of a slush fund, created by \npooling together all excess appropriations dollars not spent in a \nfiscal year and using them for almost whatever purpose they wanted. \nWhether authorized by law, or not. There was no auditable trail, no \naccounting controls.\n  By the time we began our investigations into the M accounts, they had \ngrown to over $50 billion. The legislation which shut these accounts \ndown required that an audit be conducted to determine, if we could, for \nwhat purposes this money was spent. After more than 3 years, we still \nhave not figured out where some $5.2 billion has gone. There are no \nmatching records for the disbursements.\n  There were elements of the defense modernization account that \nreminded me of M accounts--and reminded others as well. In fact, my \ndistinguished friend from Michigan, Senator Levin, was kind enough to \nshare with me an exchange of correspondence he had with the Office of \nManagement and Budget about the problems with this account. And as \npreviously stated, I have asked that this correspondence be made a part \nof the Record.\n  I am bound and determined that we not repeat the past. Since the \ncommittee reported the legislation, I have been working with Senator \nNunn and others to improve section 1003. I now believe that we have \nbuilt in sufficient financial controls and reporting requirements, \nwhile maintaining the flexibility, incentives, and intent of the \noriginal legislation.\n  I would like to briefly discuss some of the problems as I perceived \nthem in the committee's language and describe what my amendment does to \naddress those problems.\n  As proposed, the DMA had significant control and accountability \nshortcomings. For example, the DMA did not say who is responsible for \nidentifying savings. If savings are achieved it is important to know \nhow so that this knowledge could potentially be applied to other \nprograms. There was no restriction on cross-fiscal year transfers--with \nthe corresponding prospect that the DMA could be funded by transferring \nexpired funds; and there was no limit on the ultimate size or life of \nthe account. Under the original legislation, funds transferred into the \nDMA would lose their fiscal year and purpose identities, greatly \ncomplicating auditing. Programs would have been able to mask accounting \nand management deficiencies by transferring unobligated balances to the \nDMA at the end of the fiscal year, and transferring money back when \nunrecorded and forgotten bills show up. There was also a substantial \nrisk, with no limit on its size or life, that the account could grow to \nembarrassing proportions.\n  We addressed these problems and I believe have reached agreement on \nacceptable changes to strengthen the financial controls. With the \nagreed changes, the DMA would require a secretarial determination of \nexcess funds and identification of their source for funds transferred \ninto the DMA; it would limit transfers into the DMA to unexpired funds \navailable in the current year.\n  It would preserve the integrity of the Account Closing Act limitation \non the period of availability for expenditure for funds transferred \ninto the account; with this limitation, funds would not lose their \nfiscal year identity.\n  It would require notice to the relevant congressional committees of \nthe amount and purpose of transfers from the DMA.\n  It would prohibit transfers from DMA to cover unliquidated or \nunrecorded obligations from prior fiscal years or to make unmatched \ndisbursements.\n  It would limit the use of DMA funds to programs and purposes for \nwhich Congress has authorized funds.\n  It would require a quarterly report on transfers to/from DMA with \namount, source and/or purpose.\n  It would cap the fund at $1 billion; limit the availability of funds \nin the DMA to the end of the third full fiscal year after transfer.\n  It would sunset the authority to transfer funds into the account \nafter 8 years; GAO is to audit the account after 5 years and again 6 \nmonths prior to sunset. This will give DOD time before consideration of \nsunset to fix whatever deficiencies are found in first audit. We also \nprovide for the account to be closed consistent with the account \nclosing provisions of title 31. (31 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1552(a), 1553(a)).\n  Mr. President I believe that these controls will help ensure that the \ndefense modernization account does not become another M account. I \nappreciate Senator Nunn's willingness to work with me on this \namendment. I also appreciate the work and input of Senator Grassley, \nSenator Roth, and their staff.\n                           Amendment No. 2279\n\n       Beginning on page 321, strike out line 15 and all that \n     follows through page 325, line 18, and insert in lieu thereof \n     the following:\n       ``(b) Credits to Account.--(1) Under regulations prescribed \n     by the Secretary of Defense, and upon a determination by the \n     Secretary concerned of the availability and source of excess \n     funds as described in subparagraph (A) or (B), the Secretary \n     may transfer to the Defense Modernization Account during any \n     fiscal year--\n       ``(A) any amount of unexpired funds available to the \n     Secretary for procurements that, as a result of economies, \n     efficiencies, and other savings achieved in the procurements, \n     are excess to the funding requirements of the procurements;

Alice Rivlin,\n     Director, Office of Management and Budget, Old Executive \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ms. Rivlin: I am concerned about the efficacy and \n     wisdom of a new Defense Modernization Account established in \n     Section 1003 of S. 1026, the fiscal year 1996 Defense \n     Authorization bill just reported by the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee. Although I agree with one motive behind this \n     effort, creating an additional incentive for the military \n     services to generate savings from efficient program \n     management, the method this bill establishes strikes me as \n     precedent-setting for other agencies as well.\n       No other department of government is allowed to keep \n     unobligated balances that would otherwise expire, and then \n     use those funds to procure items or services that Congress \n     has not expressly authorized. And although Section 1003 is \n     crafted to try to avoid a repeat of past abuses of the DOD \n     ``M'' accounts, I believe the protections may be inadequate. \n     The laws Congress has passed establishing new buying \n     practices and requiring more efficient procurement should \n     provide all the incentive needed. If programs can be \n     completed for less money, shouldn't Congress authorize less \n     money, or rescind unobligated balances and return funds to \n     the treasury?\n       Would you please provide me with the Administration's view \n     on Section 1003, and specifically address whether the Office \n     of Management and Budget supports allowing the Department of \n     Defense the new budgeting authority in S.1026?\n       As S.1026 could be before the full Senate within a week, I \n     would appreciate a prompt reply.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carl Levin.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              Executive Office    \n                                                 of the President,\n\n\n                              Office of Management and Budget,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 1995.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: Thank you for bringing to our attention \n     the establishment of a new Defense Modernization Account \n     (DMA) in section 1003 of S.1026, the fiscal year 1996 Defense \n     Authorization bill. Enclosed is a preliminary technical \n     analysis of this section that was prepared by my staff.\n       We are in agreement with the major purpose of the proposal, \n     which is to assist in the modernization of our military \n     forces. Funds in the account would be used for increasing \n     procurement quantities, increasing Research, Development, \n     Test and Evaluation (RDT) accounts or modernization of an \n     existing system being procured under an ongoing procurement \n     program, all to support overall defense modernization.\n       We are concerned, however, about the erosion of the \n     appropriations process that this provision would encourage. \n     Although uses of funds in the DMA would ordinarily be \n     approved through a reprogramming, and the Appropriations \n     Committees would be able to block any use of DMA funds they \n     disagreed with, reprogrammings are not sobject to the full \n     appropriations process involving both houses of Congress.\n       Also, the definitions of sources for the account appear \n     broad. The terms ``procurement'' and ``support of \n     installations and facilities'' would allow deposits of a wide \n     array of funds into the DMA to be used for procurement and \n     RDT rather than the original purposes for which \n     appropriations were made.\n       Practical considerations may also limit the use of funds in \n     the DMA. Use of DMA funds would increase outlays, and the DMA \n     would not offer any relief from the scoring required by the \n     Budget Enforcement Act. Further, transfers from source \n     accounts would be constrained by the need to keep sufficient \n     balances to cover such things as contract adjustments.\n       On balance, we think that section 1003 would provide the \n     Department of Defense some modest additional flexibility in \n     providing for modernization, but the flexibility would be \n     offset by the concerns we have noted above.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Alice M. Rivlin,\n     Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                  \n[[Page S 11735]]\n\n\n\n          technical staff analysis of section 1003 of s. 1026\n\n       Section 2221(a) would establish a Defense Modernization \n     Account (DMA).\n       Section 2221(b)(1) would authorize the Secretary of Defense \n     to transfer, without limit, (A) funds available for \n     ``procurement'' that would otherwise expire and (B) funds \n     available for ``support of installations and facilities'' \n     that would otherwise expire.\n       Since almost all DOD accounts are available for \n     ``procurement'' and the ``support of installations and \n     facilities'', funds could be transferred from many different \n     accounts. For example, all of the O, Procurement, RDTE, \n     Housing, and even parts of the Defense Health Program \n     accounts are available to procure goods and services and/or \n     support installations and facilities.\n       Section 2221(b)(2) specifies that funds may not be \n     transferred to the DMA by the Secretary if the funds are \n     necessary for programs, projects, and activities that, as \n     determined by the Secretary, have a higher priority than the \n     purposes for which the funds would be available if \n     transferred.\n       Section 2221(b)(3) would permanently reappropriate the \n     amounts transferred to the DMA from fixed period (i.e., \n     annual and multi-year) appropriations to no-year \n     appropriations.\n       Section 2221(c) would ``attribute'' the amounts transferred \n     to the DMA. Essentially, funds transferred in by a military \n     department, Defense agency, or other element of DOD shall \n     only be available for that department, agency, or element. It \n     is not clear that the term ``element'' is needed. However, if \n     it is retained, it should be clearly defined and in a manner \n     that will not complicate DOD's accounting system.\n       Section 221(d) would make the funds available for a broad \n     range of activities (1) for increasing the quantity of items \n     and services procured under a procurement program in order to \n     achieve more efficient production or delivery rate or (2) for \n     research, development, test, and evaluation and procurement \n     necessary for modernization of an existing system or of a \n     system being procured under an ongoing procurement program.\n\n       Section 2221(e) would prohibit the use of the funds: for a \n     purpose for which Congress denied funds; or in excess of:\n       --a specific limitation provided in law on either (1) the \n     quantity or the items or services that may be procured or (2) \n     the obligation or expenditure obligated or expended, \n     respectively, for the procurement program; or\n       --the requirement for the items or services as approved by \n     the Joint Requirements Oversight Council and reported to \n     Congress by the Secretary of Defense.\n       Section 2221(f)(1) would provide permanent transfer \n     authority up to $500 million each year from the DMA to \n     accounts available for the purposes described in subsection \n     (d). This subsection and subsection (b)(3), when taken \n     together, would establish a process that would function \n     through reprogramming.\n       Section 221(f)(2) would require the Secretary to notify the \n     Armed Services and Appropriations Committees of any proposed \n     transfers under (f)(1).\n       Section 2221(g) specifies that funds in the DMA (to include \n     balances over the $500 million transferred under subsection \n     (f)(1)) may be appropriated for purposes of subsection (d) to \n     the extent provided in Acts authorizing appropriations for \n     the Department of Defense. This appears to provide another \n     method to make funds in the DMA available for obligation in \n     addition to reprogramming.\n       Section 2221(h) would require the Secretary of Defense to \n     exercise his authority under this section through the \n     Undersecretary of Defense (Comptroller). If the intent is to \n     allow the Secretary to delegate this authority it is \n     unnecessary. Sufficient authority already exists for such a \n     delegation.\n       There is no sunset date for the DMA.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I join Senator Glenn in offering an \namendment to Section 1003 of the bill.\n  Section 1003 establishes a new account at the Department of Defense \n[DOD].\n  The new account is called the ``Defense Modernization Account.''\n  When I was first told about the Defense Modernization Account, I was \nvery concerned.\n  The alarm bells went off.\n  Right away, I thought I could see another slush fund like the \ninfamous $50 billion M accounts in the making.\n  Subsection (B)(3) is what really set me off.\n  This is what it says:\n\n       Amounts credited to the Defense Modernization Account shall \n     remain available until expended.\n\n  To me that sounds like a permit to open a laundry operation to break \ndown the integrity of appropriations.\n  That sounds like another honey pot where unlimited amounts of no-year \nmoney could be stashed for a rainy day.\n  Like the M accounts, I fear this money could be used to cover cost \noverruns and other unauthorized projects beyond the purview of \nCongress.\n  Clearly, this is not the intended purpose of section 1003.\n  But in my mind, it is a potential problem. Bureaucrats at the \nPentagon might abuse the new authority.\n  I also think section 1003 may be inconsistent with various parts of \ntitle 31 of the United States Code and most particularly the M account \nreform law enacted in November 1990.\n  I am afraid that section 1003 might be used to undermine strict \nprocedures for closing appropriation accounts that were established by \nthe M account reform law.\n  That law set up expired accounts.\n  When the period of availability of an appropriation ends--as fixed by \nannual appropriation bills, those moneys are placed in an expired \naccount--where they remain for 5 years.\n  While in the expired accounts, the fiscal year and appropriation \naccount identity must be maintained.\n  At the end of 5 years, accounts must be closed and all remaining \nbalances are canceled.\n  It is important to maintain the integrity of appropriation accounts.\n  And it is important to respect the period of availability set in the \nappropriations bills.\n  But my concerns are not incompatible with the purpose of the Defense \nModernization Account.\n  The Defense Modernization Account is supposed to encourage the \nDefense Department to save money and to use savings to meet critical \nmodernization shortfalls.\n  The periods of availability in expired accounts plus the availability \nprovided in annual appropriations bills means that procurement moneys--\nthe primary focus of section 1003--are available for 8 years or more.\n  That's more than enough time to identify savings and reallocate them \ninto top priority modernization programs--with congressional approval.\n  Senator Glenn has crafted an amendment that addresses all of my \nconcerns.\n  His amendment brings the Defense Modernization Account into line with \ncurrent law.\n  Above all, his amendment protects the integrity of the appropriations \naccounts and all moneys involved.\n  I thank Senator Glenn for making such an important contribution to \nfinancial management at the Pentagon.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/07/senate-section/article/S11732-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I have a unanimous-consent request that \nhas been cleared on both sides. I ask unanimous consent that only \ndebate be in order on the welfare bill, H.R. 4, until the hour of 3 \no'clock p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, ``The lessons of history, confirmed by \nthe evidence immediately before me, show conclusively that continued \ndependence upon relief induces a spiritual and moral disintegration, \nfundamentally destructive to the national fiber. To dole out relief in \nthis way is to administer a narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human \nspirit. It is inimical to the dictates of sound policy. It is a \nviolation of the traditions of America.''\n  So spoke Franklin Roosevelt in his second annual message January 4, \n1935, the year that welfare, as we currently refer to it, was passed. \nAs a matter of fact, we are almost 60 years to the day. One more week \nand we would be there. August 14, 1935, we passed the Social Security \nAct.\n  The act had two components. One was Social Security pensions and the \nother was welfare for widows and orphans. Both of the above, the \npensions and the welfare for widows and orphans, were intended to cover \nreally the same group of people at that time, in 1935. But they were \ncovered for different reasons.\n  Social Security, the pension, was to be yours, of course, if you \nworked until age 65 and collected a pension for the rest of your life. \nBut support for widows and orphans, enacted in the same bill, was to be \nyours if the breadwinner died.\n  This was done in 1935, Mr. President. In most cases in those days, \nwomen did not work outside of the home for money. They stayed home, and \nthey raised the children. The breadwinner was normally a man.\n  So the Social Security Act said, all right, if the man works and he \nworks until he is 65 and he retires, he gets a pension, and with the \npension he will still be able to take care of his wife; his children by \nthat time presumably would have been grown and off working on their \nown. If by chance, however, the breadwinner died before 65, then who \nwas left to support the widow and the children? For that purpose, in \nthe same act as Social Security, we passed what we now call Aid to \nFamilies With Dependent Children. We then simply called it welfare. It \nwas presumed that the widow would have no more children unless she \nremarried, in which case she would not need welfare support any more. \nAnd in those days, almost all welfare, that is, as we now call it, AFDC \n[Aid to Families With Dependent Children], over 90 percent of welfare \nwent to widows and orphans.\n  It was not until 1939 that what we call survivor coverage was added \nto Social Security. And we now said if the breadwinner--and this was \nstill presumed to be the man--died prior to age 65, and if the \nbreadwinner had a widow with children, the widow would get 75 percent \nof the pension benefits that the breadwinner would have gotten had he \nlived until 65 and in addition got 75 percent for each child that she \nhad up to a capped amount. You could not have 20 children and get 75 \npercent each, but most people do not have 20 children.\n  I emphasize again, in 1935 we passed the Social Security Act. It has \na pension part and a welfare part. And the two were really separated.\n  Then in 1939, 4 years later, we added this survivors coverage to \nSocial Security, and an interesting thing happened after we added it. \nBecause by and large the survivors pension to the widow and the \nchildren under Social Security was larger than welfare, and gradually \nfrom 1939 on, first as more people worked in the system and then as we \nadded by statute more and more people to the system and covered more \nand more people--I think probably the biggest single coverage expansion \ncoming in 1953 or 1954 under President Eisenhower--by the time we had \ngotten to 1960, most people were covered by Social Security, and \ntherefore had Social Security survivor benefits for widows and \nchildren.\n  So the original purpose of welfare, to provide for the widows and the \norphans, was supplanted by Social Security. And from 1960 onward, maybe \n1970 onward, in a rapidly accelerating pace, welfare, Aid to Families \nWith Dependent Children as we now call it, started tilting toward the \nsupport of unwed mothers and children who had never had a breadwinner \nin the house.\n  This was not a substitute for the deceased husband. For the first \ntime, we began to see the welfare system turn toward a different \nconcept from that upon which it was founded. The concept upon which it \nwas founded was, if the breadwinner dies, there is money for the widow \nand the child.\n  As Social Security replaced and supplanted welfare, therefore, I \nsometimes wonder--I do not really say this with any assuredness--but I \nsometimes wonder if the bureaucracy that administered the old welfare \nsystem thought to itself, ``We will soon be out of a job,'' Social \nSecurity having taken over the job, and, ``We need to find some other \nfunction.''\n  It happens in private enterprise all the time. A classic example, of \ncourse, would be the March of Dimes. Franklin Roosevelt started the \nMarch of Dimes. We eradicated polio, and the need for the March of \nDimes could have gone out of existence. If you look at it in the phone \nbook, it is now referred to as the March of Dimes, Birth Defects. The \norganization--I do not mean this any way critically--needed another \ncause after our having successfully conquered polio. I do not say this \nis what happened with the welfare bureaucracy from 1960, and certainly \n1970 onward. But instead of welfare now being emergency financial \nsupport for an absent, deceased breadwinner, it began to become a \nlifetime support system for somebody that never had a breadwinner.\n  Then, unfortunately, it became not just a lifetime support system, \nbut a generational support system of a woman, then a child, and then \nthe child's child, and then the child's child's child, all on welfare. \nAnd, therefore, what we could presume at the start with welfare, we \ncould no longer presume from--I will just pick the date--1960 onward.\n  When we gave money in 1935, 1937, 1938, and on up until Social \nSecurity took over the principal function of survivors' benefits, we \nwere presuming, one, the woman would have no more children, or if she \ngot married she may have more children but she would marry a \nbreadwinner and be off welfare, and, two, if it was a widow's pension \nwith a child, the child grew up and the woman had her pension until she \ndied. And society could humanely justify and support that, because we \nknew that this was not going to be massive in cost. Most breadwinners \ndo not die. And we knew that, as a matter of conscience and humanity, \nwe could afford it.\n  But as we got into a situation where we were looking at lifetime \nsupport or generational support, we had to attempt to shift welfare \nfrom emergency support because the breadwinner died to an effort to \nteach and train people to get off of welfare. We did not intend welfare \nas a lifetime and generational support system.\n  So for a quarter of a century, the Federal Government has tinkered \nand tried to remedy the problem of work. Mr. President, the Federal \nGovernment has failed. It has not worked. Welfare, as the Federal \nGovernment hoped it would work, would be a trampoline. People would \nspring back to work. Instead of a trampoline it has become a hammock. \nAnd it is not working at all.\n  Let me ask you, Mr. President, has it failed because we have not \nspent enough money? This is often the argument. ``All we need is a bit \nmore money and we could take care of the problem.''\n  Mr. President, I do not know how much ``a bit more'' is, but I do \nknow that we have spent an increasing amount of money on welfare by any \nmeasure over the last half century. If we hoped that by spending more \nwe would reduce the welfare caseload and get people off of welfare, we \nhave failed. The Social Security Administration puts out a publication \nannually on what they define public aid. The Social Security \nAdministration takes the various programs that we might generically \ncall aid to the poor, not just aid to families with dependent children, \nbut all the programs--Medicaid, food \n\n[[Page S 11737]]\nstamps, anything that would go to the poor--and have added up how much \nwe spend. They have done it using what we call constant dollars, \ncurrent dollars, and per capita dollars. I will define what I mean by \nthese.\n  ``Current dollars'' means what you spend today. It does not \nnecessarily mean a dollar of the same value. Let us say you spend $100 \non welfare today, and $100 will buy you a certain basket full of \ngroceries. Let us say you have 100 percent inflation, and in order to \nbuy the same basket of groceries the next year, you would need $200. So \nwe spend $200 on welfare. That is called current dollar spending. \nBasically, it is just what we spend now and takes no account of \ninflation. The $200 does not buy you any more than the $100 did before \nthe 100 percent inflation. That is one way to measure things.\n  If you take all of the programs that Social Security counts as public \naid in terms of current dollars, in 1947 we spent $2 billion in this \ncountry, including what the States spent--$2 billion. We now spend $180 \nbillion on roughly the same programs. Some programs have dropped by the \nwayside and others have been added, but on balance it's roughly the \nsame types of programs.\n  A better test is what we call constant dollars. You assume that the \nvalue of the dollar has never changed, there has been no inflation. You \nadjust the spending backwards so you know what you would have spent \nbased on today's dollars as if there were no inflation for 50 years. On \na constant dollar basis, in 1947 we spent $10 billion, not $2 billion \nbut $10 billion. Today it is $180 billion. We have gone in uninflated \ndollars from $10 billion to $180 billion.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  (Mr. THOMAS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. No, not until I finish, thank you.\n  Have we fixed the welfare problem? We have not even come close. Maybe \nthe best figure, though, is per capita spending. How much do we spend \nper person in this country on a constant dollar basis? In 1947, we \nspent $70 per person in this country; in 1991, which is the last year \nwe have figures for, we spent $713 per person. This assumes the dollar \nhas never been inflated. The $70 has risen to $713, and the welfare \nproblem is getting worse.\n  Last figure. What percent of our total gross domestic product do we \nspend on what Social Security calls public aid? In 1947, 0.7 percent of \nour entire gross domestic product of all the goods and services in this \ncountry was spent on public aid. We now spend over 3 percent.\n  So by any measure of money we have spent on welfare, we have spent it \nin spades. We have doubled and redoubled and redoubled and redoubled \nand redoubled the money we have spent on welfare. I would suggest, Mr. \nPresident, it has not solved the problem.\n  Next, has it failed then because of insufficient regulation? I have \nhere in my hand the 1935 section of the Social Security Act for \nwelfare. It is about two and a quarter pages long. That is it. That was \nthe welfare law. There were no regulations. There was a little pamphlet \nthat could not have exceeded 30 pages that sort of explained what this \ntwo and a quarter pages of law meant.\n  You know what we have today? Let me show you this. This is what an \nOregon caseworker has to go through to make sure that they are meeting \nthe eligibility standards of a potential recipient.\n This is not for all of welfare. This is only for welfare eligibility, \nnot the administration of the program once you are on it. This is what \nwe have come to.\n\n  Do you wonder why the States are asking us to give them a block grant \nand saying, ``Let us try it.'' Can you imagine what it is like for a \ncaseworker, who is a decent person who would like to help somebody, who \nwould like to spend the bulk of his or her time working person to \nperson with people who are deprived and genuinely entitled to welfare? \nThat is what this caseworker would like to do. The caseworker does not \nwant to spend time reading these kinds of regulations and filling out \nforms to make sure that what they are doing comports with the Federal \nregulations which are equally thick. And that is what we have come to \nyear by year, year by year, year by year.\n  There was a wonderful example yesterday. It is unrelated to welfare. \nIt involves the Drug Enforcement Administration. This tells you the \nfolly of federal rules.\n  Portland has a drug-sniffing pig. It is a Vietnamese pot-bellied pig, \nand it can sniff out drugs better than a dog and it is cheaper than a \ndog. Here is the picture of Harley. People keep these things for pets.\n  The Portland police bureau applied to the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration for funds for Harley and the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration said, ``No, only dogs, not pigs.''\n  The Portland police bureau said, ``But the pig can smell better, the \npig is cheaper.''\n  ``No, only dogs.''\n  We finally got them to admit that the pig was all right. This is the \nkind of thing that States have to go through to do perfectly normal \nthings.\n  I realize we are not all used to drug-sniffing pigs, but they work. \nWe ought to let States try it.\n  Here is the best statement I could find. This is from Duncan Wyse, \nwho is the former executive director of the Oregon Progress Board \nmonitoring welfare. This is his statement. Oregon comes very close to \nbeing the best, probably the best State, in terms of trying innovative \nwelfare and Medicaid approaches. It has been like pulling teeth to get \nthe Federal Government to give us waivers and to cooperate. This is \nwhat Duncan Wyse says:\n\n       Almost all of the Oregon option undertakings require the \n     use of Federal funds and, in many cases, the waiver of \n     Federal rules and restrictions on how the money is used. We \n     need the Federal Government as a partner. But Federal \n     programs that provide money tend to be so severely \n     prescriptive and riddled with redtape that stifles \n     innovation. In the biggest area of Federal aid--welfare--at \n     least 20 percent of our administrative time and money costs \n     have been spent on Federal paperwork.\n\n  Twenty percent is spent on Federal paperwork. When people say, what \nhappens if we give welfare to the State, will the State be able to \nadminister it well and compassionately, to begin with, Oregon can save \n20 percent off the top if they do not have to cross every ``t'' and dot \nevery ``i'' of the Federal regulations.\n  So where are we after 60 years, 60 years this year, of Federal \nwelfare almost divided in two with the dividing line coming maybe 1960, \nmaybe 1970 when it moved from widows and orphans as survivors of the \ndeceased breadwinner to what welfare as we know it now? I thought \nSenator Carol Moseley-Braun from Illinois phrased it best at the \nFinance Committee markup on May 24, 1995: ``In this $7 trillion \neconomy, we still have 40 million people living in poverty; some 14 \nmillion of those people are in the welfare system in the States and 9 \nmillion of those people are children.''\n  Mr. President, that is welfare as we know it. This is the welfare as \nwe know it that President Clinton has said he wants to end. This is \nwelfare as we know it that has been fostered, foisted, and directed by \nthe Federal Government. Do we have any reason to assume after 60 years \nof toying and tinkering with the system that the Federal Government \nwill do any better if we tweak it here, twist it there and hope that \nthis beast will fly? It is like a hippopotamus, Mr. President. No \nmatter how long you make his ears or how long you screw up its tail, it \nis not going to fly.\n  Every now and then, you run across a little pamphlet. I say to \nSenator Moynihan, this was written 20 years ago, ``To Empower People--\nThe Role of Mediating Structures in Public Policy.'' Jack Kemp would \nlike the title.\n  I mention Senator Moynihan because almost 20 years ago--he came to \nthe Senate in 1976, so it is not quite 20 years ago--he and I tried to \nget tuition tax credits for parochial, private school students. I think \nwe would have settled for vouchers if we could get vouchers.\n  This book--book is the wrong word, pamphlet is better--is only 42 \npages long. I do not know the two gentlemen who wrote it, but I was \nintrigued with their opening page statement:\n\n       Two seemingly contradictory tendencies are evident in \n     current thinking about public policy in America.\n\n  Do not forget, this is 1977.\n\n       First, there is a continuing desire for the services \n     provided by the modern welfare state. * * * The second \n     tendency is one of strong animus toward Government \n     bureaucracy and bigness as such. * * * We suggest the modern \n     welfare state is here to stay, indeed that it ought to expand \n     the benefits it \n\n[[Page S 11738]]\n     provides--but that alternative mechanisms are possible to provide \n     welfare state services.\n\n  There are a number of us who would quarrel with whether or not we \nwant to expand the services or not. What I was intrigued with was the \nauthors' suggestion. They almost bypass States and local governments. \nWhat they refer to as the role of mediating structures in public policy \nthey define as neighborhood, family, church and voluntary associations. \nThey go through what could be done if we were willing to attempt to \nadminister our welfare programs through these organizations, and they \nhave any number of quotes. I am not going to quote them all, but there \nis one I find interesting:\n\n       If a policy furthers a legitimate secular purpose, it is a \n     matter of legal indifference whether or not that policy \n     employs religious institutions.\n\n  How many of us have been to a Salvation Army workshop or Goodwill \nworkshop, or any of the sheltered workshops where private charities are \ndoing a sensational job beyond anything that we seem to be capable of \ndoing? And yet, in many of these areas, we have run up against the \nargument, ``Well, it's a religious institution.''\n  Mr. President, the time has come when institutions should not be \nprohibited from trying to help us, the Government, solve our welfare \nproblems simply because they have a cross on the wall or a menorah in \nthe hall. That does not disqualify some of the most extraordinary \norganizations in America from being able to help.\n  Lastly, and then I will go on to the bill itself, I will quote just \nvery briefly from a speech that I made also in the same year, 1977, to \nan annual Republican conference in Oregon called the Dorchester \nConference,\n in which I was attempting to delineate major differences between \nparties. I said I do not find overwhelming differences on foreign \npolicy or on transportation, or on a number of areas, but I said there \nwere two where they were significant differences.\n\n  One was in the providing of social services. And, on average--\nspeaking generically because it is not of every Republican or every \nDemocrat, but on average--Democrats would prefer that Government rather \nthan private entities--be that business or religious entities, \nneighborhood associations, or anything else--deliver those services, \nwhereas Republicans prefer private entities to deliver the services. \nThe other was the feeling that if government had to deliver the \nservices, the Democrats would prefer that the Federal Government did \nit. Republicans would prefer that State and local government did it. I \nam not sure that, generically, those two differences--Government versus \nprivate sector--and in the private sector, I include all kinds of \nnonprofit charities, let alone business--and central Government versus \nState and local government--have changed.\n  In that March 5, 1977, speech, I said:\n\n       In considering this difference, we first must get over our \n     hangup about which government the taxpayers' money belongs to \n     --local, State, or Federal. The money does not belong to any \n     government. It is the taxpayers' money, and government--be it \n     local, State, or Federal--simply holds it in trust for a time \n     after collection and before disbursement. The argument that \n     money collected by the Federal Government is Federal money \n     and, therefore, the Federal Government has not only a right \n     but a duty to say how it is spent is poppycock. But even \n     assuming the Federal Government does have a right to say how \n     it should be spent, there is nothing obtuse about saying that \n     the Federal Government policy on spending money will be: Give \n     it back to the State and local governments with minimal \n     strings. Let them spend it as they like. We don't need dozens \n     of housing, health, urban, and other kinds of programs, let \n     alone 50 to 100 categorical grant education programs. If a \n     local government doesn't know better whether it needs a park \n     block or a fire engine or a day care center or a school \n     librarian, then how can those in Washington, DC, possibly \n     know better?\n\n  I want to get to the outline of the bill now, Mr. President. I want \nto emphasize once more what I just said and what Professors Berger and \nNeuhaus would say. In essence, we are saying that you cannot run this \ncountry well from Washington, DC. It is interesting that we are finding \nthe same philosophy existing in some of the major businesses of this \ncountry. They realize they can no longer run their business well from \ncorporate headquarters. Businesses are devolving, giving regional \nmanagers more authority than they ever had, giving plants more \nauthority to organize than they ever had. You are seeing this \ndevolution outward from the center in all areas of this country except \nthe Federal Government.\n  The Federal Government has preempted one of the best sources of \nraising money and that source is, of course, the income tax. Some \nStates have high income taxes. My State is one that has a high income \ntax as compared to other States. One of the reasons we have a high \nincome tax is because we have no sales tax in Oregon. All States are \npikers in comparison to the amount of money the Federal Government gets \nfrom the income tax. It is a progressive source of revenue from \neverybody, and we collect most of it.\n  There is nothing wrong with our saying we want to see if we can solve \nthis welfare system. ``We,'' being collectively the States, the local \ngovernments, Salvation Army, and the Catholic Church. We want to see if \ncollectively we can solve this problem. We have failed to solve the \nproblem since we first got into this area in 1935, and we have \nprogressively failed in the last quarter of a century. We have \ngeometrically failed.\n  Is there a possibility--just a scintilla of a possibility--that State \nand local governments, if we let them experiment and innovate, might \ncome up with solutions that we have been incapable of thinking of, or \nif we have been able to think of them, for whatever reason we were \nincapable of administering and achieving? That, in essence, is what the \nbill before us today attempts to do.\n  First, I will describe the bill's provisions on what we call welfare, \naid to families with dependent children. This bill has a number of \nsections to it of which this is one.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for one question?\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Not until I finish. Thank you.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I hope later on we will have time for questions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon has the floor.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, AFDC or welfare, as most people call it, \nis a section of this bill. I am going to take it section by section, \nbut I will take this one first.\n  The bill takes the seven AFDC programs--they are, one, cash \nassistance; two, administration of the program; three, the so-called \nJOBS Program; four, emergency assistance; five, child care for the JOBS \nProgram; six, child care for transition to work; seven, child care for \nat-risk families--we take those seven programs and consolidate them \ninto one program called a block. We say to the States, we will \neliminate these programs as we now know them, and we will give you the \nmoney instead, and you must spend this money on the needy, not airport \ntarmacs, or rebuilding piers for their port, but to spend it on the \nneedy as you see fit.\n  Here you have a battle, a philosophical battle, because we have put \nsome strings on this bill. The ultimate would be to say to the States, \nhere is the money, you spend it on welfare as you want to define it. \nBut because we did not want to be that broad and did not know what they \nwanted to do, there have been two very tough restrictions put in the \nbill.\n  The first one is work. Welfare recipients must go to work. They must \ngo to work no later than after they have been on welfare for 2 years. \nBut the States can make that much shorter if they want. If the State \ndetermines that somebody is work ready, then they have to go to work \nthen.\n  The States have to have 50 percent of their total number of adults \nwho are on welfare in work by the year 2000. Today, we do not even \napproach that. On occasion, people will give you a percentage that \nseems quite high, but that is because, under the present law, there are \nall kinds of exceptions to those who do not have to work at all. So say \nyou had 1,000 people on welfare, but you say 200 do not have to work \nbecause they have a child under 3; another 100 do not have to work \nbecause they are disabled; and another 100 for another reason. You get \ndown to 500, and then you say of the 500, 250 are working. That is 50 \npercent. Well, that is 50 percent of 500. It is 25 percent of a \nthousand. This bill says by the year 2000, 50 percent of what \ncaseworkers would call your adult caseload, your welfare caseload, must \nbe working. Second, we say that \n\n[[Page S 11739]]\nyou can only be on welfare for a maximum of 5 years in your lifetime, \ncumulative period, total. You run out the 5 years, it is zip, finito, \ngone. Those are the two major strings that we put into this bill.\n  The States and the Governors, by and large, find this acceptable, but \nthere are some Governors who do not agree with what we have done. Most \nlike what we have done because we have said to the States, this is no \nlonger a Federal entitlement program as we call the words \n``entitlement,'' which means we determine who is eligible for welfare.\n  We are saying to the States, ``Here's the money; you determine who is \neligible, but you have to put a certain percentage of those you \ndetermine as welfare-eligible to work. That is basically all we are \nrequiring of you.'' They cannot be on welfare for more than 5 years. \nThat is the broad outline of the welfare portion of the bill.\n  We have a second section called SSI, supplementary security income. I \ndo not find a great deal of dissent with what we have done to SSI. This \nis another welfare program, often for the elderly, but not always for \nthe elderly. We have said that there will be three categories that will \nno longer be eligible. SSI is totally a Federal program. No State money \nand no State administration is involved in this at all. The bill says \nthat you will no longer be eligible if you are disabled because of a \ndrug addiction or an alcoholism addiction. You may be an alcoholic or a \ndrug addict, and you may be eligible for this program for other \nreasons, but you are no longer going to be eligible solely for drug \naddiction or alcoholism. Noncitizens will no longer be \neligible unless they do work and pay taxes for specified periods of \ntime, and children with modest disabilities will no longer be eligible. \nI do not find overwhelming argument with the SSI provision of the bill.\n  The third part of the bill is child support enforcement. Here we have \nstrengthened the Federal role, and the States agree. By ``child support \nenforcement,'' we are talking about custody orders. The child's parent \nis ordered to pay $100 a month, $500 a month, $1,000 a month, and the \nparent moves to another State. The parent may not even disguise their \nname, but it is almost impossible to enforce child support orders \nbetween States. It costs more than it is worth. This particular \nprovision of the bill significantly beefs up the interstate, between-\nState, enforcement of child support.\n  Next is food stamps. This part of the bill is somewhat controversial. \nI have to give great credit to the Agriculture Committee. They came \nforth with reforms of the program in their committee that were \nextraordinary in terms of both the reforms and saving money. The bill \nincludes all of their reforms.\n  We have added a particular wrinkle to food stamps. We have given \nStates the choice of taking a block grant for food stamps. The way food \nstamps work now is that the Federal Government determines if you are \neligible, then you get food stamps and take them to the grocery store \nfor groceries. You give the grocer food stamps, you receive groceries, \nand the grocer turns the food stamps in to the Federal Government, and \nwe pay the grocer money.\n  Some States under experimental programs with waivers are doing what \nis known as cashing out food stamps. In some cases they are doing it \nstatewide, and in some cases only in counties. What they do is take the \nmoney that a recipient would otherwise give for food stamps, use it as \na subsidy with an employer, and put the person to work. Almost \ninvariably the person has more money from working than they get from \nthe food stamps and welfare. The food stamp money is used as a wage \nsubsidy. You can only do that now if you get a waiver from the Federal \nGovernment. This bill would make it easier for States to do this.\n  As I said, the bill also gives States the option to take a block \ngrant for food stamps. We have put a limitation in it. I would go \nfurther and say the States can cash out totally and use the money as \nthey see fit. I recognize there are not the votes to go this far. \nInstead, this bill allows States to cash out food stamps, but at least \n75 percent of the money must be used for food for the poor and the \nremaining 25 percent can be used for wage-subsidy programs which, if we \nare trying to get people off of welfare and into work, probably are a \nbetter use of the money than anything else that we might suggest.\n  On the child nutrition programs and the commodity distribution \nprograms, we have included in the bill the Agriculture Committee \nreforms exactly as they reported them without change. They are good \nreforms. I think they are relatively noncontroversial reforms.\n  We have taken from the Labor Committee, Senator Kassebaum's \ncommittee, her child care and development block grants. She \nconsolidates three Labor Committee child care programs into a single \nprogram, and we have put it in this bill with a minor modification. We \nhave also included another bill that the Labor Committee reported which \ntakes 90 different job training and education programs and consolidates \nthem into one block.\n  Then we have taken suggestions on housing with relatively modest \nchanges in rent subsidy eligibility rules and housing assistance rules. \nAgain, I think there is no controversy. Those provisions came \nprincipally from the Banking Committee.\n  Then we have changed the rules on noncitizens for what are called \nFederal means-tested programs. Means-tested programs are those that \ndetermine eligibility based on how much income and money you have. If \nyour income and resources exceed a certain level, you can not qualify \nfor the program. The bill provides a uniform rule for noncitizens who \napply for Federal means-tested programs. I believe there is some \ncontroversy about this provision in the bill.\n  But, Mr. President, I think the overwhelming bulk of the controversy \nfalls in two or three areas of the bill and not most of the latter ones \nI talked about.\n  Then lastly, we have called for a reduction of 30 percent in Federal \nemployees who administer the AFDC welfare programs and the work force \njob training programs.\n  Mr. President, that is it. It is not very often that we have a \ngenuinely philosophical debate in this Congress. This is a genuinely \nphilosophical debate. Do you prefer that the Federal Government \ncontinue to fund and administer the welfare programs in this country \nand the food stamp programs? If yes, in essence, you are saying you \nlike the way they are working. Or do you say, I am not happy with the \nway the welfare programs are working, and try as we might, well-\nintentioned as we may be, the Federal Government has failed to make \nthem work and we would like to let the States experiment?\n  Mr. President, the problems of the States in this country are \ndifficult. A State that has immense immigration has different problems \nthan a State that does not. A State that has a disproportionately large \nnumber of poor has a different problem than a State that does not. One \nsize does not fit all.\n  This bill, as we debate it, and as we finally vote upon it, is going \nto be a touchstone showing the difference between the parties and \nbetween those who prefer a Federal system, no matter how badly run, to \na State system which we cannot guarantee will work but I think we can \nguarantee it cannot work any worse than it is now working.\n  Is it worth a try? You bet it is.\n  Over the next 2, 3, or 4 days, or however long we debate this, keep \nin mind a few objectives: Federal versus State, and work. Those are the \nissues that we are talking about.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to continue the debate from this \nside of the aisle, but first to congratulate and, as always, to express \nappreciation to my colleague and friend, the chairman of the committee, \nfor his thoughtful, persuasive arguments--not all of which have \npersuaded me; I am sure there are those who will feel the same way--and \nin particular to thank him for citing this, I will call it a booklet, \n``To Empower People, The Role Of Mediating Structures In Public \nPolicy.'' This was the work of Peter L. Berger, who is a professor of \nsociology at Rutgers, and Richard John Neuhaus, who is the senior \neditor of World Review. He is a theologian, and a much-respected one.\n  This is a product of a research group the American Enterprise \nInstitute had started. Nathan Glazer, my colleague \n\n[[Page S 11740]]\nand friend, headed the section on welfare and social services.\n  Mr. President, once again I am proud and happy to report that this \nimportant social analysis was sponsored by the National Endowment for \nthe Humanities. I cannot think of a more trenchant argument for \nsecuring its future and that of other such matters.\n  I thank my friend for having brought it to our attention. It is, \ncurious--what they argue is the extension of the analysis by Professor \nPutnam of those communities in Italy over the last 700 years that have \nbeen successful and those that have not, and the degree to which \nempowering activities locally, a choral society in Tuscany or a \nvolunteer fire department, characterized----\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Or a local soccer team. I am indebted to the Senator \nfor calling to my attention this book by Professor Putnam in which he \nstudied all the provinces of Italy which had identical charters given \nto them in 1920. Professor Putnam discovered that the provinces \ngoverned themselves differently, although the charters were identical. \nAnd after extensive research and evaluation, Professor Putnam concluded \nthat local and civic traditions was responsible for most of the \ndifferences and the charter did not make much difference at all. And \nthe best example we have of that is the Soviet constitution, which \nhardly had a peer in the world as a Constitution.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. As a youth in New York City, I had more than one \noccasion to study the Soviet Constitution and see that this, obviously, \nhad to be the finest society on Earth because it had the best \nConstitution.\n  I will try to argue that the outcomes of our efforts with dependent \nchildren and families will, in fact, depend less on statute and more \nupon the local energies and enterprise which either rise to the effort \nor do not. I will argue that in some cases we see there are dimensions \nof size that overwhelm individual effort. And I will argue that we did \nvery well in 1988. We are beginning to see results with exactly this \ntheory in mind.\n  With those facts in mind, on May 18 I introduced the Family Support \nAct of 1995, a bill ``to enable each State to assist applicants and \nrecipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children in providing for \nthe economic well-being of their children, to allow States to test new \nways to improve the welfare system, and for other purposes.''\n  The measure was referred to the Finance Committee. It was taken up on \nMay 26, and failed on a 12 to 8 vote, whereupon the committee, by a \nsimilar 12 to 8 vote, adopted the predecessor of the Work Opportunity \nAct of 1995, the bill which Senator Dole has introduced as a \nsubstitute.\n  But, first, let me describe the thinking behind an earlier, quite \nsignificant revision of welfare law, the Family Support Act of 1988, \nbasic legislation which I propose now we build on.\n  In his State of the Union Address in February 1987, President Reagan \npledged his support for what he called ``a new national welfare \nstrategy.'' Democrats and Republicans in Congress saw a window of \nopportunity to redefine our welfare system, to replace the half-\ncentury-old AFDC Program with a program designed for the social \nrealities of the last part of the 20th century.\n  The Governors led the way. Governor Clinton, chairman of the National \nGovernors Association, and then Gov. Michael Castle, of Delaware--now \nRepresentative Castle--was chairman of the Welfare Prevention Task \nForce, a bipartisan effort, and they presented the Governors' concerns: \nimprove enforcement of parental child support obligations; permit \nflexible State-designed employment programs--include remedial \neducation, training and work experience; mandate participation in such \nprograms for parents with children over age 3, and create a ``social \ncontract''--I say once again a social contract--to obligate State \nagencies to provide opportunities to become self-sufficient while also \nobligating recipients to take advantage of these opportunities.\n  The Family Support Act of 1988 sought to turn the existing welfare \nsystem on its head. And we used that term conscious of the historical \nreference. Rather than beginning with a public assistance payment that \nis supplemented with sporadic child support payments and occasional \nearned income, it placed the responsibility for supporting children \nwhere it belonged: With parents--both parents. And the focus was to be \non the long-term dependents--not the divorced woman who needs some help \nwhile she puts her life back in order, but the teenage mother who has a \nchild and is at risk of spending most of her life on the dole.\n  On September 29, 1988, just this side of 7 years ago, the Family \nSupport Act passed the Senate. We had 63 cosponsors and the vote was 96 \nto 1. It went out the door 96 to 1, a bipartisan judgment the like of \nwhich is rarely seen in this body and which, unhappily, evidently has \nnow disappeared.\n  I was the manager on our side, and I recall the atmosphere, the \nemotion. At a Rose Garden ceremony that followed were Senators Dole, \nBentsen, and Brown, Speaker Foley, Mr. Michel, and Governors Clinton \nand Castle.\n  President Reagan, on signing the bill, told the assembled company \nthat:\n\n       They and the members of the administration who worked so \n     diligently on this bill will be remembered for accomplishing \n     what many have attempted but no one has achieved in several \n     decades, a meaningful redirection of our welfare system.\n\n  It may seem unimaginable to us today. But the Family Support Act of \n1988 was not a partisan political measure. Democrats and Republicans \nalike joined in near unanimity to do what needed doing, a good half a \ncentury into the experience of what we have called welfare under the \nSocial Security Act of 1935, a history the chairman has set forth very \nably and very accurately.\n  The Governors had asked for flexibility in designing State programs \nto help poor parents overcome their dependence on public assistance, \nand they got it. With the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Program, \nJOBS, States were free to offer a variety of education, training and \nwork activities. States were directed to involve the private sector in \ndesigning their JOBS Programs and to coordinate with other work-related \nprograms, such as the Job Training Partnership Act.\n  The Family Support Act brought the statute in line with a new \nreality. Again, as the chairman has said, the original Social Security \nAct of 1935, adopted in the midst of the Depression, provided aid to \ndependent children wherein the Federal Government took over the widows \npensions that had been adopted in almost half the States by this point. \nThose States were under severe economic stress in the Great Depression. \nThe Federal Government assumed the responsibility for children.\n  In 1939, the mother of the children was included as well. So it \nbecame Aid to Families With Dependent Children, and it was expected to \nbe a bridge until widows with their children were entitled to old age \nand survivors insurance, and, indeed, it was a bridge in the time that \nsurvivors insurance matured.\n  Then something new happened. In 1960's, Samuel H. Preston, in his \naddress to the American Demographic Association in 1964, put it that \n``an earthquake shuddered through the American family--an earthquake \nshuddered through the American family.'' Family structure began to \nchange. Out-of-wedlock births surged.\n  We now have a ratio of births of children in single-parent families \nthat has reached an estimated 33 percent. By 1992--I have a table here. \nCan I bring that over?\n  Mr. President, this will give you some sense of what we are dealing \nwith. These are the ratios in the 20 largest cities in the country: \nBaltimore, 61 percent; Boston, 48; Chicago, 56; Columbus, 41; the \nDistrict of Columbia, 70; Indianapolis, 40; Milwaukee, 58; New York, \n46; Phoenix, 42; San Antonio, 20.\n  These are numbers unknown to social conditions of the north, west, \neast, or southern man or woman. So far as I know it is without \nprecedent in human experience. I have said this before and have been \nsaying it for 15 or 20 years. And no one has ever contradicted this.\n  Early in the century, an anthropologist named Malinowski, who \npracticed and worked and lived in London, set forth the universal law \nof human society, which is that in any society, every society that has \never been known, ever examined, ever studied, ever recorded, all \nchildren knew who their male parent was. That was the first law of \nanthropology. And everyone agreed. Once it was said, it was obvious.\n  It no longer is, Mr. President. The ratios, Baltimore is 61 percent, \nDetroit 72 \n\n[[Page S 11741]]\npercent. They are without precedent. And the thing to know is that we \nare not alone in this. Something like the same phenomenon has overtaken \nthe United Kingdom, France, and Canada. We find it difficult to explain \nwhat has happened here. But they find it difficult to explain what has \nhappened there. What we cannot do is deny the reality.\n  We think this increase is largely a matter of demography.\n  In the 1950's, the child-bearing population was flat or even declined \na bit.\n  Then starting in 1989, the caseload began to rise.\n  What I am trying to say, Mr. President, is that this obviously has \nled to increases in the Aid to Families Dependent Children Program of \nlate. In the aftermath of our 1988 legislation, the number of children \non the AFDC rolls has gone up again. It went from 3.5 million cases to \nalmost 5 million in 4 years. You can see this right here. Here is where \nwe passed the bill. Then, seemingly, after we passed the bill, things \nget out of control again.\n  You have to start this discussion, if it is going to be in any way \nhonest and open, with acknowledging the fact that if anyone had \nsupposed in 1988 the number of AFDC cases would go down--and we never \nsaid that, but if anyone thought that might happen--they would have \nbeen wrong. Indeed, they went up. We think we know why they went up.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has established that about 60 percent \nof the increase is simply the increase in the number of single-parent \nfamilies. The demography of persons in that population, the number of \npeople coming into the reproduction ages, suddenly bumped up. It will \nhappen. It happens all the time--up, flat, up, and sometimes indeed \ndeclining, as was the case in late 1930's or late 1940's.\n  The thing is, we know very little about this. We know a certain \namount about the duration of benefits. More than a quarter of new \nentrants onto the AFDC rolls remain there less than a year. Almost half \nare gone in 2 years. Data are elusive. The Federal Government has never \ncollected systematic time series data on this information. And we would \ndo well to remind ourselves of the maxim that you should never really \ndo anything about a problem until you first learn to understand it.\n  Annual unemployment rates did not appear in the United States until \n1948. We used to take the unemployment rate from the census. We took it \nin April 1930 and April 1940, and there was no Great Depression. We \nlearned sampling and we did it by counting everybody. We learned to \nsample and get numbers. It was a development in the late 1930's and \nmatured in the early or mid-forties.\n  We have not done this at all with respect to welfare dependency \nbecause we have not seen it, in part, as the problem it has become. By \n1948, we knew unemployment was a problem.\n  I might say last year, in 1994, Congress enacted the Welfare \nIndicators Act.\n  It is a measure I had been seeking for many years, an annual report \ncomparable to the Economic Report of the President which deals with \nunemployment or employment and which has begun long-term analyses of \ntrends, disaggregating large numbers and finding significant \nsubsectors.\n  The act specifies that with respect to welfare indicators, the \nfollowing subjects be addressed: indicators of the rate and degree to \nwhich families depend on welfare income; predictors of welfare receipt; \nan assessment of the adequacy of existing data resources; and an annual \nreport of welfare indicators.\n  For the moment, Donna Pavetti at the Urban Institute has compiled \nthis distribution, one of the few things we seem to have. Note we get \nit from the Urban Institute, not from the Department of Health and \nHuman Services.\n  This chart depicts ``Distribution of Total Time on Welfare.''\n  This is important, Mr. President, because both the bills that the \ndistinguished Republican leader and the chairman of the Committee on \nFinance have introduced, the bill that our able and distinguished \nDemocratic leader has introduced, have 5-year time limits.\n  I am sorry to turn this into a statistics expose, but we are talking \nabout numbers here, and we never learned to do anything about \nunemployment until we got hold of those numbers. And the numbers are \nsimply that half the AFDC population who enter the system leave it \nwithin 24 months. We do not know who they are. There is no account \nkept. There are no samples taken. But we have a pretty good idea. These \nare mature women whose marriages have come apart, have been dissolved \nin some way or other. For them, AFDC is a form of income insurance just \nas unemployment insurance protects those persons working. They need it \nfor a while, then they need it no longer and they leave.\n  We knew this much in 1988. We said not to worry about this group. It \ntakes care of itself. You simply have a simple income insurance--as \nSocial Security is income insurance--and let them be.\n  The Manpower Demonstration Research Corp. had established with great \nclarity that you can train such folk, you can educate such folk. They \ndo not need the training or the education. They just need to get their \naffairs together, and they do.\n  On the other hand, sir, three-quarters of the recipients, adults and \nchildren, who at a given point in time are on welfare are on for more \nthan 5 years. The mean duration is 13 years. That means half below 13, \nhalf above 13. The mean is 13--12.9 it says here.\n  So let it be clear. You are putting at risk an enormous population, \nabout which we know very little in terms of what works and which we \nhave only begun to attempt to know. Three-quarters of those who are on \nthe welfare rolls at any one time are going to be there for more than 5 \nyears, and half will be there more than 13 years. That is why this is a \nsocial crisis which we had best get hold of or who would want to be \nsure of the future of this society. And that is why, sir, in this \nSenator's view, and in the view of the whole Senate, not 7 years ago \nthere was a national response.\n  The fact is that, as I said, divorce is one source of dependency and \nseparation another. These are the people up here in the first two \nlines. But there is a much greater cause, and that is nonmarital \nbirths. In the State of the Union Message of January 25, 1994, \nPresident Clinton included this passage:\n\n       We cannot renew our country when within a decade more than \n     half of our children will be born into families where there \n     is no marriage.\n\n  I repeat:\n\n       We cannot renew our country when within a decade more than \n     half of our children will be born into families where there \n     is no marriage.\n\n  To my knowledge, no President in our history has raised this issue in \na State of the Union Address, nor very possibly in any address. On the \nfollowing June 14 in Kansas City, the President unveiled a new welfare \nreform proposal and his address contained this passage.\n  We also have to face the fact that we have a big welfare problem \nbecause the rate of children born out of wedlock where there was not a \nmarriage is going up dramatically. The rate of illegitimacy has \nliterally tripled since this Senator first called it to our attention \n30 years ago. At the rate we are going, unless we reverse it, within 10 \nyears more than half our children will be born in homes where there \nnever has been a marriage.\n  Unless we reverse it, within 10 years more than half our children \nwill be born in homes where there has never been a marriage.\n  These things happen, Mr. President, in a sometimes sort of random \nway. In 1993, I happened to see the nonmarital birth ratio for 1991 and \nsaid, ``You know, that looks like a straight line going back to 1970 or \nso.'' And we took it and we plotted the actual ratio. And then we saw \nwhat would be the correlation with a straight line, and as I said on \n``Face the Nation'' yesterday morning, anyone watching this, if you \nhave a daughter or a son in high school, they will explain correlations \nto you. Otherwise, you have to take it on faith. Senator Wellstone can \nhandle it, I am sure.\n  The correlation is 0.99. That means it is almost a straight line. The \nperfect correlation is 1.00. Well 0.99 does not happen in statistics. \nYou reel back. And then you say, ``Do it again; that cannot be.'' But \nthere it is. And the slope is 0.86, which is almost 1 percent a year. \nWe figure now we are almost at \n\n[[Page S 11742]]\none-third. But we figure--I say we figure because no one else figures, \nMr. President, not the Census Bureau or the National Center for Health \nStatistics.\n  None of them does this. They have avoided this. And this is where we \nhave gone. That is what avoidance will do for you. The President was \nciting that 50 percent ratio in a State of the Union Message. He got it \nin a conversation from me. In the main, Presidents have better sources \nof data. But that is how we have avoided this issue.\n  Let me show you something that ought to chill us all. What you are \nseeing here, sir, is that part of an exponential curve, when it begins \nto take off, is like a jet plane. Here we go back to 1940. In 1940, we \nhad a ratio--here again we fit a curve, and we have come up with \nsomething almost as remarkable as our straight line. I said that \ncorrelation was 0.99. This correlation is 0.98. Again, things like that \ndo not happen in statistics. But with this correlation, a slope of just \nabout 0.5 percent per year. You start out a ratio of 4 percent, and \nlike any of these curves you get very slow impact, but then it \naccumulates. Keynes referred to ``the magic of compound interest.'' You \ndid not have much. Nothing seemed to happen. Then suddenly you are \nsoaring.\n  This curve right in here, if I showed you a straight line, that is \nwhen you start going steadily upward. If you followed this curve you \nwould, in fact, be at 50 percent in the year 2003. Now, that makes me \nuneasy. It probably would make you, Mr. President, uneasy. But, sir, we \nare going to be at 40 percent within a decade. We are at 33 percent \nnow.\n  I will put it this way. If, in 1970, when we had a ratio of 10 \npercent, someone had come along and said that by 1990, they thought it \nwould be 30 percent, people would have said, ``You are loony. Are you \ncrazy?'' No. Well, we did. And the thought that we will go further and \nreach 50 percent--I do not want to say 50 percent. I just do not think \nthat is possible. I think something awful will happen in the country \nbefore we do. But we will get to 40 percent. We are not that far now. \nIf we go on at the rate we have gone the last 10 years, we will be at \n44 percent by the year 2000. It is as simple as that.\n  I want to acknowledge this work was done by Jack Fowle, a scientist \nwho was on leave from the Environmental Protection Agency. He did this \nwith a great deal of clarity and consistency, as you can see.\n  Mr. President, we have had this recent increase in the caseloads. In \nJuly 1993, the Congressional Budget Office issued a staff memorandum \nentitled ``Forecasting AFDC Caseloads With an Emphasis on Economic \nFactors.'' What they found in brief is that the increase that followed \nfrom 1989 to the third quarter of 1992 is basically due to the increase \nin single-parent families. About two-thirds is that, and the remainder \nis economic. And the economy has an effect. We begin to see that. It \nparticularly has an effect where you would expect, with AFDC-UP, which \nis aid for two-parent families which began in the 1960's. CBO found \nthat 70 percent of the increase in the two-parent family caseload \nduring the period is explained by the economic downturn.\n  That is exactly what you would predict. And it is somewhat \nreassuring. But the caseload of regular AFDC families responds to the \nchange in family structure, and little else.\n  Now, sir, what did happen even as the caseload was going up? I want \nto say that in this Senator's view, what happened was exactly what we \nhoped would happen. The States were told to experiment. The States were \ntold to innovate. The States were encouraged to think up things on \ntheir own. And they did. There is a basic fact which is that Aid to \nFamilies With Dependent Children, welfare, is not an entitlement to \nindividuals. We have allowed it to be seen as such. A lot of waivers \nand regulations accumulated at the Federal level, and people thought it \ncould be such. But it is not.\n  AFDC is an entitlement of States to have the Federal Government match \nfunds States spend on this population. The matching rate varies, but if \nWisconsin spends $1, the Federal Government will give $1, and $2 will \nbe spent on the program. But States do not have to have AFDC. As a \nmatter of fact, Wisconsin, at the end of 1997, will not have AFDC at \nall. Or a State may have AFDC, and what you pay individuals is $1 a \nmonth, $1 a day, $100 a month. It is a State option entirely. The \nnotion that it is an entitlement of individuals gets us off into \ndiscussions which I do not think are very helpful.\n  Let me see if I cannot just talk a little bit about the kinds of \nwaivers that the States have requested and have been granted by the \nFederal Government. The President, I think very properly, makes the \npoint that he has been saying yes. President Bush said yes. There are \nvarious Secretaries that are very encouraging. Look at this. Thirty-\nthree States have asked for waivers that increase the earnings \ndisregard. That means you say to a mother, ``The first $30 a month you \nearn, you do not lose any welfare benefits,'' or the first $50. This is \nencouraging people to get to work. For if you earn $1 and you lose 50 \ncents, that does not encourage work, obviously.\n  To me, a very important thing is that 31 States have asked for an \nincrease in asset accumulation. This is a subject which is painful but \nnecessary. One of the conditions we placed--and it is a Federal \ncondition--one of the conditions we placed upon receipt of AFDC \nbenefits, Federal moneys, in 1935 was that the child be a pauper--not a \npleasant word, very much not a pleasant reality. The families can have \n$1,000 in assets, plus a car worth not more than $1,500. And there are \nplaces in the country where you cannot work without a car.\n  A worker who was laid off when a plant closes is not suddenly a \npauper. I mean, there is a good car around. The house is around. There \nare some savings, some pension--not always, but normally. The welfare \ndepartment is under these rules. I have a mother in one State that will \ncome to mind--I think she was found to have secreted some $9,000 away \nin a bank account to help her daughter go to college in Connecticut.\n  They discovered it. They confiscated the money, and I do not suppose \nthey sent the mother to jail. You cannot save. If you save, you are \nbreaking the rules.\n  Another 29 States have asked to ease up on eligibility for unemployed \nparents [UP].\n  Time requirement. JOBS participation. Deny aid for failure to attend \nschool--some 24 States have been allowed to say, ``If your kid is not \nin school, you lose something.''\n  Family cap: 16 States have applied, 11 States have been given the \nwaiver, so that if you have an additional child while on welfare, you \nreceive no additional benefit.\n  Further down the list we have: Deny aid for child support \nnoncooperation, and teen parent residency requirement. Seven States \nhave applied to do what I think we are going to do this week, which is \nto say that teenage children must stay with their parents.\n  Senator Conrad has a proposal for maternity homes. Senator Packwood \nhas a provision which provides second-chance homes, if you like, for \nvery young women with children who do not themselves have a home that \nis a promising place to raise a child. I think this is a point we have \nreached agreement on. There was disagreement for a while, but now we \nare reaching agreement.\n  All this innovation and experimentation at the State level which is \nbeing carried out under current law is finally starting to show \nresults. Six weeks ago, we received the first numbers from the national \nevaluation of the Family Support Act being conducted by the Manpower \nDemonstration Research Corp. Of those placed in a program emphasizing \nrapid job entry, the number of cases dropped by 11 percentage points, \nemployment rose 8 percentage points and expenditures dropped 22 \npercentage points.\n  If you recall, Mr. President, in 1988--1987 when we introduced the \nbill--we based our bill on the findings of the Manpower Demonstration \nResearch Corp. based in New York, a very professional group trying to \nestimate what worked, what did not. Mostly nothing worked. Hence, this \nstatement. They said the results they are finding from the Family \nSupport Act programs ``exceeds the savings achieved by experimentally \nevaluated programs of the last 15 years.''\n  They have never before seen such results. Spectacular results? No. We \ndid not tell anybody to expect anything \n\n[[Page S 11743]]\nspectacular in the face of this demographic change. But real? Yes.\n  Moreover, of the two large States whose programs have been evaluated \nrigorously, California and Florida, earnings are up and caseloads down. \nIn Riverside, CA, there was a 26-percent increase in the share of AFDC \nrecipients working, a 49-percent increase in average earnings, a 15-\npercent decline in welfare outlays, all of which helped the program \nreturn to taxpayers almost $3 for every $1 spent.\n  Recently, Prof. Lawrence Mead of New York University, now visiting \nprofessor at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson Center, who has been a \nconservative critic of the welfare system, certainly, looked at the \ngrowth in the AFDC caseload between 1989 and 1993, the period during \nwhich the JOBS Program began to come into play.\n  He concluded that for every 1 percent of the caseload enrolled in \nJOBS, caseload growth was 1 percent lower, even when total caseloads \nwere going up. For every percentage point that JOBS participation grew \nduring this period, caseload growth was three-quarters of a point less. \nNot spectacular, but real and in the right direction, in the directions \nyou had hoped for.\n  Again to say, States can do what they want in the system. They ask \nfor a waiver, they get it. Just 2 months ago, George Allen, Republican \nGovernor of Virginia, announced such an effort. He called it ``the most \nsweeping and I think the most compassionate welfare plan anywhere in \nthe Nation.'' It is 2 years and you are out, and President Clinton \napproved the waiver and said he approved of the program.\n  In any event, AFDC rolls are now coming down. Over the last year, \ncaseloads have declined by 240,000 cases or 4.7 percent. It breaks out \nto 4.4 percent for the single-parent families and 9.4 percent in the \ntwo-parent families. You see that drop, Mr. President. I will say the \nold adage, if you turn the rudder on the battleship, it is a long while \nbefore you see the bow turn. I cannot prove it, but I do think we have \nseen this program taking hold.\n  Now, something we did not know, and we may have stumbled on new \ninformation--when we look at the numbers by State, where have these \ndeclines taken place? It is very important. It is a pretty rash person \nwho suggests he has learned anything about welfare, but we may have \ndone it.\n  In this period of decline, May 1994 to 1995, the decline for AFDC-R--\nwhich is what we call regular--in California and New York was zero. \nAFDC-UP was up a little bit. Not important. The two big States with a \nquarter of the caseload had no effect. There were good programs in \nRiverside, things like that, but nothing changed.\n  You go to a group of middle-sized States--Texas, Florida, \nPennsylvania, Illinois, and Ohio--AFDC down 6 percent; AFDC-UP, down 20 \npercent. We are not used to numbers like that. Mr. President, I have \nbeen with this 30 years, you do not see numbers like this.\n  Then you go further down to the many States that have small \ncaseloads--anyway, small numbers. They are down 9 percent for AFDC and \n19 percent for the AFDC-UP Program. The real problem here is the \nregular caseload, as AFDC-UP is, again, a form of unemployment \ninsurance.\n This is what matters: Zero in the big States, 6 percent in the mid-\nsized, 9 percent in the small States.\n\n  My friend, Dr. Paul Offner, who is with me on the floor today, was \nhead commissioner of welfare in Ohio and who will shortly be the head \nof the health care financing agency for the District of Columbia, would \nsay you go out to the small towns or cities in Ohio and you would go to \nthe welfare offices and a kind of culture had developed. Yes, they knew \nwho their clients were, the recipients and they knew what you might be \nable to do and they were doing it and feeling pretty good about \nthemselves.\n  In New York City, about 23 years ago, the very able and distinguished \nhead of the human resources administration with a million persons on \nwelfare and a quarter million in her employ, put on a wig and an old \ncoat, went around to four welfare offices and said she was applying for \nwelfare and they handed her papers to fill out. She was their \ncommissioner. They never once suggested that she might be interested in \ntaking a job.\n  The contrast between welfare programs in big cities and elsewhere is \nsomething worth keeping a hold of. Last spring, as my friend, the \ndistinguished chairman recalls, the Committee on Finance had a retreat \ndown in Maryland in which we talked about welfare, among other things, \nand we discussed this question of whether teenage mothers with children \nshould be required to live at home, or should receive welfare benefits \nat all. There is a movement to stop their benefits, and groups like \nCatholic Charities say do not do that, that is God's child, too.\n  One of our Members, a Senator from a Midwestern State, was back home \nand he was interested in this, so he called the State officials \ninvolved and he said, how many such cases do we have in our State? Let \nhim identify it if he chooses. Cases of teenage mothers with children, \nliving on their own? He said, yes, that is what I mean. Well, there is \nMary Ann, she lives down there. And there is Sue Mary, and there is \nAlice, and then there is Florence. The last two just moved in from, \nlike I say, West Virginia. They had four, and they knew them by name. \nIn that State they have four.\n  The population on welfare in New York City is almost as large as the \nentire population of one of those States. So you have a problem of \nscale which I do think we begin to see. I make the point, Mr. \nPresident, that we know so little. There has been so little inquiry.\n  Here I would like to make a final point on nonmarital births. Senator \nGramm, my friend with whom I was debating this matter yesterday, along \nwith a number of other Senators, notably Senator Faircloth of North \nCarolina, has raised the issue of the connection between the present \nwelfare system and the extraordinary rise of nonmarital births over the \nlast generation. I said to him yesterday privately that this certainly \nwas an issue. I said it then and I will say it again--the most \nimportant thing to know about this subject is how little we know about \nit. Candid officials within the administration will grant that for much \nof the 1960's and 1970's and into the 1980's, the subject was taboo. \nForces from the traditional left and traditional right, if such terms \nare meaningful in this context, simply did not want the matter raised.\n  A mode of denial was obviously in place. In this regard, Mr. \nPresident, may I say that the one honorable exception is the annual \nreport entitled ``Kids Count Data Book,'' published by the Annie E. \nCasey Foundation. It puts the annual laments of the other advocacy \ngroups to shame. The Annie E. Casey Foundation comes out and tells you \nwhat they found about this central fact of being a child in the United \nStates. The work is called ``The Kids Count Data Book.'' It is the \nfirst time we have had an advocacy group that could speak up and deal \nwith the reality of the problem of single parenthood.\n  However, if the argument that higher levels in welfare produce higher \nlevels of illegitimacy cannot be proved, neither can it be disproved. \nThus, the State of Texas ranks 50 in combined AFDC food stamp payments \nto welfare families, as of July of last year. At the same time, it has \nan overall illegitimacy ratio of 17.5 percent, which is half the \nnational average. States with high benefit levels have twice that \nratio.\n  For example, California had 34.3 percent, and New York had 34.8 \npercent. It would not be fair to say that the burden of proof is on \nCalifornia and New York to demonstrate that higher levels of welfare \nproduce higher levels of illegitimacy. You cannot prove it but you \ncannot dismiss it.\n  On the other hand, if Texas, with its low level of welfare support \nhas a low illegitimacy ratio, Mississippi, with equally low payment \nlevels, has the highest illegitimacy ratio. I will read some more.\n  The lowest ratio, as you might suppose, is Utah, at 15 percent, which \nis four times the 1940 ratio, but 15 percent. Texas was 17.5; Idaho, \n18.3. But now we get to South Carolina, 35.5; Arizona, 36.2; New \nMexico, 39.5; Louisiana, 40.2; Mississippi, 42.9.\n  Mr. President, we have not got a purchase on this issue yet. We know \nthat there is great variation and when there is variation, there are \nexplanations. Some would say it is the weather. Well, \n\n[[Page S 11744]]\nwe can check that out. Longitude, altitude, Mormons. But you can begin \nto find out about these things. Unemployment was a mystery, a baffling \nmystery until we began to break it down to aggregate, correlate and \nlearn.\n  I hope that we do that. I make the point, Mr. President, that we are \nbeginning to see the effects of the Family Support Act of 1988. That is \nwhy I have sponsored the Family Support Act of 1995. The matter that I \nhave proposed is a serious effort to continue and build on the base \nthat we have now established. I hope that the Senate might understand \nthe enormous value of continuing a bipartisan program,\n involving various levels of government, national and State, which is \nin place and appears to be working.\n\n  Remember, we did not promise a rose garden. We did not say it would \nbe easy. I think we can find in our descriptions in the debate warnings \nthat it will be worse before it is better. But it begins to seem like \nit may be taking hold. That is by far the most promising thing I have \nseen with this subject in 30 years.\n  I repeat one point. Examining the specific programs, Riverside, CA, \nand others, 6 weeks ago, the Manpower Demonstration Research Corp. said \nthey are seeing the strongest results they have seen in 15 years. We \nseem to be getting the hang of working with the problem. We seem to \nhave defined it reasonably well.\n  I hope we do not give this up, Mr. President. It would be a prelude \nto bitter political division and, far more importantly in my view, to a \nbitter experience for millions of dependent children throughout our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I am not through with the remarks I had intended to \nmake this morning, but the morning has come and gone. I see the Senator \nfrom Texas is on the floor. He has been very patient. He is even \nsmiling. Senator Wellstone was up earlier regarding questions on the \nopening statement.\n  Given this attractive choice on either side of the aisle, it might be \nprudent for me to yield the floor, unless the Senator wished to address \na question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would like to ask a few questions of \nthe Senator from New York, if I could.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Please.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. First of all, Mr. President, I wanted to ask my \ncolleague from New York, in talking about the whole question of birth \nout of wedlock, is it not true that roughly speaking 80 percent of \nwelfare families, AFDC families have two or fewer children?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes, sir, I believe the number of children--Mr. \nPresident, you have to forgive statistics--it is unlikely, but the \nnumber of children is 1.9 children. Actually one, two, or three \nchildren averaging out to 1.9.\n  These are not large families.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me just go on and let me get a \nresponse from my colleague from New York.\n  As I understand the premise that Senator Packwood is proposing--and \nSenator Gramm probably has, I argue, a more extreme version--there are \ntwo premises here.\n  One argument is that in most cases it is single parents, women, who \ndo not want to work. That is the first argument. The second argument is \nwelfare causes women to have more babies. It seems to me that is the \ncase, if I had to get to the essence of it, unless you just sort of \nhate welfare mothers, and I doubt that is what is going on here.\n  Could I ask my colleague to just very briefly respond to each of \nthese arguments. Let me take the first one. Franklin Delano Roosevelt \nin 1935 said, ``I hope to be able to substitute work for relief \naltogether.'' He talked about the importance of work. Then we went to \nthe family assistance program. In 1970, we had the WIN Program by \nPresident Ford. We had the Better Jobs and Income Program by President \nCarter. We have had any number of different programs. We had the \nSenator's important program in 1988.\n  I am trying to be empirical about this. Let me take the first \nargument. Does the Senator believe that, as a matter of fact, welfare \nprevents women from working? Is it not true that roughly speaking, 70 \npercent plus of AFDC members go to work within a 2-year period? The \nproblem is that many then come back to welfare because they cannot \nafford child care. The job does not pay enough to support a family.\n  Is it true that welfare is the reason that women do not work?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. We certainly have never demonstrated that in any \nserious way.\n  Sandy Jencks, at Northwestern University, has done some case \nhistories which argue that welfare is a mode of optimizing income when \nyou both work and get welfare.\n  I give you my view, which is that this is all falling from nonmarital \nbirths to young people.\n  As we say, about half the people coming on welfare are on for less \nthan 2 years. They are mature people whose marriages are in trouble one \nway or another. They do not need your advice or help. What a \nsteelworker needs is a monthly check. And then they go away. It is \nincome insurance.\n  The other group is more problematic. I said three-quarters of the \nchildren will be on for more than 5 years--not consecutively but \nintermittently. The median now, the mean duration is 13 years. Imagine \nthat.\n  We cannot demonstrate--and one of the reasons we cannot demonstrate, \nsurely, we have not tried to find out. Most of the data I have been \npresenting here will be found from Manpower, from the Urban Institute, \nor places like that.\n  I would not in any way dispute what I believe to be what you imply, \nthat there is no evidence that people are on welfare because they do \nnot wish to work, no.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If I could ask another question, is there any evidence \nof higher payments--understanding that there is not one State in the \ncountry that provides an AFDC benefit up to what we define as poverty, \nam I correct?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Understanding that point, is there any evidence that \nhigher payments--that is, any correlation, much less causation, between \nhigher payments and larger welfare families, women having children?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. No, none, zero.\n  Higher payments are not hard to explain. States with higher per \ncapita income have higher per capita benefits. They just have higher \neverything, including higher cost of living.\n  If you adjust for cost of living, New York State has the sixth \nhighest poverty rate in the Nation, but you would not know it from our \nnumbers of dollars.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Just looking at this comparatively for a moment, in \nother countries that have more generous, if you will, more broadly \ndefined welfare payments, do we see more children born out of wedlock \nin those countries?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Sir, I will ask you to let me evade that question \nbecause I simply do not know. You can see the ratio of nonmarital \nbirths as being much higher in those Nordic countries which have high \nbenefits, but I make this point, that in 1960--the Senator is very \ngenerous with his time, but I ask him to hear me--in 1960, in the \nUnited Kingdom, the illegitimacy ratio was 5 percent; by 1992, it was \n31 percent. In Canada, in 1960, it was 4 percent; in 1992, it was 27 \npercent. In France, in 1960, it was 6 percent; in 1992 it was 33 \npercent.\n So you go from 6, 5, 5, 4, to 33, 31, 30, 27. You see the same change.\n\n  If I were to speculate, I would say in France, which began big \nprograms of child support in the late 19th century--they thought they \nwere dying out and they would have no soldiers to fight Germans, \nPrussians, literally--there was a pronatalist policy. It made it very \nsuspect in Protestant circles in the United States, but the payments to \nfamilles nombreuses, the ordinary child allowance--the more children \nyou have, the more you get--they had that in place in 1960 enhanced \nfrom 1930.\n  But they, even so, went from 6 percent to 33 percent.\n  I do not know how much of this is simply the absence of marriage, \nformal marriage, in what are nonetheless stable relationships. I do not \nknow. I wish you could go and write a book and tell me.\n  I can say the Netherlands went from 1 percent to 12--that is 12 \ntimes. And the Netherlands had very generous benefits in 1960.\n  Italy, however went from 2 to 7--not high. Switzerland, 4 to 6.\n  We were entertaining the hypothesis that the critical variable might \nbe distance from the Vatican. But then we \n\n[[Page S 11745]]\nnoticed Japan. Japan was 1 percent in 1960 and 1 percent today.\n  That was a joke.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Does the Senator yield? Is the \nSenator yielding the floor?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Senator yields the floor. May I say I understand we \nwill alternate speakers. I hope Senator Wellstone might be the next \nspeaker on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the Chair's understanding.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me begin by saying I always find it \ninformative to listen to our distinguished colleague from New York. \nNobody in this country, in the last quarter of a century, has had more \nreasonable things to say about this subject than he has. I feel very \nstrongly about this issue, and I know that he feels just as strongly as \nI do. And, while we have very great differences on this issue, even \namong Republicans, I think everybody should know that in my mind, and I \nthink in the mind of any reasonable person, everybody who is debating \nthis issue is sincere. Everybody understands what profound consequences \nawait the Nation in this area. In fact, yesterday, as the distinguished \nSenator from New York and I discussed this issue, the one thing we \nagreed on was that a continuation of the current trend means a profound \nchange in our country and the loss of the America we know.\n  I think, as we start this debate, it is important to begin it with \nthis fact in mind. The Senator from New York and I are far apart as to \nwhat the remedies are in dealing with this problem, but we are in total \nagreement that a failure to deal with this problem means the end of \nAmerica as we know it. It is from this premise that I want to start the \ndebate today.\n  In the last 30 years, if you take all the means-tested programs in \nAmerica--that is programs where money is allocated, directly or \nindirectly, or is spent on behalf of people who are poor--if you take \nall those programs and add them up, you find that over the last 30 \nyears, in fighting this war on poverty, as Lyndon Johnson deemed it to \nbe in 1965, the American taxpayer has spent $5.4 trillion on programs \naimed at helping poor people.\n  Mr. President, nobody here, I believe, really knows what $1 trillion, \nor even $1 billion, is. I have a constituent from Dallas named Ross \nPerot who knows what $1 billion is. But I readily admit that I have a \nhard time fathoming what it means. But let me take a couple of cracks \nat what it means and why it is a very big number.\n  No. 1, the newest estimate by the Heritage Foundation of the value of \nevery building or plant in America, the whole physical capital of the \nUnited States of America, the greatest economy in the history of the \nworld--if you add up the value of every building and improvement, every \nfactory and all the tools of all the workers in America, it is roughly \n$5 trillion in value. So, one measure of the commitment of the American \ntaxpayer to fight and win the war on poverty, is that in the last 30 \nyears we have spent slightly more than the total value of all the \nbuildings, all the plants, all the equipment and all the tools of all \nthe workers in our country. The net physical wealth of the Nation is \nroughly equal to what we have expended over the last 30 years in our \nefforts to try to help people help themselves.\n  A second figure which I think is equally revealing is that, if you \nsimply look at the burden of the welfare program as it exists today--\nnot how much we spent in the last 30 years but the amount we are \nspending today--and you distribute that whole burden among all the \nfamilies in America that file a Federal income tax return, that burden \nadds up to $3,357 per family filing a Federal income tax return last \nyear.\n  Most working Americans do not know what $1 billion is, but virtually \nevery working family in America knows what $3,357 a year is, and that \nis what we are talking about in terms of our annual commitment, as \ncompared to the number of families in America that filed an income tax \nreturn last year.\n  The point I am trying to make here is no one can say the American \npeople have not made a legitimate effort to deal with this problem. In \nfact no society in history has ever made a similar effort over such an \nextended period of time. Never in the history of the world has a \nsociety taken more away from the people who are pulling the wagon and \ngiven more to people riding in the wagon; and, as I will argue later, \nin doing so has made both groups worse off.\n  If we look at what have been the fruits of this massive expenditure \nof money, I do not think anyone would find the results to be anything \nbut disappointing. We have seen, under this program, the illegitimacy \nrate explode--from 5.3 percent in 1960 to almost a third today. Last \nyear, in our big cities, about one-half of all the children born were \nborn out of wedlock.\n  And nationwide, almost one out of three children born in America was \nborn out of wedlock. And we might debate what, under the current trend, \nthe illegitimacy rate is going to be at the end of the century. Is it \ngoing to be 40 percent? Is it going to be 50? We can debate how that \nwill break down across various identifiable groups in America. But \nnobody can dispute the fact that under the current system the trend in \nillegitimacy is up, and no one can argue that we have seen, from this \nmassive and unprecedented expenditure of money, tangible results in \nterms of people becoming less dependent, nor in terms of people \nbreaking the cycle of poverty. That is not to say that you can spend \n$5.4 trillion without helping somebody. But when you look at America I \nthink it is very, very difficult, if not impossible, to argue that \nafter spending $5.4 trillion on welfare programs over the last 30 years \nthat America is better off today than it was when we started. I \nbelieve.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me finish my statement and I would be very happy to \nyield.\n  I think that, by any definition, people are more dependent on \nGovernment today than they were in 1965. We have more people who are \npoor today than we had when we started. I think if you look at the \nquality of life in those areas where you have high concentrations of \npoor people, especially in our inner cities, by any definition of the \nquality of life, people are worse off today than they were when we \nstarted this program.\n  The first point that I want to make is that this is not the kind of \ndebate--and we have many debates on the floor of the Senate that I \nthink would qualify under this heading--where we are talking about \nwhether to undertake an activity; where there is real debate about \nwhether or not the problem would get better more quickly if we left it \nalone. This is not a marginal kind of debate. I think there is a \nconsensus--whether you are a moderate Member of the Senate or more \nconservative--that this is an issue where the future of America is on \nthe line, that our house is literally on fire. And I would argue--and I \nthink the evidence is convincing on this argument--that what we have \ndone in the last 30 years has not only failed to put this fire out, but \nrather has made it burn even brighter. The time has finally come for a \ndramatic change in public policy.\n  In a series of amendments today and for the next few days I, and \nothers, will offer proposals that are aimed at dramatically changing \nthe system.\n  Some will argue that if we can do anything that is an improvement on \nthe current system, we ought to do it. But I would like to remind my \ncolleagues that we have reformed welfare on numerous occasions. In \n1988, we had what was touted as a dramatic change in welfare. The \nSenator from New York today announced that there may be a glimmer of \nhope that positive results are being produced and, obviously, I hope \nthat he is correct. But again, let us look back at what the world \nlooked like in 1988 in terms of poverty, and let us look at what it \nlooks like today. I think that when we look at the numbers we cannot \nhelp but be discouraged.\n  Between 1988 and 1993, welfare spending in America has risen by \nroughly 50 percent. The poverty rate has risen from 13 percent of the \npopulation living in poverty in 1988 to 15.1 in 1993. So, in other \nwords, as spending has risen by 50 percent, the percentage of the \npopulation living in poverty in America has actually gone up by almost \n2 percent. During this 5-year period, from 1988 to \n\n[[Page S 11746]]\n1993, 95,000 new bureaucrats have been added to the welfare system.\n  So we reformed welfare in 1988. But we clearly did not make any \ndramatic changes. And while the Senator from New York may see some \nglimmer of hope, I think his hope is very, very difficult to see in \nthese statistics.\n  But the point is that these statistics represent a very small part of \nthe cost of the failure of the American welfare system, because there \nis a human face behind each of these numbers--because not only have we \nspent record amounts of money, but we have made people more dependent \nand in the process we have changed behavior.\n  I was talking to my mother the other day about welfare, something \nthat anyone who wants to be a leader on this issue would be well \nadvised to do. My mother made the point that the problem today with \nwelfare is that young people do not have the same pride that she had \nwhen she was growing up. And I argued. ``Well, mother, I am not sure \nthat is right. I am not sure that young people are so different today \nthan they were when you were growing up. But I will tell you one thing \nthat I know is different; the system is different.''\n  I tried to explain to my mother that if we had back then, when she \nwas young, had two little children, and was working at the mill, if we \nhad then the kind of welfare system we have now, she would have \nprobably taken it. And my mother argued she would not have taken it. \nShe said that she would have starved to death before she would have \ntaken it. I said, ``Well, mother, you would have been better off taking \nwelfare than you would have been working. Everybody you would have \nknown would have been taking it. There would have been no stigma \ninvolved, and people would have made fun of you for not taking it.'' To \nwhich my mother responded by saying, ``I would not have taken it, and \nif you ever say I would have taken it, I will go on television and \ndenounce you.''\n  Maybe my mother would not have taken it. But the point is that a lot \nof people have. We started out with the idea of helping people. We \nstarted out to build a social safety net. But what happened somewhere \nalong the way, during these past 30 years, the social safety net \ninstead became a hammock. We started to change people's behavior, which \nis not surprising because under the current system, generally, if a \nwelfare mother takes a job she loses her welfare. If she marries \nsomebody who has a job, she loses her welfare. But if she has more \nchildren, she gets more welfare.\n  So not surprisingly in spending this massive amount of money, $5.4 \ntrillion, we have not broken the cycle of poverty. We have not helped \npeople produce independence. But what we clearly have done is changed \nthe way people behave.\n  The other day, in debating this issue, one of my colleagues said, \n``We are not going to solve this problem until we find a way to change \nhow people behave.'' I would argue, Mr. President, that we have found \nthe way to change how people behave. It is our current welfare system. \nNot only have we made people more dependent, not only have we taken \naway their initiative and denied them access to the American dream, but \nwe have affected their spirit and their pride in themselves. Because, \nas people have turned more and more to Government to take care of them, \nto fix their every mistake, they have turned away from self-reliance, \nturned away from their family, and turned away from their faith in \nthemselves.\n  How do we fix it? The Senator from New York says the plain truth is \nthat we do not know. And I think that no one can definitively disagree \nwith that statement. The question is, however, having traveled one road \nfor 30 years--a road that is littered with the wreckage not only of the \nexpenditure of $5.4 trillion but with the lives of people who were \ncaught up in this whole crisis--is it not time for a dramatic change?\n  Let me try to define the debate, if I may. And I know that any time \nyou try to define your position relative to somebody else's, almost by \nthe very nature of the debate, you are unfair. But let me, at least as \nI see it, try to define where we are.\n  We have basically three proposals that are going to be discussed and \nvoted on in the Senate. We have the Dole-Packwood bill, which is an \neffort to try to institute marginal change.\n  First of all, it deals with only 13 percent of means tested programs, \neven if you do not count Medicaid. And even within the areas where it \nprovides block grants, for example, Aid to Families With Dependent \nChildren, despite all the talk of removing strings, in truth the \nstrings are still present. I will just give you an example.\n  According to the Dole-Packwood bill, if under the block grant of AFDC \nmy State wants to require welfare recipients to wash windows on public \nbuildings, but is currently paying State employees to wash these same \nwindows, then they cannot use welfare workers because it would displace \nState employees.\n  Mr. President, clearly, when you are looking at this kind of \nrestriction, you are looking at a focus being put on the interest of \nsomeone other than the taxpayer.\n  Let me run down other problems with the Dole-Packwood bill and how a \ngroup of some 24 Senators that I will be working with on this issue \nwill try to deal with them. First of all, the Dole-Packwood bill fails \nto establish a real mandatory work requirement. There is clearly a \nconsensus in the country on a mandatory work requirement, but right at \nthe final stage of the bill's work requirement--when a decision is made \nwhether or not to actually terminate somebody's welfare if they refuse \nto work--the Dole bill leaves the decision up to the States. The House, \nin contrast, has a real pay-for-performance provision that basically \nsays if somebody shows up to work half time, they get half their \nwelfare benefit; if they do not show up, they get none.\n  I do not believe the District of Columbia will terminate welfare \nbenefits for people who refuse to work and I am not sure what other \nStates will do. I do know that there are some people who say, well, let \nus just turn this whole thing over to the States.\n  I, too, want to give the States a massive expansion in independence, \nbut there is an absolute consensus in America that able-bodied men and \nwomen riding in the welfare wagon should get out of the wagon and help \nthe rest of us pull.\n  We will offer an amendment later today, or sometime this week when we \nhave the opportunity, that would put a pay-for-performance provision in \nthe bill. Members of the Senate can vote either for or against having a \nreal pay-for-performance provision which will simply say that whether \nor not somebody gets AFDC--and our goal will be to expand this \nprovision to food stamps and housing subsidies--depends on their \nwillingness to work. If people refuse to work, we ought to cut off \ntheir benefits.\n  That is how it works in America. That is how it works in the real \nworld, where families and businesses operate every day; if you do not \nshow up for work, you do not get paid. So that is the first change we \nwill institute, and it is a fundamental change. I believe that unless \nwe are willing to have a real mandatory work requirement, not only are \nwe not fulfilling the commitment that Republicans made in the election, \nI think we are not doing what has to be done in order to deal with this \nproblem.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that we claimed in 1988 that we had a \nwork requirement, but what happened was, when it finally went into \neffect, there was an outright exemption for 57 percent of the people \nreceiving welfare. When you finally get down to the bottom line, less \nthan 7 percent of the people ever complied with the work requirement. I \nwant everybody in America who is on welfare to understand that able-\nbodied men and women are expected to work, and if they do not work, \nthey are going to lose their benefits.\n  But the most serious problem with the bill before us is that it does \nnot deal with illegitimacy. If there is one underlying problem in \nAmerican welfare today, if there is one self-perpetuating quality to \npoverty, it is the explosion of the illegitimacy rate. This is not an \neasy problem to deal with, and the proposal that I and others will make \nis not a proposal that is easy to accept. What we are going to propose \nis that we stop giving people more and more money to have more and more \nchildren while on welfare. \n\n[[Page S 11747]]\n\n  A discussion occurred earlier in which someone pointed out that \nWestern Europe has the same illegitimacy problems we have. I would \nargue that it largely has the same welfare program we have. We have \ntried for 30 years with a system that provides monetary reward for \nhaving more and more children on welfare. I believe the time has come \nto terminate that monetary reward. I think the time has come to say to \npeople on welfare that we are not going to give you more and more money \nto have more and more children while on welfare.\n  This is a tough decision to make, but I believe that without this \nchange, we are not going to fundamentally change the poverty problem in \nAmerica. I am very proud of the fact that the House made the change, \nand they made it in two important ways. No. 1, they stopped giving \ndirect cash payment to children who have children. The House bill ends \nthe absurd system which allows a 16-year-old to escape her mother and \nher family by simply having a child; at which point she qualifies for \nAFDC, food stamps, and housing subsidies, and can immediately qualify \nfor enough benefits to leave her family. I believe that the current \npolicy basically represents a national policy of suicide. It is one \nthat has to be changed.\n  We will offer two amendments. One will deal with teenage mothers, and \nthe other will deal with a provision whereby we will deny additional \ncash payments to people on welfare who have more and more children.\n  We have had on occasion debate about how many children people on AFDC \nhave, but I think the facts are pretty clear. First, people on AFDC \nhave children at a younger age than do people in the population as a \nwhole. And on average, if you look at the age groups roughly through \nage 34, the fertility rate among people who are receiving a financial \nreward for having children is about 25 percent higher than those who \nare not.\n  How outrageous is our current policy where we have working families--\nfamilies that are saving money and delaying having children they want--\npaying taxes to encourage and even reward other people to have more \nchildren while on welfare.\n  I think clearly this policy has to be changed. The House bill has a \nbonus for those States that reduce the illegitimacy rate through their \nprograms. It also has a provision--and we will add and strengthen that \nprovision--to see that nothing we do encourages States to promote \nabortion in order to try to qualify for these bonuses. But I believe, \nand many people in America believe, that the solution to the poverty \nproblem lies in trying to deal with illegitimacy.\n  I also believe we need to promote marriage. I believe there are only \ntwo things that can prevent or eliminate poverty: work and family. No \ngreat civilization has ever risen that was not built on strong \nfamilies. No great civilization has ever survived the destruction of \nits families, and I am fearful that America will not be the first.\n  We need some clear incentives for the formation of strong families. I \nwould like to eliminate the marriage penalty for moderate- and low-\nincome families. Under the current system, if two working people fall \nin love and get married, they pay a higher tax rate than they would pay \nif they had stayed single. Clearly that cannot be good public policy. I \nwant, as we promised in the Contract With America, to have a tax credit \nfor families that adopt children, something we desperately want to \npromote. I would like to have favorable tax treatment for families that \ntake care of parents in their own home.\n  We are trying to figure out now how to deal with these issues in a \nbill that is not a revenue bill from the House. And that is something \nthat we are working on. But I think it is fundamentally important that \nin the last 30 years we have tried everything to deal with welfare \nexcept work and family. And I think if we are going to solve this \nproblem, we are going to have to make that change.\n  I believe that the paternity provision in the Dole bill is a weak \nprovision. It basically requires the unwed mother to cooperate in \ntrying to identify the father, whereas the House language is very, very \nstrong so that except in very extreme circumstances, if the mother does \nnot identify the father, she does not get the benefits. I believe that \nis a change that has got to be made.\n  Probably the first amendment that we will offer will have to do with \npeople coming to America to get welfare. I think most Americans are \nshocked to find that someone can come to America today and qualify for \nwelfare tomorrow. I think we have room in America for people who want \nto come and work. I am not in favor of tearing down the Statue of \nLiberty. New Americans are often the best Americans. They bring new \nvision and new energy. And we have got room in America for people who \nwant to come and work. But people ought to come to America with their \nsleeves rolled up, not with their hand out. We do not have room in \nAmerica for people who want to come in here and live off the fruits of \nsomeone else's labor.\n  I want to make it clear that our amendment is going to be \nprospective. So what we are going to say is, as of the adoption date of \nthis bill, from that day forward, anybody who comes to America comes \nhere understanding that they cannot immediately qualify for welfare. \nNow, if they come here, and are productive members of society, and if \nin 5 years they meet the citizenship requirement, once they become \ncitizens, obviously, under the Constitution they have the same rights \nas anybody else. And that is how it should be. But I do not believe \nthat we ought to continue to provide incentives for people to come to \nAmerica to look for welfare.\n  I want to see us block grant more programs. I think it is important \nthat we vote on block grants for food stamps. I would also like to vote \non block grants for housing subsidies. I would like to see us give the \nentire welfare program back to the States and set the States free to \ncome up with a tailored program that will fit their individual needs.\n  A final major point in the bill which I think just defies logic is \nthat, while we eliminate AFDC as a Federal program and give the money \nback to the States, the bill will eliminate only 30 percent of the AFDC \npositions in the Federal bureaucracy. In other words, in AFDC and in \nthose training programs that will be block granted under the Dole bill, \n70 percent of the Federal bureaucrats that are currently working for \nthose programs which we are going to be eliminated at the Federal level \nwill stay on the Federal payroll.\n  I believe that we need to eliminate those Federal bureaucracies when \nwe eliminate the programs. I mean, is the only thing in life that is \nimmortal a Government job or a Government position? It seems to me that \nit is impossible to justify keeping 70 percent of the bureaucrats that \nare running a program in place when we are going to eliminate the \nprogram.\n  Now, we are working, we hope, to negotiate a compromise where you \nmight keep 10 percent of the people to help monitor the program. I \nwould prefer to do that through a contract with some private accounting \nfirm. But there is no way that I can be supportive of a bill in which \nwe eliminate a program but we keep 70 percent of the people who were \nrunning it.\n  In short, the Dole bill does not live up to the commitments that \nRepublicans made in the election. It will not solve the problem. It \ndoes not have a binding, mandatory work requirement. It does not deal \nwith illegitimacy, and it continues to provide the resources to give \npeople more and more money to have more and more children while on \nwelfare. It continues to invite people to come to America, not with \ntheir sleeves rolled up but with their hand out in order to get \nwelfare. And for even the programs it eliminates, it keeps 70 percent \nof the Federal bureaucrats in place with no other job, it seems to me, \nother than to interfere with the State's ability to truly reform the \nprogram.\n  The choice we must make, is to dramatically strengthen the Dole bill. \nWith all due respect to my Democratic colleagues--and I have no doubt \nas to the sincerity of their position--when you get down to the bottom \nline, their position is basically that we can still make this thing \nwork, that after spending $5.4 trillion if we could just spend more \nmoney, if we could just start a new entitlement we can fix the current \nsystem. They are going to propose, it is my understanding, that we \n\n[[Page S 11748]]\nstart a brandnew entitlement to give child care to welfare recipients. \nThis will be a massive and expensive entitlement. But basically their \nargument is--not that they are going to make it, but when you get down \nto the bottom line--is that what is lacking in the welfare system is a \ngreater commitment, that if we simply had more benefits, if we simply \nhad more money, that we could make this whole thing work. I believe the \nAmerican people passed that view 15 or 20 miles back down the road.\n  The tragedy, it seems to me, in this debate in the Senate is that the \nAmerican people are far beyond us in terms of the proposals that they \nare ready to accept. The American people are ready to dramatically \nchange welfare. The American people understand that our house is on \nfire, and they are willing to put the fire out. They are willing to \nmake dramatic change.\n  I have no doubt that if the amendments that I and others will offer \ncould be voted on by the American people, if you took the three bills \nthat in essence we are going to be debating in amendment form, and you \nreduced them down to an agreed-upon, two-sheet summary of each, and put \nthem on every kitchen table in America, I do not have any doubt about \nthe fact that 80 or 90 percent of the people in America who do the \nwork, pay the taxes and pull the wagon would be in favor of the changes \nthat will be proposed by those of us who believe that the Dole bill is \nnot strong enough.\n  This is not an issue where cutting a deal in Washington, DC, is going \nto solve our problems. We need, on this issue, to stand up and fight \nfor a change because the future of America is on the line and we are \ngoing to lose our country as we know it if we do not make the necessary \nchanges.\n  Finally, there are a lot of people who have worked in trying to put \ntogether an alternative that reflects the will of the American people. \nBut there are two people that I want to talk about before closing. One \nis John Ashcroft, our new colleague from Missouri, a former Governor, \nwho understands the functioning of welfare in the States, who probably \nhas as much practical experience as any Member in the Senate with \nwelfare, who certainly has administered a major welfare program more \nrecently than any other Member of the Senate.\n  I think his contributions, in terms of wanting to change the system \nwhere we have the Treasury allocate the funds to the States and where \nthe Federal Government gets out of the way and where we eliminate the \nFederal bureaucracy, are vitally important. I intend to follow his \nleadership on this issue, and I am very hopeful that the amendments he \nwill offer will be adopted.\n  Finally, our relatively new colleague, Lauch Faircloth, has probably \nbeen more courageous on this issue than anybody else. It is often easy \nin party meetings, regardless of which party, when people are trying to \ntalk about supporting a bill to simply nod and hold your tongue.\n  I think the willingness of Lauch Faircloth to stand up and say no, \nespecially on this issue of illegitimacy, has been vitally important. I \nthink it has awakened conservative Republicans to the fact that this is \nsomething that is worth fighting for.\n  I think if we pass a good bill, and I am hopeful we will, and when \nthe dust settles--and I do not know when that is going to be--when we \nfinally enact a bill, that we will have strengthened the bill's \nprovisions on illegitimacy, we will have strengthened its provisions on \nwork, and we will have strengthened its provisions in terms of denying \nbenefits to people who come to America and get welfare. I think in the \nend, probably none of our colleagues will be due more credit for making \nthat happen than Lauch Faircloth.\n  So we will have a series of amendments. I am hopeful we reduce the \nnumber, though I have to confess, as of right now, we have about a \ndozen. Some of them will be very controversial, such as the \nillegitimacy reduction amendments. Some of them, I hope, will be \naccepted. I think we will see a split. Members on both sides of the \naisle will vote for and against some of these amendments, but I think \nwe have an opportunity to make history. I think we have an opportunity \nto write a welfare reform bill that will live up to its name. What we \nreally ought to be debating is not simply reforming welfare but \nreplacing it. I think the amendments that we will be offering represent \na major step in that direction.\n  I want to thank my colleagues who have worked on this effort, and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President. I have tried this morning to \nengage my colleagues and put some questions to them, and I know later \non we will have time for debate. They wanted to get through with their \nstatements. So I am going to do the same thing. I think that is \nunfortunate because, frankly, I think rather than a series of speeches \nwe ought to have a real debate about this.\n  Mr. President, as I was listening to my colleague from Texas, I heard \na lot of apples and oranges, kind of mixed up together. I heard $5.4 \ntrillion, and then I heard a lot about the AFDC Program. One would \nthink we have spent $5.4 trillion since 1965 on Aid to Families With \nDependent Children. Hardly the case.\n  In another point in time, because I am not going to yield my time, I \nwant to put questions to my colleague later on--we will have time for \ndebate--I simply have to say, it will be very interesting to find out \nwhat has been lumped together in this $5.4 trillion. I am sure it is \nfinancial aid for students and all sorts of different programs that are \nmeans tested. Let us not confuse the issue and spend 90 percent of our \ntime on the floor bashing away at AFDC, welfare mothers and their \nchildren, and then every once in a while talk about $5.4 trillion, \nbecause I am afraid people who are listening to this debate will get \nthe impression that that is what we have spent on the AFDC Program. \nThat is hardly the case.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will not yield for a question now. I tried to get \ncolleagues to yield for a question all morning. I intend now to lay out \nwhat I think is a different perspective.\n  One would think from listening to some of my colleagues that we have \nseen an explosion in the number of children born out of wedlock within \nwelfare families. That is not the case. As a matter of fact, we see \nsmaller families. We see, over the last several decades, the typical \nwelfare family is a smaller family. The average size now is less than \ntwo children: One mother, two children. One would think from listening \nto my colleagues that what we have is an explosion in the number of \nchildren in welfare families. That is not the case--that is not the \ncase.\n  Mr. President, one would think that the reason for that is that we \nhave seen a dramatic increase in welfare benefits, although the AFDC \nbenefits have been cut in real dollar terms. I heard my colleague from \nOregon earlier on--I wanted to put a question to him--talking about \nincrease of benefits. But the AFDC benefit, in real dollar terms, has \ngone down about 40 percent or so since 1970.\n  But we only know, I say to my colleague from New York, we only know \nwhat we want to know and sometimes we leave out inconvenient facts. Mr. \nPresident, one would think, listening to my colleagues, that the reason \nfor the $4 trillion-plus of debt, the reason for the budget deficits, \nthe reason for the crime, the reason for the unemployment, the reason \nfor difficult lives for all too many children in this country is the \nAFDC Program. This is just preposterous scapegoating. That is what this \nis all about. Scapegoating: Drive the cheaters off the rolls and the \nslackers back to work, and we can eliminate the total debt of the \ncountry and eliminate all the budget deficits.\n  Mr. President, who are we talking about? Let me just say at the \nbeginning, when I listened to my colleague from Texas--and I am sorry \nto speak with some indignation, I will try to keep it to quiet \nindignation--speaking about the American people and what they are for, \nthe American people do not want us to be reckless with the lives of \nchildren. The American people do not want us to be reckless with the \nlives of children. And, Mr. President, there is a big difference \nbetween reform and reformatory. \n\n[[Page S 11749]]\n\n  Let me tell you what reform is. The Senator from New York has been \nprophetic on this issue forever. I am almost embarrassed to be speaking \nwhile he is out on the floor, because I have so much respect for his \nwork over the years. But at the very minimum, if we are going to be \ntalking about welfare reform, we have to be talking about several \nthings. The Senator's bill in 1988 talked about that. There is nothing \nnew here. The Senator talked about the need to have education, talked \nabout the need for job training and to focus on jobs and, as I \nremember, it had a transition period of time where you did not get cut \noff from Medicaid.\n  That is what it is all about. When we are talking about welfare \nrecipients, the 15 million recipients including 5 million families, and \nwe are talking about driving the slackers back to work and cheaters off \nthe roll, 9 million are children under the age of 18, and the rest are \noverwhelmingly single parents.\n  Interestingly enough, and I will get to this later on in my comments \nwhen we talk about the States and leaving it up to the States, actually \nall too few States have been willing to have the AFDC-UP Program. Too \nfew States have been willing to have that, if we want to talk about \nwhat quite often encourages the breakup of families.\n  But, Mr. President, I have to say to you today that there is a \ntremendous amount of scapegoating that is going on here. If you want to \nhave welfare reform as opposed to reformatory, No. 1, what Minnesotans \nwill say is, ``Look, we think it's important, work is important, to be \nable to have a decent job is dignity.'' That is what all of us desire.\n  By the way, I might be one of the few Senators who spent 20 years, or \nthereabout, organizing with welfare mothers. I might know this \ncommunity better than some people here. Maybe I do not. Maybe that \nmeans I do not have any objectivity.\n  But on the other hand, at least I do not perpetuate a lot of \nstereotypes. At least I have some examples that I can give based upon \nsome personal experience. Most welfare mothers that I know want nothing \nmore than to get out from under the thumb of the welfare department and \nwork.\n  My colleague from New York wrote in his book, ``The Politics of the \nGuaranteed Income.'' To be poor in America is one thing, but to be poor \nand dependent is all too often to be despised. There is a tremendous \namount of stigma. We all want to work.\n  Mr. President, it is very difficult to work. If you want to have real \nwelfare reform and not reformatory, No. 1, there has to be affordable \nchild care. What are you going to do?\n  What are you going to do if you have small children and you are going \nto work? Is there going to be a way you can afford child care? By the \nway, Mr. President, that is not just an issue for welfare mothers. It \nis also an issue for many working families in this country. In this \nCongress, we have cut investment in child care. So at the same time \nthat we say what we need in America is more workfare and less welfare--\nI say to my colleague that we have heard that for a long time--we are \ncutting money and we are retreating from an investment in resources in \nchild care.\n  What are we saying? I thought we valued family. I thought we valued \nchildren. We are saying to welfare mothers, you take a job, and if you \ndo not take a job, you are cut off from assistance. But if that mother \ncannot afford child care, if she loses her Medicaid coverage and the \njob she gets is $5 an hour, or thereabouts--which is exactly the job \nopportunity structure that many welfare mothers face--she is worse off.\n  I say to my colleagues, where in their alleged reform proposal is \nthere any funding for child care? There is no increase in funding for \nchild care. In fact, we are cutting child care assistance. So if we are \ngoing to speak for the majority of people in the United States, let us \nmake a distinction on the floor of the Senate right now. People want to \nsee reform, yes. People would like to see less welfare and more \nworkfare, yes. But people do not want to see children punished. They do \nnot want to see legislation in the name of reform which is degrading \nand punitive. They do not want to see us being reckless with the lives \nof children.\n  By the way, just because a child is in a welfare family, just because \na child is low income and of a single parent, does not mean that child \nis a boy or a girl of any less worth or substance than any of the rest \nof us. These proposals--especially the proposal of the Senator from \nTexas--is not reform, it is reformatory.\n  It is based upon a tremendous amount of scapegoating. And you know \nwhat, Mr. President, there is not one former welfare mother on the \nfloor of the Senate. Welfare mothers do not have the money to buy ads \non CBS, NBC, and ABC to fight some of these cultural stereotypes. I \nhave heard my colleagues come to the floor and give examples.\n  Are we going to now govern by anecdote? I have examples, too, Mr. \nPresident. I say to my colleague from New York, ``There Are No Children \nHere'' is a wonderful book. The title is troubling. Here is the basis \nof the title. The basis of the title is that a journalist from the Wall \nStreet Journal is talking to a mother. He has come to know this family \nwho lives in a housing project. He wants to write about the children. \nThe mother says to him, Mr. President, ``Well, if you want to write \nthis book, you can, but there are no children here.'' What she is \nsaying is, given the brutality of their lives, there are no children, \nthere is no innocence; they do not have the chance to be children.\n  But, Mr. President, for all of these stereotypes about these welfare \nmothers, my God, we have heard it forever. ``They have Cadillacs.'' You \nwould not think that the maximum benefit in the median State is $366 a \nmonth, which is what it is. You would not think in every State the \nwelfare benefits are way below poverty--in the State of Texas, not even \n20 percent of poverty. From listening to my colleagues speak, you would \nthink welfare mothers are receiving huge amounts of money, living high \non the hog, all of them having tons of children. You would think that \nthe average size of a family was 10. But that is not true. The average \nsize of the family is one mother and less than two children.\n  Seventy percent of welfare families have one or two children. You \nwould think welfare mothers do not want to work. But I raised the \nquestion with my colleague from New York earlier. As a matter of fact, \nabout 75 percent of AFDC mothers go to work. But within 2 years, quite \noften, they return back to welfare. And then they go to work again. I \nwill tell you exactly what happens, because I know some of the people \nwe are talking about. It does not make me better than anybody else in \nthe Senate, but at least, for God's sake, I am not operating on the \nbasis of vicious stereotypes.\n  You have a mother and she goes to work and tries to make it, and it \nis a $5.50 an hour job, or whatever the case is; and then she tries to \nwork out a child care arrangement and is able to do that for a while. \nBut pretty soon she is further behind. So she goes back to welfare. \nThen she finds another job and she is doing pretty well at that job, \nbut her child gets sick and she has to stay at home, and this time \naround, she loses that job. And then she seeks employment again. As a \nmatter of fact, that is the pattern, that is what is so dangerous about \nthe 5-year cutoff. That is the pattern. But this does not represent the \npathology of welfare mothers. This represents a group of citizens--\nwomen--who are trying to work and support their families.\n  Mr. President, I have not heard one of my colleagues on the other \nside talk about how it is that in many of our large cities, small \nchildren go to school, all too often crossing through gunfire, and get \nhome and graduate from high school, and some go on to college and some \nhave rewarding lives. Do you know who takes them to school? Do you know \nwho takes them home? Do you know who organizes against the drug \npushers? All too often, they are welfare mothers.\n  I have not heard any stories on the floor of the Senate about any of \nthose women. No, no, no. We only want to know what we want to know. \nBetter to have all of the cruel stereotypes; better to do all of the \nscapegoating. That is the way we are proceeding right now on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  This is not reform, this is reformatory. Some of these proposals are \nvery reckless with the lives of children. We should not be so generous \nwith the suffering of other people. It is a great hot-button issue; you \ncan push it and you \n\n[[Page S 11750]]\ncan get a lot of support. But I will tell you something, there is a lot \nof goodness in this country. When people see some of these proposals \nfor what they are, people will be furious and they will object.\n  I know a woman in Minnesota, a welfare mother. I say to the Senator \nfrom New York, do you know why? Actually, she had a middle income and \nlived in a middle-income family. She was doing fine. She was full of \nhope. She had children. Everything was going right. There was only one \nproblem: Her husband battered her.\n  For many women, like it or not, the welfare program, the AFDC \nProgram, is the only alternative to an abusive relationship. That is \ncorrect. So she left her husband, and now she has small children and \nreceives aid to families with dependent children. I do not hear any of \nmy colleagues talking about such examples. I know another mother, and \nshe has two small children. You know what, I say to my colleague from \nNew York, it reminds me--boy, I am going to get in trouble politically \nfor saying this--but it reminds me of the book entitled ``Let Us Now \nPraise Famous Men.'' It should have been ``Men and Women.''\n  I would not praise all welfare mothers. I can give examples of abuse. \nBut this woman should be famous. She is an AFDC mother. Her husband \nleft her. He is not taking any responsibility for supporting the \nchildren. She has two small children that she takes care of. She goes \nto community college, and she works at a job, as well. She is trying to \nbe independent. She takes good care of those children. She is amazing. \nI do not know how she does it. She is a welfare mother, folks. She is a \nwelfare mother. I have not seen any of my colleagues out here with her \npicture. I have not heard any of those stories.\n  Mr. President, it is time to maybe talk about the basic facts on \nwelfare. Let us not base public policy on the basis of stereotypes.\n  Mr. President, I remember a study by Gilbert Steiner, an institute \nstudy that quoted FDR. He gave a speech and said, ``I hope soon to \nabolish relief altogether.'' Then he moved forward and talked about the \nWIN Program. Leonard Goodwin, of Brookings, wrote a piece in 1970. He \nwas doing an analysis and found that what happened was very \ninteresting. A lot of welfare mothers, rather than saying they heard \nabout this work incentive program now, said they could not wait to \nwork. The problem is we only ended up placing 2 percent of them in jobs \nthat put them in a better position than they were in when they had \nwelfare.\n  Does anybody want to look at the job opportunity structure in \nAmerica? Do any of my colleagues have children in their twenties? I do. \nHave you taken a close look at the jobs that are available right now \nfor people? Has anybody looked at that? Then I hear this wonderful \nargument on the floor of the Senate, and the argument goes as follows: \nWhat is going on here is welfare is causing poverty. And you get all \nthese statistics. I think my colleague from Texas does this. You get \nall these statistics on the rise of poverty in America. That is true. \nThe statistics about the state of children in America should shame all \nof us. One would think that welfare is the cause of the poverty.\n  Not a word about the political economy of the country. Not a word \nabout the minimum wage of $4.25. Not a word about increasing minimum \nwage. Not a word about an expanded job opportunity structure. Not a \nword about the huge number of people today in our country who work 52 \nweeks a year, 40 hours a week, only to make poverty wages. Not a word \nabout any of that.\n  The argument that welfare causes poverty is tantamount to arguing \nthat Social Security causes people to get old.\n  Come on, colleagues. Get your independent and your dependent \nvariables straight. This is the kind of argument that is easy to make \nwhen there are a group of people that you can bash because they are not \nthe big political campaign givers. They do not make the big \ncontributions. They are not the heavy hitters. They are not the \nplayers.\n  But that is still no excuse for bashing people and then basing policy \non these myths.\n  Then we have the Family Allowance Program. Back then, maybe I made a \nmistake. I think my colleague from New York certainly would say I did. \nI thought it was equity within inadequacy. But I do not know. At least \nPresident Nixon and his chief urban adviser, now Senator Moynihan, I \nthink that they were right. They are trying to say, ``Let's have some \nkind of income floor. Let's have some real reform.'' That was defeated. \nCertainly we lost that opportunity.\n  Then Jimmy Carter came in and he said welfare was a disgrace. He had \nhis Better Jobs and Income Program. Ronald Reagan pulled hundreds of \nthousands of people off the rolls in the early 1980's. He thought it \nwas encouraging people to get out of work and stay on welfare, and \nthere was abuse there. But it actually did not lead to anything good \nfor children. Not at all.\n  My colleagues talk about all of this discussion about illegitimacy \nand family caps. My colleague from New York, correct me if I am wrong, \nas I look at the New Jersey experience, Rutgers came out with a study \nrecently and what they found was that, frankly, it did not seem to make \nany difference one way or the other in terms of the cap. The only \ndifference it made was it took some food off the tables.\n  Am I correct?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Senator is correct. The study done at Rutgers \nUniversity showed that.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. This was a study, for the information of my \ncolleagues, a study of the family cap; to have an additional child, \nthere will not be any more assistance.\n  Initially, there were, as I remember--I am kind of going by memory--\nthere were initially proclamations and claims that, as a matter of \nfact, this had cut down on the number of welfare children and the \nnumber of people who were obtaining welfare.\n  I think probably what happened, it was underreported. I think \nprobably a lot of mothers just did not report it.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Reasonable persons learned there would be no additional \nmoney when an additional child was born; they did not report it, and in \ntime these numbers got resolved and there appeared no effect of any \nkind.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. For the record, the best known study of the effects of \nthe family cap was the Rutgers study of the New Jersey plan. Here is \nthe principle investigator for that study who recently reported that \nduring the first year of the program, ``There is not a statistically \nsignificant difference between the birth rates in the experimental and \ncontrol groups. We find a 6.9 percent rate for women subject to the \nfamily cap, and a 6.7 rate for those in the control group.''\n  As a matter of fact, Mr. President, there is not one bit of research \nthat I know of that suggests policywise we are going to be able to do \nanything to stop out-of-work wedlock births.\n  Does the Senator know of any research that suggests we can do that?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I ask unanimous consent to address the Senator \ndirectly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Sir, I do not. I wish I did. I prepared for this debate \nby canvassing acquaintances around the Nation. Did they know? No, they \ndid not.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, we are talking about, we should listen \nto the foremost expert, not just among people in the Senate but in the \ncountry on welfare, Senator Moynihan, if we want to base our policy not \non stereotypes, some of them crucial stereotypes, but on whatever \nevidence there is.\n  As a matter of fact, I heard the Senator from Texas proclaiming we \nwill do this all in the name of helping children. The only thing that \nhappened was there was less money for food.\n  Senators, that is the only thing that happens. And we are profamily? \nAnd we are going to take food out of the mouths of hungry children?\n  Senators, if you have some studies that you can bring to the floor of \nthe Senate, if you have some empirical evidence that these proposals \nwill, in fact, make a difference in terms of reducing the rate of out-\nof-wedlock children, fine. If you have some evidence that a family cap \nor other harsh proposal will reduce the rate of ``illegitimacy,'' fine. \n\n\n[[Page S 11751]]\nIf you do not have evidence, please understand on the basis of what \nstudies have taken place so far, a family cap is no help whatsoever.\n  Also, remember, that over 70 percent of welfare mothers have one or \ntwo children at the most. But what you will do is you will, by this \nkind of change, make sure that these families--and, Senators, there is \nnot one State in the lower 48 that has a welfare benefit up to the \npoverty level income--will have less income to feed their children.\n  Is that what we are about? Is that what we are claiming to be reform? \nThat is not reform. It is punitive. It is degrading. It is reformatory. \nIt is hot-button-issue politics. That is all it is.\n  It is not a policy based upon evidence. It is not sound public \npolicy. We are being very reckless with the lives of children in the \nUnited States of America.\n  Mr. President, who receives AFDC? Eight percent of all AFDC families \nare headed by teens. The vast majority, 81 percent, are young families \nheaded by mothers in their twenties and thirties.\n  How many people receive AFDC? Nine point five million children. Who \nare we talking about? These cheaters we want to drive off the rolls and \nthe slackers we want to drive back to work, who are we talking about? \nMr. President, 9.5 million of the 14 million AFDC recipients are \nchildren.\n  A little less than 5 million are mothers, and many of them are \nmothers of small children. And you do not have any additional funding \nfor child care at all. You do not want to raise the minimum wage for \nworking families. You do not want to have additional assistance for \nchild care.\n  Some of you, I ask the Senator from Oregon, I assume that Medicaid is \ncarried for an additional 2 years? I do not want to give up the floor, \nbut let me say that I assume--I ask unanimous consent to ask the \nSenator from Oregon whether or not in his proposal there is a \ntransition period of time, 2-year period of time, where a welfare \nmother is able to keep her Medicaid? Under the unanimous consent, I ask \nthe Senator from Oregon, and I keep my time on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. One year.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Family Support Act, 1 year.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how many children do AFDC families \nhave? I went over this, but we should be clear. The average family \nreceiving AFDC has two children, about the same as a typical nonwelfare \nfamily; 73 percent of the families receiving AFDC in 1992 have only one \nor two children.\n  The average number--for my colleague from Texas--the average number \nof children in an AFDC family has actually dropped 33 percent since \n1970. You would think, from what my colleagues are proposing, that we \nare having this explosion of additional children to welfare mothers. \nQuite to the contrary. But do not let the facts get in your way, \nbecause it is easy to bash these people. It is easy to bash them.\n  Are AFDC families mostly white or black? I tread on some sensitive \nground here. But I have noticed all too often, when my colleagues come \nout with their pictures, we have African-Americans, usually. So let us \nbe clear about this. Recipient families are about as likely to be white \nas black. In 1992, 39 percent of the families were non-Hispanic white, \n37 percent non-Hispanic black, and 18 percent Hispanic.\n  Mr. President, are you ready for this? This is an important piece of \ninformation. How much do AFDC families receive each month? The maximum \ncash grant for a mother and two children in a typical State is $366 a \nmonth.\n  Now, my colleague from New York pointed this out earlier when he was \ntalking about entitlements--actually, the State defines the benefit. \nThe Federal Government is willing to make a contribution, but the State \ndefines the benefit. And there is a tremendous variation. Mississippi, \nwhich is the least generous State, provides $120 per month. By the way, \nI am not picking--before my colleagues from Mississippi come out here, \nlet me be clear. I think, and I would be willing to be corrected by the \nSenator from New York, usually what happens here is it is the per \ncapita wage that sets the level of AFDC benefits. Those States which \nhave lower working wages, those States that are poorer States have \nlower benefits, by and large.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Plus food stamps.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Plus food stamps. I am going to talk about food stamps \nin a moment, I say to my colleague.\n  AFDC--I will get from my colleague in a moment the 1995 figures. In \n1992, the AFDC payment programs cost the Federal and State Governments \ncombined $22 billion; 1 percent of the Federal budget, and the States' \nshare was about 2 percent. One percent of the Federal Government.\n  Now, the Joint Tax Committee, in talking about corporate welfare, \nsays we have $425 billion a year in tax expenditures. We have a total \nof welfare for the poor, Federal and State, of $22 billion, or a little \nmore now. One percent of the Federal budget. And now we have an all-out \nattack.\n  I am all for reform, by the way. But reform means affordable child \ncare and reform means there has to be a job so a parent can support her \nor his children. That is what reform is all about.\n  You would think from the way in which we see this bashing of welfare \nthat we were spending huge amounts of money. Mr. President, that \naverage $366 per month is, roughly speaking, $4,392 per year. I do not \nknow what the Federal poverty line is, it must be $13,000 per family of \nfour?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Fourteen.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, about $14,000 for a family of four. We \ncan get into a long debate about poverty. We will not today. We have a \ndefinition of poverty, first defined by Molly Orshanski--who I think \nregrets some of the ways in which it has been used--but we have a \ndefinition of poverty. Our definition of poverty is, we say this is the \ndefinition of what a family needs to purchase the minimum amount of \nneeded goods and services. We are talking about children here. Now, \nwhen we define poverty, we say this is the income a family needs to \npurchase the minimum amount of goods and services.\n  The next piece of evidence is there is not one State in the United \nStates of America with welfare payments and food stamps combined that \neven equals what we say a family needs to purchase a minimum amount of \ngoods and services. And we are going after these mothers and these \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, from hearing my colleague from Texas speak especially, \none would think we have seen this dramatic increase in welfare \nbenefits. The Senator from Texas combined all the programs in this \nstatement earlier. But, again, I do not think we can be talking about \nall the programs. If you wanted to have a debate about the welfare \nstate broadly defined, let us have that debate. But do not keep mixing \napples and oranges and throw out a $5.4 trillion figure here and talk \nabout increases here. With the AFDC program, which is the program we \nare talking about, benefits have decreased 47 percent since 1970 in \nreal dollar terms.\n  It is pretty amazing to me. You have an average benefit of $366 a \nmonth for a family of three, and then I think the maximum increase of a \nbenefit for another child in a typical State is $72 more. We make \n$130,000 a year as Senators. Think about this for a moment. Think about \nwhat it costs to raise your child. Do you really believe that, with a \ntypical benefit being $377 per month, and you get an additional $72 a \nmonth, that that is why women have children? Do you think they are \nfurther ahead? Do you think that is a good deal, with what it costs to \nraise a child?\n  There is no evidence of that. No evidence supporting that. No \nevidence for that whatsoever. And if you are honest with yourselves and \nyou think about your own family, you will know that it costs much more \nthan that to raise a child.\n  We have heard a lot. I will conclude just with a little bit more \nfactual information. This is just an average monthly AFDC benefit per \nfamily, in 1992 dollars. From 1970 to 1992, the real value of the AFDC \nbenefit fell 45 percent. If anybody wants to dispute me on the floor of \nthe Senate, do so. Does anybody want to? Good. We have established that \nfact.\n  Mr. President, AFDC and food stamp benefits as a percentage of \npoverty line for a family of three, from 1980 to 1993--AFDC only, \naverage benefit is now 38 percent of poverty line; AFDC and food stamps \nis 67 percent of poverty line. It was 83 percent in 1980, 74 \n\n[[Page S 11752]]\npercent in 1985, 72 percent in 1990. It is now down to 67 percent of \npoverty. So I guess we have not seen a dramatic increase in benefits. \nNot even on the average 67 percent of what we say it takes a family to \npurchase a minimum amount of goods and services; 1 percent of the \nFederal budget. And this is where we are targeting all of our guns. \nRight?\n  Mr. President, here is a chart called ``Percentage Spending for AFDC \nas a Percentage of Total Federal Outlays, 1970 to 1992.'' In 1970, it \nwas 1.40 percent; 1975, 1.5 percent; and 1992, 0.88 percent. Is it 1 \npercent now? Is there any dispute about that?\n  Mr. President, now we are going to talk about just block granting; \ncut child care, tell people they have to work, no affordable child \ncare, do not even talk about the job opportunity structure, do not try \nto raise the minimum wage--not just for welfare mothers but for working \nfamilies, and Medicaid for 1 year. Then what happens after 1 year, \ngiven the job opportunity structure, and how do you afford decent child \ncare?\n  I am going to make a child care point. I am going to make a State \npoint. And then I am going to sit down. But I cannot wait for us to get \ninto some real debate on the floor of this Senate, because if there is \nany role I can play, it is to make sure that nobody gets away, with \njust impunity, with coming to the floor with all these stereotypes. \nSenators can disagree, and that is fine. I am all for that. I just want \nto make sure when the final policy is enacted it is not based on myths \nabout many of these women who cannot fight back.\n  By the way, we are talking about women and children in the main. \nWomen and children.\n  On the child care part--I will not go into child care. We will wait. \nWe will have that debate.\n  Mr. President, let me just give you a feel for the AFDC benefits in \nStates. I see my colleague from Texas. Texas--but I will not pick on \nTexas. I will talk about a lot of different States. The maximum monthly \nAFDC benefits, as of January 1994, was $184. That is for a family of \nthree--$184. That is 19 percent of the poverty level.\n  Mr. President, the decline in the monthly benefits for a family of \nthree, after adjusting for inflation, in the State of Texas was 67 \npercent, a decline.\n  In Alabama, it was $164. That is 17 percent of the Federal poverty \nline.\n  In Maryland--I am going through this at random--$366, 38 percent of \nthe poverty line.\n  Minnesota, $533, 54 percent of the poverty line.\n  New York, $577, 60 percent of the poverty line.\n  This is just welfare benefits. This is AFDC, not the food stamp part.\n  New Jersey, $424, 44 percent of the poverty line.\n  Vermont, $638, 67 percent of the poverty line.\n  Arkansas, $204, 21 percent of the poverty line;\n  Mississippi, $120 per month, 13 percent of the poverty line.\n  Mr. President, let us just finish up this way. Quite to the contrary, \npeople are not living ``high off the hog.'' Quite to the contrary, \npeople are trying to obtain work. Quite to the contrary, most welfare \nmothers and most policy analysts I know are for reform. But you have \naffordable child care, and I think the biggest job we have is job \nopportunity, to be able to get the job, to be able to support yourself. \nLook at the jobs available.\n  Let me say this to my colleague from New York. With regard to this \nwhole notion of ``get off your duff and get a job'' mentality, a recent \nstudy on the availability of jobs in the fast food restaurants found \nthat for each job, there were 14 applicants. As the study's authors put \nit, ``In short, it is simply not the case that anyone who wants even a \nlow-wage job can get one.'' This is the study ``The Job Ghetto.'' This \nwas in the American Prospect, summer of 1995.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, if I may say, the Senator is correct. \nThat was the article.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will conclude with the following poem \nthat was just given to me. It comes from Julia Dinsmore, a welfare \nmother in my State of Minnesota.\n\n       My name is not ``those people.''\n       We always call them ``those people,'' and we had a Member \n     on the floor of the House refer to animals-- ``wolves and \n     alligators,'' a shameful debate.\n       My name is not ``those people.'' I am a loving woman, a \n     mother in pain, giving birth to the future where my babies \n     have the same chance as anyone. My name is not \n     ``inadequate.'' I did not make my husband leave us. He chose \n     to and chooses not to pay child support. While society turns \n     its head, my children pay the price. My name is not \n     ``problem'' and ``case to be managed.'' The social service \n     system can never replace the compassionate concern of loving \n     grandparents, uncles, fathers, cousins, community. Oh, the \n     people who need to be but are not present to bring children \n     forward to their full potential. My name is not ``lazy, \n     dependent welfare mother.'' If the unwaged working parent's \n     home making, community building was factored into the gross \n     national product, my work would have untold value.\n\n  By the way, Mr. President, this is really counterintuitive where this \ndebate is going, and I do think it is very important to have jobs with \ndecent wages. I want to remind my colleagues that being at home and \ntaking care of children, whether you are a woman or a man, is \nimportant, vitally important, productive work.\n\n       My name is not ``ignorant, dumb and uneducated.'' I live \n     with an income of $621 with $169 in food stamps. Rent is \n     $585.''\n\n  This is from Minnesota. Our benefits are much higher than most.\n\n       That leaves $36 a month to live on. I am such a genius at \n     surviving that I could balance the State budget in an hour. \n     Never mind that there is a lack of living-wage jobs. Never \n     mind that it is impossible to be the sole emotional, social, \n     and economic support to a family. Never mind that single \n     mothers can work another job outside the home and lose their \n     children to the gangs, drugs, stealing, prostitution, social \n     workers, kidnapping, street predators. Forget about putting \n     money into our schools. Just build more prisons. My name is \n     not ``lay down and die quietly.'' My love is powerful and my \n     urge to keep my children alive will never stop. All children \n     need homes and people who love them. All children need safety \n     and the chance of being the people they were born to be. The \n     wind will stop before I let my children become a statistic. \n     Before you give in to the urge to blame me, the blame that \n     lets us go blind and unknowing into isolation that \n     disconnects us, take another look. Do not go away, for I am \n     not a problem but the solution. And my name is not ``those \n     people.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I want to make sure the Senator from \nMinnesota does not misconstrue. In the play ``Man for All Seasons'' \nwhere Thomas Moore is being tried--and I will paraphrase the best I can \nrecall--for he would not assent to the king's divorce, he never said \nanything about it. He just did not assent to it. But he would not sign \non it. And in the trial they accused him of opposing the divorce. He \nsaid, ``No. I said nothing about the divorce.'' And the prosecutor said \nsomething about the law and presumptions, and Moore says, in that case, \nit is not to presume that silence assumes assent. He said nothing.\n  I do not want my silence--in response to his papers when he is \nholding them up saying ``anybody here disagrees''--to be assent. He \nsaid nothing.\n  I do not want my silence--in response to his papers when he is \nholding them up saying ``anybody here disagrees''--to be assent. At the \nappropriate time, I will respond to those. But I do not want to leave \nyou with the impression that I agree with everything or barely anything \nthat he said.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, for the first time in 30 years or more, I \nbelieve the Senate is beginning a broad range of debate over a system \nof welfare, not a single program such as AFDC or Medicaid or any of \nhalf a dozen or more others, but a system of welfare.\n  During that period of at least 30 years, the debate over particular \naspects or programs that are a part of that system has always been on \nwhat additional program, what additional help the Government can \nprovide to deal with what was a serious problem of family breakdown, of \ndependent single parents, of illegitimacy and occasionally \nhomelessness. During the course of those three decades, AFDC, \nsupplemental Social Security income, subsidized child care, job \ntraining, Medicaid, and other programs have all been debated as a part \nof the solution to our Nation's social pathologies. And, in most cases, \nthese programs have either been brought into existence or \n\n[[Page S 11753]]\nhave been expanded in an attempt to alleviate social conditions. But \neach one of those additions, each one of those increases, has been \naccompanied by not by a decrease in welfare dependency--both in terms \nof families and illegitimacy, but an increase in those terrible social \nchallenges.\n  So it is appropriate that we debate this issue at this time. I must \nsay that simply the fact that increases in the challenges and \npathologies which have accompanied increases in programs does not \ncreate an irrefutable inference of cause and effect.\n But it certainly does state the proposition that at the very least, \nthese increases, these new programs, these new requirements have not \nalleviated the conditions at which they were aimed at the time of their \ncreation or increase.\n\n  Each liberal attempt at reform which was offered as a way out, or as \na partial solution to the way out, has proved at the very least not to \nhave provided that way. So what we have today is a system elaborate in \nits complexity, requiring a huge Federal bureaucracy to establish and \nto enforce rules related to welfare here in Washington, DC, mirrored by \nhuge State bureaucracies designed to administer and to enforce those \nrules and, of course, in the case of each State, to add to them.\n  The total, the net result is a set of programs and of benefits that \nclearly provides at a certain level a disincentive to entry-level work, \nand as a consequence or as an accompaniment, the social pathologies \ncontinue and grow.\n  And so we are now presented with roughly three alternative proposals \nfor reform. Maybe there is a fourth. In listening to the extended \nstatement by the Senator from Minnesota, the clear implication is that \nwe simply need to do more in the way of programs to provide a greater \ndegree of income and comfort and benefits for those on welfare. But I \ndo not believe that implied solution--and I put the word ``solution'' \nin quotation marks--finds much support either in the American people or \neven on that side of the aisle in this debate.\n  The proposal which seems to have the most support over there is \nessentially more of the same thing masquerading under a set of work \nrequirements and limitations on the time during which an individual can \ndraw AFDC benefits. But these apply to only a modest handful of the \ntotal beneficiaries.\n  The second alternative presented eloquently by the senior Senator \nfrom Texas an hour or so ago was to substitute for the detailed liberal \nrequirements somewhat less detailed but nonetheless significant \nideological requirements from the conservative side of the spectrum on \nthe ground that rules which limit benefits going to teenage unwed \nmothers and single parents will reduce the rate of illegitimacy.\n  The third alternative is the alternative proposed by the majority \nleader, building on the proposal from the Finance Committee and from \nits distinguished chairman, the Senator from Oregon. While it includes \nsignificant work requirements and significant limitations on the amount \nof money and time an individual can draw these various welfare \nbenefits, its philosophy is that far more experimentation should be \npermitted on the part of individual States; that we should not have one \ncentralized system but allow 50 different systems for dealing with \nwelfare.\n  I imagine that the goals of each of these proposals are to try to see \nto it that there is less dependency, to provide fewer incentives for \nillegitimacy and single-parent families, to provide relatively greater \nincentives for work, provide more effective requirements of support on \nthe part of the absent parent--almost always the father--and to \nterminate or limit the misuse of the SSI disability policies.\n  I think with respect to some of these, particularly absent parent \nresponsibility and SSI, there may not be too great a difference among \nthese various proposals. It seems to me, as one of the sponsors of the \nthird proposal, that identified by the Senator from Oregon and the \nmajority leader, that it has at least the virtue of modesty--modesty, \nthat is, in the sense of our saying that we are not certain what \nprogram, what reforms will work to reach the goals that I and others \nhave outlined. We can be, I think, reasonably confident, maybe \noverwhelmingly confident, that what we have now has not worked, and we \ncan be reasonably confident that not only has it not worked but it has \nactually exacerbated the very situation, the very set of conditions it \nwas designed to alleviate in the first place. Of that we can have a \nfair degree of confidence.\n  I submit that I do not have a great deal of confidence in attempting \nto outline a system that I know will work. The Senator from Minnesota \nseems to be very confident without much evidence that all we need to do \nis more of what we have been doing in increasing amounts for the last \n30 years. I submit that he will find relatively little agreement with \nthat position.\n  If it is the case that none of us, not only U.S. Senators but all of \nthe panoply of professionals and so-called experts and academics in \nthis field, cannot be certain of how we can deal successfully with \nthese social pathologies, then this third alternative, the Dole-\nPackwood alternative, is clearly the way in which to go because it is \nclear that if we pass this proposal, 50 States will engage in 50 \ndifferent experiments.\n  It is doubtful that any two States will pursue the quest for a better \nwelfare system in exactly the same way. There is a fear that some will \nnot engage in a maintenance of effort. That may indeed happen. But if \nthere are failures, we will learn from those failures and have a \nclearer idea of what works and what doesn't work.\n  It is true that some States will incur severe penalties, at least \nwhen we compare it with the present system, for illegitimacy and for \nteenage births, and we will determine whether or not that works as \nagainst more liberal States that retain something like the present \nsystem.\n  It may be, Mr. President, in 5 years or 6 years or 10 years of such \nexperimentation, we will have learned that certain State welfare \nsystems work--that is, if the conditions they are designed to alleviate \nare, in fact, alleviated. Others will not have worked--they will have \nincreased the amount of dependency. Others, finally, will have had no \nimpact at all. And it may be that we here in this body, or our \nsuccessors here in this body, will, with that experimentation, be able \nto have a greater degree of confidence in how we should design a \nnational system.\n  But, Mr. President, we cannot claim that confidence here today. We \nonly know that what we have done cumulatively over the last 30 years \nhas been a disastrous failure, not only for the public Treasury, but \neven more so for the American social condition.\n  So, Mr. President, let us take the great advantage that a Federal \nsystem like ours offers to us, the ability to have different solutions \nin different parts of our country, the ability to use the 50 States as \na laboratory for experiment, the ability under those circumstances to \ndetermine what may help us to solve this tremendous social problem and \nmeet this social crisis, and what may not.\n  And it is for that reason, Mr. President, that while the history of \nthe last 30 years has shown us that the liberal prescription for \nwelfare has been an almost unmitigated disaster, so perhaps may be the \nconservative prescription for welfare. Let us exercise our voices and \nour votes with a degree of modesty, a degree of uncertainty, a degree \nof the point of view that we are not quite certain what the answer is, \nand in doing so, accept the amendment that is before us at this point, \nallow for experimentation and innovation and see how, through our \nFederal system, we can learn what will work to solve the problem of \nwelfare.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I think from the debate that we have heard so far on \nthis issue, that we see clearly the fundamental differences about what \nwelfare should be and how we make it what we want it to be. We are \ntaking up a reform of historic magnitude. We have laid the framework \nfor a revolution in the way our country goes about giving help to those \nwho have been told for too long that they are incapable of helping \nthemselves.\n  Over the past 30 years, our welfare system has become an agent of \ndespair \n\n[[Page S 11754]]\nfor those who are trapped in its coils. And if we know one thing about \nour current welfare system, it is that we are not getting our money's \nworth. There are two constituencies that we must serve in this reform--\nthe taxpayer and the welfare recipient. Neither the taxpayers, who foot \nthe bill, nor the beneficiaries themselves are getting fair treatment \nunder the present welfare program. You do not help anyone by \nencouraging self-destructive behavior.\n  The original intent of welfare was something very different from what \nwe have in place today. In the 1930's Americans wanted to open our \nhands and our hearts to the most desperate victims of the Great \nDepression, indigent widows and their children. Then beginning in 1965, \nour War on Poverty attempted to nudge those on the bottom rung of the \nladder in the direction of middle-class security. But we have failed \nmiserably.\n  The percentage of Americans living in poverty has risen steadily at \nthe same time that our welfare apparatus has grown. What we have \ncreated instead is a self-perpetuating monster that sustains the most \ndistressing ills of our society--illegitimacy, the disintegration of \nthe family, weakening of the work ethic, and crippling dependency. \nIndirectly, it feeds ever-rising levels of functional illiteracy, \nviolence, and juvenile crime.\n  The American people are demanding to know why, after an expenditure \nof $5 trillion, there are more people living in poverty today than ever \nbefore in our country. A partial explanation is the growth of the \nwelfare delivery sector of the Government and the private sector \nhangers-on. It is in their interest to make sure that more and more \nmoney is spent on poverty programs without regard to whether we are \nreducing the number of people living in poverty.\n  The American people also wonder, after spending $5 trillion, that \nanyone could think a continuation of the present system with more money \ncould be even a step in the direction of solving this problem. The fact \nis, those who administer these programs and those who advocate them \nhave no incentive to encourage welfare beneficiaries to move forward \nwith their lives. Dependency is presented as acceptable and inevitable. \nIndividual responsibility and all it implies is discounted. This is \nneither beneficial nor benign.\n  We have lured those in need down a dead-end street. The welfare \nreform measures we are considering today would short circuit the \nbureaucracy which the Federal Government has created and hand most of \nthe responsibility over to the States. This will free each State to \nexperiment with new strategies for welfare, new approaches to giving \nbeneficiaries incentives to work and contribute to the American \neconomy.\n  This State involvement with the welfare apparatus is a pivotal \nelement of our reform plans. Unless the Federal Government steps aside \nand lets the States go forward, we will lose the innovation that the \nStates have put into the system. That is where the creativity has been. \nAnd in many instances this has happened in part because the States, \nunlike Congress, are required by their constitutions to come up with a \nbalanced budget every year. Because they are closer to the people and \ncan respond to changing conditions more quickly than the Federal \nGovernment, the States have been able to come up with effective, \ninnovative programs in their reform efforts.\n  Nearly 30 States have requested waivers from the Federal Government \nto enact reforms. Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson says the welfare rolls \nin his State have dropped 19 percent while the national rate has \nincreased to 32 percent. Here are some of his innovative programs: \nlearnfare, which requires welfare teenagers to stay in school; \nmarriagefare, which creates incentives to marry and have no additional \nchildren while still on welfare; and workfare, which ends cash \nassistance after 2 years and requires work in return for other \nbenefits.\n  Because of forward-looking programs like these, the States have \nearned the reputation for being laboratories for innovation. Passage of \nthe bill we have under consideration today will encourage the States to \nachieve reform quickly and give them the freedom to continue their \nexperimentation. It is time for the Federal Government to step aside \nand let the States run with the ball. Mr. President, the American \npeople are entitled to know that we mean business here today. The \nRepublican welfare reform bill we are debating will:\n  End welfare as a way of life by limiting the amount and time of \nassistance that can be made available.\n  It will require able-bodied recipients to work, not enrolled in an \nendless series of job training programs, but begin to work, showing up \nevery day like the rest of us do, no later than 2 years after the \nassistance begins.\n  Reinforce families and cultivate personal responsibility. States will \nbe able to deny cash payments to teenage mothers but instead require \nsingle teens to stay in school and live with adult supervision, \npreferably their parents or grandparents. Applicants for benefits will \nbe required to cooperate in establishing the paternity of their \nchildren. Deadbeat parents will be confronted with the painful \nconsequences of their irresponsibility.\n  That is how our bill will affect welfare beneficiaries. But it has \nother ramifications as well. No State will lose its present Federal \nallotment, and growth States will have an increase each year to help \nwith growing needs. I am going to talk about this later in the debate \nwhen there will be an amendment on allocation of Federal dollars. I \nhave worked very hard on a formula that I think is fair, fair to the \nStates that are not growing, fair to the States that are growing, and \nfair to the States that get more in the beginning and fair to the \nStates that get more in the end. It is a good formula. It takes into \naccount each specific State's unique problems.\n  The Federal welfare bureaucracy will be reduced by 30 percent. \nFederal welfare spending will drop by more than $65 billion below \ncurrent projected levels over the next 7 years. We must not lose sight \nof the goalpost. We are actually going to reduce the cost of welfare in \nthis country for the first time in a long, long time.\n  This bill will empower the States as never before. What is more, \nmoving the responsibility for these programs to the States will give \ntaxpayers more direct say in the targeting of welfare assistance.\n  Last, and perhaps most important, Mr. President, I, like most \nAmericans, believe that no one should have an unrestricted right to \nlive off the toil of others. The crucial element in this welfare \nlegislation is its work provisions. Under this bill, work means work as \nmost Americans understand it. It means participants will have to go to \nwork every day and, yes, maybe do things they do not particularly like \nto do. We have all had that experience in life.\n  The decisions of welfare beneficiaries, like ours, will have \nconsequences. A welfare recipient whose assistance is reduced for \nfailing to work will no longer be able to turn around and get a handout \nfrom another source in the form of food stamps or housing assistance \nincreases. States will be able to require welfare applicants to look \nfor a job before they ever get a welfare check. That will be their \noption.\n  This bill requires 25 percent of each State's welfare caseload to be \nworking by 1996 and 50 percent to be working by the year 2000. The \nStates can exceed these requirements if they choose, and we hope they \nwill. The bill imposes a 5-year lifetime limit on welfare benefits.\n  Mr. President, when we have enacted this legislation, we will be able \nto look the American people in the eye and tell them that we have made \na difference, that we are trying to make things better for both \nconstituencies: The taxpayers who are footing the bill and the welfare \nrecipients who we want to give a hand up to. We want the welfare \nbeneficiaries to have the dignity that comes with making a \ncontribution, with giving an honest day's labor for the money they \nreceive. They will be better off and their children will be better off \nif we can make individual responsibility a part of this country once \nagain.\n  If everyone would work together on a bipartisan basis, we can have a \nbipartisan victory, a victory for the recipients who will know the \npride of earning a living, paying their own way in society, and a \nvictory for the taxpayers who are working people who are trying to meet \ntheir own family responsibilities. \n\n[[Page S 11755]]\n\n  Mr. President, that is what this bill is all about. I hope that at \nthe end of this week, we will be able to go back home and tell the \nAmerican people that we have made a giant step forward for both the \nrecipients of welfare and the taxpayers who have carried a heavy load \nand know it has not worked.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased--very pleased---that we are \nfinally debating a very important issue: The issue of welfare reform. I \nam happy for two reasons.\n  No. 1, I think if there is any issue I heard over a long, long period \nof time the constituents have asked us to do something about, it is the \nissue of welfare reform, and also from the standpoint of those who are \non welfare, to give them a better opportunity and a better environment \nto move from welfare to work and to move from Government dependency to \nbeing independent.\n  We all know that the President needs credit for highlighting this \nissue. I suppose maybe every President has had welfare reform to some \nextent in his platform. But this President in 1992 made it a very \nimportant issue, because he said, ``We are going to end welfare as we \nknow it.'' Probably it is his ability to use words, to use them well \nthat brought attention to this issue that maybe other Presidents before \nwere intending to bring as an issue and could not. There was also the \nnecessity of a Democratic President to highlight it, because you \nremember in that 1992 campaign, he was going to run as a new Democrat, \nnot the typical tax-and-spend Democrat. We were going to have a whole \nnew Democratic Party approach to Government.\n  So the President was elected, and I suppose the American people found \nout he was not a new Democrat, more the typical type of Democrat. Maybe \nthat is why it took another election in 1994 to show the President's \ninaction and to question whether or not he was really serious about \ndramatic change of welfare.\n  The people demonstrated in 1994 that they wanted change, and they \nhave not seen it from the Democratic President and the Democratic \nCongress on the issue of welfare reform.\n  So the American people have now placed their confidence in our party \nand given us an opportunity, as well as a responsibility, to change the \nsystem, to end welfare as we know it, as the President said he wanted \nto change it.\n  So we have taken the people's challenge expressed in the last \nelection, and we Republicans bring this bill to the floor.\n  As our good friend, Senator Moynihan, discussed this morning, in \n1988, we passed welfare reform with 96 votes, one person opposing.\n  Unfortunately, I believe that it failed our hopes and expectations. I \nknow there are a lot of people in this body who would disagree with \nthat point, and I would be happy to speak at great lengths as to why I \nfeel it has not met our hopes and expectations. In doing that, I do not \nin any way express resentment toward those who feel it has been very \nsuccessful. It is probably a difference of opinion of what was supposed \nto be accomplished by that bill.\n  But one of the ways I measure it is that we have more people on \nwelfare today than we did then. I do feel that one positive thing that \ndid come out of the 1988 Family Support Act was the movement toward \nmore experimentation at the State level, which I think the Republican \nbill today is a fulfillment of the ultimate goal that has been \nexpressed here for a decade.\n  Under the 1988 bill, the States took the initiative to try new ideas \nin welfare reform. It was 20 years since the States had that sort of an \nencouragement, or if they had the encouragement, a willingness to do \nit. In spite of the need to come, as they must, hat in hand on bended \nknee, for permission from the Federal Government, the States still \ntried new ideas. That spirited example of the States is what spurred \nsome of us toward giving States maximum flexibility in addressing the \ncrisis in our current welfare system, as we do through the Dole-\nPackwood legislation.\n  Last year, Senator Kohl of Wisconsin and I introduced a bill to give \nStates a block grant for the AFDC JOBS Program and for the AFDC Food \nStamp program. We introduced that bill back then because we believed \nthe States had shown the initiative to reform the current welfare \nsystem. Leaders in States like Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, and some \nmight be surprised that Eastern seaboard States like New Jersey and \nMassachusetts, where generally you think there is a more liberal \npolitical philosophy, all of these States were coming up with the best \nideas to change the system and to move people from welfare to work. I \nthink the State of Iowa has demonstrated the great benefits of a system \ndesigned with the citizens in mind.\n  Two years ago, my State legislature proposed a bill to totally revamp \nthe welfare system. State leaders, after it was passed, came to the \nFederal level, HHS, to receive the waiver necessary to implement their \nideas. Yes, the State of Iowa wanted to very dramatically reform \nwelfare, move people from welfare to work, and save the taxpayers \nmoney.\n  They could not do that on their own. They could only do that within \nthe Federal law, and then they had to come, as I said, on bended knee \nto the officials at HHS to get permission to do what I think everybody \nrecognizes is working so very well, not only in the State of Iowa, but \nin several other States.\n  To the President's credit, he has granted these waivers more \nexpeditiously in late months than in early months, and he has granted \nwaivers to several States--I do not know whether every State, but I \nthink well over 20 States have requested waivers.\n  But why, when dealing with a subject like welfare reform, should \nStates that want to move people from welfare to work and, hopefully, in \nthe process, save the taxpayers money, have to get the permission of \nsome lowly bureaucrat at HHS? We even had to make some modifications to \nsatisfy the Federal bureaucracy. It took several months to get the \nwaiver approved. But my State of Iowa began the implementation of its \nprogram in October 1993. In the last 2 years, the number of AFDC-\nemployed recipients has increased from 18 percent of all welfare \nrecipients to 34 percent--I believe now the highest of any of the \nStates--as a percentage of welfare recipients who are working.\n  I think this dramatic increase shows the ingenuity of people at the \nState level. Specifically, in my State--but not to any greater degree \nthan other States--you hear about them trying to do these things, to \nmove people from welfare to work. I think it also shows the importance, \nthough, of providing much greater flexibility for State leaders, so \nmore of this reform of welfare can be accomplished where people seem to \nbe willing to accomplish it. Because, you see, we passed legislation in \n1988, but here it is, 7 years later, and we are just now talking about \nwelfare reform. In the meantime, there are 3.2 million people on \nwelfare.\n  It was the creative approach of State leaders like Governor Branstad \nand Director of Human Services Chuck Palmer that allowed for such a \ndramatic increase in the number of people working. It was not here in \nWashington. We did not get any encouragement out of Washington. It was \nalmost like fighting the bureaucracy to do this very modest reform. \nThey had to negotiate changes in our claim to get the permission to do \nthat.\n  Now, that is micromangement from the Federal level. It is the type of \nmicromangement that this Republican bill will eliminate, so that the \npeople of our 50 States, through their own State legislatures, can \nprescribe their own welfare system if they want to meet their own \nunique ways and needs, moving people from welfare to work, moving \npeople from dependency to independence.\n  I think it is impossible, Mr. President, with a country that is \ngeographically as vast as our country, a population that is so \nheterogeneous, for us to pour one mold in Washington, DC, and say you \nhave to take care of your welfare people in New York City the same way \nyou do in Des Moines, IA. No, because of the differences of our people, \nbecause of the geographical vastness of it, I think it dictates that we \nnot try to do this from Washington, DC, not only from the standpoint of \nsaving the taxpayers' money, but also \n\n[[Page S 11756]]\nfrom the point of building on the ingenuity of our local people, closer \nto the grassroots.\n  So the whole idea behind the proposal that I spoke about just \nrecently of Senator Kohl and mine, which we introduced last year, and \nalso, I think, the bill before us--although, quite frankly, the bill \ngoes much further than anything that was anticipated by any political \nparty in either House a year ago--that says something, that the people \nat the grassroots are making changes faster than we are willing to make \nthem.\n  The bill before us, as well as the one Senator Kohl and I introduced \nlast year, is to block grant these programs to the States so that the \nStates can change the system in ways that fit the culture of that \nindividual State.\n  In the leadership bill, we remove the need for permission from the \nFeds before States can experiment to help the people of their State.\n  It is amazing to me when I hear that if we give authority back to the \nStates that children will be left starving in the streets. Somehow, \nmany have brought into this debate the idea that we, at the Federal \nlevel, know best and that we are the only ones who can fix a social \nproblem.\n  Frankly, I think it is very arrogant to assume that only Federal \nleaders are compassionate toward the needs of those less fortunate in \nour society. It is a way of saying that we in the Congress have more \ncompassion toward the needs of the people than our State legislators \ndo. I say that for each of our 50 State legislators that I do not think \nthat that is an accurate assumption.\n  Clearly, it is not the basis for this legislation, because this \nlegislation gives so much flexibility. If there is going to be \ncompassion, and there will be, it will be demonstrated at the State \nlegislatures. I can say that there is compassion--probably more so--in \nthe State plan of the State of Iowa than anything we have had on the \nbooks for the last 40 years in Iowa.\n  Clearly, as I have pointed out, States have already demonstrated \ntheir ability to creatively manage welfare programs. Unfortunately, in \n40 years of Federal control, all we have seen is the ongoing \ndestruction of the historic and traditional American family under the \nprograms that we have had at the Federal level.\n  If we as Republicans and Democrats agree on anything, it is that the \ncurrent system must be changed. It must be changed dramatically.\n  Now, in this body of 100 people, 46 Democrats and 54 Republicans, \nthere still may be a legitimate debate about whether the welfare state \nis worthy of our time and consideration and an instrument for \ndelivering public policy. There is no disagreement that the welfare \nsystem within the welfare state is broken and needs to be fixed.\n  The statement of the President of the United States in both State of \nthe Union Messages and in his own campaign rhetoric as a Democratic \nleader demonstrates that better than anything a Republican can \ndemonstrate.\n  The way, then, to make the necessary change is to give the authority \nback to the ones who have been coming up with the most innovative ideas \nin recent years, the ones who have demonstrated that they are worthy of \nour trust--the people at the State and local level. I believe that \nStates will live up to that trust. They will meet the needs of the less \nfortunate in ways that are compassionate and as caring as anything we \ncan do, and yet require and enable people toward independence.\n  This is the American way. It says that we, as a society, now more so \nunder the State legislatures than under the Federal Congress, if you \nhave a need, we are going to extend a helping hand if you need it. We \nwill help you over a period of trial and tribulation in your life. We \nare not going to help you forever if you have the capability of helping \nyourself.\n  We hope that when you move from welfare to work, when you have been \nhelped over the hump, that you then will be in a position to give back \nto the community by helping others as they have helped you.\n  I think the leadership bill meets three of four chief goals that I \nwant to accomplish in legislation: To provide for a system that meets \nthe short-terms needs of low-income members as they prepare for \nindependence; next, to provide for much greater State flexibility; \nnext, to prevent the incidence of out-of-wedlock births; finally, to \nsave the taxpayers some of their hard-earned money.\n  The leadership bill provides for a block grant for the AFDC Program \nto the States so they can meet the needs of low-income Americans in the \nmost community-oriented, cost-efficient manner. That is good. It also \ngives the States greater flexibility in designing their programs to \nmeet the needs of their individual citizens. It also saves the \ntaxpayers some of their hard-earned money.\n  The one goal that I had that still needs some work is the issue of \nreducing out-of-wedlock births. The House bill set a clear goal for the \nStates of reducing the number of out-of-wedlock births. In my judgment, \nhowever, the House bill goes too far in telling the States how they had \nto reach this goal.\n  I do not support exchanging liberal prescriptiveness for conservative \nprescriptiveness. It is just as wrong to have conservative \nmicromanagement in the future as we have had 40 years of liberal \nmicromanagement of welfare programs.\n  The whole idea behind the leadership bill is to set clear goals for \nthe States and to give the States the flexibility to reach the goals in \nways that work best for those States. I support that approach in \ngetting more people to work. I also support the approach of reducing \nout-of-wedlock births. I will promote efforts to strengthen this \nportion of the bill without mandating prescriptive approaches.\n  Mr. President, the real difference here is not between those who want \nstrings attached or do not want strings attached in this welfare block \ngrant, as some of the media has wanted to concentrate on a few minor \ndifferences between Republicans; the real difference here is between a \nphilosophy that has dominated welfare reform debate for the last 40 \nyears, and a new approach.\n  The old approach is micromanagement from Washington, DC, versus State \nflexibility. That real difference of liberal micromanagement came from \nFederal control that came through the welfare system being an \nentitlement program. There are still a lot of people, particularly on \nthe other side of the aisle--the more liberal Democrats--who do not \nwant to give up that Federal control and that Federal entitlement. It \nis that side versus those who want to give control to the States.\n  It is interesting to me that many Members will oppose this bill \nbecause they say it will hurt children. Yet they fail to admit that the \ncurrent welfare system hurts children, as well. The research shows that \nchildren born into families receiving welfare are three times more \nlikely to be on welfare when they reach adulthood. How, then, is the \ncurrent system good for children? If we truly care about these \nchildren, we will reform the current detrimental welfare system.\n  What about the children, then, who are not on welfare? We have equal \nresponsibility for all children. What about them? Are we concerned \nabout these children?\n  With our current budget debt of almost $4.9 trillion, each man, \nwoman, and child owes $18,000 toward that debt. A newborn babe right \nthis minute owes $18,000. If we do not reverse the deficit crisis, our \nchildren will pay 80 percent of their lifetime earnings in taxes.\n  What do we do about these children? Are we concerned about them? It \nis appropriate for us to be concerned for the children of low-income \nmembers. Frankly, I think we should be concerned for all the children \nof America. That means that we have to reduce the deficit while we \nchange the welfare system to free those currently trapped in \ngovernmental dependence.\n  If we take steps to move people from welfare to work, if we give more \nflexibility to the States, and if we reduce illegitimacy, we will, in \nthe long run, save the taxpayers money. This will be the natural result \nof positive changes to the current system.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the distinguished leader is on the \nfloor. I know he wants to speak. I will not delay him but 90 seconds, \nperhaps, to thank the Senator from Iowa for his remarks about the \nenergetic new program that has been developed in Iowa, \n\n[[Page S 11757]]\nwhich was done in the context and under the rules of the Family Support \nAct. It is exactly what we looked for. Federal money is involved. They \nhad to get a waiver. It took a few months. They got it. What more, I do \nnot know, could be asked of a level of government that is participating \nin the financing.\n  I wish we did not have to have this rhetoric of liberal \nmicromanaging. The AFDC Program has been in place for 55 years. During \nthose 55 years, we have had a Democratic Presidency for 27; a \nRepublican Presidency for 28. It is about even.\n  The Aid to Families with Dependent Children Program--the programs are \nset by the States, not by the Federal Government. You can have a large \nand generous program, you can have no program. Wisconsin, at the end of \n1997, will have no program. That is its right.\n  Finally--I do not want to keep the majority leader waiting--a certain \ntouch of reality here. We have heard all day long about this \nsuffocating, all-embracing, ever-expanding Federal bureaucracy that \nruns the welfare programs. Mr. President, I have here a letter from \nMary Jo Bane, the Assistant Secretary for Children and Families. It \nreports that in the 55 years of the AFDC Program, the monster Federal \nbureaucracy here in Washington running that program has reached 92 \npersons--92 persons--the JOBS Program, 26 persons. In the regions, AFDC \nis 144 persons; JOBS, 65 persons.\n  In the entire Nation there are 327 Federal employees dealing with \nwhat we generically call welfare; 327. That is not a staggering number. \nThere are 327 elevator operators in the U.S. Capitol and we have \nautomatic elevators--or some such number. It is being said of the \nmajority leader's bill that he only cuts this bloated bureaucracy back \n30 percent. If you cut it back 30 percent, Heaven help us, that might \nmean 100 people. If we cut it in half, that could mean 150.\n  I do not know what we need do, but we surely need not begin a serious \ndebate like this with such little respect for data, which data is not \ndifficult to obtain.\n  I have also heard at some length this morning about how little we \nknow about so much of this problem. The Senator from Washington made \nthat point with great clarity, I thought. But we do know how many \npeople are working on AFDC in Washington and the Department of Health \nand Human Services. The number is 92. They are dealing with 15 million \npeople. I leave it there.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter from the \nHonorable Mary Jo Bane be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Department of Health & Human Services, Administration for \n           Children and Families,\n                                   Washington, DC, August 7, 1995.\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: As you requested, the following \n     table shows the number of staff, expressed as full-time \n     equivalents (FTEs), who work with the AFDC and JOBS programs \n     in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     Central                            \n             Program                  Office      Regions       Total   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAFDC.............................           92          144          236\nJOBS.............................           26           65           91\n                                  ======================================\n      Total......................          118          209          327\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       This table includes employees in the Office of Family \n     Assistance here in Washington, D.C. and in the ten Regional \n     Offices.\n       Thank you for your attention. If you need additional \n     information, please let me know.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Mary Jo Bane,\n\n                                           Assistant Secretary for\n                                            Children and Families.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The majority leader is present. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I know there are a number of people who \ndesire to speak. I will not take but a few moments.\n  I had a chance to speak briefly on Friday, and I have listened to \nboth Senators Moynihan and Packwood and others today. It is my hope \nthat in the end we will end up with welfare reform, or whatever we want \nto call it. We call ours--the word ``work\" is in ours--Work Opportunity \nAct of 1995. On the other side, the Democratic bill, the first word is \n``work.'' So that is where the emphasis is. That is where 62 percent of \nthe American people say they have the deepest interest--they want to \nfind work for the people.\n  I felt the same way back in 1988. I offered, with Senator Armstrong, \nat the time a workfare amendment. It was the first time we had one. \nThere was an effort to table the amendment. The vote was 49 to 41. It \nfailed, and the first workfare amendment was adopted in 1988. It also \ndealt with participation rates.\n  Some people opposed work, and it has not worked that well since, I \nmight add. But at least there was an effort made. It turned out to be \nbipartisan effort after the initial skirmish. Now everybody is focused \non work 8 years later. Maybe we should have been focused on it before. \nI offered, along with Senator Long, in 1979, a block grant on AFDC--in \n1979.\n  So, some of us have had these ideas for a long time. But I hope in \nthe end we have a bill that will have enough support to get out of the \nChamber and, hopefully, support on both sides of the aisle. We have had \nbipartisan support. The vote was 96 to 2?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Ninety-six to one.\n  Mr. DOLE. It was 96 to 1, with three absent.\n  This is, really, the first day of debate. I have listened to most of \nit carefully. I think there is probably enough debate to last for \nanother 2 or 3 hours, and I hope we can continue the debate. But before \nthat, I do want to modify my amendment.\n  I send the modification to the desk. I do not need consent to do \nthis, it is simply a modification. I will explain what the modification \ndoes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to modify his \namendment. It is so modified.\n  The modification of the amendment (No. 2280) is as follows:\n\n       On page 32, line 19, strike ``and''.\n       On page 33, line 3, strike the end period, and insert ``; \n     and''.\n       On page 33, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n       ``(F) vocational educational training (not to exceed 12 \n     months with respect to any individual).\n       On page 33, strike lines 9 through 10, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(1) reduce the amount of assistance otherwise payable to \n     the family pro rata (or more, at the option of the State) \n     with respect to any period during a month in which the adult \n     so refuses; or''.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me explain what the modification does. \nIt modifies the bill to include the House provision regarding sanctions \non those who refuse to work. While our amendment does require the \nStates to sanction, it leaves it up to the States as to the actual \nreduction, and some suggest this leaves in doubt our commitment to \nwork. There is not any doubt about our commitment to work. I have had \none since 1988. But to clarify it, we say at a minimum, the States must \nreduce the benefits by at least the amount not worked.\n  We have also heard from a number of Governors with reference to the \nsecond modification, and I talked this morning with Gov. Mike Leavitt, \nof Utah, who says we were shortsighted in this in excluding vocational \neducation in the list of those activities permitted under our \ndefinition of work. That concern has been expressed by a number of my \ncolleagues.\n  Our view was, some people get in these vocational education programs \nand they never do work. They are in it for a year, 2 years, 3 years. So \nwe tried to strike a balance because of the interest of many of the \nGovernors and many of our colleagues, by permitting vocational \neducation for up to 1 year. We do not expect it to be a career. But I \ndo believe that some of the Governors believe they have very good \nvocational education programs in place and they would like to keep \nthem.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. That makes sense.\n  Mr. DOLE. It made sense to me, so we have made that change.\n  I heard my friend from Texas refer to this bill as ``the Dole bill.'' \nThis is the leadership bill. This is a bill sponsored by every \nRepublican Member of the leadership and 28 other Republicans, and we \nhope to have more. We hope to have 54, and we hope to have some \nDemocrats.\n  And I believe there is some opportunity here because I am getting hit \nby \n\n[[Page S 11758]]\nthe White House on the one side and my friend from Texas on the other. \nThe White House says that ``the Dole bill,'' which is the leadership \nbill, is unacceptable. And that is pretty much what the Senator from \nTexas, Senator Gramm, said: It is unacceptable; only his is acceptable, \nwhich I have not seen.\n  So maybe if that is the case, there is some room for adjustment here.\n  I read here from a press release from conservative Governor Branstad \nof Iowa who said that conservative micromanagement is just as bad as \nliberal micromanagement. So the Governors are concerned, and we have 30 \nRepublican Governors. We are very fortunate to have 30 Republican \nGovernors. I am very proud of it. They represent States that have 70 \npercent of the population in those States, 70 percent. Every Governor \nsupports the leadership effort, the Republican leadership effort. Every \nState, every Governor, including the Governor of Texas, including the \nGovernor of New Hampshire, including the Governor Iowa, including the \nGovernor of Arizona, to name a few early primary States.\n  So this is an important matter that we are debating. I hope we can \nresolve it this week. This is not about Presidential politics. It is \nabout welfare, about work, about opportunity, and about changing a \nfailed system. And I want to mention what this debate is not about.\n  I do not think this debate is about which party cares the most for \nthose in need. It is not about which party has the biggest heart, \nbecause every Senator knows there are some Americans who need help.\n  I do not care what bill we pass. Some Americans are going to need \nhelp, and they ought to have it. Every Member knows, and you probably \nknow of someone in your hometown or neighborhood right here, who is \nstruggling every day to keep their head above water. Some of us know it \nbecause we have watched our parents and our grandparents and others go \nthrough it--to do everything they possibly could to make ends meet. And \nI will bet half of the Members--maybe not half--I will bet a fourth of \nthe Members in this body are in that category; not now, but when they \nwere growing up.\n  So it is not about which party has the most compassion. It is not \nabout which party wants to do the most to hurt someone who finds \nthemselves in a condition where they have to have help. It is not about \nthat either.\n  In my view, I think we are all pretty much in agreement around here \nthat the system has failed.\n  I remember being in North Carolina with the Senator from North \nCarolina--now a Senator, but he then was a candidate--that was his \ntotal, No. 1 issue in his campaign: welfare reform. And he has not \nchanged his commitment. He has not changed it, and it should not \nchange. And I know other of my colleagues who have done the same.\n  We all know the system has failed. It has failed American taxpayers, \nand it has failed the Americans who we tried to serve. I think we made \nevery good effort, and maybe we have not given the 1988 bill enough \ntime to work. But there are a lot of people out there with no hope. \nThat is what this debate is all about: How do we change the system? It \nis not how many people we dump on the street and how many children we \nleft to go to bed hungry, or how much more we spend.\n  I carry around in my pocket a copy of the 10th amendment. It is only \n28 words in length. It simply says:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to States respectively, or to the people.\n\n  That is what this debate is all about, as far as I am concerned--\ngiving power back to the Governors and to the State legislatures, \nDemocrats or Republicans, in either case--on the theory that they are \ncloser to the people.\n  There are some who think we can fix the system by just tinkering \naround the edges here and apply a Band-Aid here and a Band-Aid there. \nIt is not going to work. And I think that is a prescription offered, \nfrankly, by the distinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle. The \nAmerican people want to go forward, far beyond fine tuning.\n  So I am proud to be joined by at least 32 of my colleagues, and I \nhope more, in the process, and by every one of our Republican Governors \nin supporting, along with Senator Packwood, S. 1120.\n  We have been criticized because we could not get a tough bill in the \nFinance Committee. You have to count votes when you have tough bills \naround here. I have learned from experience. The bottom line is, how \nmany votes do you have? It is not how many speeches do you make or how \nmany times you criticize somebody else; it is, how many votes do you \nhave?\n  This is a legislative body. I cannot stand up and say, ``This is \ngoing to pass.''\n  I happen to believe that S. 1120 will change the very principles and \nvalues on which the system is based. It is going to change that \nattitude that ``Washington knows best.''\n  So what we are trying to do in our approach--certainly it can be \nchanged, it can be improved, it can be strengthened by what the words \nmay be, and some people may interpret those words differently and have \na different idea about what improvement or strengthening or whatever \nmight be. But we are going to combine AFDC, child programs under AFDC, \nand job training programs under AFDC into one block grant, and the \nStates are free to spend the money as they see fit.\n  I, for one, advocate food stamps as a block grant. I said that \npublicly in the Senate Agriculture Committee. We did not have the \nvotes. I think it is a great idea. It would also go a long way in \nsolving some of our formula problems in this bill, and there will be \nsome debate on it. It may not have the votes, but we will find out.\n  As a result of the work of the Senate Labor Committee and my \ncolleague, Senator Kassebaum, we will consolidate and put into another \nsingle program 88 job training and training-related educational \nprograms, including the Job Training Partnership Act and the Carl \nPerkins Vocational Training and Education Program.\n  For some reason, returning power to the States makes President \nClinton nervous. And he has been a Governor. Maybe he learned from \nother Governors who are nervous because they do not believe the \nGovernors or the States can handle it. I hope that is not the case. But \nhe said giving our States control will incite a ``race to the bottom.'' \nI do not know which States he has in mind. I hope not Kansas or \nMissouri or any other State represented here.\n  I have asked the President in Burlington, VT, and would question him \ntoday, which States--rhetorically, because he was not there at the \ntime--which States will participate in such a race? Not my State, not \nNew York State, not Arkansas.\n  And I want to thank the Senator from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers. He \nvoted for Work Fair in 1988, one of a number of Democrats who joined \nus.\n  Which Governor does he think does not care about the people in need? \nI do not know of any, Democrat or Republican.\n  And which State legislatures cannot be trusted with the welfare of \ntheir people? I do not know of any. Maybe there are some out there. \nMaybe they would take this money and spend it for bridges and highways. \nThat is not going to happen. It cannot happen.\n  So I would also say that in our bill, the leadership bill, the Work \nOpportunity Act of 1995, that we want to reduce the very disturbing \nnumber of children born out of wedlock just as much as everybody else, \nand there are no magic solutions out there that this Senator knows \nabout. We do not believe the best way is to do it through more Federal \ncontrol.\n  Our bill recognizes that States are better able than the Federal \nGovernment to determine what programs will best reduce illegitimacy.\n  S. 1120 recognizes the importance of the family. It recognizes that \nfamilies that stay together are far less likely to be on welfare than \nthose that do not.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator be willing to yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. I want to finish my statement. This is the first statement \nI have made except a brief introductory statement.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOLE. But I would ask unanimous consent that we continue debate \non the bill without amendments until 5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n[[Page S 11759]]\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, it takes the commonsense approach of \nrequiring that single teenaged parents receiving welfare must stay in \nschool and live under adult supervision.\n I know this is a breaking point with some of my colleagues on this \nside. I am not certain about that side.\n\n  In S. 1120, we give the States authority to deny benefits to teenage \nmothers and to place family caps. Again, I believe the Governors can \nmake that choice. Many will make that choice. Others, for reasons that \nthey feel are justified, and maybe better than ours, just want to do it \nat the Federal level. They want to mandate that you have to do it. We \nwant it so the Governors can do it without asking Federal approval. \nGive them a little flexibility, give them a little freedom.\n  S. 1120 also requires that welfare applicants cooperate with \npaternity establishment of their children and requires the States to \nachieve a 90 percent success rate. Now, if some mother out there \nidentifies the father and the search is begun, they cannot find the \nfather, should we go so far as to say she cannot have any benefits even \nthough she cooperated? I do not think so. Others would deny benefits \nuntil the father is apparently located.\n  One of the reasons the present system has failed is it provides no \ntime limit for receiving welfare. And it offers in effect motivation \nfor recipients to leave the welfare rolls for a payroll. We have long \nfought to put work back in. As I said, in 1988, with the former Senator \nfrom Colorado, Bill Armstrong, we made a number of modifications to the \nFamily Security Act which many of my colleagues and then the chairman, \nSenator Moynihan, accepted because he was just as genuinely sincere as \nwe were in trying to make changes.\n  So there was a feeling back then by the American people and by the \nMembers of Congress in both parties that work was important.\n  We also introduced at that time what we now know as participation \nstandards that required States to make certain a percentage of their \npopulation was actually engaged in work.\n  S. 1120 goes further. With no exceptions, every adult recipient must \nstart working and stay working. In our bill, work means work--no year-\nlong job searches, no graduate degrees, no moving from one training \nprogram to another. And as I said, in the modification I just made, you \ncannot stay in vocational education forever either. There is a 1-year \nlimit. I assume some Governors would find this to work because that \nwould satisfy their concerns.\n  And then there is the question about whether we have strong work \nrequirements in S. 1120. The bottom line is that S. 1120 contains the \nsame provisions that are in the House bill with respect to the number \nof hours that must be worked, and it actually contains tougher \nparticipation requirements because States must sanction beneficiaries \nwho refuse to work. And we have made a modification in that area, too. \nBut I would just say that the general thrust is hopefully we can work \nout any differences on this side. As I have said, let us have a jump \nball. We will throw it up in the air, and whoever gets the tip wins, \nand we are all still in the game. We do not say, well, if I lost, I am \nout of the game. Some will win and some will fail.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office--and I think Senator \nPackwood mentioned this--we will save in S. 1120 over the next 7 \nyears--and these are estimates, CBO estimates which could be off either \nway--$70 billion. That is a lot of money. The House saves--they do not \nhave a 7-year figure; they have a 5-year figure--$65 billion. So I \nwould assume they save much more in 7 years, at least according to \nassumptions.\n  The point I wish to make today is this is the first day of the real \ndebate. I would like to complete action on this bill this week. I do \nnot see why we cannot. We will only have one or two distractions. We \nare still trying to work out an agreement on the DOD authorization \nbill. I think as we speak Senators are meeting to see if they can \nmodify a couple of things that might permit us to complete action on \nthat. If not, that will not be taken up.\n  But we will have 5 long days here, and maybe--I said Saturday we \nwould not have a Saturday session, but if it meant completing action on \nthis bill Saturday, obviously that would be different. I am not trying \nto threaten anybody. I say we ought to finish this before we leave. I \nam not saying if we just stall it until Friday we are out of here. That \nis not what I am saying. We ought to finish it before we leave, and \nthat can be interpreted differently by different Members.\n  I hope we do not become overly partisan in the debate. As I said at \nthe outset, it is not about compassion. It is not about generosity. It \nis about a system for some reason that is not working, despite all the \ngood efforts by many and some in this Chamber now. I think it is our \nduty to fix it.\n  It is our duty to fix it. We ought to get it fixed this week. We \nought to get it fixed before we leave here for what may be left of the \nAugust recess, so we will be in a position to go to conference with the \nHouse.\n  I must say, in the White House release that I referred to earlier, \none thing that was encouraging, Mr. McCurry, the White House spokesman, \nmade it very clear that they were not threatening a veto. ``A long way \nfrom a veto'' and ``wants to cooperate with Capitol Hill.'' Their \nbiggest objection is that ``It does not require States to offer child \ncare opportunities for welfare recipients going to work.''\n  That is the big objection the White House has apparently at least \ntoday with the so-called leadership bill, the Work Opportunity Act of \n1995. And I might say there are some on this side who have the same \nconcern.\n  That is what it is all about. How do you get enough people together \nwith different views to pass it? You cannot pass it with 23 votes. You \ncannot pass it with 33 votes. You cannot pass it with 43 votes. We \nmight have to have 60 votes, though I am told, at least by inference, \nthere will be no effort to filibuster or cloture will not be necessary \non this bill, because I believe everybody wants us to come up with some \nchange.\n  If that is the case, it is out there somewhere. There are 51 or 61 or \n71 votes out there somewhere. And that is what this debate is all \nabout. It is not about the toughest. It is not about the easiest. It is \nabout substantial, meaningful change because the system has failed.\n  I hope as we continue the debate we will have a coming together of \nideas. The leadership does not suggest S. 1120 is perfect. I might say \nthere are one or two provisions that divide the people on this side of \nthe aisle like cash payments to teenage mothers. That is opposed by the \nCatholic bishops and by the Catholic Charities and the National Right \nto Life Organization but supported by the Christian Coalition, and you \nhave the same lineup on family caps; also opposed by the 30 Republican \nGovernors.\n  So it is not a question of--I mean I assume those groups are viewed \nas conservative groups. In this particular instance, they do not agree \nwith one another, just as we do not agree with one another on some of \nthese provisions. Hopefully we can work those out, plus others that are \nof particular concern to my friends like Senator Faircloth and others \non this side of the aisle.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. DOLE. Speech or a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Question.\n  Mr. DOLE. Sure.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We will have the chance to debate the different features \nof the Senator's proposal, but I wanted to have the Senator's response \nto one of the primary areas of concern, and that is in the area of day \ncare for children. As the Senator is familiar, the Finance Committee \nput approximately $1 billion of the child care program, day care \nprogram into the AFDC, and the budget has reduced the approximately $1 \nbillion in the child care program, made 30 percent of it to be \navailable to the States. So that means that there is only about a third \nof the total funding for the child care program.\n  Today there are 400,000 children under AFDC that receive any kind of \nchild care. We have 10 million children \n\n[[Page S 11760]]\nand 4 million adults under AFDC. If half of the adults are going to \nhave to go to work and their children are going to have to go to day \ncare, it means there will be 4 million more slots that are going to be \nnecessary for day care programs, as there will be 2 million of the AFDC \nparents that will go to work.\n  I am just wondering and asking the Senator where the funding is under \nthe Dole proposal for the child care proposal, whether he is willing to \ntry to find ways--perhaps it is already there. The Senator might be \nable to respond to the question or at least try to designate ways that \nissue could be addressed.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me just respond this way to the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I said just a few moments ago--I do not think the \nSenator was on the floor--that was an area of concern today raised by \nthe White House, the same general area. As I said, it is a concern \nraised by a number of my colleagues on this side of the aisle.\n  We had our first meeting on Friday. And Senator Kassebaum, the \nchairman of the committee, who did a lot of work in that area, was \npresent. So I can say to the Senator in all candor, it is something \nthat we are looking at. We know there is a problem, and we are looking \nat it because under the present provision of S. 1120, it would be block \ngranted to the States. But there is a great deal of concern expressed. \nI can only say that we are going to sit down, I think, again either \ntonight or tomorrow morning, to try to address that on this side.\n  We will be happy to discuss it with the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I just say that I appreciate that, \nbecause as the Senator has pointed out, the initial block grant program \nwas worked out on a bipartisan basis with Senator Dodd, Senator Hatch, \nSenator Kassebaum, and others, and in the Finance Committee, Senator \nMoynihan and others. The Republicans worked out the $1 billion program. \nThe concern that many of us had is that the $1 billion program, which \nwas used for the 400,000 day care slots for children, has gone into the \nAFDC. That figure, of course, is capped at the 1994 level.\n  The other block grant program, a third of that is no longer going to \nbe necessarily designated for child care, which only leaves about $600 \nmillion. That is to go not to welfare parents, but to low-income \nworking families. So this is an area of considerable concern.\n  We will look forward to try to work with the majority leader because \nit is an area of great concern.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  I thought we were going to alternate one side to the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is not the Chair's understanding.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order for that.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. There is no order, but that has been our agreeable \npractice throughout the day. There was an informal agreement, and the \nchairman of the Finance Committee would so attest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any advice from the chairman of the \nFinance Committee?\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I was not informed of the rule.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. The Chair is correct. There is no rule.\n  Senator Moynihan and I agreed we would try to go back and forth. I \nmust say, in fairness, we have had four or five speakers on our side. \nThe Democrats had none on theirs. Just to the extent we are on the \nfloor, we are going back and forth on the floor informally. If no one \nis on the floor, we will recognize who is there to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I was not aware.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the President and the chairman of the committee \nand the ranking member.\n  Mr. President, it is about time, at long last we are debating welfare \nreform on the floor of the U.S. Senate. This is a debate welcomed by \nthis Senator, and I know by others on this side of the aisle and on the \nother side of the aisle. It has been a long time coming.\n  Reform of the welfare system is a serious issue. It is my hope that \nwe will have a serious, thorough, and thoughtful debate, a debate that \nrises above partisanship, a debate that says let us not make politics \nas usual, business as usual, especially with this issue. The American \npeople want us to work together to make welfare work for America.\n  Of course, there is disagreement about how to achieve that goal. But \nthere is also a lot of common ground. All of us agree that today's \nsystem is broken. It discourages work, it rewards dependence, it \ncripples opportunity, and it wastes tax dollars. I have said many \ntimes, Mr. President, that the present welfare system is unfair. It is \nunfair to the people who are on it and it is unfair to the taxpayers.\n  But for too long, that is just about as far as it has gotten. \nPolitics as usual has crowded out good ideas and practical solutions. \nAnd what has been the result?\n  Families on welfare have been stuck in the dependence trap and \ntaxpayers have been stuck with the bill. So how do we escape it? Well, \nthe key to real reform is to start with the basic questions--not what \nmakes the best sound bite, not what pushes the most hot buttons, but \nwhat makes common sense and what works.\n  My work on welfare reform over the last several years has led me to \nfive fundamental conclusions about how to not just reform welfare, but \nhow to once and for all say really farewell to welfare as we know it. \nAnd I would like to go through those five conclusions.\n  Conclusion No. 1. Welfare reform must be built on a foundation of \nresponsibility. We must stop looking at welfare as a Government \ngiveaway program. Instead, it should be a contract demanding mutual \nresponsibility between the Government and the individual receiving the \nbenefits. The contract should outline the steps a recipient will take \nto become self-sufficient and a date certain by which they will be off \nof welfare. Responsibility should start on day one with continued \nbenefits conditioned on compliance with the contract's requirements \nand, I might add, continued benefits conditioned on the compliance with \nthe contract's requirements by both sides, by both the State and the \nrecipient.\n  Conclusion No. 2. The goal is self-sufficiency. We have to have a \nshift in our thinking about welfare, that somehow it is going to be \nwelfare to work, or welfare to a job. I think we have to now begin \nthinking about welfare to self-sufficiency. Self-sufficiency is a term \ndifferent from a job. Maybe in the past, we could have the luxury of \ntraining someone for a job, giving that person a job, and maybe they \ncould have it for 20 or 30 or 40 years. We know right now that the \naverage worker in America changes jobs, I think, seven times during his \nor her lifetime. For those at the lower income of the economic scale, \nit is probably twice that many times.\n  So I believe that we have to stop thinking about just getting someone \na job. We have to prepare people to be self-sufficient. And that \nencompasses a whole different concept than just training someone for a \njob.\n  We do not want just to get families off of welfare and a job, we want \nto keep them off permanently. That means providing incentives that \nencourage work and savings, but it also means not just issuing empty \npromises about child care, but building up people's skills, assisting \nwith child care, education, job training and other basic skills that \nwelfare recipients need to find and keep good jobs. I mean, it could be \neverything from how to interview, how to keep a budget, how to shop, \nhow to dress, language skills, how to communicate. All of these things \nneed to be built into this concept of being self-sufficient.\n  So the bottom line in welfare reform is not in short-term budget \nsavings. But the bottom line is the number of families who are able to \nclimb up that ladder of opportunity and escape for good, knowing that \nthey have the necessary skills and fundamentals so that, if they do \nlose a job, they can go out in the marketplace and find another one.\n  Mr. President, I also, just as an aside here, want to say that in \nIowa--I will refer to this periodically throughout my remarks, and I \nknow the majority \n\n[[Page S 11761]]\nleader said something about hoping that we could have a good bipartisan \nprogram of welfare reform. That is possible. We did it in Iowa. I might \njust add as a preface to some of the other things I am going to say, we \npassed a welfare reform bill in Iowa 2 years ago. It has been in effect \nfor 1\\1/2\\ years. It got the support of, as I have always liked to say, \nPat Robertson conservative Republicans and Jesse Jackson liberal \nDemocrats.\n Only one person in the Iowa House voted against it. It was signed into \nlaw by a conservative Republican, Governor Branstad. We were able to \nwork in a bipartisan fashion. But the way we did it, I think, was the \nright way, rather than just throwing a bill out and having an \nideological debate about welfare.\n\n  Back in the 1980's, the legislature, again working in a bipartisan \nfashion in Iowa, established some pilot programs around the State to \nfind out what would work. They were demonstration programs to see what \nwould and would not work. This went on for a few years. As a result of \nthese programs, the legislature took up the bill 2 years ago and passed \na welfare reform bill based upon those demonstration programs. And it \nhas been in existence for a year and a half, and I will talk more about \nthat in a few minutes.\n  Iowa's Governor, Terry Branstad, said last December, ``There has been \nmuch recognition that welfare reform requires an up-front investment \nwith long-term results.'' Even Governor Thompson of Wisconsin echoed \nthe same words when he said, ``Welfare reform requires cash investments \nup front. But that investment eventually turns into savings.''\n  Conclusion No. 3 is that one size does not fit all. An inflexible 2-\nyear time limit on welfare benefits, as I have said before, is too \npermissive. If put in place, a 2-year maximum becomes a 2-year minimum. \nTime limits should be based on individual family circumstances, not \nsome cookie-cutter approach. The plain fact is that many require far \nless than 2 years on welfare to achieve self-sufficiency. States also \nshould not be strapped with a welfare Federal straitjacket. We should \ncut Federal redtape and leave the States with the option of choosing \nthe policies best for them. After all, what works in Brooklyn, NY, may \nnot work very well in Brooklyn, IA.\n  But we also should not abandon the basic national framework that \nassures protection for children and demands responsibility from all \nrecipients. Without that, we risk trading in one large failed \ndependency-inducing system for 50 smaller varieties of the same thing. \nI will repeat that. If we do not keep our basic national framework that \nassures protection for children and demands responsibility from \nrecipients, if we are going to turn this back to the States, we are \ngoing to have 50 varieties, basically, of what we have right now.\n  Conclusion No. 4. The private sector must be a full partner in fixing \nwelfare, not in the end but in the beginning. Too often, we have put \npeople through welfare programs, training programs, and then at the end \nwe say, ``OK, go out to the private sector and get a job.'' I believe \nthat what we have done in Iowa has shown that to be absolutely the \nwrong approach. The private sector must be pulled in up at the \nbeginning when a person is on welfare and when they have signed the \ncontract and they begin that process for self-sufficiency. There must \nbe ways for the private sector to be involved right from the beginning.\n  Also, instead of creating costly and inefficient Government make-work \njobs, the focus ought to be moving people into permanent jobs in the \nprivate sector and not some dead-end, make-work job in the beginning.\n  Mentoring programs by the private sector must be encouraged. They \nwork great in Iowa. And microenterprise development--and I will have \nmore to say about that in a few minutes--must be enhanced and promoted. \nBusinesses should be encouraged with whatever we have to encourage them \nto do so, to get in on the ground floor of welfare reform and work with \nclients in the beginning.\n  I mentioned microenterprise development. Look at the work of the \nInstitute for Social and Economic Development in Iowa. It has been \nhelping low-income individuals start their own businesses. While most \nsmall businesses fail within the first year in America, most businesses \nestablished with the assistance of ISED, since this program started in \n1988--and this is a program where with a very little amount of money, \nwelfare recipients who have the ability and desire to establish their \nown businesses through microenterprises are given intensive training \nperiods in accounting, bookkeeping, buying and selling; setting up a \nbusiness. This lasts for about 3 months, and they are then given low-\ninterest loans, very low-interest loans, to help start that small \nbusiness.\n  Guess what has happened? While most small businesses fail in the \nfirst year, this program has had a 72 percent success rate. Think about \nthat. Since 1988, for every 100 businesses started under this program, \n72 percent are still surviving today, providing former welfare clients \nwith a business of their own and providing them with self-sufficiency. \nThat is better than SBA can ever hope for--72 percent. And yet, under \nthe bill we have in front of us--I will say more about this later--that \nfunding is taken away for microenterprise development. That is one of \nthe most successful things we have seen.\n  I had an example here of some of the people who were involved in this \nprogram. Jo Sires, owner-operator of Again and Again Consignment, buys \nclothes from garage or yard sales. Some of it she gets on consignment \nand resells. She has owned and operated that business for 5 years. She \nstarted in June of 1990. She was laid off from Rath Packing Company due \nto plant closure. She had been on and off AFDC for 4 years. She is a \ndivorced mother with three children. She started working with the \nInstitute of Social and Economic Development in July 1989. She opened \nher store in 1990. Right now, she has pursued her business and has \nrelocated her store after the first year to a place with twice as much \nfloor space. Her sales range from $3,000 to $6,000 per month. Here is a \nperson who was on welfare, AFDC, for almost 4 years. Now she is totally \nself-sufficient.\n  I have a lot more cases here of people that have started their own \nsmall businesses and how they have gone on to operate those businesses \nwith their families and become successes. We ought to encourage more of \nthis and not pull the rug out from underneath them. We have a success \nrate of 72 percent, and that is something to crow about.\n  Conclusion No. 5. Bipartisanship is essential. Neither political \nparty has a corner on the market of good ideas. We can learn from each \nother and come together on a plan that includes the best ideas of both. \nI was proud last year to have joined with Senator Kit Bond of Missouri \nto introduce the first bipartisan welfare reform legislation last year. \nIt encompassed much of what we did in Iowa and much of what Missouri \nhad done also. As I said, no party has a corner on the market of good \nideas.\n  Mr. President, I have worked to develop an approach that is rooted in \nthese five core principles. The centerpiece is the family investment \nagreement, which requires all families on welfare to enter into an \nindividualized contract with the State. Under the plan, each family \nwill sit down with a case manager and chart a course to self-\nsufficiency. Basically, it means taking people who are on welfare now, \nputting them through the family investment program, having them sit \ndown with a case manager and getting an assessment, a thorough \nassessment of that individual--background, capabilities, test scores, \nwhether they have disabilities, what their family is like, how many \nchildren, do they have disabilities in the family, do they need \ntransportation, and where they live.\n  You need a good profile of people so that you can come up with a \ncontract that individualizes the approach, as I said earlier. One of my \nconclusions is that one size does not fit all. We have proven that in \nIowa. When you individualize a contract, when you have a case manager, \nwhen you do a good profile of an individual and of her or his \nsituation, then you can draw up a contract that is realistic and that \nprovides that person with a pathway up and out of welfare and into \nself-sufficiency.\n  Flexibility is critical in welfare reform. We should be inflexible \nwhen it comes to one bottom line: We must demand results. \n\n[[Page S 11762]]\n\n  Under the legislation that Senator Bond and I introduced, 90 percent \nof the recipients would be required to sign agreements and find work. \nThis plan may sound unrealistic.\n  The fact is those ideas are based on reform that has actually worked. \nUnder Iowa's revolutionary bipartisan welfare reform plan, which \nadopted the family investment agreement 1\\1/2\\ years ago, the number of \nwelfare recipients holding jobs has grown by 93 percent.\n  Mr. President, here is a chart that illustrates what has happened in \nIowa, through June 1995, starting in September 1993. Actually, I said a \nyear and a half, and you might say, well, you have been on the program \nalmost 2 years. Most things did not go into effect until January of \n1994. We took this as the starting point of that fiscal year and the \nbeginning of the next fiscal year.\n  At that time, we had 6,553 families on welfare in Iowa who were \nworking. We now have 12,351. That is an increase of 93 percent. That \nhas happened in Iowa. People might say, well, you have low rates of \nunemployment, and maybe the economy has gotten better. Maybe there are \nthings to account for that.\n  Mr. President, because we had to go to the Department of Health and \nHuman Services to get a waiver for our program, they demanded we set up \nthe control group. There are people in Iowa who are not under this \nprogram, they are operating under the old program. So we are able to \nsee whether or not they have been able to do the same thing as this \ngroup.\n  Guess what? Under the old group, looking at this chart, right in the \nbeginning we had 18 percent of our families working who were on \nwelfare. That is now up to 34.8 percent. In the control group, it is \nstill operating under the old system. They are still down at 18 percent \nworking. Under the new system, we have almost doubled it--93 percent \nincrease. You cannot say it is just because the economy has gotten \nbetter or low unemployment, because we have the control group there \nunder the old system. We are able to compare. We know under the new \nsystem we have almost doubled the number of people on welfare who work.\n  I am proud to say that right now Iowa leads the Nation, we have a \nhigher number of our people on welfare who work than any State in the \ncountry. Iowa leads the Nation in moving recipients from welfare to \nwork. The costs to taxpayers are steadily going down and welfare \ncaseloads are declining.\n  Since the program began on October 1, 1993, the number of Iowa \nwelfare recipients who are working and earning a paycheck, as I said, \nhas almost doubled. Since more welfare recipients are working and \nearning income, the average size of the welfare grant has declined from \n$373 down to $336.\n  Mr. President, here is a chart showing what has happened to our \naverage grant, $373, now down to $336. Again, keep in mind, we have \nalmost doubled the number of people on welfare who work and we have cut \nthe average size of the grant from $373 to $336.\n  Now look at what has happened to our caseload. The number of families \non welfare has declined. Now, Mr. President, I said earlier, to echo \nGovernor Branstad and even Governor Thompson, sometimes it takes \ninvestment up front to get long-term investments. We knew in Iowa--\nRepublicans and Democrats alike--that when we made the changes the \nnumber of people on welfare would blip up in the beginning, but we had \nconfidence that because of what we had seen on some of the pilot \nprograms in Iowa earlier, we knew after the initial blip up they would \nstart to come down. That is exactly what has happened. This chart \nproves it.\n  We started out our caseload with 36,404. Immediately, up until May of \nlast year, it boomed up. Once we worked through the system, we got \nthese people because of the transportation, and things like that, it \nleveled off, and since that point in time, it has dramatically come \ndown, and we are down now to 34,806. This is what we have to keep in \nmind.\n  Sometimes an investment up front will yield long-term investments. We \nare so concerned around here about cutting this, we want to see what \nwill happen in the first year. Cut everybody down the first year. What \nwill happen is it will boom up later on because people simply will not \nhave the wherewithal, the training, to be self-sufficient.\n  That is what we have done in Iowa. We took the long view. We said \nmaybe in the first few months it may cost a little bit more. We may get \na few more people on welfare. But we know what will happen, and what \nhappens statewide is what happened in every pilot program that we had \nbefore that.\n  So it is working. I urge my colleagues, keep in mind the long term, \nnot just the short term, but the long term. We know what has happened \nin Iowa.\n  Lastly, what has happened on the macro scale to the State of Iowa \nwith this program? Total cash payments have declined by 20 percent from \n$13.8 million per month to $11.7 million per month. Two million a \nmonth, $24 million a year--that is not bad for the State of Iowa.\n  Here, this chart shows it. The blue line is fiscal year 1992. The \ngreen line is fiscal year 1993. The yellow line is fiscal year 1994, \ntotal expenditures on welfare grants in Iowa. Here is what happened \nafter we instituted our welfare reform program--the red line. It has \nbeen coming down constantly. Compared to just here in 1994, we are down \nto about $2 million a month.\n  Let me sum it up. What have we done in Iowa? We doubled the number of \npeople on welfare working. We cut the number of total caseloads on \nwelfare. We have cut the cash grant to families. We have cut the total \nexpenditures that the State of Iowa has to come up with. It is working.\n  I have said many times, we in Iowa did it right. We are sort of the \nRodney Dangerfield of welfare reform. We did it right, but ``We don't \nget no respect.'' We have done it right in Iowa. As I said, it got the \nvote of conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats, and they put it \nthrough.\n  It has worked. It has worked well. Taxpayers have saved money, \nwelfare recipients have gotten jobs, fewer families are on the welfare \nroll. I call that a triple play.\n  I had some editorials I was going to read. Mr. President, I will have \nprinted an editorial about the mentoring projects in Iowa, where we \nbring in private businesses to mentor people who are working on \nwelfare, and how good a program that is. I ask unanimous consent that \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Mentor Project a Good Idea\n\n       The Iowa Invests Mentors Project aims to pair people who \n     have made it with those who want to.\n       The basic idea is to help people on welfare by providing \n     guidance from those who have learned how to survive in the \n     methods and skills of job hunting and job retention.\n       The program is not designed to provide a cheerleader, but \n     someone who can give practical, real-life advice.\n       But there is more to the program. Participants are required \n     to sign a contract agreeing to obtain training and get jobs \n     with phased-out assistance payments.\n       This is an Iowa program that grew out of a 1988 pilot \n     program, giving state jobs to former Polk County Aid to \n     Families with Dependent Children recipients.\n       In 1993, the project expanded into the Family Investment \n     Program-Promise Jobs, an outgrowth of a bill passed by the \n     Iowa Legislature in response to Iowa Commission on the Status \n     of Women requests.\n       This is the kind of program which critics of the welfare \n     system have been demanding for years.\n       Now it has arrived. But, ironically, there has been little \n     response from the community.\n       According to program managers, there are as many as 2,000 \n     eligible people in the eight-county southwest Iowa area, yet \n     no more than 25 to 30 volunteers are expected by the most \n     optimistic organizers.\n       We might be forgiven for suspecting that opponents of \n     welfare are not putting their time and money where their \n     mouth is.\n       We are sure that in our area there are many who could give \n     substantial guidance to those seeking self-sufficiency.\n       For women who have faced the humiliating need for public \n     assistance, often after being abandoned by a spouse, this \n     first step is critical toward establishing self-esteem and a \n     secure economic future.\n       We think they deserve our support.\n       For those unable to mentor, there will be the opportunity \n     to offer pledges to those who will be ``rocking'' in a \n     rocking chair marathon Saturday at WalMart, 3201 Manawa \n     Center Drive, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n       It is of no use to complain about state-sponsored welfare \n     and then refuse to participate in programs that provide \n     grassroot support for those among us who need our help to \n     establish themselves.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. A good editorial from the Cedar Rapids Gazette entitled, \n``Take Good Ideas and Run With \n\n[[Page S 11763]]\nThem.'' I might point out this was in last year in December.\n\n       As the reins of power in Congress are passed to new hands \n     over the next month, the incoming Republican majority should \n     not only take note of the voter unrest that made this change \n     possible, but other circumstances outside the Washington \n     beltway.\n       For instance, Tom Harkin, heretofore a well-positioned \n     Democratic member of the United States Senate, and Terry \n     Branstad, the Republican poised to set a longevity record for \n     Iowa governors, find themselves on the same wavelength about \n     a traditionally dicey issue--welfare.\n      Both have had good things to say about efforts in Iowa to \n     reform welfare programs. Both regard the Iowa experiment \n     as a potential model for Federal welfare overhaul.\n\n  Anyway, it went through what happened in Iowa and concluded by \nsaying:\n\n       That's how government is supposed to work, of course. \n     Forget the partisan sideshow and concentrate on making good \n     public policy out of good ideas regardless of their origins.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this be printed in the Record, \nalso.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Take Good Ideas and Run With Them\n\n       As the reins of power in Congress are passed to new hands \n     over the next month, the incoming Republican majority should \n     not only take note of the voter unrest that made this change \n     possible, but other circumstances outside the Washington \n     beltway.\n       For instance, Tom Harkin, heretofore a well-positioned \n     Democratic member of the United States Senate, and Terry \n     Bradstad, the Republican poised to set a longevity record for \n     Iowa governors, find themselves on the same wavelength about \n     a traditionally dicey issue--welfare.\n       Both have had good things to say about efforts in Iowa to \n     reform welfare programs. Both regard the Iowa experiment as a \n     potential model for federal welfare overhaul.\n       Iowa has instituted a plan in which recipients of public \n     assistance must agree to gradually re-enter the work force, \n     thereby easing themselves off welfare. Some don't like this \n     imposition of deadlines, complaining that life doesn't \n     necessarily mesh with such mandates. True, but absence of \n     specific targets merely encourage the status quo.\n       Other gaps probably exist, too. But though the Iowa plan \n     isn't perfect, the system it replaces has long since become \n     inefficient. And in the relatively short time the new program \n     has been in place, results have been encouraging. Greater \n     numbers of assistance recipients are able to share in their \n     own support through earnings.\n       Never will society be entirely free of an obligation to \n     help the less fortunate who cannot help themselves. But \n     neither should it be burdened with supporting those who will \n     not contribute to their own well-being.\n       What Iowa policymakers crafted for this state shows \n     promise, and under Harkin's guidance, could become a pattern \n     for federal welfare reform. He's losing chairmanship of a key \n     Senate committee, by virtue of being relegated to minority \n     status, but Harkin is shrewd enough about the ways of \n     Congress to know how to get a good idea considered. He and \n     Sen. Kit Bond, a Missouri Republican, will reintroduce \n     legislation next year on welfare reform.\n       That's how government is supposed to work, of course. \n     Forget the partisan sideshow and concentrate on making good \n     public policy out of good ideas regardless of their origins.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is an editorial more recently, on May \n11, from the Des Moines Register, which is titled ``A Welfare Winner--\nIowa's Family Investment Plan Could be a National Model.''\n\n       With a solid year's worth of experience behind it, Iowa's \n     innovative new welfare program looks like a winner. If the \n     numbers hold up over time, the state's Department of Human \n     Services will have succeeded where the nation and practically \n     every state have either feared to tread or have tried and \n     fallen short.\n       As Senator Tom Harkin has pointed out, the Iowa idea could \n     be a model for the Nation. But rather than looking at Iowa, \n     congressional GOP leadership is focusing on block grants to \n     states, with no guarantee that they won't use Federal tax \n     money to perpetuate formulas for failure that have \n     characterized welfare from its inception.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this editorial be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Des Moines Register, May 11, 1995]\n\n  A Welfare Winner--Iowa's Family Investment Plan Could Be a National \n                                 Model\n\n       With a solid year's worth of experience behind it, Iowa's \n     innovative new welfare program looks like a winner. If the \n     numbers hold up over time, the state's Department of Human \n     Services will have succeeded where the nation and practically \n     every state have either feared to tread or have tried and \n     fallen short.\n       As Senator Tom Harkin has pointed out, the Iowa idea cold \n     be a model for the nation. But rather than looking at Iowa, \n     congressional GOP leadership is focusing on block grants to \n     states, with no guarantee that they won't use federal tax \n     money to perpetuate formulas for failure that have \n     characterized welfare from its inception.\n       There remains a very long path toward a complete weaning of \n     Iowa's poor from the dole. It will never be complete; a core \n     of hard cases is inevitable. And the Iowa reform plan, known \n     as the Family Investment Plan, has yet to make a serious dent \n     in Medicaid, the welfare health program that costs seven \n     times as much in Iowa as do the cash grants to the poor to \n     pay for necessities. (Besides serving young, needy families, \n     much of the Medicaid expense goes to the elderly poor in \n     nursing homes.)\n       But the welfare that hits the public's hot buttons--Aid to \n     Families with Dependent Children--involves cash grants given \n     to women who have babies instead of jobs. In that area, Iowa \n     is making progress by substituting the Family Investment \n     Plan.\n       The March 1995 welfare caseload in Iowa is down 9 percent \n     from March 1994.\n       The cost of welfare grants for the month of March '95 is 12 \n     percent lower than for the same month a year ago.\n       Before Iowa began phasing in the Family Investment Plan \n     program in October 1993, fewer than one Iowa welfare family \n     in five had any earnings from a job. By March '94, the number \n     was roughly one in four. By March '95, it was one in three.\n       ``Getting that first job is the big step,'' said Ann \n     Wiebers of Iowa's DHS.\n       To make getting that job more attractive, the state allows \n     welfare recipients to keep more earnings than they did under \n     AFDC. Welfare grants decline as earnings increase, but they \n     don't fall as fast as under the old AFDC formula. That means \n     giving more bucks to beginning wage-earners--but the \n     investment pays off for taxpayers.\n       The new Family Investment Plan includes penalties as well \n     as rewards. Those who refuse to sign a contract to get a job \n     or get training, or sign a contract but refuse to abide by \n     it, can lose their cash grant.\n       For the first three months, non-cooperators continue to get \n     full benefits; for the next three, benefits for adults in the \n     family go. After that, it's over, and as of April 1, the DHS \n     had canceled grants to 1,112 families. They continue to get \n     health care, and food-stamp allotments actually increase. \n     Iowa public-health officials visit families to make sure the \n     children are getting along.\n       The program is not yet fully implemented. The Family \n     Investment Plan has replaced AFDC in 90 counties, and has \n     taken much of the caseload in the other nine.\n       The only valid rationale for having maintained 50 separate \n     state welfare programs through the years is to enable states \n     to improvise and innovate. Iowa has sought reform through \n     increased incentives, and it works. But as Harkin told a \n     Senate Finance Committee hearing, ``No one seems to be paying \n     any attention.''\n       They should be. And the lack of attention makes one wonder \n     if congressional leadership is less concerned with successful \n     reform than with who gets the credit.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, at the end of my \nstatement, at the end of my time, a series of other editorials in \nsupport of the Iowa program be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, let me comment a little bit about the bill \nwe have before us. I guess it is called the Dole-Packwood bill, S. \n1120.\n  I think, basically, this bill strikes out. As I have said, the Iowa \nprogram is a triple play. This bill strikes out. It fails the test of \nmoving people from welfare to self-sufficiency. Again, do not take my \nword for it. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 44 of the \n50 States will not meet the work requirements as outlined in the bill.\n  We need a welfare system that empowers people and promotes \nindependence. Today's system fails to do it and, I believe, so does the \nbill before us. The Dole-Packwood bill merely changes the means of \ndelivering welfare programs but will not affect the end. Families will \nremain trapped in a cycle of dependency and poverty. The pending \nlegislation replaces this one failed dependency-inducing system we have \nwith 50 varieties of the same. It boxes up the problem and ships it off \nto the States. It will not ensure reform. Nor will the pending \nlegislation provide opportunity, real opportunity for welfare \nrecipients, the real opportunities to become self-sufficient. That \nshould be our goal. If you do not have an education and skills, you \nwill not get a job. If you do not have transportation, you cannot get \nto a job. And if you do not have child care, you cannot keep a job.\n  That is the reality for most families on welfare: No one to take care \nof the \n\n[[Page S 11764]]\nkids, no way to get to work, no skills, no education. And, to them, the \nbill before us, the Dole-Packwood bill, says ``No way out. No luck. No \nexit.'' That is not welfare reform, that is welfare fraud.\n  What we did in Iowa--I might add, some of the things that increased \nthe caseload, that made this caseload up in the beginning, is we let \npeople keep more of their earnings. We raised the ceiling for \nautomobiles. Under Federal law, a welfare recipient getting AFDC cannot \nhave a car valued at more than $1,500. What do you get for $1,500? You \nget a car that breaks down all the time. So the welfare client, they \nhave a car worth $1,000 or $1,200, it breaks down, they cannot get to \nwork, they lose their job, and go right back on welfare.\n  We in Iowa raised that to $3,000. Now people on welfare can have a \nlittle better car and be assured they can get to work.\n  If you think that is liberal you ought to try Utah. Utah raised the \nvalue of the car, I believe, if I am not mistaken, to $7,000 or $8,000. \nYou can have a car valued at that much and still get AFDC, still \nqualify for AFDC.\n  So these up-front investments are necessary to move people out of \nwelfare and achieve real, long-term savings. I am afraid the Dole-\nPackwood bill is nothing more than just shifting the costs onto the \nState and local taxpayers.\n  In talking with people in Iowa in town meetings, especially with \nboards of supervisors, they know what is going to happen. It is going \nto fall in their lap. This is just going to be a shift down to general \nrelief. Since people will be at the county level, they know these \npeople, then it is going to mean an increase in property taxes. The \nDole-Packwood bill, I think, if nothing else, means that. It is going \nto increase property taxes for people in this country at the local \nlevel and it is not going to provide for any pathway to self-\nsufficiency.\n  Again, to repeat, the goal of reform should be self-sufficiency, so \npeople can get off of welfare and stay off of welfare. The Dole-\nPackwood bill will not do this and it should be rejected. But we should \nwork together to try to change, to modify, to make sure that we have \nlegislation that I believe is more in keeping with what we did in Iowa. \nThe bill that Senator Daschle has come up with, I think, takes a \ndifferent approach--realistic, forward-looking, profamily, and prokids. \nThe Work First proposal requires a contract between welfare recipients \nand the State similar to that in the Iowa Family Investment Plan.\n  Now the Dole-Packwood bill also has a contract in it, but it does not \nsay what the contract has to do. The bill over here, the Work First \nproposal, does set that out. The Work First plan also offers the Iowa \nplan as one of three models that States may adopt in their effort to \nreform the current system and move recipients from the welfare rolls to \nthe job rolls. In other words, under the Daschle bill, the Work First \nbill, if a State wants to adopt the Iowa plan, it can do so and not be \nburdened with any Federal regulations, Federal rules. They do not have \nto come under the other purviews of the welfare bill.\n  As I say, it is one of three: That; the Oregon plan; and I believe \nthe Riverside, CA, plan.\n  So this may be someplace where both sides can work together and that \nis to make sure at least the contract is one that is realistic, that is \nbinding, that holds the recipient to be responsible from day one, but \nalso holds the State responsible. What we have done in Iowa, under the \ncontract, once that initial assessment is done and a contract is worked \nout, the recipient signs it and the State signs it. The State has to \nlive up to its side of the bargain, too; in other words, to provide \nchild care, transportation, we provide education, tuition--that type of \nthing. Whatever is the best for that person, to get that person through \nthe program and into self-sufficiency.\n  As I said, we found in most cases it does not take 2 years. I think, \nif you have 2 years, as I said before, the maximum becomes the minimum. \nBut every contract, every contract in Iowa, has a time limit. And every \ncontract should have a time limit--whatever time it requires to get \nthat person through and into self-sufficiency.\n  There are always going to be the hard cases. The 18-year-old girl who \nhas two children and has no high school education. One of her kids is \nseverely disabled. She may have a disability herself. And she may have \nno family support anywhere. To think that that person may get through \nin 2 years is foolish. It may take 4 years. It may take 5 years. Those \nare the hard cases. But the vast majority of cases will take less than \n2 years. That is why I say it has to be individualized and not ``one \ncookie-cutter plan fits all.''\n  So instead of simply slashing welfare and dumping all the \nresponsibility and all the bills onto the States and local taxpayers, I \nbelieve the Work First plan represents real reform and real change.\n  Like the Iowa plan, the Work First plan demands responsibility from \nday one, not after 2 years. And it ends the ``something for nothing'' \nsystem of today with one that truly turns welfare into work. The Work \nFirst plan is built on the concepts of accountability, responsibility, \nopportunity, and common sense. It will liberate families from the \nwelfare trap and it will strengthen families and help today's welfare \nrecipients finally walk off this dead end of dependence and on the road \nto self-sufficiency.\n  Mr. President, I close by urging all my colleagues to please take a \nclose look at the Iowa plan, what the Iowa plan has done, the success \nit has had. I hope we can work together in a bipartisan fashion. We \nhave two bills out here now. I am sure amendments will be offered and \ndebated. They should be.\n  What we are talking about here is nothing less than perhaps the most \nprofound change in social policy that we have had in 20, 30, 40 years, \nperhaps--maybe more. We should not take it lightly. We should not rush \nto judgment. But we should not be stampeded into making changes that \nare not based upon sound data and experience that we have had.\n  We should not be making decisions just based upon anecdotal stories \nor ideology or what feels good or what makes a sound bite or what \nscores the most political points. This is a very serious debate long \noverdue. It should be thoughtful and thorough. Amendments ought to be \noffered. I have some that I will offer maybe to both--I do not know--\nthat will incorporate a lot of what the Iowa plan does because I think \nit does make common sense. There are some other provisions that other \npeople have worked on that, quite frankly, I like, some that are on the \nother side of the aisle.\n  So I am hopeful that we will do this in a thoughtful and thorough \nmanner. I do not know if we can get it done this week or not. I do not \nintend to filibuster it. I have never heard anybody talk about a \nfilibuster. But I do believe it ought to be thorough and thoughtful and \ntake whatever time is necessary. If it takes more than a week, maybe it \nought to take more than a week. I do not know. I hope we have our \ndebates and have our amendments, and vote them up or down. Hopefully, \nwe can come up with a welfare reform program that truly is \nrevolutionary. I do not think that this Congress could do any better \nfor the American people than adopting what we have done in Iowa to move \nfamilies off of welfare.\n  I thank the Chair.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n          [From the Burlington Hawk-Eye (Iowa), Feb. 8, 1995]\n\n                      Welfare Reform Shows Promise\n\n  (FIP program: More welfare recipients getting jobs under new rules \n              designed to get people off the public dole)\n\n                            (By Roger Munns)\n\n       Des Moines.--Welfare recipients in a test group who still \n     get benefits under Iowa's old law are much less likely to \n     have jobs than the majority who get benefits under a reform \n     law, according to state officials.\n       Only 18 percent of a test group of families who get Aid to \n     Families with Dependent Children have members with part-time \n     jobs.\n       ADC was replaced last year with the Family Investment \n     Program in which recipients must sign a contract detailing \n     how and when they'll get off the dole.\n       The 18 percent compares to 33 percent of FIP recipients who \n     have jobs.\n       ``To me, this says that the families under the old policy \n     are continuing to behave in the way they always did,'' said \n     Deb Bingaman, welfare reform waiver coordinator for the \n     state. ``That percentage isn't increasing.''\n       When Iowa switched to the new law last year, some \n     recipients were deliberately selected, at random, to be part \n     of a control \n\n[[Page S 11765]]\n     group that still receives AFDC. There are 2,158 families in the test \n     group, all from nine counties: Polk, Black Hawk, Clinton, Des \n     Moines, Jackson, Jones, Linn, Pottawattamie and Woodbury.\n       Of those families, only 390 had a member with a part-time \n     job in January. That's the same percentage of AFDC recipients \n     who had jobs before the reforms went into effect.\n       By comparison, almost exactly a third--33.4 percent--of the \n     vast majority of cases who are getting benefits under the new \n     law have outside income. In December 37,925 Iowa families \n     were getting FIP grants, and of those, 12,667 had family \n     members who had jobs.\n       Bingaman said state officials are encouraged by the \n     numbers, since more and more welfare recipients are getting \n     work experience that will help them become self sufficient.\n       The key reason for the disparity is that the new law has an \n     incentive for work. Recipients get to keep higher amounts of \n     outside income before benefits start to decline.\n       ``This encourages people to become involved,'' said John \n     Kneeland, director of welfare services in the Ottumwa region. \n     ``The old system sort of gave things to you with one hand and \n     took them away with the other.''\n       Charles Bruner, director of the Institute for Social and \n     Economic Development in Des Moines, said there hasn't been \n     enough evaluation to determine the success of the new law. \n     But he said the early numbers are encouraging.\n       ``I think Iowa is pretty much a model. It's one of the best \n     efforts to create a ladder out of poverty, and it's showing \n     positive results,'' said Bruner.\n       ``More people are working and more are on welfare, but \n     average grants are less, and it's not costing us any more \n     than the old system. So overall, it looks good.''\n       In addition to the outside income allowances, there are \n     other differences between the old and new laws. Recipients \n     are allowed higher assets without being disqualified, it's \n     easier for two-parent households to qualify, and recipients \n     must sign agreements on how they'll become self sufficient.\n       Those who don't play by the rules have benefits cut off.\n       When the program began, the caseload shot up dramatically, \n     up to a peak of more than 40,600 last April, and has been \n     dropping since. Last December, there were 37,925 families \n     receiving welfare.\n       The average grant was $344.64 in December, and it, too, is \n     declining as people earn more money in their jobs, Bingaman \n     said. By comparison, the average AFDC grant in September 1993 \n     was $373.75. FIP recipients also receive food stamps and \n     medical care.\n       Bingaman said there is no data on the test AFDC group other \n     than the percentage of those with jobs. The state has hired a \n     Washington, D.C., group to conduct research on the test \n     group.\n       Bruner said one factor that might skew the results is \n     Iowa's robust economy.\n       ``Obviously, welfare reform is going to be far better in \n     areas where there's a lot of demand for workers. We're \n     looking at this in a climate of a fairly healthy economy,'' \n     he said.\n       Bingaman concurred, but said the robust economy didn't \n     increase the percentage of those in the test group with jobs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n             [From the Cedar Rapids Gazette, Apr. 17, 1994]\n\n                          This One's Different\n\n       Iowa Senator Tom Harkin is teaming up with conservative \n     Missouri Republican Sen. Christopher Bond to introduce a \n     ``Welfare to Self-Sufficiency Act'' that would limit benefits \n     more than the welfare proposal espoused by President Clinton.\n       Clinton's plan would stop paying benefits after two years. \n     But the Bond-Harkin plan would provide full benefits for \n     three months, reduce them for three months and then stop \n     them.\n       And listen to Harkin's rationale for such a short term: It \n     requires welfare recipients to take responsibility for \n     themselves and their families ``from day one, not year two.'' \n     Harkin said he is concerned ``that a two-year limit on the \n     welfare rolls will actually become a two-year minimum. If \n     people aren't encouraged, or in some cases required, to help \n     themselves, many simply won't.''\n       Key to the plan is a contract between the government and \n     participants that outlines the steps recipients would take to \n     resume self-sufficiency. The plan also allows families to \n     keep more of their earned income and to save money, according \n     to Associated Press. The plan is based on reform already in \n     Iowa and Missouri.\n       Of course, such plans depend a lot on employers creating \n     jobs that people in these circumstances are able to fill. \n     Also, this plan, introduced last Monday, joins a growing list \n     of welfare reform efforts. But it could stand out both for \n     its conservative provisions and its sponsorship by the \n     liberal Tom Harkin.\n       That last point alone could make a difference.

It has become a way of \n     life, a culture, an expectation, a cycle of dependence that \n     has been passed from one generation to the next.\n       The state decided to do something about that cycle last \n     year, and the results are beginning to take hold. About 250 \n     families have been cut off from welfare benefits because they \n     refused to take part in a new program that forces families to \n     take specific steps to wean themselves from welfare.\n       Many taxpayers believe it is long overdue. Some welfare \n     recipients believe it is unfair--particularly to children.\n       At the beginning of this year, most Iowa families that \n     receive Aid to Families with Dependent Children were forced \n     to sign contracts called Family Investment Agreements.\n       The agreement spells out steps that families must take to \n     leave welfare and enter the workforce. In return, families \n     will be able to keep more of their earnings and accumulate \n     more assets without hurting welfare payments. To assist, the \n     state is spreading a safety net that includes such support as \n     child care, job training, education and health insurance.\n       For years, critics have argued that one of the main flaws \n     in the welfare system--not just in Iowa, but nationwide--is \n     that it provides too many incentives to stay on welfare, and \n     makes it too difficult to get off of it.\n       The Iowa program is designed to provide incentives to leave \n     welfare.\n       In addition, the new program provides welfare recipients \n     plenty of opportunities to enroll. They receive written \n     notice before payments are trimmed, then cut off. And people \n     who lose benefits may apply again in six months.\n       But the philosophy seems simple enough: Take steps to find \n     work and the state will help you. But if you won't do \n     anything to help yourself, why should the state be expected \n     to take care of everything?\n       It only seems fair.\n                                                                    ____\n\n               [From the Omaha World-Herald, May 5, 1995]\n\n                   Welfare Contract a Worthwhile Idea\n\n       The idea that welfare should involve form of social \n     contract continues to deserve attention.\n       Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, has introduced a bill in the \n     Senate that reflects ideas from a welfare reform plan enacted \n     by Governor Branstad and the Iowa Legislature. One idea is \n     that welfare isn't run automatic entitlement. A recipient \n     must sign a contract with state government. The contract \n     spells out the services the government will provide, and it \n     contains specific steps to be taken by the recipient to \n     become self-reliant.\n       A similar provision has been included in the welfare reform \n     program under consideration in Nebraska. Jerry Oligmueller of \n     the State Department of Social Services said that recipients \n     would sign a ``self-sufficiency contract'' charting a two-\n     year course to self-sufficiency.\n       Emphasis on personal responsibility, he said, is part of \n     the state's effort to recognize and encourage a change in \n     attitudes about welfare.\n       The idea of changing society's thinking about welfare is \n     all to the good. In the case of people who have no physical \n     or mental ailments, welfare should not be an open-ended \n     arrangement. It's not fair for the government to take money \n     from tax-paying citizens to provide for the permanent support \n     of an able-bodied person. State and federal officials who are \n     trying to re-establish welfare as a temporary, rehabilitative \n     program are doing the right thing.\n                                                                    ____\n\n            [From the Waterloo Courier (Iowa), Oct. 3, 1994]\n\n          Changes in Welfare Rules Fulfill Will of the People\n\n       Iowa taxpayers who have long demanded accountability from \n     welfare recipients started getting it on Saturday.\n       Under reform legislation enacted last year, welfare \n     recipients must sing Family Investment Agreements that detail \n     how and when they will become self sufficient.

Not \n     surprisingly, some have reconsidered and now want to get into \n     the Family Investment Program, as welfare is now known.\n       But a state official said benefits for those people would \n     not be restored until they actually signed a contract with \n     the state. That could take at least a month, according to \n     Gloria Conrad, bureau chief for the Family Investment Program \n     division.\n       Those who made no effort to sign the self-improvement \n     contract by Friday will have their benefits shut off for a \n     minimum of six months.\n       Benefits are being stopped only for people who were in the \n     first wave of recipients contacted six months ago and who \n     have refused to participate in the reform law.\n       The cutoffs will not come as a surprise to any of the \n     affected recipients. Those who failed to respond were given \n     numerous changes--including in-person visits by state Human \n     Services workers whenever possible--to change their minds.\n       ``There aren't really very many who have simply ignored the \n     program,'' said John Newland, a welfare administrator of a \n     10-county area based in Ottumwa. ``But we have had some \n     people who have simply said no, they won't choose to do any \n     of this stuff. The feeling, I guess, was that we were \n     intruding on their own business, that we didn't have the \n     right to tell them what to do. That's their decision to \n     make''\n       Those people have to right to feel that way if they wish, \n     but they don't have a right to expect taxpayers to continue \n     carrying them.\n       But the triumph of the story is not necessarily in who will \n     not benefit. Instead, praise and support should go to the \n     vast majority of recipients who are cooperating, and the \n     people making the program work.\n       About a third of the state's welfare cases have gone \n     through the system and most--more than 12,000--have signed \n     the agreements.\n       To encourage recipients to take jobs, they are now allowed \n     to earn higher wages and still get partial benefits. For the \n     same reason, the average monthly grant is now lower than a \n     year ago--$348 in August compared with $373 in September \n     1993.\n       The Family Investment Program is a shining example of \n     responsible, responsive government.\n       The law's passage last year made it clear that there are \n     limits to the public's patience and obligation for \n     individuals.\n       Its implementation reflects the fact that the General \n     Assembly and the governor are capable of hearing--and \n     delivering--on the values and policies desired by the \n     ``silent majority'' that pays the bills.\n       It sends an irrefutable message that Iowans will help those \n     people in need who show the desire and responsibility to help \n     themselves. And, especially important, the new policy tells \n     that small group of freeloaders who are unwilling to better \n     themselves for the common good that they are--finally and \n     deservedly--on their own.\n\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, could I make a request that those on the \nRepublican side who wish to make opening statements offer them so we \ncan get them in order.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we have begun today in the U.S. Senate a \nhistoric debate. My colleague and friend from Iowa has just said it is \na debate that is, frankly, long overdue. It is a debate about an issue \nthat deeply troubles the American people. As I have traveled in my home \nState of Ohio over the last few years, I have not been able to find \nanyone who thinks that our current welfare system works very well or \nthat it cannot be improved. I have talked to people on welfare. I have \ntalked to people who have been on welfare who are now working in the \nprivate sector. I have talked to other taxpayers. No one, Mr. \nPresident, thinks our current system works.\n  This is truly a monumental task that we have begun today. The tragic \nfact is that there are too many people in this country who are \nliterally trapped in a cycle of welfare dependency.\n  Mr. President, America simply cannot afford to continue in this \ndirection. It is fundamentally, morally wrong that a sizable portion of \nAmericans, a sizable number of Americans, should be excluded from what \nmost of us consider the American mainstream.\n  Mr. President, let me state what I do not mean by ``mainstream.'' I \nam not talking about a narrowly defined lifestyle or conventional set \nof values on controversial issues. That is not what I am talking about. \nWhat I am talking about is the bare essentials of participation in \nAmerican life, holding down a job, being responsible for your own \nchildren, and living in the reasonable expectation of physical safety \nfor you and your loved ones.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support the current welfare reform effort \nthat is being undertaken, for one simple reason. I believe it has the \npotential to help rescue a whole generation of Americans. It will give \nthem the bare essentials of American life, a chance at the American \ndream.\n  If we are to succeed, I believe we must tackle the welfare system in \na truly fundamental and comprehensive way. As we know, Americans on \nwelfare today may get, in addition to AFDC, cash payments and a whole \nhost of other benefits--housing, food stamps, job training, education, \nchild care, and other services. These are things that, as we discuss \nthe issue, most of us just lump together and refer to as ``welfare.''\n  Mr. President, some would have us focus our welfare reform efforts \njust on AFDC or just on a few of these programs. I think to limit \nreform just to that would be a mistake because it really does not go \nfar enough. It would not go far enough to solve the problem. To solve \nthe problem that we face, we need to tackle the welfare system in its \ntotality.\n  The welfare reform approach I am supporting would block grant as much \nas is prudently possible of the Federal welfare responsibility back to \nthe States. I believe that we should end the decades-long practice of \ndictating welfare policy from the Federal level. Why? Because, if you \nlook at the welfare debate today, one key fact becomes astoundingly \nclear. We just do not know the answers. We know what does not work. We \nhave seen that for over 30 years. But we really do not know what works \nnor what will change things.\n  We have heard on the floor, and we just heard from our colleague from \nIowa examples of what his State is doing. We have heard examples of \nwhat other States are doing. And many of these, I think, are great \nideas. But we have not been about these changes long enough that we in \nCongress should feel confident enough that we should turn to a State \nand say, ``This is the one way to reform welfare. This is how you have \nto do it. This is what we know works.'' Because the truth is, Mr. \nPresident, we do not know for sure what will work. We have had 30 years \nof experience in knowing what does not work.\n  We as a nation are only just beginning to come to grips with the \ncollapse of this decades-old experiment with welfare. Most people \nconcede that this experiment has failed, but we have not developed a \nnew consensus on what kind of system should take its place.\n  Mr. President, as a Senator who has served in State and local \nelective office for a number of years, let me say that I do not--I \nrepeat, I do not--believe that it is bad. I do not think it is bad that \nwe do not yet have a consensus, because the lack of a new consensus \ngives the States a great opportunity to experiment; an opportunity to \nexperiment, though, Mr. President, only if we allow them to do that.\n  Mr. President, welfare today is an area which we know does not work. \nOur current policy does not work and has not worked for decades. But \nwhat we do not know is what works. We do not have the answers on how to \nget people off welfare onto work and into the American mainstream with \na chance at the American dream.\n  Some States, as we have discussed, have experimented on welfare, but \nwe do not have enough history on these experiments to totally judge \ntheir success. As we used to say when I was a county prosecutor and we \nwere waiting for a jury to come back with the verdict, the jury is \nstill out. We just do not have the experience level to give us enough \nconfidence to impose on the States mandates. To impose these programs \non all States, to impose Federal uniformity of programs we are not sure \nof would be, I think, a serious mistake and would not be true and \nmeaningful welfare reform. It is not the way to change the direction of \nthis country.\n  That is why, Mr. President, this is exactly the kind of problem that \nought to be turned back to the States. By focusing on federally written \nprograms and forcing State welfare policy to conform to a mold shaped \nin Washington, DC, Congress in the past has seriously weakened the \nability of States to adapt, to experiment, to find out what \n\n[[Page S 11767]]\nreally works to solve their own problems in their own way and maybe to \npoint out useful directions for other States.\n  It is very important to note that in the kind of block grants I \nsupport, we stop telling the States step by step how to do welfare. We \nwant to tell the States, this is what we should do; here is the purpose \nyou can spend the money on; but we in Washington will no longer dictate \nthe means you can use to achieve that purpose.\n  In some of the block grant proposals that are before us, there is \neven some additional flexibility. States can take up to 30 percent of \nthe block grant and use it for any welfare purpose at all, still \nserving people but giving the States that needed flexibility.\n  Make no mistake about it: Welfare needs are different from State to \nState. They are even different from county to county. The needs of my \nAdams County, OH, and Cuyahoga County, OH, are fundamentally different. \nThey both have needs; they both have people on welfare; but they are \nfundamentally different counties with different problems.\n  Some counties may need more child care, some may need more child \nwelfare service. I favor an approach that gives Governors the \nflexibility to solve problems. I think that would be a huge step \nforward.\n  Let me summarize it this way. I think our goal should be not to fund \nprograms. Rather, our goal should be to solve problems, to get people \noff welfare and into the work force. That should be the goal in any \nwelfare reform bill that this Senate adopts.\n  As we move forward in this debate, we must be careful not to succumb \nto the desire to tell States how to meet the goals in these block \ngrants. We must be vigilant and avoid a refederalization of welfare \nthrough the back door. We cannot on the one hand say the States have \nthis flexibility and then on the other hand tell the States what to do. \nWe cannot on the one hand say that a problem in the past has been that \nWashington has mandated too much, and now that the complexion of the \nSenate and the Congress has changed, we who happen now to be in the \nmajority party know best and we should write the dictates and mandates \nfrom Washington. That, in my opinion, would be a mistake.\n  I find some of these mandates that have been discussed to be quite \ntroubling. We are just beginning to unburden the States from a Federal \nsystem that for too long has prevented States from making changes, \ntrying new approaches. It would be a serious mistake to move from that \nsystem to a system in which we force States to implement various reform \nmeasures prescribed by the Congress.\n  Let me give you a couple of examples. I think we all agree that when \na large portion of the children in society do not have two parents, \nsociety is going to be a lot worse off. We agree that America would be \na better place if there were fewer out-of-wedlock births. When two-\nthirds of the children in some of our major cities--two-thirds, Mr. \nPresident--are born outside of marriage, we are ensuring permanent \npoverty and hopelessness for a very large group of young Americans. The \nresult will be extremely dangerous not only to those children but to \nAmerican society.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, half of all teenage \nunwed mothers are on public assistance within 1 year of having their \nfirst child and within 5 years, 77 percent are on public assistance--77 \npercent. Children who do not have fathers around are five times more \nlikely to be poor than children who do. Those are the facts. They are \n10 times more likely to be extremely poor, to live in the kind of \ngrinding poverty from which it is very hard to ever escape.\n  Do we have a Federal cure for illegitimacy? Are we in this Chamber \ncertain enough about whatever that cure might be that we are prepared \nto mandate it and to say every State has to impose it?\n  Let me tell you, I know one Senator who is not so sure of what that \nanswer is.\n  In this context, let us talk for a moment about the proposed family \ncap. In New Jersey, they have experimented with denying additional \nwelfare benefits to mothers who have more children on welfare. An \ninitial study released late in 1994, which has been referred to on this \nfloor, seemed to indicate the New Jersey family cap had caused a \nserious decline in the birth rate to welfare mothers, somewhere between \n19 and 29 percent.\n  So the family cap is a great idea, right? Well, hold on a minute. We \nhave another study, and this study has been referenced in the Chamber \ntoday as well. This study, based on a more complete sample, was \nconducted by Rutgers University. This study indicated that the denial \nof benefits made very little difference in the births, very little \ndifference in behavior of welfare mothers. It found the drop in the \nbirth rate was roughly the same among a control group, women who were \nexempt from the family cap law, as it was among those who were subject \nto the cap.\n  There is also some indication that the New Jersey cap might have led \nto an increase in the number of abortions. This Senator is deeply \nconcerned about that, as I know a number of Senators are. I think it is \na concern that we should not just dismiss.\n  Clearly, we do not yet know what works in this area. Therefore, now \nis not the time to impose Federal uniformity based on guesswork. We are \nin the middle of a controversy that is far from resolved, and what we \nneed more than anything else is facts. State experimentation will help \nus find these facts.\n  Mr. President, are we certain enough about the wisdom of the family \ncap at this time, at this place to write it into Federal law? Are we \ncertain enough to make every single State live by it? I know one \nSenator who is not.\n  Let me turn to another issue, and that is the work requirement. If \nthere is one thing that will change welfare more than anything else, it \nis getting people to work. The statistics are overwhelming, that if an \nindividual can get a job and hold that job for any reasonable period of \ntime, the odds are that person then becomes a part of the mainstream. \nPart of them has the opportunity for the American dream. And that \nperson may not have that same job in a year, year and a half, but if \nthey get the first job and are able to hold it, it makes a fundamental \ndifference.\n  So there is more we can do. Debate has already indicated Senators on \nboth sides clearly agree about the necessity of work. We all agree that \nwork should be a condition for receiving public assistance. But I \nbelieve--I want to put out one cautionary comment at this time as we \nbegin this debate--it is important we make the work requirement \nachievable by the States.\n The work requirement will have to be tough, but it will also have to \nbe believable and achievable. In short, a strong work requirement has \nto work.\n\n  Mr. President, I think one way that we can encourage work, the most \neffective way, is through the block grant proposal that is in front of \nus. By doing this, States will clearly have a direct incentive to get \npeople off welfare and to allow them to become workers. This pressure \nwill make a difference. Mr. President, tough choices on how to divide \nup a no longer unlimited stream of Federal dollars will cause the \nStates to become innovative, to become bold, to experiment, and, I \nthink, ultimately to learn from the experience of other States as well. \nAnd that will make a difference.\n  Mr. President, when you are a government with limited welfare \ndollars, and you are trying to reduce your welfare caseload, you are \ngoing to start looking at the people who are able-bodied and refuse to \nwork. And by necessity, States will have to have a strong work \nrequirement.\n  I think the spending cap will also help us reduce the tide of out-of-\nwedlock births as well. Mr. President, fiscal pressure caused by the \nspending cap is going to do a great deal to focus people's attention on \nthis tremendous problem of illegitimacy. As I mentioned before, the \nFederal Government does not know how to make people act responsibly, \nbut we do know this, a State with limited resources and a serious \npoverty problem will have to make the wisest possible use of its \nlimited resources.\n  What is the best way, Mr. President, to balance our two goals, the \ngoal of the need to help children who are born out of wedlock, help \nthem, and the need at the same time to discourage people from having \nchildren born out of \n\n[[Page S 11768]]\nwedlock? I am not sure any of us really know. But I believe that \ncapping the block grant proposal with a tough, yet achievable, work \nrequirement will set the States on the road toward finding out.\n  Let me talk about a positive Federal role, Mr. President. There are \nsome areas in which the Federal Government can play a very helpful \nrole. And I would like to talk about one such area right now.\n  We are all angry, as the public is, about the men who father children \nand then run off without paying child support. Fifteen, 20 years ago in \nthe late 1970's, when I was a county prosecuting attorney in Greene \nCounty, in the southwestern part of Ohio, I learned about this problem. \nI had to spend a lot of my time, my staff's time, chasing after these \nbums, trying to locate them, trying to get them to live up to what \nshould have been their obligations. I had some very aggressive \nassistant prosecutors who helped me in this and who learned a great \ndeal, as I did, about this problem. Nancy Nevins, Susan Goldie, they \nheaded up our child support enforcement unit. And we found, as we \ndelved into this problem, how big a problem it was and how oftentimes \nthese absent fathers were individuals who had taken off across the \nState line, almost as if they knew, and I guess many of them did, that \nif they could get across the line and they could go into another State, \nthat it was going to make it much more difficult to get them to live up \nto their obligations.\n  Today, Mr. President, the statistics are staggering. I am told that \n40 percent of the unsolved paternity cases nationwide are unsolved \nbecause the fathers have left the State. In Ohio that figure is closer \nto 45 percent. Clearly, a nationwide paternity data bank would be a big \nhelp to the State officials who are trying to track down these \ndeadbeats. And we might even go further, Mr. President. We might even \nwant to consider a national collection system to collect back child \nsupport from these deadbeats. Mr. President, clearly this is an area in \nwhich Federal coordination would actually help the States and not \nhinder their efforts to reform.\n  But I do believe it remains generally true that the Federal \nGovernment does not have the answers on welfare reform. The Federal \nGovernment, Mr. President, needs to be honest about the real lessons of \nits three decades of failure. The welfare policy of the Federal \nGovernment is intellectually bankrupt and the U.S. Senate needs to put \nit into receivership. The receivers in this case are the 50 States, the \n50 laboratories of democracy, 50 laboratories of reform. Many States, \nas we have already discussed today, are already showing terrific \nleadership in reforming their welfare systems.\n  Mr. President, instead of taking the glimmerings of success of any \nsingle State and then imposing a rigid, absolutely uniform model on \nevery other State, we need to make sure all States continue to \nexperiment. Ohio, to take a single example, has been a leader in the \ndrive for experimentation. Let me just give a couple examples. In 1989 \nOhio received a waiver to try the LEAP program. LEAP stands for \nlearning, earning, and parenting. The LEAP program created incentives \nfor welfare clients to continue and then to complete their high school \nstudies. And that program has met with modest success. In 1991, another \nexample, Mr. President, Ohio received a Federal demonstration waiver \nfor the Parents Fair Share program. That State program made \nnoncustodial parents, parents who do not live with the child, either \nwork or receive job training with a view toward supporting the child. \nIt targeted those individuals.\n  We have had success. Ohio, another example, received a Child of \nOpportunity waiver to help keep the children in school by punishing \nparents for the child's absenteeism. Another program, the Communities \nof Opportunity waiver allowed us to exchange AFDC and food stamp cash \npayments for employment subsidies. We were able to use this waiver to \nget private-sector jobs for welfare clients across the State, \nCleveland, Akron, Columbus, Cincinnati.\n  Another example, 1994, we wanted to decrease the penalties for moving \nfrom welfare to work. We received a micro-enterprise development waiver \nso we could remove some of the limits on the assets, the income of \nwelfare recipients. Early on in the debate I heard the distinguished \nSenator from New York talk about that as being a problem, people not \nbeing able to keep enough of their assets. We encouraged them to move \ninto the work force.\n  Mr. President, what is interesting about all of these examples that I \nhave given, and the Senator from Iowa and my other colleagues have \ngiven today, is not that they are good ideas, though I believe probably \nmost of them are. What is notable is that each State has had to \npetition Washington, DC, for the right to try any of them.\n  The President is now talking about speeding up the waiver process. \nAnd that is a good idea. President Bush, and now President Clinton, \nhave granted waivers. That is absolutely true. And I think that the \nleadership from the top has been to try to get as many of these waivers \ngranted as possible. But I believe that we still have a basic problem. \nAnd that is, the basic problem is, that these waivers are required at \nall, and in a time when we need to encourage not discourage State \nexperimentation in solving problems.\n  I asked one time, Mr. President, our director in Ohio, Mr. Tompkins, \nabout what percentage of the waivers we asked to have granted were \ngranted by the Federal Government? And he told me something very \ninteresting. He said, ``The percentage will be relatively high. The \nproblem is that we generally only ask for a waiver if we have a pretty \ngood indication we are going to get it.'' It does not tell you or does \nnot tell the reader of those statistics how often we wanted to do \nsomething, how often in our own experience we felt, we knew that some \nprogram would work or had a good chance of working and yet we were told \noff the record by the Federal bureaucracy that, ``No, look, don't ask \nus for that because we are just not going to give you that one.'' And \nso when we look at the statistics of waivers being granted, it does \nlook good and it does look high. But what it does not show is the many \ntimes when the State was told, ``Just don't ask about that one because \nwe are not going to grant it.''\n  Now, earlier this year, Mr. President, the Ohio General Assembly \npassed a major welfare reform bill. That bill contains a provision \nsaying that a welfare client who gets a job can keep the first $250, \nplus one-half of the additional income earned for 1 year after starting \nwork--an incentive to ease people off welfare. The goal, again, Mr. \nPresident, is to avoid penalizing the welfare client for trying to work \nin the real economy. To do this, we now need Federal permission. In \nfact, there are 15 other provisions in Ohio's newly passed welfare \nreform package, 15 other ways Ohio wants to experiment to see what \nworks, for which we are awaiting the Federal go-ahead.\n  Mr. President, we have to let the States be more flexible. Arnold \nTompkins, who I referenced earlier, Director of Ohio's Department of \nHuman Services, says he is frustrated by a system that really is too \nmuch like an on/off switch. Our department in Ohio, as is true in other \nStates, is only allowed to help people when the people go on welfare.\n  If you are ``on'' welfare, all kinds of benefits are going to be \navailable to you. If you are ``not on'' welfare, many times nothing is \navailable to you.\n  Mr. Tompkins says that we need an approach that is more like a dimmer \nswitch--a system that allows the human services officials flexibility \nto intervene in helping people to keep them off of welfare before they \ngo on welfare. Maybe helping someone find other resources, Mr. \nPresident, like helping pay their rent or electric bill for a couple of \nmonths, will do a lot more good than waiting for them to be evicted and \nonly then being able to sign them up for the full welfare program. I \nthink it will be more cost-effective, and I think it will work.\n  Mr. President, the States need to stay focused on the overall goal of \nkeeping people off welfare. That is why we should, in addition to \nrewarding States that reduce their welfare case loads, reward States \nthat help their citizens avoid having to go on welfare at all. I intend \nto return to this question later on this week, as the amendment process \nbegins.\n  Mr. President, for 30 years, Congress has created programs and \ntrusted the \n\n[[Page S 11769]]\nprograms to work. It is time to move the focus from programs to people.\n  Mr. President, this is the whole welfare reform debate microcosm: Do \nwe want the Congress to write yet another program? Or do we want States \nto come up with solutions?\n  I think the American people do not want another program. They look at \nthe problems of poverty in this country and they want answers. That is \nsomething the Federal Government really just does not have.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to be a participant in the Senate's very \nhistoric welfare reform debate. It offers some real hope for a solution \nto America's social crisis. That is why I intend to work over the next \nfew days with my colleagues on the floor to ensure that the bill we \npass does as much as it possibly can to let the States succeed in truly \nreforming welfare.\n  Mr. President, thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise, first off, in support of the \nDole substitute. And I want to congratulate the leader, the leadership, \nthe leadership of the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator \nPackwood, and many others who contributed to this bill and taking what \nwas, by all accounts in the newspaper, an issue that was dead and gone \nfor the summer and maybe for a long time after that and resurrecting \nthat issue and bringing it to the floor with, I think, a very solid \nbase of support on the Republican side of the aisle, and I am hopeful a \nvery strong base of support on the Democrat side of the aisle.\n  I think we have a good bill here, one that can attract bipartisan \nsupport, one that, the majority leader has said, is not veto bait--at \nleast yet--at the White House.\n  I hope that is a good start, and I hope over the next several days we \ncan work in a bipartisan fashion to structure a bill that will truly \nmake substantive and great reform in an area that probably needs it \nworse than any other single area in Government--not just for the \ntaxpayers, who we hear so much about, but for the people in the welfare \nsystem.\n  I have been fortunate enough to be able to work on this issue quite \nsome time now--at least quite some time in my career here in the \nCongress. I worked 3 years ago in crafting a bill that came to the \nRepublican position in the House of Representatives in the House Ways \nand Means Committee, and it became the basis for the bill that passed \nthe House, which I am very proud of. It was a good bill.\n  I think what we have done here in the Senate is a very good bill. In \nsome respects, it goes farther. It is more dramatic than what the House \nRepublican measure has done, particularly in the area of food stamps. \nFood stamp reform here is at least as tough--the reforms themselves. \nBut we in the Senate in this bill give the States an option to take \nblock grants. It is their option. In the House bill, they cannot do \nthat unless they have electronic benefits transfer.\n  So, in a sense, we have gone one step further here in the Senate than \nthey have in the House bill. The AFDC work requirement--the standards \nare tougher here in the Senate bill than they are in the House bill. \nThe work requirements are equally as tough as the House bill.\n  So you could even make the argument that the AFDC provisions of this \nbill are tougher than the House bill. I think that is a very big plus. \nIt is a look at certain areas and to say we have come out, after \nreviewing what the House has done, and think we can go a little \nfarther. In some areas we do not go as far as the Senator from Texas, \nSenator Gramm, and Senator Faircloth from North Carolina would like to \ngo; frankly, as far as I would like to go. I think we can go farther, \nand should, in doing block grants.\n  Child nutrition programs, school lunch programs, and the like--I \nthink the reforms done in the House were good, solid reforms, well \nthought out, and actually better targeted the resources at the people \nwho need them. But they turned out to be very controversial measures. \nOne that elicited, I think, a public outcry and one that, I think, we \ndetermined in putting this bill together was better left to maybe the \nnext round of welfare reform, which may not be too far in the offing, \nbut to focus in on the things that we can accomplish, hopefully, in a \nbipartisan manner, and that is focusing in on AFDC, what most people \nconsider welfare.\n  It is only a part of the welfare pot. Some would say it is 7 percent. \nOthers would say it is a little bit more than that. But it is a very \nsmall portion of what we spend on means-tested programs, in other \nwords, programs that are directed toward low-income people. The biggest \nsingle program is Medicaid. That is the largest welfare program, means-\ntested entitlement program. Most people think AFDC is second. It is \nnot. The second largest means-tested program is SSI, which I will talk \nin somewhat detail about during my opening statement.\n  Then we get down to programs like food stamps; on down the list is \nAFDC. But AFDC is considered welfare because it is the program that was \ndesigned in 1935 to help mothers with dependent children. It is the \nprogram that gets the most publicity. It is important to reform that \nprogram. But it is no less important to look at the other means-tested \nentitlement programs and appropriated accounts and reform those \nprograms, too, and to make the reforms work together.\n  One of the good planks in this bill is the fact that States can work \ntogether with housing benefits and food stamps and Medicaid and others \nto make sure that when you cut off AFDC benefits, if, in fact, someone \nis cut off, that their food stamp benefits do not go up to compensate \nfor the reduction in the AFDC. So they can work with those two programs \ntogether to make sure one is not offsetting the penalties of the other.\n  Another very good part of this bill, something the Senator from \nMissouri, Senator Ashcroft, has brought to the table and I think is a \nvery good idea, is how the private sector can get more involved in \nproviding welfare; for the States to be able to contract to community \nproviding organizations, including churches, who are in there in the \ncommunity right now doing the work that is necessary to help the poor \nin their community. Why not have them be the local agency that helps \nthat community and the people in that community solve their problems of \npoverty? Why not give them the resources and the responsibility to help \npeople in the community? That is a great idea. It gives flexibility to \nthe States which they have never had before.\n  We know historically in this country what works to help poor people \nget out of poverty. It is not just passing a check. I think, if there \nis anything that we can all agree on, it is that just handing a check \nover to someone does not solve the poverty problem. What helps people \nget out of poverty is not a guaranteed income from the Government, but \nan opportunity to go out and work and earn it for themselves.\n  We know that check does not encourage what we know works, which is \nwork. That guaranteed income does not encourage work. What does \nencourage work is people who care, people who care about that \nindividual and know that they are going through the trouble to take the \ntime to listen. This is no fault of the caseworkers in the welfare \nsystem. They are processing thousands of checks a day. They cannot \nafford and do not have the time. The caseworkers do not have the time \nto sit one on one to go through the life history of the person, whether \nit is a problem with their husband, whether it is a substance abuse \nproblem, or satisfy a problem with their parents, or whatever else; an \nillness. They do not have the time to sit and care. They do not have \nthe resources to do it. We need a system that is more friendly to \npeople who need help, not just saying, ``Well, here is your check. \nLeave us alone. You should be OK. You have been provided for.''\n  Actually, we should start turning this program, this welfare \nbureaucracy, over to the people who live in that community, who see \nthat neighbor at church, who walk past them in the aisle in the grocery \nstore, and who care because a better person in their community means a \nbetter community and a better life for them. Let us use what we know \nworks, and that is people helping people. \n\n[[Page S 11770]]\n\n  That is what we are saying in this bill--let us get it back to the \nfolks who care the most, and it is not us. We say we care a lot. But I \ndo not consider it particularly compassionate on my part to take your \nmoney--the people who are out working in America--and then give it to \nsomebody else who is not working. It may make me feel good that I am \nhelping someone who is poor, who maybe cannot work, who maybe is having \nproblems and needs to get their life together again. That may make me \nfeel good. But that certainly is not compassionate.\n  A lot of people around here will define the terms in this debate on \nhow much money we take from some people to give to other people, that \nthe more we take from workers to give to other people, many of whom do \nnot work, the more compassionate we are. I would say, that is not a \nvery good judge of compassion on my part. To know how much money I give \nout of my salary to my church or to the community group--that is \ncompassion. That is money otherwise I could spend. But taking other \npeople's money is not compassion. That is how we have measured \ncompassion in this country for a long, long time. I find it absolutely \nunbelievable that we do.\n  I tell you, it would be very easy for me to just hand out all the \nmoney that I can get my hands on around here. It is fun. We enjoy doing \nthat. But it is not compassion. More than anything else, it is not \nhelping anybody. I think we, hopefully, have come to that determination \nin this body; that just handing it out makes a bunch of people who pay \nfor the program very resentful and the people who receive the money \nvery dependent. It does not help either.\n  Let us get back to something that we know works--getting it back to \nthe local level, getting it back to the people who care. And that is \nwhat this program is all about. Some will say, ``Well, it is just \npassing the buck.'' My initial response to that is, if the buck is \nbeing misspent here, let us at least give someone else a try. Maybe \npassing the buck in this case is the best thing to do because we know \nwhat the current system is doing.\n  The Senator from New York, who knows more about welfare than anyone \nin this Chamber, having studied it for years and years, presented the \ncase very well for why the system does not work. I mean, the statistics \ndo not lie about the problems that we have in poverty in America today \nand the growth in illegitimacy and the lack of work in the inner cities \nwhere welfare is the highest, the destruction of communities, the \nincrease in crime, the destruction of the family, lower rate levels of \neducation among the poor. I mean the scenario is very clear what is \ngoing on here. We know it is not working.\n  The question is how much courage do we have to say that what we have \ntried has failed? What we know historically in this country that has \nworked has not been given a chance, at least from the Federal \nperspective, in a long time. Let us try that.\n  You will hear this quote often throughout the discussion on welfare. \nIn fact, I have heard it many times already in this body. But I think \nit is so appropriate. It is such a good codification of the American \nspirit and what the greatness of America is all about in solving the \nproblems of the people who are of lesser means, and that was de \nTocqueville's analysis of America.\n  When he came to this country over 100 years ago and looked at the \nprivate sector, the institutions, the volunteer organizations, the \npeople who went out of their way to help their neighbors, the sense \nthat Americans cared for each other and supported each other, there \nwere not the Government programs--there was no AFDC Program when de \nTocqueville was here, no SSI Program. There was none of that. Not to \nsay those programs are bad, but none of that was here. It was private \ncharity, people helping people. And de Tocqueville commented that \n``America is great because it is good.'' And when America ceases to be \ngood, it will no longer be great.\n  We need to draw on the goodness of people. We need to entrust the \npeople to be good. That is what this bill is all about. It says that \nwe, standing on high, are not going to dictate what is good for \neveryone but in fact put the resources back into the community so those \npeople can determine what is good for themselves and their neighbors.\n  It is a very dramatic turnaround in policy in this country. It is one \nthat will frighten a lot of people because a lot of people think, as \nthe Senator from Kansas, the majority leader, said, there will be a \nrace to the bottom; that States will race to the bottom and they will \ncut benefits on everybody, as if Governors and State legislators have \nlittle care about the welfare of the poor in their State but we in \nWashington care supremely for them.\n  I do not think anybody truly believes that, but that is the comment \nyou are going to hear many times repeated here, that States simply will \nnot provide for the poor; that we cannot trust them; that they will try \nto export them to another State, which will in turn try to export them \nto another State, and they will go to another State. I do not know what \nall is being suggested, but that is pretty much how it is going to play \nout.\n  I do not think that is going to happen. I think there are a lot of \nStates--the Senator from Iowa got up and talked about how wonderful a \njob Iowa is doing in reforming the program. And I would say there is \nnothing in the bill the Senator from Oregon and the majority leader \nhave put forward to stop Iowa from doing it. In fact, it would provide \nmore flexibility to Iowa. I do not understand what he thinks the \ntrouble is, but it would enable Iowa to do more that works.\n  I think this is the mentality. The problem is we know, or I know that \nthis works in Iowa, and therefore I am going to tell everybody this is \nwhat they have to do. Well, just because it works in Iowa does not mean \nit is going to work in Alaska or Pennsylvania or anywhere else. And it \nhas been working in Iowa for 1 year, so now we should take the Iowa \nexperiment and tell everybody to do this?\n  What if Pennsylvania has a good program, and we have some good things \nin practice, and what if we made Iowa do that? What if we told Iowa: \nYou cannot do what you are doing anymore because we in Washington now \nthink something works in Pennsylvania and we should make you do that. \nThe Senator from Iowa, I am sure, would have objection to that. And you \nknow what? He would be right in objecting.\n  So I do not think that is a very serious objection to this bill. This \nbill is one that I would think Members who come from States that like \nthe welfare program they have, that have popular support for it, would \nembrace it, would embrace this bill as an idea whose time has come. We \ndo a lot in this bill. We reform AFDC. We require work. We have some \nillegitimacy programs, not as far as I would go, but we will have \namendments and we will have good debates on that here on the Senate \nfloor.\n  It provides the flexibility that I discussed, which I think is so \nimportant to States and communities, to deal with it. It ends the \nentitlement to AFDC; allows States to determine who is eligible for \nthose benefits. I think it is very important to do that.\n  We reform the school lunch programs and nutrition programs, child \nnutrition programs. We block grant job training and day care, and we do \nit, as I think everyone will agree, with a substantial amount on child \nsupport enforcement, including interstate enforcement of child support \norders, which, as the Senator from Ohio commented earlier, is \nabsolutely essential if we are going to get our arms around the problem \nof over $50 billion in uncollected child support.\n  Let me repeat that: $50 billion are owed mostly by fathers to support \ntheir children and is simply uncollectable because we do not track \nthat.\n  I want to move on to another area where I hope we can have agreement, \nan area of welfare that as I mentioned before is the second largest \nsingle welfare program in America, and that is the SSI Program.\n  The SSI Program was created back in 1974. It is the Supplemental \nSecurity Income Program. As I said before, it is the second largest \nmeans-tested entitlement program, second to Medicaid. In 27 States, the \naverage child SSI payment is greater than the AFDC payment for a family \nof four. So if you have a child on SSI, you get more money in 27 States \nthan a family of four on AFDC. This is a big dollar program, and as you \ncan see, it is growing, particularly since the late 1980's, at a \n\n[[Page S 11771]]\ntremendous rate, close to $30 billion--in fact, as of 1994, it is over \n$30 billion this year.\n  AFDC payments, as we have discussed here, in 1994 figures, are around \n$17 billion; SSI, as you can see there, almost $28 billion. Federal \noutlays in the year 2000, if we do nothing, for AFDC are projected to \nbe $20 billion. That is $3 billion more than today. On the other hand, \nSSI is going to go up to about $43 billion--a much faster growing \nprogram, and SSI does not get a lot of the ink.\n  An individual cannot receive SSI and AFDC simultaneously, but members \nof an AFDC family may receive SSI benefits. That results in a situation \nthat was quoted in an article here earlier, the Rivera family of \nBoston. Eulalia Rivera has 16 children, 89 progeny, and they collect in \nbenefits from the Federal Government between $750,000 and $1 million a \nyear in means-tested welfare benefits. Most of that benefit, by the \nway, is not AFDC. It is SSI, supplemental security income.\n  What is this program, SSI?\n  Well, the program was created back in 1974, which was intended to be \na work supplement for people who were disabled and could not work but \ndid not work enough quarters to be able to qualify for Social Security \ndisability. I want to differentiate in the discussion here between SSI, \nwhich is supplemental security income, and SSDI, which is disability \nincome out of the Social Security trust fund. SSI is not out of the \nSocial Security trust fund. It is out of the general fund. People do \nnot have to have any work history to be able to collect.\n  Who qualifies for SSI? Well, the disabled, the elderly, the blind, \ndrug addicts and alcoholics, children. You might ask: Well, wait a \nminute. Why are children covered under an act that was created to \nsupplement income for people who are not able to work? Children \nobviously do not earn income anyway, so why do we have a program here \nin place to support children who do not earn income?\n That is a good question to ask. I do not think there was ever a good \nanswer to it at the time it was created.\n\n  But it has evolved over to say, well, it is used because parents of \npeople with disabilities cannot work, and so it indirectly supplements \ntheir income. Of course, you lose that point because a lot of parents \ndo not work anyway, at least second parents do not work where the \nmothers or fathers do not work if you have a primary income earner.\n  Nevertheless, that is in place. You can use the argument it is there \nbecause there are medical needs for the people who are disabled and you \nneed the cash to pay for that, except for the fact that if you qualify \nfor SSI, you also qualify for Medicaid, which, of course, pays your \nmedical benefits. So, in a lot of cases SSI is a nice chunk of change. \nAnd it is, in fact, a $458-a-month Federal benefit per child.\n  Now, we have reforms in this bill that address three areas of SSI: \nchildren on SSI; drug addicts and alcoholics; and immigrants, aliens, \nsponsored aliens in particular.\n  Let me first talk, if I can, about children. It is a controversial \narea to talk about, one that a lot of folks do not like to address. \nMost people do not like the fact of targeting disabled children and \nsay, ``Why do we want to cut off benefits to children who are \ndisabled?'' I would suggest to you that the leader's proposal does not \ncut off benefits to children who are truly disabled. In fact, that is \nthe whole point.\n  If you look at what has gone on in the past few years with the number \nof children receiving SSI, in 1990 there were 300,000 children on SSI. \nThat number was fairly flat from the 1970's through 1990, I mean, \nincreasing gradually but not substantially. In 1990, 300,000; to \n900,000 by 1995, which is this year, and they expect another 200,000 \npeople on the caseloads. You will have 1.1 million kids, estimated, by \nthe year 2000, 1.4 million on SSI.\n  You say, ``Wait a minute. What has happened here that we have had \nthis explosion of children on SSI rolls?'' There was a decision made by \nthe U.S. Supreme Court in the Zebley decision, which changed the \ncriteria for which children could be eligible for SSI. This is sort of \nan amazing little thing that was not well known and is becoming more \nwell known. That is why you see these numbers go up. Before, you had to \nhave a severe disability to be able to receive these benefits. You had \nto be mentally retarded, you know, or have cerebral palsy or some \ndebilitating disease or illness or condition that would require the \nGovernment to support this child.\n  No longer. The new criterion is called an individual functional \nassessment. And what is an individual functional assessment? They \nactually go in and talk to the child and try to figure out if their \nbehavior is--this is the standard--age appropriate. So if you have age \nand appropriate behavior--who here has not?--but if you have age and \nappropriate behavior, you now qualify for $458 a month. That is true.\n  So, what is happening? I am sure this will not be a surprise to a \nwhole lot of people here. What teachers and pediatricians and social \nworkers are saying is that SSI puts marginally disabled or nondisabled \nchildren on the dole for their life, hides children's real problems, \nsuch as abusive or neglectful parents, and results in creating a class \nof people who are at a very early age determined disabled when their \ndisability is not such that they should be labeled disabled.\n  Are we helping these children? Most of the people who look at this \nprogram say, no, we are not. We are not helping these children at all \nby labeling them as ``disabled.''\n  Most of these people that have come on since the Zebley decision in \n1990, two-thirds of them, in fact, have come on because of a mental \nimpairment. Learning disabilities; a learning disability qualifies you \nfor $458 a month; attention deficit syndrome, $458 a month.\n  Let me tell you a couple of comments from school administrators. This \nis a school administrator in New York Central Park East Secondary \nSchool. ``Parents whose children have minimal handicaps try to get \ntheir children into special education classes so they can qualify for \nSSI.''\n  Here is a student at one of the schools in a New York City elementary \nschool. She is acting out her tale with dolls. This was a play-acting \nthing that she was going through in the school. She described a mother \nof four who had adopted two more children. Although the new siblings \nwere not working out, the mother planned to keep them anyway, the girl \nexplained, because she wanted the extra money in SSI payments that they \nwere bringing in. ``[The child who described this] is a special \neducation student. She doesn't understand much,'' says school \npsychological aide, Beth Mahaney, ``but she understands how the system \nworks.''\n  Disability checks are there to help replace lost earnings. And what \nhave we turned it into? Again, parents do not need this money for \nmedical supplies. Attention deficit syndrome does not require medical \nsupplies, and a lot of these mental conditions do not require it. And \nif they did, again, Medicaid is there to provide for it.\n  This is a program that harms children. One of the ways mentioned \nearlier that it harms is that it masks abusive and neglectful parents. \nA lot of the problems--and we have a caseworker or a psychologist who \nhas done a lot of work with SSI for kids come in and talk to me. She \ncannot give me any of the names of the kids because of confidentiality, \nbut she has given me a list of examples of abuse, horrible abuse of \nthese children. As a result of the parent's abuse, the parents get $458 \na month because their child is so messed up because of them.\n  Is that not a great reward for parents who abuse their kids? They get \na check. In fact, a Philadelphia psychiatrist, Kenneth Carroll told the \nWashington Post,\n\n       Many of the problems these children manifest are largely \n     traceable to parental neglect or abuse. Behavior and \n     emotional problems or conduct disorders are directly \n     attributable to inadequate parenting and have often been \n     called disabilities. And the parents are receiving a cash \n     award for having achieved the problem.\n\n  What the Packwood bill does, Dole bill does, in fact what the Gramm \nbill does--same thing--it says we are going to eliminate individual \nfunctional assessments. We are going to get back to giving benefits to \nchildren who are truly disabled and stop disabling another generation \nof Americans for all the wrong reasons at a big, big expense of \ntaxpayers' dollars and of children's lives.\n  The next area we are going to get into in SSI reform is expenditures \non \n\n[[Page S 11772]]\ndrug addicts and alcoholics. Yes, believe it or not, if you are so \naddicted to drugs and alcohol that you can no longer work, you can get \na check from the Federal Government, $458 a month in benefits because \nyou are so addicted to heroin or alcohol that you can no longer work. \nThese are the numbers.\n  See, in dollars spent, we spent $14 million in 1985 on drug addicts \nand alcoholics. In 1990, it was $84 million. In 1994 it was $433 \nmillion, and climbing. You might say, what is the reason for the \ndramatic increase in these numbers? There are a couple. Let me give you \nprobably the biggest. This started under the Bush administration, so it \nhas bipartisan blame, but it has been continued, in fact expanded, \nunder the Clinton administration.\n  What is this program that I talk about that is responsible for this \ndramatic growth in this program? You see the dollar growth. Let me show \nyou the number of people. We were at 5,000 drug addicts and alcoholics \nin 1985 in this program, 5,000. Ten years later 120,000 people are on \nthis program. Two years from now it will be almost 200,000 people on \nthis program. And you can see numbers going up and up.\n  You may say, what is causing this? Is alcoholism and drug addiction \ngoing up? No. That has not gone up dramatically. If you look at some of \nthose numbers, the numbers have leveled off and, in many cases, gone \ndown. So why the increase? Well, it is because of a program that was \ninstituted by the Bush administration on a pilot basis, but has now \nbecome a program that is all over the place in the United States and \nmost of the major cities already.\n It is an outreach program. You say, an outreach program? Yes, an \noutreach program. We now spend Federal dollars to go out to the \ncommunities, to go into the homeless shelters, to go into the clinics, \nto go into the streets and the alleys and find drug addicts and \nalcoholics so that we can give them money.\n\n  It is working. The program is working. We are finding them, and we \nare giving them money. Now, you could say, OK, what is the next logical \nquestion one would ask? We are going to go out and find them and give \nthem money.\n  What would be the next thing you would ask? I would ask, are you \nhelping these people? Is it working? Are people being helped by being \non this program? Well, let me give you the opinion of one person who \ntestified before the Aging Committee this year. In fact, he has \ntestified in the past. A person, by the way, who has done a lot of work \non this issue and whose ideas are partly reflected in this bill by \nSenator Cohen of Maine. It is Bob Cote, who runs a drug and alcohol \nhalfway house in Denver, CO, says:\n\n       Our compassion literally kills them. I know of 41 \n     individuals who received SSI checks and died from the binge \n     they went on. Others just go on drinking it month after \n     month. They call the first day of the month ``Christmas \n     Day,'' because it is when the checks come. They take those \n     checks directly to the bars, and when the money is gone, they \n     are back in my shelter. Taxpayers should not be subsidizing \n     addictions.\n\n  There is an article--a series of articles, in fact--by the Baltimore \nSun, about this program. Not only, again, is it a fast-growing program, \nbut what is the impact on the people in the program? Bob Cote will tell \nyou people are dying. What will Shirley Chater say? Shirley Chater is \nthe Administrator of the Social Security Administration. When she \ntestified before the Ways and Means Committee last year on this subject \nand I asked her, ``In the history of the drug addicts and alcoholics \nprogram under SSI, how many people have you documented that have been \ncured, have received the check, gone in and got the required treatment, \ngotten off the program, stopped the checks, and have gone on to \nproductive lives?'' Do you know what her answer was? ``In the 20-year \nhistory of the program, documented cases of recovery are zero.'' Zero \ndocumented cases of recovery.\n  Now, does this program work? Are we helping drug addicts and \nalcoholics? Let me give you a couple of examples of people.\n  This is from a Baltimore Sun article, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nAddicts Squander Checks on Drugs, Alcohol--Your Cash Supports Abusers' \n                                 Habits\n\n                  (By Jim Haner and John B. O'Donnell)\n\n       They found Delmont Williams' body in an alley off Harlem \n     Avenue, lying under the bald branches of a withered willow \n     tree, staring up at the afternoon sky through dead eyes on \n     ``check day.''\n       He had enough alcohol and heroin in his veins to intoxicate \n     three men.\n       And you paid for it.\n       The homeless Army veteran overdosed with money from a \n     Social Security program that doles out monthly checks to 8 \n     million people who are too old or disabled to work. But \n     250,000 of them are believed to be hardcore substance abusers \n     who routinely squander the cash on drugs and alcohol.\n       Beginning Jan. 27, the new Republican-led majority in \n     Congress will examine the problem in hearings on Capitol \n     Hill. Some are already vowing to give addicts the ax.\n       But they will soon learn that it's easier said than done \n     because of one little-known fact: Most of the addicts and \n     alcoholics on the rolls--perhaps as many as three out of \n     four--are retarded, blind, crippled or suffer from some other \n     disability that would still entitle them to the $458 monthly \n     checks.\n       And Congress has refused for two decades to provide \n     treatment for addicts in spite of a chronic shortage of even \n     the most basic rehabilitation. Fearing that any appearance of \n     coddling drug abusers would invite voter backlash, the \n     nation's lawmakers have ignored social workers and drug \n     counselors who say that intensive long-term treatment is the \n     only answer.\n       ``The first reaction of right-wing conservatives will be to \n     gut the program completely,'' says Dr. Sally Satel, a Yale \n     psychiatrist. ``And the real liberal types won't want it \n     touched. But either of those courses would simply perpetuate \n     this crisis.''\n       Says Pam Rodriguez, a Chicago drug counselor: ``We have \n     never seen a population like this before. For years, Social \n     Security saw its\n      job as to simply write checks. Now, we're getting [people] \n     and they're ruined. We don't even know where to start.''\n       Checks for the drug abusers are costing taxpayers $1.4 \n     billion a year. Most are alcoholics. The vast majority are \n     men. Almost half are black. Their average age is 42. And few \n     ever kick their habits. Rather, they usually end up dead or \n     in prison within seven years of receiving their first check.\n       The case of Delmont Williams is typical.\n       A bearded father of two who drifted from North Carolina to \n     Baltimore, his medical records show that Social Security knew \n     he was a hard-core alcoholic when it mailed him his first \n     check in 1987.\n       His liver was swollen from years of heavy drinking. His \n     heart was congested. Half his teeth were missing. And his \n     skull--bashed in years earlier in a drunken brawl--was webbed \n     with cracks like a piece of glued-together pottery. He \n     suffered from seizures and mental illnesses.\n       There could be little question that he wasn't capable of \n     holding a job, or that he would squander the money Social \n     Security gave him for his fractured skull and manic \n     depression unless he got off drugs and alcohol. But the \n     agency offered him no help. Just a check.\n       ``Delmont knew he was dying,'' says Curtis Mann, a drug \n     counselor at the Health Care for the Homeless free clinic on \n     Park Avenue. ``All the dealers came circling around him on \n     check day like vultures. A week later, he'd crash from \n     whatever dope he was using and feel terrible.\n       ``Those were the times that he'd go looking for help. The \n     problem was that we could never find it for him before that \n     damn check came in the mail on the first of the month and the \n     whole cycle started all over again.''\n       In a city with some 2,400 addicts on the disability rolls \n     and the highest per capita rate of hero-in-related emergency \n     room admissions in the country, there is not even short-term \n     treatment available\n      for nine out of 10 addicts, the nonprofit Abell Foundation \n     found last year.\n       And the kind of in-patient care that removes hard-core \n     addicts from their drug-infested haunts long enough to learn \n     a new way of life is not available at all in Baltimore.\n       Time and again, Delmont Williams was confronted by waiting \n     lists of up to a year, then headed back out onto the street \n     to blow his aid money on blinding binges that ended in trash-\n     strewn alleys, jail cells and hospitals all over the city.\n       On the afternoon of June 1, police came upon his corpse in \n     a West Baltimore alley wrapped in a filthy red polo shirt. \n     Just four hours earlier, he had picked up his $446 check from \n     a small drop at the clinic and cashed it at a nearby liquor \n     store.\n       Delmont Williams died homeless, stoned and alone at 49.\n       ``With his history, there's no way he should have been \n     walking around with that much money in his pocket,'' says \n     Lauren Siegel, a social worker at the free clinic. ``But they \n     gave it to him anyway. Every month, no strings attached, the \n     check would come and Delmont would spend it on drugs and \n     alcohol. Until it finally killed him.''\n\n[[Page S 11773]]\n\n       The money came from a program known as SSI, for \n     Supplemental Security Income--a plan set up by Congress two \n     decades ago with little deliberation or debate. The idea was \n     to provide food, shelter and clothing to disabled poor \n     people.\n       It is one of two such programs for the disabled run by the \n     Social Security Administration. The other is called DI, for \n     Disability Insurance. Since 1956, it has let workers who have \n     paid into Social\n      Security's retirement trust fund draw benefits early if they \n     become injured, ill or addicted.\n       Both programs are in trouble.\n\n\n                           Contradictory law\n\n       Envisioned as modest proposals to help a few million aged \n     and disabled Americans, SSI and DI now cost $65 billion a \n     year--fueling the national debt and sappling the fund that \n     retired Americans rely on to pay their bills.\n       Both are covered by the same set of 1972 disability rules.\n       Even then, thousands of recipients were known drug addicts \n     and alcoholics. But the rules placed few controls on how they \n     spent the money--except that they could not use it to buy \n     drug treatment until they first paid their rent, utilities \n     and living expenses.\n       In a glaring contradiction written into the law, Congress \n     deemed that letting handicapped addicts spend their checks on \n     treatment would violate the philosophical underpinnings of \n     the aid program: to provide for the basic needs of those who \n     couldn't work.\n       That decision set blind, retarded and mentally ill addicts \n     adrift in lives of despair because it effectively cut them \n     off from private clinics, where treatment is generally \n     available to anyone who can pay for it. And the prohibition \n     has remained unchanged for more than 20 years. Further, \n     tucked inside the law was one sentence that said addiction \n     alone could qualify as a disabling disorder, making it \n     possible for virtually anyone hooked on dope or booze to get \n     a monthly check even though they have no other disability.\n       Before then, an addict or alcoholic had to prove that his \n     substance abuse were so severe that it had caused disabling \n     brain or liver damage, conditions that usually took decades \n     to develop.\n       But under the 1972 rules, an addict has only to prove that \n     his drug abuse is bad enough to keep him from holding a job--\n     opening the door for thousands of young substance abusers who \n     aren't physically disabled and who probably never would have \n     qualified for aid under the old rules.\n       They are men like Ernie Hernandez.\n       The 34-year-old heroin addict and father of two sits in the \n     brown grass outside the San Joaquin County drug clinic in \n     French\n      Camp, Calif., a desolate farm town east of San Francisco.\n       He fidgets with his beefy hands as he describes his six \n     years on SSI.\n       A one-time cannery worker and farm laborer, he has no \n     apparent physical problem that would keep him from working. \n     He is lucid in conversation. And at 6 feet tall and 225 \n     pounds, he's built like a weight lifter.\n       ``I admit it,'' he says. ``I don't look sick.''\n       But he's collecting $458 per month in SSI, which qualifies \n     him for a $200 supplemental payment from the state, bringing \n     his tax-free monthly take to $658--about the same amount that \n     the average retiree gets from Social Security after a \n     lifetime of labor.\n       ``The money definitely changes you,'' he admits. ``I just \n     ain't going to risk losing that money by working at some \n     minimum-wage job. Next thing I know, I get too stoned, I lose \n     the job. Then what am I gonna do to feed my kids?''\n       ``You can tell them congressmen, if they stop SSI, the \n     crime rate around here is going to go through the roof. It's \n     all a lot of us have.''\n       And Ernie Hernandez knows about crime. He says he's been \n     using heroin and cocaine since he was a teen-ager, landing in \n     prison at least nine times.\n       He'd like to get himself clean and back to work--if for no \n     other reason than to get his family off his back and to ``be \n     able to spend a weekend in the mountains without having to \n     come home early because I ran out of dope.''\n       But he has never been able to rehabilitate himself. Even \n     when he wants it, there is little in the way of intensive \n     treatment available.\n       On this sweltering day in July, he wants it in the worst \n     way.\n       Jittery from a dose of black tar heroin he shot into his \n     leg the night before, he considers his options as he fingers \n     a small, gummy ``booger'' of heroin in his pocket.\n\n\n                        `i'm really gonna kick'\n\n       Cheap and plentiful, black tar has spawned a plague of \n     addiction in the cities and towns along Interstate 5 that has \n     helped make California--with at least 34,000 addicts on the \n     aid rolls--the ``Disability Capital'' of the nation.\n       ``You back again, Ernesto?'' asks Floyd Brown, the chain-\n     smoking assistant director of the clinic.\n       ``Yes, sir,'' Ernie Hernandez replies, hoisting himself up \n     from the grass. ``I want to get on the waiting list. I'm \n     really gonna kick this time.''\n       Both men know his chances of getting off heroin are nil. \n     Since he's been on SSI, he's been in and out of the clinic so \n     many times that they've both lost count.\n       He is one of 6,000 heroin addicts in the valley who rotate \n     on and off the out-patient treatment program throughout the \n     year. In a region that has become a hotbed of disease, many \n     of them suffer from\n      tuberculosis and AIDs. Three out of every four are getting \n     disability checks, according to a recent county survey.\n       ``They'll test positive for heroin and we'll flunk them out \n     of the program,'' Mr. Brown says. ``Then they'll sign back up \n     on the waiting list and the whole thing starts all over \n     again. I can honestly say that in my 21 years in this \n     business, I have never had a disability recipient \n     successfully complete the program.''\n       When Congress first decided to let addicts like Ernie \n     Hernandez get aid for merely being addicted, it ordered \n     Social Security to herd them into treatment as a condition of \n     their getting checks.\n       Any addict who refused was to be cut off--except for DI \n     addicts, because Congress deemed that they had ``earned'' \n     their benefits when they were working and should be free to \n     spend them as they saw fit.\n       The treatment rule was supposed to keep poor addicts on SSI \n     from simply using the money to feed their habits. But former \n     agency officials and legislative aides say they warned \n     Congress as early as 1969 that there were nowhere near enough \n     in-patient treatment slots for them. And no one expected out-\n     patient treatment to work.\n       But the nation's lawmakers were less interested in \n     accountability for addicts, the aides say, than they were in \n     insulating themselves against outraged taxpayers should the \n     program go wrong. Then-Sen. Russell B. Long, the legendary \n     Louisiana Democrat, was the prime mover.\n       ``He told us there was no way in hell he would support \n     giving checks to dope addicts without at least making it look \n     like we were getting tough with them at the same time,'' says \n     Tom Joe, a Washington social policy analyst who helped write \n     the disability rules. ``Everybody knew that they probably \n     wouldn't be able to actually find treatment.''\n       Then or now.\n       Today, a minimum of 3.2 million addicts and alcoholics need \n     help, according to federal, state and private estimates. But \n     there are slots available for less than half. And at least \n     100,000 people are on waiting lists for those slots at any \n     time. For others, there are no lists.\n       Consider North Carolina, a state with 6,200 addicts on the \n     federal disability rolls and few publicly funded in-patient \n     treatment slots.\n       In Asheville, a small town in the pine-blanketed foothills \n     of the Great Smoky Mountains, a downtown Social Security \n     office draws scores of disabled people from the surrounding \n     countryside. Many are illiterate, hobbled by years of hard \n     labor in mines and lumber mills, and suffering from addiction \n     to rot gut wine and moonshine.\n       ``We're basically telling them to get treatment when there \n     isn't a treatment facility within 200 miles of here,'' says \n     Sharon DeLong of the American Federation of Government \n     Employees, who represents local caseworkers.\n       ``We try to push them to Alcoholics Anonymous or something \n     like that. But how long can they last when all they're \n     getting is a couple of hours of group therapy before they \n     head back out to sleep in the woods with a dozen other \n     alcoholics? It's utterly demoralizing.''\n       Her frustration is echoed by caseworkers and drug \n     counselors from Baltimore to Seattle who say Congress and the \n     Social Security Administration have never been serious about \n     rehabilitating addicts--or in understanding how treatment \n     works.\n       Counselors surveyed by The Sun say programs like the San \n     Joaquin methadone clinic and Alcoholics Anonymous that bring \n     addicts in off the street for a few weeks of detoxification \n     of a few hours of group counseling every day are the least \n     likely to succeed with hard-core substance abusers.\n       ``It amounts to drive-by therapy,'' says Dr. Satel, a \n     professor of psychiatry at Yale and the University of \n     Pennsylvania who has worked with addicts for seven years. \n     ``It may work fine for the early stage addict who still has a \n     home, a family and a job. But that's not who you see on \n     disability.\n       ``These people are seriously debilitated drug abusers, and \n     they need months of heavy-duty residential care that cuts \n     them off from their addict friends and their old hangouts, \n     and teaches them a new way of life.''\n       And it is precisely this kind of treatment that Congress \n     has refused for 20 years to provide to the destitute \n     substance abusers on federal disability. Today, there are \n     only 68,000 federally funded in-treatment slots in the entire \n     country.\n       ``It's one of the terrible ironies of the disability \n     program,'' says Dr. Satel. ``Congress tells addicts, `You \n     have to be in treatment, but we're not going to give it to \n     you--and you can't use your check to buy it on your own.''\n       Under the rules set up by Congress, Social Security is \n     required to stop checks to addicts who are caught spending \n     them in a residential program.\n       Adding insult to injury, counselors say, Congress ordered \n     Social Security last summer to carry out a plan to cut off \n     addicts' checks after three years. The agency says the move \n     will trigger $275 million in notification processing and\n      legal costs--enough to buy residential treatment for 35,000 \n     addicts.\n       ``Instead, we're spending it to shove these people back out \n     onto the street in 36 months,'' says an exasperated Jack \n     Gustafson, who represents state rehabilitation directors in \n     Washington. ``We'll buy their \n\n[[Page S 11774]]\n\n     drugs for them for three years, but we won't give them \n     inpatient treatment. It's insane.''\n       Nor will the crackdown achieve the results that Congress \n     promised to taxpayers when it vowed to purge addicts from the \n     rolls. That's because most of them suffer from other physical \n     or mental disabilities that will still qualify them for aid.\n       ``The fact is that drinking and drugging is usually just \n     part of the problem,'' says Joe Manes, a Washington mental \n     health activist. ``They usually have a complex of ailments \n     that may or may not be related to their substance abuse.''\n       Willard Redpaint is a walking illustration.\n\n\n                         `pints away from dead'\n\n       Most mornings, the 42-year-old Dakota Indian can be seen \n     stumbling down Larimer Street on the graffiti-scrawled \n     industrial fringe of downtown Denver, a bottle of Wild Irish \n     Rose wine in his trembling hand and a glassy film across his \n     bloodshot eyes.\n       At 10:30 on a bright, clear morning in August, he is \n     already drunk. So drunk that when he blows into a \n     Breathalyzer at a nearby homeless shelter he registers a \n     potentially lethal .42 blood alcohol level--four times the \n     amount to be considered legally intoxicated.\n       ``God almighty, Willard!'' blurts Bob Cote, director of the \n     shelter. ``You're about two pints away from dead!''\n       He breaks into a heated lecture, brow-beating, accusing. He \n     reminds Willard Redpaint that at least 41 men have killed \n     themselves on Larimer Street with disability aid money in the \n     past few years.\n       ``You knew a lot of those guys, didn't you?'' Mr. Cote \n     demands. ``You want to end up like them?''\n       ``I like my wine,'' Willard Redpaint replies sleepily. ``I \n     like to drink.''\n       Reeking of urine and garbage from four nights of sleeping \n     in an alley, he says he can't remember how long he has been \n     getting disability checks. Court records show it has been at \n     least since 1985.\n       But alcoholism is far from his only problem.\n       Willard Redpaint is mentally retarded. And his brain is \n     damaged from a car accident that sent him hurtling through \n     the windshield of a pickup truck when he was a child. He \n     signs his name with an ``X'' because he cannot read or write.\n       When he was 4, a gang of thugs strangled his father during \n     a robbery. A few years later, his mother was taken away to a \n     mental institution. By the time he was 15, he was drifting \n     the Western high country alone.\n       His earliest notice in Denver is recorded in court files at \n     age 25, when police found him stumbling drunk down the center \n     of a six-lane interstate in the middle of the night. Since \n     then, he has been arrested 16 times in alcohol-related \n     incidents.\n       In 1988, he beat another homeless man to death with a slab \n     of concrete over a stolen radio. Convicted of manslaughter, \n     he served three years in prison, feeding his habit with \n     homemade potato wine.\n       ``It gives you a hangover in the morning,'' he says of his \n     drinking. ``And I'll end up dying. but that's the only bad \n     part.''\n       Each morning, he goes to a homeless aid station where \n     social workers dole out his monthly check to him in $10 \n     installments.\n       ``I can buy four bottles of wine with that much,'' he says. \n     ``That's a lot of wine.''\n       Left without treatment, counseling or supervision, Willard \n     Redpaint receives just enough money every day from U.S. \n     taxpayers to drink himself to the edge of death.\n       And the crackdown launched by Congress last summer with \n     much election-year rhetoric will do nothing to stop him. If \n     Social Security cuts off the checks because of his \n     alcoholism, all he will have to do is reapply, citing mental \n     retardation and brain damage.\n       Nor do drug counselors and social workers expect any of the \n     other measures Congress passed in August to have much effect. \n     Among the mandates were orders for Social Security to force \n     addicts into treatment programs that don't exist and to hire \n     special inspectors to make sure they don't misuse their \n     checks.\n       But the agency has had inspectors in 18 states for years. \n     And they say they have been consigned to failure by a lack of \n     funding.\n\n\n                           little supervision\n\n       In California, Social Security monitored addicts so poorly \n     that it continued to send checks to 119 of them while they \n     were in prison, the state attorney general found last year. \n     And in Illinois, a Chicago firm lost track of 7,000 more \n     because Social\n      Security never provided a list of their names.\n       And Social Security does not expect to be able to tighten \n     supervision with the money Congress wants to spend on the \n     job. Rather, private firms will be paid roughly $600 per \n     addict to monitor their whereabouts and make sure they are \n     signed up on waiting lists until their checks run out in 36 \n     months.\n       ``Obviously, one long-term goal is to rehabilitate \n     people,'' says Commissioner Shirley S. Chater, the agency's \n     head. ``And the way we do that is to have these monitoring \n     agencies encourage the addict's sense of individual \n     responsibility to find treatment for himself.''\n       But Social Security estimates that the majority of \n     substance abusers on disability--perhaps as many as 200,000--\n     will continue to get checks and go untreated long after the \n     three-year cutoff because of loopholes in the law.\n       As many as three out of five are exempt because they have \n     other disabilities. And another two out of three are \n     collecting DI checks that can't be cut off until three years \n     after they are actually accepted into a treatment program \n     because Congress decided that they ``earned'' their benefits.\n       Meanwhile, new addicts continue to pour onto the rolls. \n     Social Security estimates that the number drawing checks \n     today will almost double by the turn of the century.\n       ``It's insane to go on giving them cash,'' says Dr. Satel, \n     the Yale psychiatrist. ``But it also makes no sense to just \n     take that money away and plow it into some other program. \n     Congress has to wake up to the fact that we need hard-nosed \n     treatment to interrupt this cycle of addiction, crime and \n     punishment that is costing taxpayers a fortune in more ways \n     than one.''\n       Estimates by the National Association of State Alcohol and \n     Drug Abuse Directors are that every dollar spent on drug \n     treatment saves $14 in police, court, emergency room and \n     prison costs.\n       But so far, Congress and Social Security have been \n     unwilling to spend the money--even in the case of men like \n     Delmont Williams who desperately want treatment and will \n     surely die without it.\n       ``It's not our job to solve the problems of the addict \n     population,'' says Deputy Social Security Commissioner Larry \n     Thompson. ``Our job is to write checks.''\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. This is about 34-year-old Ernie Hernandez. This part of \nthe article says:\n\n       The 34-year-old heroin addict and father of two sits in the \n     brown grass outside the San Joaquin County drug clinic in \n     French Camp, CA, a desolate farm town east of San Francisco.\n       He fidgets with his beefy hands as he describes his 6 years \n     on SSI.\n     A one-time cannery worker and farm laborer, he has no \n     apparent physical problem that would keep him from working. \n     He is lucid in conversation. And at 6 feet tall and 225 \n     pounds, he's built like a weight lifter.\n       ``I admit it,'' he says, ``I don't look sick.''\n       But he's collecting $458 a month in SSI, which qualifies \n     him for a $200 supplemental payment from the State, bringing \n     his tax-free monthly take to $658--about the same--\n\n  States supplement the SSI benefits, California being one, with an \nadditional $200, in addition to being eligible for Medicaid, food \nstamps, and other programs.\n\n       --about the same amount that the average retiree gets from \n     Social Security after a lifetime of labor.\n       ``The money definitely changes you,'' he admits. ``I just \n     ain't going to risk losing the money by working at some \n     minimum-wage job. Next thing I know, I get too stoned, I lose \n     the job. Then what am I gonna do to feed my kids?''\n\n  Are we helping Ernie Hernandez? Well, Ernie is one of 6,000 heroin \naddicts who rotate on and off in the outpatient treatment program \nprovided in French Camp throughout the year. In a region that has \nbecome a hotbed of disease, many of them suffer from tuberculosis and \nAIDS. Three out of every four are getting disability checks, according \nto the recent county survey.\n\n       ``They'll test positive for heroin and we'll flunk them out \n     of the program,'' Mr. Brown says. ``Then they'll sign back up \n     on the waiting list and the whole thing starts all over \n     again. I can honestly say that in my 21 years in this \n     business, I have never had a disability recipient \n     successfully complete the program.''\n\n  That is Floyd Brown, director of the drug treatment center in French \nCamp, who said, ``If SSI was around 20 years ago, when I was trying to \nget straight, I would probably be dead right now.''\n  Is this a program that is helping people? The answer is, obviously, \nno. We get rid of it. Under this bill, there are no checks for drug \naddicts and alcoholics anymore for this program. We are not going to \ncontinue to subsidize people who break the law by consuming illegal \ndrugs.\n  Finally, the issue of non-citizens. This gets to be a very touchy \nissue for a lot of people. I want to associate myself with the remarks \nof the Senator from Texas when he says that most non-citizens who come \nto this country--immigrants--come here with their sleeves rolled up \nready to work, to provide for themselves, their families, and the \nopportunity to live the American dream. I stand here as a product of \nthat.\n  My father is an immigrant. He came here during the Depression. His \nfather worked very hard in the coal mines for many, many years. It is, \nin fact, the American dream that the son of an immigrant can stand on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate, as many have before me.\n  No one wants to deter people from coming to this country, no one \nwants to take away the opportunities that come with living in America, \nnor do we want to be the beacon of the world for the handout. We want \nto say to people, \n\n[[Page S 11775]]\n\nif you want to bring your mother here, who is 70 years old, to come and \nlive with you, and you sign a sponsorship agreement that says you will \nprovide for them--which you do under current law--then you should \nprovide for them, and not as many do, turn them over to the SSI \nDepartment or the Social Security Administration through the State, in \nsome cases, turn them over so they can collect Government benefits \nbecause they are out there and therefore qualified for SSI.\n  Here are the numbers of non-citizens. In 1982, about 125,000 non-\ncitizens received SSI. We were up to 700,000 as of 1993, and that \nnumber is growing fast.\n  It is a serious problem and one that we have to address. It is a \nphilosophical decision, one the House made in favor, and I am hopeful \nwe will make it here, too. People who come to this country should come \nfor the opportunities provided to them and not for the benefits that \ncould inure to them because of welfare. So what we say is, simply, reap \nthe benefits of the fastest-growing economy in the world over the past \nmany years--jobs and opportunities--but not for welfare benefits.\n  If you are a sponsored immigrant--let me finally explain the \ndifference between other immigrants and sponsored immigrants. We are \nnot talking about refugees, people who were in a war-torn country, like \nBosnia, who come on the shores or who are fleeing the former Soviet \nUnion.\n  Now, those people would not be affected by the change being proposed \nhere in SSI. Only people who come to this country who are sponsored to \nbe here by--in almost all cases--a family member; where the family \nmember signs a document saying that they will provide for this person \nif they come here, and the person signs a document that says, ``I will \nnot be a charge or ward of the State'' when they come here.\n  We are saying, we should enforce this agreement. If families want to \nbe reunited on American soil, fine; but it should not be the role of \nthe American taxpayers to be the retirement home for millions of people \nwho want to bring their parents to this country to retire with them. \nThat is what is going on, if you see the numbers of seniors, in the \nvast majority of these numbers. That is the problem.\n  What we are suggesting is, the door is open to reunite families, but \nit should not be at the expense of the taxpayers of this country, given \nthe fact that these seniors have contributed nothing and worked, in \nmany cases, not at all in this country and paid nothing in taxes.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to focus on the issues of SSI as, hopefully, \nissues that by and large can bring us together in this debate. I think \nthey are issues that we can find consensus and agreement. I will remind \npeople again that this is the second largest of all the means-tested \nentitlement programs, one that needs dramatic and sound reforms that \nhave been put forward by the Finance Committee and the leadership bill \nas well as Senator Gramm's bill. I am hopeful we can work together on \nthis particular area.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \ncontinue with debate only on the pending welfare bill until 6:30 this \nevening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Consistent with our informal arrangement to go back and \nforth between the sides, I yield now to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank my colleagues who have been participating in this \ndebate this afternoon.\n  Let me start by commenting on the comments of the Senator from \nPennsylvania about the SSI Program and to commend him for pointing out \nwhat he has, in fact, stated. The problem is severe and it is serious.\n  Also, I want to point out that there is no disagreement, essentially, \nbetween Democrats on this side of the aisle and our Republican \ncolleagues on that side of the aisle about this issue.\n  President Clinton appointed our former colleague from Kansas, James \nSlattery, to a commission to study in detail this very problem that the \nSenator spoke of, the problem of some parents in some parts of the \ncountry utilizing SSI programs in order to qualify children who, in the \nminds of both experts, should really not be considered to be disabled \nand entitled to benefits. They made some strong recommendations about \nhow those determinations should be made in order to protect children \nwho are legitimately disabled, who have mental disabilities, who have \nphysical disabilities, who truly qualify as disabled.\n  There is no argument that those children deserve our care and those \nchildren deserve our help and assistance. Those recommendations, I \nthink, are in the Republican proposal. They are in the Democratic \nproposal.\n  The question of SSI benefits, cash benefits, going to people who \nsomehow get qualified because of being a drug addict or an alcoholic, \nthere is no basic disagreement in the provisions of both bills. The \nDole bill and the Democratic alternative clearly says that a person \nwill not be able to be eligible for cash benefits because they are a \ndrug addict or because they are an alcoholic.\n  That is not to say that they should not get medical attention. Drug \naddicts and alcoholics and drug abusers who do not get medical \nattention, I suggest, become a much more serious problem to society if \nthey are not treated, if they do not receive medical help and medical \ncare. That is different from giving them cash benefits.\n  Our legislation clearly says that they would be entitled, if they \nqualify, for Medicaid assistance but not for any cash benefits. I think \nin those areas we are in substantial agreement.\n  Let me talk about the basic proposals that are pending before the \nSenate dealing with so-called welfare reform. I do not think there is a \nSenator in this body, whether he or she be a Republican Member or a \nDemocratic Member, who would argue that welfare as we know it and see \nit and experience it today is not broken and does not need fixing. \nThere is no disagreement on that.\n  There is no one on this side of the aisle who says that we should, in \nfact, not make any changes, that everything is working perfectly, when, \nin fact, we all know that welfare does not work very well for those who \nare on it, nor does it work very well for those who are paying for it. \nThere is no disagreement with regard to that proposition.\n  We all agree that major changes should be made. How we go about \nbringing those changes are where some may have differences, which is \nthe subject of legitimate debate on this floor.\n  I am concerned that it seems that the argument portrayed by some is \nan argument that suggests who should be responsible for solving the \nproblem. Some would suggest that, well, the States ought to solve the \nproblem because the Federal Government has not done a very good job. \nSome may suggest, although I have not heard that, that, no, the Federal \nGovernment should do it, because we know best.\n  In truth, the argument and the real question that I think should be \nbefore this body is not whether the Federal Government should do it or \nwhether the State government should do it, but rather, how do we both, \nworking together in a true partnership, solve this problem.\n  I suggest that this problem is too big for the Federal Government to \nsolve it by ourselves. We cannot know what is best for every State in \nthe Union here in Washington. I do not know what works best for States \nI may never have been to or where I have not spoken to welfare \nrecipients or welfare administrators in that particular State. Being \nhere in Washington does not give me some type of intelligence that is \nbetter or smarter than anybody on a State level.\n  I reject the argument, if anyone would make it, that welfare reform \nshould be a Washington program. I also reject the argument that the \nStates should do it by themselves, because I think the States do not \nnecessarily have the financial ability to do it by themselves. And if \nyou are going to have major Federal contributions to the programs, \nthere should also be substantial standards on how those national \nFederal dollars, in fact, will be spent.\n  Therefore, I argue and I suggest that the answer is not the Federal \nGovernment versus the State government but truly a partnership between \nthe Federal officials and the State officials in trying to craft a \nprogram that puts the best of both together and comes up with a program \nthat truly solves the \n\n[[Page S 11776]]\n\nproblem and ends welfare as we know it today.\n  Now, for 60 years we have had a partnership. For 60 years the Federal \nGovernment has put up some of the money, and for 60 years we required \nthe States to put up some of the money. That has always been the \npartnership arrangement that has existed.\n  It is like that in every other program, Mr. President, if you think \nabout it. In the highway program, the Federal Government puts up some \nof the money, the States put up some; on water projects, the Federal \nGovernment puts up some of the money, the States put up some of the \nmoney.\n  There is a reason for that. It binds and ties the concept that it is \na partnership. It reinforces the fact that both of us have to work \ntogether to solve the problem.\n  What disturbs me in the Dole proposal, in the Packwood proposal, is \nthat it breaks that partnership for the first time in 60 years,\n because for the first time it says the Federal Government will put up \nthe money and the States, if they want, have to put up nothing. That is \nnot a partnership. That, if anything, is the Federal Government being \nresponsible for all of it.\n\n  The Republican plan eliminates the requirement that the States \ncontribute. How many times have we heard proposals from the Republican \nside of the aisle that have talked about copayments in health care \nbeing extremely important because copayments from a person who has \nhealth insurance establishes in that person's mind that he is \ncontributing or she is contributing to the solution, and therefore they \nare going to be more careful in how they use their health insurance? \nWithout any kind of a copayment requirement, they do not have a \nconnection with the cost, they do not have a connection with the \nsolution to the health care problem.\n  Therefore, time after time I have heard Republican colleagues argue \nabout the necessity of even increasing copayments. But for the first \ntime--for the first time in my years in the Congress, in this body and \nin the other body, we have a proposal from our Republican colleagues \nthat eliminates the requirement that the States put up their share to \nsolve problems that their citizens and their partners are experiencing \nby being on welfare assistance. We have called it the maintenance of a \nState effort, a State maintenance of effort to get the States to do \nsomething so they can see that this problem is not one that can be \nsolved without this partnership. I think that is wrong.\n  Poorer States have always had to put up less. My State of Louisiana \nis probably one of the lowest, but we contribute, I think it is, about \n28 percent. The Federal Government puts up 72 percent, my State of \nLouisiana contributes 28 percent for the welfare program in my State. \nIn some States the State has to put up as much as 50 percent, where it \nis dollar for dollar; the Federal Government puts up a dollar, the \nState puts up a dollar. But there has always been this partnership \nrequirement.\n  The States who are helping to solve the problem also have to be \nresponsible for contributing financially to that solution. We all know \nit is a lot easier to spend somebody else's money. I am concerned this \nwill happen if the Republican proposal is adopted. If all of a sudden \nthey see a pot of gold coming down from Washington and we say, ``Here, \nspend it pretty much like you like, and, by the way, you do not have to \nput up anything; you can use the money that you used to put up for \nanything else you want because the Federal Government will continue to \nsend the same amount,'' States, for instance, could take the 50 percent \nor the 28 percent they had to put up in the past and say, ``All right, \nif the Federal Government tells us we are not going to have to do it \nanymore, I am going to take that money I was putting up for welfare and \nI am going to use it to get maybe more highway funds. I will use the 28 \npercent of the dollars that I raise on the State level to do the \nwelfare program, and I am going to use it instead to match to get more \nhighway funds, to build more bridges and more roads. Let the Federal \nGovernment take up the entire tab for welfare in my particular State.''\n  An even worse example than that, what about a State that says, ``All \nright, if I do not have any maintenance of effort, if I do not have to \ndo anything, if this partnership is terminated, I will take the money \nthat I used to put into the welfare program and, guess what, I am going \nto use it to build a new building so the Governor will have a new set \nof offices. Or, better yet, I am going to use it to give raises to all \nthe State employees. Let me use the money for that.'' Is that really \nsolving the welfare problem as we know it? Of course not.\n  Some States may even think like this. Listen to this example. The \nFood Stamp Program is 100 percent federally funded. When a person's \nincome goes lower and lower, they qualify for more and more food stamp \nassistance because their income is less. So if a State decides not to \nmake a contribution to the welfare program, reducing the amount of \nmoney an individual gets, the Federal Government is going to have to \nincrease the amount of food stamps that the same family gets.\n  Is this what our Republican colleagues want? Is this what they are \ntrying to establish in their proposal? Are they seeking to make the \nFederal Government spend more money than we are spending now on the \nFederal Food Stamp Program?\n  I suggest that is not a good idea at all. Therefore, what I am \narguing for is a partnership between the Federal Government and the \nStates. Give the States a great deal more flexibility, absolutely. I am \nnot suggesting that not be done. I support that. Give them the maximum \ndegree of flexibility that they can.\n  But I, as a taxpayer in Louisiana, want to know that when my citizens \nare taxed for this program that people in New York and people in Oregon \nand people in all the other 49 States are going to spend my tax dollars \nwith some degree of national responsibility, some degree of national \ngoals and guidelines in partnership with the other States that will be \nreceiving money from my State as well.\n  One of our colleagues, I think it was Senator Faircloth from North \nCarolina, when he testified before our Finance Committee, made a \nwonderful point which I agree with.\n  ``If you want to block grant the Federal welfare program to the \nStates and just give it to them with no strings attached,'' he said, \n``you ought to cut any Federal assistance going to that State. If there \nis not a national interest in how we spend welfare dollars on this \nprogram, if there is not a Federal interest, then there is no Federal \nneed or responsibility for the Federal Government contributing any \nmoney to the State.''\n  Let me repeat that, because this concept came from Senator Faircloth \nfrom North Carolina, and I agree with him. I am not disagreeing at all. \nI am complimenting him for pointing out something I agree with. Let me \nsay one more time what he said.\n  He said, ``If you are going to give it all to the States with no \nstrings attached, there is no reason why the Federal Government should \ngive them anything. Let the State raise the money if they want to spend \nit any way they want.''\n  And I agree with that. But I think there is a national responsibility \nwhen we start paying the tab to make sure that there are some national \nparameters and national goals and national standards that are going to \nbe followed, with a maximum degree of flexibility to the States to \ndevise the program that best fits the needs of their State. It should \nnot be written in Washington, but it should be a program that has \nnational goals and national standards. That is what we are talking \nabout.\n  Therefore, my point No. 1 is that: If we have a Federal program, we \nought to have a partnership, a State maintenance-of-effort requirement \nthat the States also contribute something to be partners in this \nprogram and not just to be receivers. A partnership is absolutely, \nincredibly important.\n  I think we ought to work together. Let me tell my colleagues \nsomething. We cannot pass this by ourselves. But you cannot pass it by \nyourselves. You do not have the votes to pass it without us, and we do \nnot have the votes to pass it without you.\n  So we have a decision to make as to whether we are going to cooperate \nand work on this together--or make political points and get nothing \ndone. That is an option. But if that option is exercised, I suggest the \nreal losers are the \n\n[[Page S 11777]]\nAmerican public and the American taxpayer. We will make short-term \npolitical points for short-term political gain. But in the long run, \nthe real losers will be the taxpayers and those who are on welfare who \nwill not have had an opportunity to have a program passed in a \nbipartisan fashion.\n  One of the things about the Republican plan, the second thing that \ngives me a great deal of concern, is the question of mandating to the \nStates that they double the number of people who are on welfare that \nare working. That sounds great. But talk is cheap. Talk is cheap. You \ncannot just say we are going to tell the States that they are going to \ndouble the number of people in their State who are now on welfare who \nare going to be working without helping them create those jobs and pay \nfor those programs that create those jobs.\n  Recently we passed an unfunded mandate bill. Everybody on both sides \nof the aisle, really, talked about how wonderful it was. No longer are \nwe going to tell the States to do something and not help them pay for \ndoing it. This legislation, when it tells the States that they have to \ndouble the number of jobs for people that are on welfare in their State \nboundaries under this program and does not give them financial \nassistance in order to do it, is the largest and biggest unfunded \nmandate that this Congress will have ever passed. We will be saying to \nall of the States that Washington is going to tell you to put people to \nwork.\n But we are not going to help you provide the money to put those people \nto work. Does anybody think that is somehow going to happen with magic? \nThere has not been a Governor that has come before this Congress \nthrough our committee systems that has ever said that goal can be \naccomplished without additional financial help from the Government here \nin Washington or from a greatly increased tax burden on their citizens.\n\n  Without the partnership that I talked about, the Republican plan is \nthe largest and biggest unfunded mandate to have ever been adopted, if \nit were to be adopted, in the history of this Congress. The ink is not \ndry on the legislation outlawing unfunded mandates, and this bill hits \nthe floor with the largest unfunded mandate I think in the history of \nthis Congress.\n  You cannot require States to double the number of people working and \ndo it by freezing the amount of money they get at the 1994 level. That \nis what this bill does, and that is the second reason why I think it \nneeds to be changed and modified.\n  The third reason that I have great concern with their proposal is \nwhat it does with child care and what it does for children. Children \ncannot be punished for the mistakes of their parents. There are \ninnocent victims in this country who did not ask to be born into this \nworld but are here in many cases because of mistakes of their parents \nand perhaps, yes, they were unwanted children. But they are here. They \nare alive and they are humans, and they deserve the attention of this \nCongress and this Government.\n  I have heard our colleague from Texas, Senator Gramm, talk about, \n``Well, you know, it is just time that the people who have been riding \nin the wagon get out of the wagon and start helping to pull the \nwagon.'' And that is great rhetoric and everybody has a little mental \npicture of what that must look like. But his proposal takes innocent \nchildren and babies and throws them out of the wagon into the street \nbecause it is clear that without help a 3-year-old or a 12-year-old or \na 4-year-old little boy or little girl cannot pull the wagon. They are \nnot old enough. They are not strong enough. They are not smart enough. \nAnd this is America which has a concern about innocent children.\n  The legislation to say that when a child is born to a teenager who is \nnot married and we are somehow going to deny that child the benefits of \nwhat that child needs to survive is un-American, it is unfair, and by \nand large it is totally absolutely unworkable. That proposal punishes a \nchild who did not ask to be born. That proposal is misdirected in that \nit does not do what we should be trying to do, and that is to punish \nthe parent.\n  Our bill, on the other hand, says the parent has to live at home; if \nthere is no home--which is the case in many cases--that teenage mother \nhas to live with adults in adult supervision, that teenage child who \nhad that baby has to go to school, has to be in a work program, and \nthere are requirements against the parent but not requirements against \nthe child.\n  The Dole bill treats it a little differently. The leader's bill says, \n``Well, the State can have an option to do that if they want.'' That is \nback to the national responsibility, the national partnership, that we \nshould be concerned about if we are raising the money for the program.\n  I cannot believe that our colleagues would agree that it is perfectly \nacceptable to have the benefits cut off to the child. That is one \noption that I think States should not be able to do when they in fact \nare using tax dollars that have been raised throughout this country.\n  Having said what I have said, I also want to repeat that we are not \ngoing to be able to pass a welfare reform bill unless we work together.\n  I will say here today that I think that can be done. The differences \nthat I have outlined I think, while substantial, are not that \ncomplicated to fix. I think the requirement that States have to put up \ntheir share, a maintenance of effort by the States, can be fixed--and \nshould be fixed--came close with an amendment that I offered in the \nFinance Committee of fixing it. We still can fix it. The work \nrequirements requiring people to work and helping the States to pay for \nthat work can be fixed.\n  Finally, I think treating the child, who is an innocent victim, \nfairly also can and must be fixed.\n  There are some other things that need to be addressed. The SSI that I \nmentioned I think we are very, very close, and almost substantial \nagreement with what needs to be done in that particular area.\n  So, Mr. President, my colleagues, I look forward to engaging our \nRepublican colleagues in debate. I hope that our ``Work First'' \nlegislation, which has been put together with a number of our \ncolleagues working very, very hard, drawing on the experience of our \ndistinguished ranking member of this committee, the Senator from New \nYork, Senator Moynihan, who has probably forgotten more about this \nissue than most of us know. We have drawn on his experience and his \nknowledge and his legislation that he has put forth in the past on this \neffort, and we are delighted to have him and proud to have him managing \nthis bill. I know that it is going to be a better product because of \nhis involvement.\n  But now is the time for us to be involved together in an effort that \nis going to affect every single American for a generation to come. I \nhope we can do it. I am confident we can.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \ncontinue with debate only with the pending welfare bill until 7:30 this \nevening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to make \nsome comments on the question of welfare reform. We have awaited this \ndiscussion for months, weeks. We are finally confronting the issue of \nwelfare. And there is much agreement, and there is much disagreement.\n  My colleague on the other side of the aisle just said that one of the \nreforms we have will put children in the street. Mr. President, the \nreason we are concerned about reform is that children's lives are being \nruined. The real tragedy of welfare is not the tragedy to be found in \nnumbers. It is not the tragedy to be found in how much this system \ncosts. It is not a tragedy about the share of the Nation's output that \nwelfare occupies or how much money the various competing welfare reform \nbills would save. This debate properly understood is not a debate about \nnumbers. It is a debate about lives. It is a debate about the lives of \nindividuals that have been trapped in a web of a ``Washington-knows-\nbest,'' ``one-size-fits-all'' welfare system. The lives of people are \nwelfare's casualties.\n  Mr. President, in the first 8 months of this Congress we have \naccomplished an extraordinary amount of work. We passed a balanced \nbudget resolution which signals to the public the right \n\n[[Page S 11778]]\nmessage about integrity and responsibility. We have advanced the \ntelecommunications bill that brings our laws in line with the \ntechnologically advanced times, a bill that makes laws apply to \nCongress itself, and previously we have been enacting legislation to \nwhich we did not adhere, and many other achievements.\n  As important as these achievements are, I believe they will be \nseriously compromised if we fail fundamentally to dismantle and replace \nthe current Washington based ``one-size-fits-all\" welfare system with \ndirection from this capital to the State capitals, and foot dragging on \nthe part of this city in terms of allowing innovation and creativity at \nthe State level.\n  Our efforts and our ability to replace welfare will be viewed by the \nAmerican people and by history as a measure of our commitment to the \nAmerican people--a bright line in our public life between cheap talk \nand real action. It is easy to call for a revolution, more difficult to \nachieve the purposes of a revolution. But that is the difference \nbetween administration and leadership. People want real leadership \nhere.\n  Across the world, our enemy for nearly 50 years no longer exists. It \nis not a result of someone conquering the Soviet Union from without, \nbut it was a defeat from forces within. What communism did to the \nSoviet Union is not unlike what welfare threatens to do to America. It \nstifled her spirit, it lulled her into dependence, and it compromised \nher greatness.\n  Our danger today is not to recognize the threat. Our danger is to \nbelieve that doing anything so long as we do something is sufficient. \nIf that occurs, we will have failed, the welfare state will have \nsurvived, our pathologies will metastasize, and an America which now \nstands on the brink of chaos will tomorrow be thrown into the abyss of \nmayhem.\n  Today, we have a welfare system that was designed with the best of \nintentions but, frankly, the poor have received the worst of all \nworlds--a world of despair, where a future is not seen, a world of no \nopportunity where advancement is not conceivable, a world of no family \nfor support, to nurture or care.\n  A couple years ago, it was my privilege to chair a task force on \nAmerica's urban families. I was shocked, going into America's cities \nand meeting with children who did not know who their fathers were, but \nreally appalled to know they lived in neighborhoods where no child knew \nhis or her father and some of these children had no acquaintances who \nknew their fathers. It is a world with which many of us are unfamiliar \nbut a world in which success is very difficult and a world from which \nescape is almost impossible. It is a world in which people are raised \nby welfare, fed through food stamps, but starved of nurture and \ndeprived of hope. Results of this kind of system are frequently tragic.\n  During the past week, I have come to this floor to talk about some of \nthe stories, to talk about and highlight this human side of the welfare \nsystem. Some of the cases are of children who have been killed or \nneglected, some are testimonies of people trapped in the system, but \neach one of the stories was real. They have all been documented. They \nall appeared in the mainstream press. They are tragically true. They \nare all stories which we should remember as we debate the welfare \nreform issue.\n  For 30 years and more, we have been told that all we need to do is \nspend more money and we would be able to solve the problems we face. We \nhave been told that Government had all the answers, that Washington \nknew best how to help.\n  Good intentions have carried us to a sorry state. Today, all the \nevidence points to the fallacy of that argument. Today, there are more \npeople in poverty than ever before. There are more children being \nabused and killed. There is less hope, less opportunity. We must \nreverse the consequences of the actions we have taken.\n  Today, again, I wish to make this point and by way of doing it I just \nrelate another one of the case histories of a child who paid the full \nprice of our welfare system. His name was Jason Allen, Jr. He was only \n2 months old at the time of his death in September 1994, just last \nyear. Born in Bakersfield, CA, to an unwed mother who had two other \nchildren besides Jason, her main source of income was $723 a month she \nreceived from the Federal Government through AFDC. Also, she had a drug \nproblem, and the Federal funds helped her maintain that, too. Ms. \nHenderson was addicted to a methamphetamine drug known on the street as \n``crank.'' In fact, by the time she became pregnant with Jason, it is \nsuspected she was using a significant portion of her welfare check just \nto finance the drug addiction. Unfortunately for Jason, his mother used \ncrank regularly throughout and after the duration of her pregnancy.\n  As the New York Times reported in September of last year, 3 days \nafter Jason was born, he had to be hospitalized for withdrawal from the \nmethamphetamines his mother had taken. As Jason recovered, his mother \ncontinued to use crank--later claiming that the high she got from \ntaking the drug helped her cope with the demands of motherhood. But \nwhen Jason was released from the hospital and his mother began to feed \nher son naturally, Jason took a turn for the worse. As the New York \nTimes wrote last year, ``Ms. Henderson awoke [one day] to find her son \nlying still in his crib not breathing, his lips blue. Throughout the \nsubsequent criminal prosecution of Ms. Henderson, prosecutors \nmaintained that 2-month-old Jason died on his way to the hospital from \nhis mother's drug-laced milk.''\n  Mr. President, there is no happy ending to this story. Ms. Henderson \nis currently serving a 6-year sentence on a felony conviction of child \nendangerment after the jury deadlocked 11 to 1 on the more serious \ncharge of second-degree murder.\n  The life of little Jason Allen, however, is tragically lost forever. \nIn truth, he did not have a chance. His is the face against which our \nreform must be judged. The reform that we pass need not be perfect, but \nit must be substantially better than the system we have today, a system \nthat finds us with individuals trapped on welfare and a system which \nprojects the abuse from one generation to the next.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania spoke just a short time ago in this \nChamber, and he talked about the intergenerational problems of welfare, \nand he cited a case that was recounted in the Boston Globe of a \ngeneration on welfare that began just a generation or two ago and the \nfamily now consumes almost $1 million annually. It is an \nintergenerational problem, a web of dependency that has entrapped \nalmost all of those who are a part of the family. We must make sure \nthat we change this record of failure.\n  For 30 years and more, the Federal Government has determined it would \ntolerate a welfare system that allows this kind of dependency, that \nsays you do not have to work to earn benefits, and it takes no action \nto discourage irresponsibility. We have, as a matter of fact, said if \nyou are irresponsible, we will continue to write the check. As a matter \nof fact, we have said worse than that. We have said the more \nirresponsible you are, the bigger the check we will write.\n  That has really found us in the validation of irresponsibility and \nimpairing survival values which are essential to the well-being of \nAmericans.\n  So when this debate concludes on welfare, be it Wednesday or Thursday \nor Friday of this week, or whenever it concludes, what will be the \nearmarks of what we have done that can assure us we have been \nsuccessful in pursuing genuine reform? Let me suggest to you a five-\npart test.\n  First, I believe we must end welfare as an entitlement, the notion \nthat people should receive Federal welfare benefits even if they do not \nwork, even if they abuse their children, even if they are more and more \nirresponsible. It is a pernicious notion. It is a notion which \nreinforces the wrong values, that underscores the wrong commitments. \nReal reform would end welfare's entitlement status. It will free people \nfrom the shackles of governmental dependence, and it would allow them \nto embrace the responsibility and opportunity that are the hallmarks of \nAmerica's survival values. It is essential that we reinforce a system \nof responsibility, and an entitlement does not have regard for \nresponsibility. \n\n[[Page S 11779]]\n\n  Second, we must radically limit Washington's intermeddling, \nmicromanaging, counterproductive control of welfare. I spent \n8 years in the Governor's office of the State of Missouri--the great \nprivilege of my life--to shape the future, along with the citizens of \nthe State of Missouri. A number of things we sought to do in welfare \nreform, ways in which we sought to change the system, an effort to \nupgrade what we were doing to make it more efficient, to make it more \nproductive, to make it consistent with our values, having to come for \neach change hat in hand to Washington, DC, and being badgered, being \nargued out of one position or being slowed down in our progress, saying \nwe will not tolerate real change; we will only allow you to do a pilot \nprogram. We will only allow it if it begins this way or that.\n It really curtailed our ability to serve the people that had elected \nus and to chart a new course that would break the web of welfare \ndependency instead of reinforcing it with unbreakable strands of \nreliance on the Federal Government.\n\n  Even now I look this year to the department of social services in \nJefferson City and they talked about Medicaid and how inefficient \nMedicaid is as a result of this intrusive control from Washington. The \nMedicaid director who works under my successor--and my successor is not \na Republican, as am I--but the Medicaid director said that if the \nFederal control were out of the system so that they did not have to \ncomply with this micromanaging, counterproductive demand for the way \nthings are done, that for the same amount of money that they are caring \nfor 600,000 people on Medicaid, they could care for 900,000 people on \nMedicaid.\n  The productivity penalty, the service penalty of this invasive, \nmicromanaging control system of Washington, the Washington-knows-best, \nthe one-size-fits-all system, is cheating 300,000 Missourians out of \nmedical care, according to the director of social services in the State \nof Missouri.\n  It seems to me if we are really interested in helping people, the \nbureaucratic tax against the poor, of robbing them of that resource by \nhaving this control mechanism and by being unyielding and being stingy \nabout what we want to do in terms of allowing for States to exercise \nresponsibility and develop procedures whereby real efficiency could be \nmanaged--that is counterproductive. We do not want to do that. We \nshould put it behind us.\n  For 30 years our welfare system has been premised on the belief that \nWashington knows best. Well, there is a fallacy that is underlying the \nbelief that anyone could know best. Because it suggests that there is a \nbest solution for the entirety of America.\n  Mr. President, I suggest to you that there is not any single best \nsolution for America. I suggest to you that a variety of communities \ncould come up with different solutions that might be best in the \ninstance of their community and that we need to move forward in an \nevolution of thought on this matter. I think it was understandable that \nat one time it might have been thought by well-meaning individuals that \nWashington did know best, that we simply ought to figure out what was \nbest, and then make the rest of a less-enlightened country comply with \nour demand. I think the effort to do that has met with substantial \nfailure.\n  So the next step in the evolution was to think that, well, maybe we \nshould have had pilot projects that we could put around the country and \nwe could learn what would be best. Then we would take the information \nfrom the pilot projects, having learned what was best for everyone, and \nwe could impose it on them because they were less enlightened than we \nwould be, having had the benefit of all those wonderful pilot projects \nand studies that were mandated every time a State wanted to have a \nwaiver or do something creative.\n  But the truth of the matter is that there is not a single strategy, a \nsingle pilot project that would work in Baton Rouge or Bangor. The \ntruth of the matter is, there are various strategies that will work in \nvarious ways around the country. For us to presume even from our \nimmense data base and from all the information and statistics that \nmight be available in Washington, DC, that we could know best what \nwould be appropriate for everyone, is an assumption that is false. It \nalso ignores the fundamental component of our human existence; and that \nis, that we tend to believe whenever we are trying to work things best, \nwe participate in the formulation of the strategy.\n  Why do we not adopt a system which allows States to be invested in \nthe formulation of strategy, allows them to participate in developing \nthe ideas that they then put into practice, and we get the additional \nvitality and additional energy in the system that comes from people \nparticipating and shaping the strategy which they will employ to solve \ntheir own problems? Really that is what freedom is all about.\n  One of the reasons freedoms flourish and societies of freedom \nflourish is they tap that special energy. We need to tap it in this \nsystem and the welfare debate.\n  This afternoon, the Senator from Iowa stood on the floor here and did \nan interesting job of talking about how Iowa had a special program that \nencouraged even small businesses from individuals who were on welfare, \nand how the number of people on welfare that went into business had, I \nthink, doubled in just the last couple years. I think that is a \nmarvelous thing to think that we could have a system that would allow a \nState to do that.\n  Iowa went through a pretty substantial process of asking the Federal \nGovernment for waivers. Why should we ask States to come here and beg \nfor waivers? Let us provide a system where States have the authority to \nmove right into these creative responses.\n  But to say, if it worked in Iowa, it has to be done in Indiana or \nthat it has to be done in Idaho or that we must mandate that system in \nNew Mexico, Arizona, California, Texas, or Georgia, is to again make a \nbad decision. It is a decision of imposition. It is not a decision of \ninnovation.\n  We need to allow the States to be involved in rejecting this idea \nthat one size fits all. It is like sending off to the catalog and \nsaying, ``The average weight of a person in my family is 120 pounds. \nSend us five pairs of pajamas to fit a 120-pound person.'' Well, I tell \nyou what, there is no 120-pound person in my family. All five of us \nwould be ill-fitted with the pajamas. But the one-size-fits-all \nmentality makes you think you can take the one-size-fits-all type \nmentality and make it fit everywhere. We need to provide for tailoring. \nLet us let these States make investment in their future, and let us let \nthem tap that creative energy that comes from participating in the \ndesign process of those investments.\n  I think it is a real chance for us to succeed. Some on the other side \nof the aisle have complained, well, the States will not be asked to \ncontribute as much as they previously contributed. The truth of the \nmatter is, we should hope that the States are so successful they will \nnot have to contribute all that they previously contributed.\n  The idea, the mandate from the people of America, is not that we \nshould maintain welfare or not that we should grow welfare. The idea is \nthat we should employ innovative and creative strategies to reduce the \ncaseload.\n  The idea of copayments was brought up. As if there is some analogy \nbetween a block grant which is limited in terms of its expenditure and \nan insurance policy which allows people to consume health care \nregardless of the amount expended. Nothing can be further from the \ntruth than to think that a limited block grant and an unlimited capless \nhealth care policy are the same things. As long as there is a limit in \na block grant, States will have an incentive to work within that limit, \ncopayments are unnecessary in that sort of setting.\n  So I really believe that we must end entitlements. There are benefits \nto doing so. But, second, in addition to ending entitlements, we have \ngot to free States to work effectively within their communities to \ndevelop these plans which will help us get the job done and get it done \nwell.\n  Bureaucracy has levied a sort of tax on the poor, taking up money and \npreventing it from reaching those in need. Every time there is a need \nfor a report in Washington, someone has to generate it in the State. So \nthe report reader has a drain on the system and the report generator \nhas a drain on the system.\n  Who should be the real judges of welfare and welfare reform? Who do \nwe \n\n[[Page S 11780]]\nreally want to satisfy? Is this a game in which we satisfy the U.S. \nSenate or the U.S. Congress? Is this some sort of exercise in which we \nshould seek to satisfy the bureaucracy in Washington, DC? I do not \nthink so. I think we really are trying to satisfy the people of \nAmerica. I do not see any reason why we cannot trust them to make \njudgments about the success or failure of what is being done in their \nown jurisdictions where they are up close, where they see on a daily \nbasis, where they walk past and work with individuals who are involved \nwith the system. No one will know better than the group of individuals \nwe call citizens.\n  Incidentally, if we are looking for the boss in America, if we are \nlooking for the final authority, let us go no further than to read the \nwords, ``We the people.'' If we want to design a welfare system and we \nwant to set up a jury to judge the welfare system as to whether it \nworks or fails, let us not try to set up a jury so that somehow the \nsystem has to come to Washington to please the Congress or the system \nhas to come to Washington to please the bureaucracy.\n  Let us put a system in place that gives the people the opportunity to \nshape the future in which they live. That is the definition of freedom. \nAnd let us put them in as judges and arbiters of whether what they are \ndoing is successful. The beauty of a free society is not just that you \nmake decisions in the first instance; the beauty of it is if those \ndecisions do not suit you or are not working effectively, you change \nthe decision.\n  Let us give the States the opportunity to make decisions which will \nresult in the kinds of graphs that Senator Harkin brought in for his \nState and proudly presented. Let us give States that opportunity, and \nlet us not make them come here to act as if what a State is supposed to \nlive for is to get the approbation and ``attaboy'' and a pat on the \nhead from the Congress or the bureaucracy. But let us be consistent \nwith the real purpose of Government and allow these jurisdictions to do \nwhat is important and what can succeed in their jurisdiction, so that \nthe people can assess whether or not this has been done well. And if it \nhas been done effectively, they will stick with it; if not, they will \nreject it and build a different bridge.\n  First, reject entitlements. We cannot go on with entitlements that do \nnot have a relation to behavior and activity. Second, empower States \nthrough block grants. Third, we must encourage a national debate on an \nepidemic of illegitimacy in America. Illegitimacy has robbed so many in \nthis culture of a future, and, indeed, unless it is reduced--not just \ncontained, but reduced--it will rob this country of our future.\n  Most of the problems surrounding welfare can be tied, in one form or \nanother, I believe, to this epidemic. It is at the root of the family's \nbreakdown in the inner city. It is tied to everything from educational \nnoncompletion and failure to crime. It is the lifeline of dependency.\n  Now, much progress has been made. I think our society and our country \nhas made a lot of progress in the last couple of years in just learning \nthat we can talk about it and that we can confront the issue and we can \nsay about it what we believe to be the truth about it. There were \npeople who did so long ago, some in this Chamber, and for whose voice I \nam grateful. But it is only in the last couple of years that our \ncountry has decided that it is fair to talk about this as a threat to \nour future, and talk about it we ought.\n  Much progress has been made, but we must encourage further debate and \ndiscussion, and we must expect States and communities to take positions \nand to deploy strategies which they believe will help curtail this \nepidemic. I was encouraged to see that even here in Washington, DC, \nwhich is not thought to be necessarily mainstream, but the city council \nof Washington, DC, has voted to deny certain benefits to individuals \nwho continue with illegitimacies while they are on welfare. There is a \nrecognition at all points on the political spectrum about the threat \nthat illegitimacy makes to the future of this country, and, frankly, \nthe disastrous impact it has on individuals.\n  The fourth test, I believe, is a test that should reflect our \nunderstanding that laws alone will probably not solve this problem. As \nmuch as it is gratifying, rewarding, makes one feel good to stand in \nthe Chamber and debate policy and to think about shaping the tomorrows \nin which we live, I believe that we have come to an understanding from \nour experience that Government probably will not alone solve this \nproblem. Government will not alone solve this problem at the State \nlevel. Government alone certainly has not solved this problem at the \nFederal level. We need to develop a strategy which will elevate \nsubstantially the participation in this challenge by nongovernmental \ninstitutions, by charitable organizations, by religious institutions. \nWe not only need to have these institutions involved, but we need to \nhave the average citizen become involved. I believe that there is a \ndifferent character in governmental programs than there is in the \nprograms of nongovernmental and charitable institutions. When \nvolunteers get involved with individuals, they have a way of saying, \n``I love you,'' by the fact that they are giving their lives to \nparticipate beneficially in the lives of others. That is not the \nmessage of government. It cannot be the message of government. It will \nnever succeed as well, because it is not.\n  It is time for us to emphasize the opportunity and to encourage the \nparticipation by the private sector, and I think we ought to do that by \nrecognizing individuals not only who give money to charities but who \nalso give their time and energy. We need, for the citizens of America, \nto come together, some on welfare, some not on welfare, but the \ninterchange and interface between them can provide the connection which \ndirects some over the bridge from dependence to independence. The \npeople who are working jobs, we need to find ways for them to be in \ncontact with people who need jobs, and that is part of the solution.\n  Lastly, I think we must realize that it is unlikely that we will have \nunanimity when we decide on a form. We cannot try to be all things to \nall people. We have seen that when we do, we are detrimental to all. It \nis as unlikely to be all things to all people as it is to have one size \nthat fits all. People are different, and there may be disagreements \nhere, but these differences and genuine efforts--a resolution of these \ndifferences deserve our best efforts. We must work together in order to \nachieve a positive result.\n  Well, today, we have a lot of work to do if we are going to get a \nbill that meets these tests, a bill that does more than just tinker at \nthe margins and embrace the label of reform. We cannot allow just \ntinkering at the margins and labeling to satisfy us.\n  We must call the Nation to greatness. We must signal that ideas and \nprinciples are more powerful than Washington's politics and pragmatism. \nWe must refuse to compromise our struggle without ever trying to retake \nour city on the hill. We cannot settle for being rhetorically \nimpressive while simultaneously being substantively lacking. Half \nmeasures which tinker with the margins are predestined to fail.\n  And most importantly, let us never forget that they fail the very \npeople that they need to help the most, and they are the people who \nfind themselves in the system. They are the population which is more \npervasively trapped now on welfare than there has been for quite some \ntime.\n  We can do better than we are doing. We can do better, and we must. \nAnd so we will work hard to achieve real reform that, in fact, \neliminates entitlements and empowers the States with the opportunity \nfor real creativity, that in fact makes it possible for reform which \nwill shape the way in which we live, that will challenge the epidemic \nof illegitimacy and reduce this pathology which shakes at the very \nfoundation the potential of the success of our Nation.\n  With that in mind, I think we have an opportunity to be of great \nservice. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am actually anxious to engage in \nthis debate on reform of our welfare system. I was reminded earlier \ntoday of a time several years ago. I was in \n\n[[Page S 11781]]\nParis, and I was walking down the street with a friend. We were talking \nabout issues having to do with poverty, and at some point in the \nconversation, my European friend made a remark the following remark: \n``You Americans are so Calvinist in your viewpoints.''\n  First I was a little mystified and then angry that he would make that \nkind of a statement. He went on to say there was a tendency in America \nto blame the poor for their problems. I pointed out to him that was not \nthe truth; indeed, on the contrary, this country has had a welfare \nsystem in place since the 1930's.\n  There are obviously problems that we need to work out, but the issue \nof addressing poverty is bigger than any welfare program. It is a \nlarger issue than that. Welfare is just a response to poverty. It is \nnot the cause of poverty. It is not the cure to poverty. It is a \nresponse to poverty.\n  The Senate is now engaged in a debate regarding the future of welfare \nand how we address the system that we have put together to respond to \npoverty. I submit, Mr. President, however, that the American sentiment \nregarding this issue, both in the larger sense as well as the specific \none, is still a very noble one.\n  We start with the notion that everybody who can work should work. But \nthat those who cannot work should be provided subsistence so they can \nlive in some dignity. At the heart of that sentiment, Mr. President, \nand at the heart of the sentiment--I know Mr. Moynihan for years has \ntried with the Family Support Act and the like, which has not been \ngiven the chance to work in the way the potential would allow it to \nwork--at the heart of the sentiment we should provide subsistence so \npeople who cannot work can live with dignity. I think is a very logical \nanalysis.\n  That is, how we will deal with poverty in our midst. How we deal with \npoverty in our midst does, in fact, is not just a local issue. It is \nnot an issue of States rights versus the Government in Washington. It \nis how we define our national character, the quality of life in our \ncountry as a whole. Frankly, it reflects the health and vitality of our \neconomy as a whole.\n  Most people, I believe, instinctively recognize that this is not just \nan ``us versus them,'' the taxpayers against the dirty welfare cheats, \nin spite of the efforts, frankly, of some, for political or otherwise, \nreasons to blame the poor for the anxieties of working people. The fact \nis that all taxpayers have a vested interest in seeing a system that \nworks and that reflects the best of American values.\n  Mr. President, I believe among those values, an important value, is \nthe recognition that children are our future. We recognize the \nimportance of providing the children with subsistence with dignity, and \nsupport and hope for a better tomorrow.\n  No 5-year-old is responsible for being born poor. So at the outset, I \nbelieve that the measure of any proposal for Welfare reform: How does \nit treat children? Does it provide a means for their parents to care \nfor them? Does it provide a safety net for those parents who are \nunwilling or unable to care for them?\n  Mr. President, some 22 percent of American children today live in \npoverty. That is 15 million children, one in five of our children--of \nour children--live in poverty. Our child poverty rate is two times that \nof Canada and Australia. It is four times that of France, Germany, the \nNetherlands, and Sweden. Nine million of those fifteen million children \nare currently the object of public assistance or AFDC; what we are \ntalking about is welfare. Nine million of those children.\n  So the fact of the matter caring for children should really be the \nsubject of all of the words flowing around this Chamber--two-thirds of \nthose on welfare are children. We must never let go of that fact.\n  Many of those children are in female-headed households. In fact, 90 \npercent of the AFDC children live in families headed by just a mother. \nMr. President, 53 percent of the families in poverty are single female-\nheaded households.\n  Senator Moynihan has spoken authoritatively about the phenomena we \nare facing. Quite frankly, as he points out, nobody quite knows why \nthat is the case, and nobody quite knows what we should do about it.\n  The point is that I believe a second objective that should command \nour attention is providing for an environment, a climate, for family \ncreation and family maintenance as an anecdote or response to our \nobjective of resolving and alleviating child poverty.\n  That is to say, the welfare of the child is not just a woman's \nproblem, it is a parent's problem. It is a male and a female problem. \nIt is a mom and dad problem. It is not simply a problem of ``the war \nagainst illegitimacy'' in the abstract. It is a real problem with a \nreal face.\n  The fact is, Mr. President, when both parents are in a household, the \nlikelihood that a child will be in poverty is diminished. That has been \ndemonstrated time and time again.\n  However, I think as we all know and without speaking to it, by \nperverse operation of practice over time, frankly, in all too many \ninstances, the men are too often seen as an impediment to providing for \nthe welfare of that child. That is something, clearly, that we have to \nface.\n  What we have now, though, in the context of this debate is the \nbeginning of a debate of historic implications, one which I submit will \nshed more light, hopefully, than heat on this issue. That has been the \nsubject of conjecture and stereotypes and myths which do not help the \ndebate very much.\n  I submit, Mr. President, that S. 1120, the Work Opportunity Act, the \nDole bill, does not in my opinion address the reforms that we need to \nhave in ways that are reasonably calculated to combat child poverty. I \nwant to tell Members why.\n  First, it maintains that child poverty is a local and not a national \nproblem or an issue. Federalism, seems to be how this debate is being \ncharacterized. The fact is, that by handing over the problem to the \nStates, by way of block grants, while it gives the States flexibility, \nwhich is a good thing, the fact is it gives the States so much \nflexibility as to be formless in terms of our national interests. It \nshifts the costs of addressing the problem to the States. It caps the \nFederal assistance at 1994 levels, and that is one of the reasons why, \nfrankly, we are going to continue to hear bickering over the allocation \nformula.\n  The high-growth States worry they will lose money. High child poverty \nStates are afraid they will lose money, stuck with a formula developed \nat a time when there was a national commitment to help resolve child \npoverty.\n  In the absence of a national commitment with regard to child poverty, \nwhat we will have, Mr. President, is a race to the bottom among the \nvarious States to see who can come up with the most punitive measures, \nwho can save and pennypinch the most, the welfare of the children \nnotwithstanding.\n  I raised the question in the Finance Committee during markup of the \ncommittee bill--What about the children in other States? I live in \nIllinois. What if I look up and discover in some State a Governor has \ndecided on a plan that leaves children homeless and hungry? That a \nsituation arises like Brazil. The answer that I got back was if that \nhappens, we will just have to come back in a couple of years and fix \nit.\n  Mr. President, I do not think that is the right response. The fact \nthat the system needs to be fixed and there needs to be reform should \nnot mean that we just give up, that we just say the Federal Government, \nthe National Government, our people, Americans across this country, \nhave no interest in the welfare of a child who happens to live across \nan artificial border of a State. That is what this bill does.\n  It says that people who live in Illinois have nothing to say at all \nabout the welfare of children in New York, or the welfare of children \nin Iowa, or the welfare of children anywhere else in this Nation.\n  I believe that turning our backs on a national commitment to children \nis an error of the gravest proportion and one that we should not allow \nto happen.\n  The second issue, Mr. President, that I think may be defective in \nthis legislation is that it does not provide a safety net for children. \nThe fact is that the kids will be punished for the conduct of their \nparents.\n  Ask yourself the question, ``What if''--what if the parents are so \nirresponsible, or alternatively so unlucky that they do not jump the \nproper hoops \n\n[[Page S 11782]]\nthat get created by the States. We have already said in this bill the \nStates can decide what they want to do, so if the States say you have \nto tap dance three times with one foot tied behind your back, \ntheoretically there is nothing on the national level we can do about \nit. Assume for a moment some child's parents do not meet the rules, do \nnot make the cut, and get thrown off. What happens to the children in \nthat situation?\n  What if a child's parents are teenagers? Does that mean that child \nthen starves because their parent is underage? The fact is, Mr. \nPresident, it is one thing to tell single mothers that they should not \nhave a child, and it is quite another to tell that child that their \nmother should not have had them.\n And that is what this bill calls on us to do. The children are left \nwith no safety net whatsoever. Whether you want to use the hot-button \nphrase of calling it an entitlement--we are not talking about an \nentitlement to States. We are not talking about an entitlement to \nparents, for that matter. What about the children? Are they not \nentitled to a guarantee from all of us, all Americans, that they will \nnot be left to starve, that they will not be left homeless, that they \nwill not be left to such grinding poverty that any hope of a future is \nextinguished when they are yet 5, and 4, and 3, and 2 years old? I do \nnot think so, Mr. President.\n\n  Third, and I think this is another significant flaw in this \nlegislation, clearly the bottom-line issue for parents is that they \nshould support their own children. I cannot imagine anybody who would \nargue with that proposition. A person who brings a child into this \nworld should take care of that child.\n  But to do so, since we are talking about poor people here, to do so \nthey have to work. The reality there, of course, is people can only \nwork when there are jobs to be had. Frankly, the absence of any job \ncreation is one of the dirty little secrets of S. 1120. The Field of \nDreams, I call it. It is legislation that says, ``If you kick them off \nthe rolls, they will find jobs.'' Mr. President, I believe that is an \nassumption that has less relation to reality than most of the fictions \nwe hear around here.\n  What jobs, I ask you? In some communities, even communities in my own \nState--and I am sorry to say that--we have areas of the State in which \nthere is 1 percent private employment, 1 percent. If you can imagine 1 \npercent private employment anywhere, that is not a recession, that is \nnot a depression, that is economic meltdown in those areas--whole \ncommunities in which our economy does not work.\n  I heard one of my colleagues talking a moment ago about the breakdown \nof the family in the inner city. Frankly, if I hear that one more time \nI think I am going to get sick on this Senate floor. The fact of the \nmatter is, it is not a matter of breaking down the families in the \ninner cities. The inner cities still have strong families, as least as \nstrong as they can manage under circumstances where there are no jobs, \nunder circumstances where men who want to work cannot work and the only \nemployment is the drug trade. Let us make honest statements on this \nfloor about what is going on in America as we address what Americans \ncan do to rise to the occasion, to fix this problem.\n  Fourth, Mr. President, I think this debate--we know there will be \namendments and alternatives. But that gets to another point I would \nlike to make, and that is I certainly hope that part of the \ncontribution that this debate makes, the debate here on the Senate \nfloor, is that we will begin to dispel some of the myths about welfare. \nThe face of welfare in this country, unfortunately, is that of a black \nwoman with several children by different fathers who stays on welfare \nbecause she is just too lazy to go to work.\n  Mr. President, that is not the truth and it never has been. The \nstatistics--I know everybody here has staff to go and pull up numbers-- \nthe statistics do not bear that perception out. That is not reality. \nFrankly, to use the examples--and I am sure we can all find them--of \nthe welfare cheat, is not the real story. There are always examples. We \ncan find somebody to be an example. I heard Members on the floor \ntalking about, yes, and here is a case of so-and-so-and-so and she had \nthese many babies and she got welfare and she is addicted to welfare, \net cetera.\n  To throw those kinds of inflammatory statements out here on this \nfloor is the equivalent of saying that every mother of two children, is \ngoing to be like Susan Smith and run them into the river and drown \nthem. It is an illogical analogy, it is a false analogy, it is an \nanalogy which I believe distorts the important nature of this debate.\n  Let us strip this debate of the myths. Let us dispel the stereotypes \nand the preconceptions, and let us have a debate in honest terms, about \nreal numbers and about real people. Let us address this debate in a way \nthat says that we want to provide a safety net, if you will, for \nchildren; that we want to treat fairly with the States in the \ndevelopment of this system; that we are not going to just turn over to \nthe States what has been called the grand-daddy of all unfunded \nmandates. Because, frankly, I think it can be said with pretty much \ncertainty under this bill, most States will probably have to increase \nState and local taxes to deal with the issue of poverty in their midst.\n  What you will have is another set of burdens foisted on local \ngovernments that they will not be able to pay for and they will not be \nable to handle. In any event, that will shift the burden from being one \nthat is shared by all of us to one that is shared just by a few. \nFrankly, it will put additional pressures on already fragile \ncommunities.\n  I believe we need to help communities to create gainful employment \nfor poor people; for poor parents, to help them to break the cycle of \ndependency. We have the wherewithal to do that. We are a rich nation. \nWe have a $7 trillion annual economy. The budget of this United States, \nthe Federal budget that we make decisions on here in this Chamber, is \n$1.2 trillion annually. We have the means to help people to work, to do \nfor themselves, to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and to \nprovide for their children. But it is not in this legislation. It is \nnot in this bill. And, frankly, it is the dirty secret of this entire \ndebate. ``We are going to kick them off, and when we kick them off they \nare going to find jobs, but we do not know where they are going to find \nthem. But if it is broken and the children start dying in the streets, \nwe are going to come back in a couple years and fix it.''\n  That is not the response the American people expect from us regarding \nthis very serious problem. To do so, I think we will have to put \naside--and I want to associate myself with the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Louisiana a few minutes ago--we are going to have to put aside \npartisanship and phony inflammatory rhetoric and try to address this \ncritical issue in the spirit that, as Americans, we are indeed all in \nthis together.\n  We are not a mean-spirited people. We want to do the right thing. We \nwant to be able to provide for our children in a way that gives them \nhope. We want to give parents hope and to encourage families and to \nencourage personal responsibility.\n  But, Mr. President, S. 1120 does not do any of those things, and for \nthat reason I believe it should not pass.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWINE). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this unanimous-consent request has been \ncleared on both sides.\n  I ask unanimous-consent that the Senate remain in status quo with \nrespect to the pending welfare bill until 8 o'clock this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, before coming to the Senate I spent 45 \nyears in the private sector, meeting a payroll as a businessman and a \nfarmer. Every year I watched as the Congress went into session and \nadjourned, leaving it more difficult for working taxpayers to make ends \nmeet because of the out-of-control Government spending programs that \nhave put our country on the path to fiscal disaster.\n  Of all the spending programs implemented by the Federal Government, \nnone has been a bigger failure than \n\n[[Page S 11783]]\nthose programs collectively known as welfare. President Johnson's ``war \non poverty'' was launched with good intentions, but it has been a \nmiserable failure. And in many ways, it has made the plight of the poor \nworse instead of better. The current welfare system has become a \nnational disaster.\n  The problem is not a lack of spending. Welfare spending has cost \ntaxpayers $5.4 trillion since 1965 when the war on poverty began. \nCurrently, the Federal Government runs approximately 76 means-tested \nwelfare programs at a cost, in 1994, of $350 billion. This amount is \nprojected to reach $538 billion by 1999, if current trends continue.\n  A simple, commonsense principle has gotten our Nation and the poor \ninto the present fix. That is, you get more of what you pay for. And \nfor the past 30 years, the Federal Government has subsidized and thus \npromoted self-destructive behavior like illegitimacy and family \ndisintegration. Almost one in three American children is born out of \nwedlock. In some communities the out-of-wedlock birth rate is almost 80 \npercent.\n  What is needed is a dramatic change; a reversal of the trends of the \nlast 30 years, and not another failed Federal Government program, like \nthe Family Support Act of 1988, which perpetuates the problem of \nwelfare dependency, and created 95,000 welfare bureaucrats; that is, \nState and Federal.\n  I know from first-hand experience in the private sector that if you \nhave a problem with your business you have to fix it immediately.\n  If you tinker around the edges and do not address the problem you \nwill be out of business. Unfortunately, far too few of my colleagues \nhave had the benefit of that sort of business experience. For many here \nin the Senate, there is no problem that can not be fixed with a future \nFederal spending program, or a continuing resolution for a future \nappropriation for another program.\n  Mr. President, these people may mean well and they may think that \nthey are being humane, but the way to solve a problem is to address the \nroot cause. And the root cause of the tragedy of welfare dependency is \nillegitimacy, the rise in out-of-wedlock births. Only by seeking to \ncurb the rise in out-of-wedlock births can we possibly hope to reform \nwelfare.\n  That is why I have consistently urged the leadership, including \nSenators Dole and Packwood, to include provisions in this bill to take \naway the current cash incentives for teenage mothers to have children \nout of wedlock. Only by taking away the perverse cash incentive to have \nchildren out of wedlock can we hope to slow the increase in out-of-\nwedlock births, and ultimately end welfare dependency.\n  Senator Packwood made it clear in a meeting with me and other \nSenators that he would not include in his bill any provisions to curb \nthe rise in out-of-wedlock births because he was opposed in principle \nto anything that would infringe on a woman's reproductive rights.\n  Mr. President, I do not know of anyone who wants to infringe on a \nwoman's reproductive rights to have as many children as she pleases, \nbut as I said in that meeting, the working taxpayers of this country \nshould not have to pay for them.\n  It is unfair for the working taxpayers of this country, and I mean \npeople who drive a truck for 14 hours a day, wait tables all night, or \nmake beds all day; it is unfair to ask these people to send their hard-\nearned tax dollars to support the reckless irresponsibility of a \nteenage mother who has children out of wedlock, and continues to have \nthem.\n  If you really want to see the working taxpayers of this country mad, \njust stand in line at the grocery store and watch the reaction of \nworking people.\n I mean people that work, people that work in chicken dressing plants, \npeople who run sewing machines, and leave 35, or 40 percent of their \npaycheck with the checkout counter in the grocery store and see men who \nobviously have not struck a lick and they know have not struck a lick \nin years, walk out with a $100 cart of expensive groceries paid for \nwith their tax dollars.\n  Mr. President, middle-class American families who want to have \nchildren have to plan, prepare, and save money because they understand \nthe serious responsibility involved in bringing children into the \nworld.\n  But welfare recipients do not prepare or save money before having \nchildren because they know they will get money from the Federal \nGovernment, and that the taxpayers of the country will take care of \ntheir children.\n  They do not take responsibility because they do not have to. We will.\n  And what is even worse is the same middle class families who are \nsaving money and working two jobs in anticipation of having children \nare seeing their own tax dollars go to support the irresponsible \nbehavior of welfare recipients having children out of wedlock. That is \nwrong any way you look at it and it must stop.\n  Individual States can gladly raise their own tax dollars and \nsubsidize this irresponsible behavior if they so choose, but those of \nus in the Congress have a responsibility to all the taxpayers in this \ncountry, and I can not believe that the American people think that we \nshould subsidize the very cause of welfare dependency, illegitimacy, by \npaying teenage mothers to have children out of wedlock.\n  There are some who argue that federalism would be infringed if the \nFederal Government does not continue to subsidize out-of-wedlock births \nwith direct cash payments to unmarried teenage mothers. However, that \nis not the case. States would still have the freedom to subsidize out-\nof-wedlock births if they want; the only restraint is that they can't \nuse Federal tax dollars. Let the taxpayers of the individual States \ndecide if they want their hard-earned money going to subsidize this \nbehavior.\n  Let the State legislatures say to the people within that State we are \ngoing to tax you to continue to subsidize out-of-wedlock births.\n  Mr. President, welfare should no longer be a one-way handout which \ndestroys the desire of able-bodied people to work. Real reform would \ntransform welfare into a system of mutual responsibility in which \nwelfare recipients who can work would be required to contribute \nsomething back to society in return for assistance given. We need \nworkforce, not welfare.\n  There is no substitute for the discipline and responsibility that \nwork instills in people, particularly young people who have lacked \nattention from their parents or have never seen their parents work. \nReal work means you do not get your benefits unless you work, this is \ncalled pay for performance work. If you do not do the work, you do not \nget paid.\n  In the private sector, in business, if you do not work, you do not \nget paid--why should welfare recipients be treated differently?\n  Mr. President, one of the worst aspects of the welfare system is its \ndestructive effect on the family. Our welfare system tells a young \nwoman, in effect, that she can collect over $15,000 per year in \nbenefits as long as she does not work or marry an employed male. Under \nsuch conditions, it makes more sense to remain unmarried. Welfare has \ntransformed the low-income working husband from a necessary breadwinner \ninto a financial handicap.\n  When the Great Society antipoverty programs were instituted in 1965, \nthe out-of-wedlock birth rate in the United States was 7 percent. \nThirty years later, the rate has jumped to 30 percent. As I said \nearlier, you get more of what you pay for. At this rate of growth, the \nout-of-wedlock birth rate is projected to reach 50 percent by the year \n2015, a prospect that President Clinton correctly pointed to with \nalarm, although he offers no plan to prevent this looming disaster, \nwhich threatens the very existence of our country.\n  The breakdown of the family contributes to a number of other social \nproblems. Children raised in a single parent home are six times more \nlikely to be poor than those raised by two parents. They are twice as \nlikely to commit crimes and to end up in jail. Girls raised in a single \nparent home are 164 percent more likely to become teenage mothers \nthemselves. That is why we have two and three generations on welfare \nliving in the same household.\n  Mr. President, the Senate should follow the lead of the House of \nRepresentatives and deny unmarried mothers under 18 years of age direct \ncash benefits for children born out of wedlock. Only by denying this \ncurrent cash incentive can we alter the self-destructive behavior of \nthose trapped in the vicious cycle of welfare dependency.\n\n[[Page S 11784]]\n\n  I especially want to thank my friend, Congressman Jim Talent, for his \nstrong leadership on this issue and the rest of the leadership in the \nHouse of Representatives for having the courage to directly confront \nillegitimacy by including provisions in the House welfare reform bill \nto end the cash incentive for teenage mothers to have children out of \nwedlock.\n  Here in the Senate I wish to thank my friend Phil Gramm for his \nstrong leadership and willingness to stand firm in helping to stop the \ntragedy of illegitimacy, and it is a tragedy.\n  We all recognize the need to reverse the corrupting incentives in our \ncurrent welfare system. Welfare recipients must work for their benefits \nand must not have children they cannot afford. This is the foundation \non which real welfare reform must rest.\n  As the Senate now takes up welfare reform, we must be willing to make \nthe kinds of tough decisions necessary to reduce illegitimacy and \npromote work or we will condemn yet another generation to the crippling \neffects of welfare dependency. The state of our welfare system demands \nthat we take immediate action because if trends continue as they are, \nour situation, especially regarding crime and illegitimacy, will get \ndramatically worse before it gets better.\n  That is why I have grave reservations about the bill in the Chamber \nas it is now written. Senator Dole has himself said that real welfare \nreform requires more than tinkering around the edges, and I \nwholeheartedly agree. But the Packwood bill will do nothing to address \nthe root cause of welfare dependency, the growing rate of out-of-\nwedlock births.\n  Real welfare reform demands more than mere tinkering with the status \nquo. It requires a whole new approach, and that is what we need.\n  By simply giving States the option to deny cash benefits to women who \nhave children out of wedlock, the Packwood bill does nothing more than \nreinforce the status quo, the status quo that has given us a 30-percent \nillegitimacy rate. It is time to change it. In business, people do not \nget paid for work they do not do. They are paid for work they perform \nand perform well. Under the Packwood bill, welfare beneficiaries who \nrefuse to work in return for their benefits will now have them reduced \non a pro rata basis. If you only work 1 day a month, then you only get \n1 day's pay. I applaud this change in the bill. It is a dramatic \nimprovement, and I was delighted when Senator Dole came to the floor \nthis morning to amend the bill so that this would be the case. Without \nsuch pay for performance standards, welfare work requirements are \nvirtually meaningless and a national joke.\n  Mr. President, it is my intention to amend this bill and try to make \nit live up to its name of welfare reform. I plan to offer a series of \namendments to address the root cause of welfare dependence--\nillegitimacy. I hope my colleagues will support my efforts to stop this \nnational tragedy that is fueling the fire of welfare dependency.\n  Mr. President, the American people clearly want welfare reform. I \nhope the Senate will have the courage and the fortitude to attack the \nwelfare problem at its source. If not, then the Senate will repeat the \nmistakes of the past and produce yet another failed big Government \nprogram that results in a Rose Garden ceremony where politicians can \npat themselves on the back and take credit for something they failed to \ndo.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN.

Mr. President, there will be no votes tonight.\n  We had hoped to be on the DOD authorization bill at this hour, but in \norder to do that we had to reach some agreement, which has not been \nreached yet, on the ABM and missile defense and other areas that are \nvery complicated, very important. Our colleagues are meeting as we \nspeak on that issue. If we can resolve that issue, we still hope to \ncomplete the DOD authorization bill this week.\n  I think the distinguished Democratic leader wishes to speak on \nwelfare reform, and then we will be out tonight and start on welfare 8 \nor 9 o'clock in the morning. There are still people on either side who \nhave not had a chance to make opening statements so we will try to \naccommodate them first.

A bill to establish the Vancouver National Reserve, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n          the vancouver national historic reserve act of 1995\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nVancouver National Historic Reserve Act with my colleague from the \nState of Washington, Senator Murray.\n  Vancouver, WA, has been described as the cradle of civilization in \nthe Pacific Northwest, as the place at which the first English-speaking \nsettlers put down their roots. Dating back to its role as the western \noutpost for U.S. military operations and for the early American \nexplorers, led by Lewis and Clark, Vancouver has been the locale of \nsignificant events of American history.\n  A few examples: Pearson Airpark, one of the oldest and most historic \nairports in our country. Pearson Airpark is the site of several \naviation firsts, including the landing site of Valeri Chkalov, the \n``Soviet Lindberg,'' after his transpolar flight. The Vancouver area is \nalso home to the original Vancouver Barracks, established to counter \nBritish influence in the region. Officer's Row, 21 historic homes that \nwere part of the barracks, housed some of our Nation's greatest \nmilitary leaders, including Generals Sheridan, Howard, Grant, and \nMarshall.\n  Recognizing the potential significance for a National Reserve in \nVancouver, WA, Congress established the Vancouver Historic Study \nCommission in 1990. The Commission was to develop a series of \nrecommendations on how best to coordinate Vancouver's many historic \nresources. Not surprisingly, the Commission found that the city of \nVancouver had an abundance of both historic sites and resources of \nnational significance, and recommended the formation of a partnership \nbetween Federal, State, and local entities to coordinate and manage a \nhistoric reserve.\n  Today, I introduce legislation that is based on the findings and \nrecommendations of the Commission's report, and a memorandum of \nagreement signed by the city of Vancouver and the National Park \nService. This legislation will ensure the preservation of the historic \nlegacy of Vancouver for our Nation.\n  Mr. President, the Vancouver National Historic Reserve is an example \nof the type of State, local, and Federal partnerships that make for \nsound public policy. This legislation represents a partnership among \nState, Federal, and local entities, working together toward one common \ngoal: to preserve, enhance, and interpret significant components of the \nPacific Northwest's history.\n  The Vancouver National Historic Act creates a unique relationship \namong the National Park Service, U.S. Army, the State of Washington, \nand the city of Vancouver. We intend that this relationship, \nestablished to coordinate and manage the many historic resources in the \nVancouver area, will keep the important legacy of this part of the \nPacific Northwest alive for future generations to enjoy.\n  The Vancouver National Historic Reserve consists of several sites: \nFort Vancouver National Historic Site; Vancouver Barracks; O.O. Howard \nHouse; Pearson Airpark; Officer's Row; Old Apple Tree Park; Marine \nPark; and the Columbia River Waterfront. In its entirety, the reserve \nincludes 366 acres of publicly owned land and extends from Officer's \nRow to the Columbia River.\n  In addition, thanks to a significant investment by the M.J. Murdock \nTrust, \n\n[[Page S 11786]]\na new air museum will be constructed on the reserve. The M.J. Murdock \nAviation Museum at Pearson Airpark will be a living memorial to \nVancouver resident Jack Murdock, in recognition of his innovative \nachievements and love of aviation. Along with original antique \naircraft, the existing historic structures of a pre-World War II hanger \nwill be rebuilt to honor one of the oldest U.S. Air Corps airfields, \nlocated at Pearson Airfield in the early 1920's.\n  Representatives from the city of Vancouver have been working to \nensure that the many historic sites in Vancouver are maintained and \nrestored. I praise the people of Vancouver for their outstanding \nefforts in securing private grants for the historic reserve. The mayor \nof Vancouver, Bruce Hagensen, deserves special thanks for his support \nand continued dedication to the development of this legislation.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to see that the \nVancouver National Historic Reserve becomes a reality.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleague \nfrom the State of Washington, Senator Slade Gorton, in sponsoring the \nVancouver National Historic Reserve Partnership Act of 1995.\n  This legislation is the product of years of effort by many people \nrepresenting public groups and all levels of government, but it would \nnot be before Congress today were it not for the vision, leadership, \nand hard work of former Congresswoman Jolene Unsoeld, who took on a \ndaunting challenge and came away with a broadly supported plan to \npreserve and promote several chapters in the colorful history of the \nPacific Northwest.\n  Briefly, the act would establish and coordinate the management of the \nVancouver National Historic Reserve, which contains a number of \ncontiguous historic sites located on the Columbia River. This area, \nsituated in the heart of the Portland-Vancouver metropolitan area, \nprovides a rare opportunity to save and interpret, in one central \nlocation, several layers of history. Vancouver's historic area has been \nreferred to as the ``birthplace of history in the Northwest'' since \nLewis and Clark explored the areas in 1805-6.\n  The historic reserve is located within an original 1848 military \nreserve and includes six principal elements: Fort Vancouver National \nHistoric Site--National Park Service; Vancouver Barracks--U.S. Army; \nPearson Airpark and museum--city of Vancouver--NPS/City, and Marine \nPark--City. These publicly-owned sites tell a story of Northwest \nhistory beginning with the rich native American culture that flourished \nalong the river, early Euro-American settlement of the area, the \nAmerican military presence in the Northwest, and more than 80 years of \ncontinuous aviation activity at Pearson Airfield, one of the original \nArmy Corps fields and the site of several aviation milestones.\n  In 1990, pursuant to Public Law 101-523, Congress created the \nVancouver Historical Study Commission and charged the five-member group \nwith developing a plan to preserve these historic assets and coordinate \nthe management of the area. After careful study and much public \ninvolvement, the Commission submitted, through Secretary of Interior \nBruce Babbitt, a report that is the basis for this act. It is a \ncarefully crafted plan which provides historic protection, a \npartnership among the property owners, and an opportunity--with no \nadditional financial obligation to the Federal Government--to highlight \nsome of the most important and interesting history in the Pacific \nNorthwest.\n  I want to commend the city of Vancouver for demonstrating, through \ntheir outstanding restoration of Officers Row, that historic \npreservation can be economically self-sustaining and for working \nclosely with the National Park Service, the U.S. Army, and the State \nOffice of Historic Preservation to develop this plan.\n  The Vancouver National Historic Reserve Partnership Act provides a \nnew standard for historic preservation. It emphasizes a narrative or \nlayered approach to history instead of the single-point-in-time \napproach, and it demonstrates how--at a time when the Federal \nGovernment cannot afford expensive new initiatives to acquire, restore, \nor maintain historic properties--we can form partnerships to preserve \nand highlight our heritage.\n  I am proud to be the cosponsor of this act in the Senate and urge \nthat it be given timely and favorable consideration by this body.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1128. A bill to amend chapters 83 and 84 of title 5, United States \nCode, to extend the civil service retirement provisions of such chapter \nwhich are applicable to law enforcement officers, to inspectors of the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service, inspectors and canine \nenforcement officers of the U.S. Customs Service, and revenue officers \nof the Internal Revenue Service; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n       the hazardous occupations retirement benefits act of 1995\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I introduce the Hazardous \nOccupations Retirement Benefits Act of 1995.\n  This legislation will grant an early retirement package for revenue \nofficers of the Internal Revenue Service, customs inspectors of the \nU.S. Customs Service, and immigration inspectors of the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service.\n  Under current law, with the exception of the groups listed in this \nlegislation, all Federal law enforcement officers and firefighters are \neligible to retire at age 50 with 20 years of Federal service. The \nlegislation will amend the current law and finally grant the same 20-\nyear retirement to these members of the Internal Revenue Service, \nCustoms Service, and Immigration and Naturalization Service. The \nemployees under this bill have very hazardous, physically taxing \noccupations, and it is in the public's interest to tenure a young and \ncompetent work force in these jobs.\n  The need for a 20-year retirement benefit for inspectors of the \nCustoms Service is easily apparent. These employees are the country's \nfirst line of defense against terrorism and the smuggling of illegal \ndrugs at our borders. They have the authority to apprehend those \nengaged in such activities and carry a firearm on the job. They are \nresponsible for the majority of arrests performed by Customs Service \nemployees. In 1994, inspectors of the Customs Service seized 204,000 \npounds of cocaine, 2,600 pounds of heroin, and 559,000 pounds of \nmarijuana. They are required to undergo the same law enforcement \ntraining as all other law enforcement personnel. These employees face \nmultiple challenges. They confront leading criminals in the drug war, \norganized crime figures, and increasingly sophisticated white-collar \ncriminals.\n  Revenue officers struggle with heavy workloads and a high rate of job \nstress, resulting in a variety of physical and mental symptoms. Many \nIRS employees must employ pseudonyms to hide their identity because of \nthe great threat to their personal safety. The Internal Revenue Service \nrecently put out a manual for their employees entitled: ``Assaults and \nThreats: A Guide to Your Personal Safety'' to help employees respond to \nhostile situations. The document advises IRS employees how to handle \non-the-job assaults, abuse, threatening telephone calls, and other \nmenacing situations.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is cost effective. Any cost that is \ncreated by this act is more than offset by savings in training costs \nand increased revenue collection. A 20-year retirement bill for these \nemployees will reduce turnover, increase yield, decrease employee \nrecruitment and development costs, and enhance the retention of a well-\ntrained and experienced work force.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me again in this Congress in expressing \nsupport for this bill and finally getting it enacted.

A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \npermit employers to provide for flexible and compressed schedules, to \npermit employers to give priority treatment in hiring decisions to \nformer employees \n\n[[Page S 11788]]\nafter periods of family care responsibility, to maintain the minimum \nwage and overtime exemption for employees subject to certain leave \npolicies, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n                  the work and family integration act\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, in 1938 American movies like ``Mr. Smith \nGoes to Washington'' and ``The Wizard of Oz'' were still in production; \nU.S. involvement in World War II was 3 years away; the American labor \nforce was almost entirely made up of industrial and agricultural \nworkers; the right to collective bargaining was not yet 3 years old; \nless than 16 percent of married women were working outside their homes; \nand the Fair Labor Standards Act [FLSA] of 1938 was enacted.\n  Now, nearly 60 years later, ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' and \n``The Wizard of Oz'' are American movie classics; World War II secured \nAmerica's ascendency to superpower status; service sector jobs dominate \nthe economy; the right to collectively bargain is deeply embedded in \nour labor laws; more than 75 percent of women with school-age children \nwork; and as absurd as it may seem, our rules governing the workplace \nand working hours still are largely governed by the Fair Labor \nStandards Act of 1938.\n  Mr. President, America's working families and working conditions are \nundergoing major transformations today, yet the rules Americans must \nwork under do not reflect changes in the structure and needs of \nsociety. Hopelessly outdated, our workplace laws reflect the needs of a \nbygone era that faced different challenges than we do today. It is \nincomprehensible that workplace law in this country is predominated by \na workplace statute that was passed almost 60 years ago.\n  The Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted at the request of President \nRoosevelt, who charged the 75th Congress with passing a law to help \nthose ``who toil in factory and on farm to obtain a fair day's work.'' \nThe law was enacted to protect unskilled, low-pay workers--those unable \nto protect themselves. In the context of today's two-parent and \nservice-oriented workplace; however, the law has unintended and \nunexpected consequences. In today's fast-paced, information-based \nsociety, its rigid and inflexible provisions have paralyzed those it \nwas meant to help. The FLSA now deprives employees of the right to \norder their daily lives on and off the job to meet the responsibilities \nof work and home.\n  For example, under the FLSA a worker who wants to work 45 hours one \nweek in exchange for working only 35 the following week so he or she \ncan attend their child's baseball game, parent-teacher conference, or \ndoctor's appointment, must first have an employer willing to pay him or \nher five hours of overtime pay for the 45 hour week. Since most \nemployers cannot afford this additional expense, an employee is left \nwith just two choices. He or she can forgo five hours of pay to be with \ntheir child, or miss the event their child needs them to attend. It is \nnot an employer who places employees in this catch-22 regarding their \nfamilies, it is the Federal Government. It is inside-the-beltway \nelitists who are depriving employees of the right to make decisions \nbest suited for their circumstances.\n  Ironically, even though the Fair Labor Standards Act ostensibly \nexempts salaried employees from the catch-22 faced by the Nation's \nhourly workers regarding flexibility in workday and workweek lengths, \nthe truth is that they are not exempt as a practical matter. Under \nrecent FSLA interpretations, whenever an employer allows a salaried \nworker to sway extra work for time off in increments which are less \nthan a full day, the salaried worker is then converted to an hourly \nworker. This opens employers up to huge overtime pay liability if they \nlet their salaried workers swap a few hours off for a few hours of \nadditional work before or after the time off.\n  Let me give an example, Mr. President. Pierce Processing was a \nprofessional engineering firm with 20 employees in Cincinnati, OH. \nWilliam Pierce updated his personnel policies to provide his salaried \nemployees with the maximum flexibility possible in their work schedules \nin order to meet the needs of their families and an attempt to increase \ntheir flexibility between work and family. Mr. Pierce had only one \nrequirement, that the employees work 80 hours in a 2-week period. Even \nthough the employees were salaried, Pierce agreed to pay them an \nadditional straight time for hours worked over 80 or to subtract the \ntime from an\n employees' pay if they did not work a full 80 hours. Through this \narrangement, he hoped these employees could tailor their work \nschedules--and even income if necessary--to meet their family needs. \nThis gave his salaried employees a great deal of control over their \ndaily lives and schedules. The Department of Labor, however, learned of \nthis progressive personnel policy, barged in and reclassified the \nprofessional employees as hourly workers. The Feds also required the \ncompany to pay the salaried employees 3 years of back overtime pay. To \nmaintain any sort of flexibility for his workers, Pierce had to adopt a \npolicy that required everyone to work a full day extra or take a full \nday off--to satisfy the Federal Government--so very little flexibility \ncould be provided. Ultimately, however, Mr. Pierce was forced, due to \nthe enormous litigation expenses, to declare bankruptcy and 20 people \nlost their jobs--all because he paid his employees well and provided \nthem with the maximum flexibility he could in scheduling.\n\n  Malcolm Pirnie, an engineering firm with offices throughout the \nUnited States and over 400 employees, suffered the same fate at the \nhands of the Department of Labor because the firm allowed salaried \nemployees to take a partial day of unpaid leave to attend parent-\nteacher conferences, to visit the doctor, or to further their \neducation. This action cost Malcolm Pirnie $875,000 in back pay for \novertime and his employees lost their flexibility to schedule their \nwork day to meet their individual needs.\n  More recently, the Department of Labor has alleged that the Boeing \nCo. misclassified professional employees earning an average of $54,000 \na year because, in addition to their salaries, they also were paid \nstraight time plus $6.50 an hour for all hours worked over 40 per week. \nWith the tools provided by our Government under the FLSA, there now is \na plaintiff's attorney currently soliciting 20,000 employees to join a \nclass action suit againt Boeing. I have the solicitation letter here, \nwhere the attorney informs potential litigants of their rights and \nspecifies that he can help only if the employees salary averages at \nleast $13 an hour for a 40-hour week. As a result, Boeing's workers now \nwill be entitled to their salaries only no matter how many hours they \nwork--extra hours will not be additionally compensated any longer.\n  Mr. President, FSLA's straightjacket on work schedules is not limited \nto the private sector, it also affects State and local government \nworkers. In Philadelphia, one FLSA court case will cost the city $60 \nmillion because the Federal Government says the city misclassified \npolice officers as salaried workers. New York City's liability for the \nalleged misclassification will be $16 million and California \nanticipates over $565 million in liability due to five pending FLSA \ncases. In almost every case, some of the most highly paid workers in \nthe labor force are collecting a windfall through this technical \nprovision in the law, thus costing taxpayers millions of dollars--\nsimply because State and local governments tried to provide their \nemployees with workplace flexibility to meet personal and family needs.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe these are the kind of results \nCongress intended in passing the Fair Labor Standards Act. I know this \nis a result this Congress should no longer tolerate.\n  Today, I am pleased to introduce the Work and Family Integration Act \nin an effort to make the Fair Labor Standards Act conform to the \nrealities of the current workplace. This legislation will put work \nschedule decisionmaking back in the hands of employees. It is designed \nto recognize that Washington does not know best, and that the millions \nof workers' individual circumstances cannot even begin to be addressed \nby this 60-year-old law, inflexible law. Today, flexibility is \nimportant and Americans deserve the benefit of setting their own \nschedules--not to be forced into the straightjacket demanded by the \nDepartment of Labor.\n  Flexible schedules were first introduced in Germany in 1967. Shortly \n\n[[Page S 11789]]\n  thereafter, many American institutions began realizing the benefits of \nthese schedules for their salaried workers--in both productivity in the \nworkplace and quality of life at home. In 1978, Congress recognized the \nbenefit of these work\n arrangements and passed the Federal Employees Flexible & Compressed \nWork Schedules Act. This act authorized a 3-year experimental period of \nalternative work schedules for Federal employees. The experiment was so \nsuccessful, it was extended again in 1982 and made permanent in 1985. \nSixty-six Senators as Members of either the House or the Senate, either \nvoted in favor of these laws, or were Members in 1985 when the \npermanent authorization passed the House and the Senate by voice vote.\n\n  Flexible work schedules give employees more control over their lives \nby allowing them to balance family and work obligations better. In \naddition, employees may attend to family needs without using limited \nsick leave allowances. Under compressed work schedules, day care \nexpenses can be reduced by as much as 20 percent. Time lost to \ncommuting would decline for employees able to travel during nonpeak \nhours.\n  Employers also would win. By having such family-friendly work \narrangements, they would enjoy increased employee productivity and \nloyalty. These benefits are essential for employers to compete in \ntoday's international, service-oriented economies.\n  It is uncontested that flexible work schedules are advantageous to \nboth employees and employers. Even President Clinton recognized the \nbenefits of flexible work schedules when he extended the FEFCWS to \nexecutive branch employees. On July 11, 1994, he said ``[b]road use of \nflexible work arrangements to enable Federal employees to better \nbalance their work and family responsibilities can increase employee \neffectiveness and job satisfaction, while decreasing turnover rates and \nabsenteeism.'' However, private sector employers remain unable to offer \nthis benefit to their hourly workers--even when both employers and \nemployees agree--due to the Congress' failure to update Federal \nworkplace laws. If such flexibility has been good for Federal \nGovernment employees over the last decade and a half, why are such \nbenefits being denied private sector employees and the employees of \nState and local governments?\n  Mr. President, the Work and Family Integration Act I am introducing \nis modeled after the Federal Employee Flexible and Compressed Work \nSchedules Act. It would allow private sector employees, specifically \nhourly employees, the same flexible work schedules that Federal workers \nhave enjoyed for almost twenty years. I emphasize that this bill is \nmeant to drag the Fair Labor Standards Act into the work and family \nrealities of the 1990's--instead of the 1930's--by doing three things:\n  First, the bill would alter the FLSA's rigid 40-hour maximum workweek \nprovision. It would allow employees to work 160 hours in any \ncombination, over a 4-week period before employers would have to pay \novertime compensation. In addition, when time is more valuable than \nmoney, employees would be able to request--and employers could \nprovide--compensatory time-and-a-half off in lieu of compensatory \novertime pay. Such flexibility in scheduling would enable employees to \nmeet better their family, community, and personal needs. Employees, not \nthe FSLA, will have control over their work lives.\n  As a safeguard against abuse, this legislation would require that any \nflexible work arrangement be agreed upon by both the employee and the \nemployer and coercion into such an arrangement is prohibited. An \nemployer who ahead of time schedules hours over 40 per week, without \nthe prior request of the employee, would continue to be obligated to \npay time-and-a-half. Employers also would be obligated to pay overtime \ncompensation for all hours worked over 160 in a 4-week period. Finally, \ncollective bargaining agreements would remain unaffected and would be \nfree to set whatever hours are reached in such agreements.\n  A second area in which my bill would update the FLSA is to correct \nthe Department of Labor concerns the salaried employee overtime \nexemption interpretation. In 1938, when the FLSA was written, employees \ngenerally were not paid unless they worked. Paid sick time, vacation \ntime, holiday or compensatory time off were virtually unknown. \nEmployees were either paid on an hourly basis\n for hours they actually worked or were paid a weekly salary. \nTherefore, the definition of salary was simple and easily understood.\n\n  Now that paid time-off policies have become so varied and \nsophisticated, the differences between salaried and hourly paid \nemployees are often almost indistinguishable. Application of the FLSA's \nsalaried exemption frequently is arbitrary, unpredictable, and contrary \nto good-faith efforts by employers to help--not abuse--employees. As a \nresult, many employers who have provided progressive flexible schedules \nfor their salaried employees--unintentionally turning these employees \ninto hourly workers, according to the Department of Labor--have been \nheld liable for massive amounts of overtime back pay. Once reclassified \nas an hourly employee rather a salaried one, not only is the employer \nliable for hundreds of thousands of dollars of allegedly unpaid \novertime, but the employee also loses control over their daily and \nweekly work schedules--and thus their ability to meet their family \nresponsibilities.\n  By clarifying the FLSA's exemption for salaried employees, employers \nwill then be free to offer flexible work schedules to employees without \nthe fear of having to pay back overtime instead of having to consult an \nattorney for every personnel decision.\n  Finally, the bill contains a provision allowing former employees a \npriority in rehiring if they quit in order to take care of family \nmember. An individual would then be able to take time off from his or \nher place of employment for up to 5 years to raise a child or care for \na parent, and upon return, could receive priority treatment in rehiring \nby the employer. The employer could not have such an employee's \npriority treatment used against it as evidence of, or an actual \nviolation of, Federal equal protection laws.\n  Mr. President, while the other institutions of society have updated \nthe modes and means of their production and operation, the Nation's \nworkplace laws have lagged far behind. Today, the most successful \ncorporations in America reflect the new realities of American life--\nthey are decentralized, flexible, and nonhierachical. Meanwhile, our \nFederal workplace laws continue to function along the centralized, \nhierarchical, and one-size-fits-all principles that were the mandates \nof an age long past. For far too long Congress has largely ignored the \nchanges in modern society's work and family realities. There is no need \nfor the Federal Government to continue protecting employees from \nthemselves in allegiance to an outdated law.\n  In the November election, Americans spoke loud and clear. \nUnfortunately, the voters' roar was barely audible to those in \nWashington who are no longer attuned to reality of the American \nexperience outside the beltway. On the other hand, for many of us, the \nfrustrated cries of those outside of Washington still echo in our ears. \nThe resounding mandate from the electorate is to drastically reduce \nGovernment spending, to shrink the size of the Federal Government, and \nto stop Government from interfering in making decisions for themselves, \ntheir property, and their lives. That means that the attitude of \nWashington-knows-best must come to an end.\n  Unfortunately, this attitude has become so prevalent in the minds of \nthis city's elite inside-the-beltway thinkers that they can no longer \nrecognize it in themselves. Washington has become so obsessed with \ntaking care of the American people that it is blind to the fact that \nsuch protection is often detrimental to the people's ability to order \ntheir activities and day-to-day lives as their desire.\n  Amending the Fair Labor Standards Act is essential to allow all \npeople--mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters--to work with their \nemployers to arrange a schedule which suits their obligations in the \nhome place as well as the workplace. This bill I am introducing would \nlargely remove the Federal Government from the most important decisions \nAmericans face each and every day, week, and month of the year.\n\n[[Page S 11790]]\n\n  And that, Mr. President, is precisely what voters sent us here to do.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/07/senate-section/article/S11785-4", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11790-S11791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               SENATE RESOLUTION 159--RELATIVE TO TOBACCO\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY (for himself, Mr. Hatfield, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Feinstein, \nMr. Kohl, Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Simon, \nMr. Bingaman, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Simpson) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                              S. Res. 159\n\n       Whereas more than 3,000,000 American children and teenagers \n     smoke cigarettes, and every 30 seconds a child in the United \n     States smokes for the first time;\n       Whereas about 90 percent of new smokers start smoking when \n     they are age 18 or younger;\n       Whereas longitudinal research has indicated that tobacco \n     use among children and teenagers has risen dramatically over \n     the last 4 years;\n       Whereas tobacco causes heart disease, strokes, lung cancer, \n     throat cancer, emphysema, and numerous other diseases, and \n     kills one out of every three long-term users;\n       Whereas tobacco causes the premature death of well over \n     400,000 Americans every year--more than alcohol, heroin, \n     crack, automobile and airplane accidents, homicides, \n     suicides, and AIDS combined;\n       Whereas numerous researchers have concluded that children's \n     and teenagers' use of tobacco decreases significantly when \n     the price of tobacco increases;\n       Whereas one study has recently concluded that a small \n     increase in the excise tax on cigarettes would save thousands \n     of lives each year;\n       Whereas the American Medical Association has recommended \n     that excise taxes on tobacco products should be dramatically \n     increased to help deter young people from becoming addicted; \n     and\n       Whereas the American Cancer Society has stated that raising \n     tobacco taxes is one of the most effective ways to rapidly \n     and significantly reduce tobacco use by young people: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) tobacco use among children and teenagers has been shown \n     to lead to addiction, disease, and premature death;\n       (2) raising the Federal excise tax on tobacco products will \n     prevent hundreds of thousands of American children and \n     teenagers from smoking;\n       (3) the Federal excise tax on tobacco products should be \n     increased in order to protect the health of children and \n     teenagers; and\n       (4) revenues raised by increasing the excise tax on tobacco \n     products should be used in part to help finance Federal \n     health programs.\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution that addresses a severe and growing public health \ncrisis--the large, and increasing, number of children and teenagers who \nare using cigarettes and other tobacco products. The sense-of-the-\nSenate makes three simple points: First, the tobacco use among children \nand teenagers has been shown to lead to addiction, disease, and \npremature death. Second, it States that raising the Federal excise tax \non tobacco products will prevent hundreds of thousands of American \nchildren and teenagers from using tobacco. Finally, my amendment, \nstates the logical conclusion of these two previous statements-that the \nSenate should support an increase in the Federal tax on tobacco \nproducts in order to protect the health of children and teenagers.\n  Mr. President, I would like to go through these three statements in \norder, explaining why I consider them to be irrefutable. First, I have \nstated that the tobacco use among children and teenagers leads to \naddiction, disease, and premature death. Let me offer a few statistics \nto demonstrate how widespread this problem is. More than 3 million \nAmerican children and teenagers smoke cigarettes. Every 30 seconds a \nchild in the United States smokes for the first time. And 90 percent of \nnew smokers start when they are teenagers or younger.\n  As if these statistics aren't frightening enough, they are soon going \nto get worse. Just last month the University of Michigan released a \nstudy showing that the rate of smoking among children has surged \nupwards over the last 4 years. In 1994, close to 20 percent of eighth \ngraders surveyed said they used cigarettes. This is a 30 percent \nincrease over the number of eighth graders who smoked in 1991. The \ntrend is similar for high school seniors: in 1992, 28 percent said they \nsmoked; by last year, this number had increased to over 31 percent. And \nthese numbers don't even count the number of children who use smokeless \ntobacco products.\n  Mr. President, the fact that well over 30 percent of America's high \nschool seniors use tobacco is a cause for great alarm in this chamber \nand around the country. Although the tobacco companies may seek to deny \nit publicly, it is well know that tobacco use causes addition, disease, \nand premature death. Tobacco is directly linked to a wide range of \nillnesses, including heart disease, strokes, emphysema, lung cancer, \noral cancer, and throat cancer, to name a few. One of every two long-\nterm tobacco users will die prematurely as a result of their tobacco \nuse. That\n totals to 1,100 deaths a day, or over 400,000 deaths a year--more than \nalcohol, heroin, crack, automobile and airplane accidents, homicides, \nsuicides, and AIDS combined. Of every 1,000 20-year-olds who smoke \nregularly, 250 of them will die in middle age from tobacco-related \nillnesses. These individuals will cut an estimated 20 to 25 years off \nof their lives as a result of their tobacco use. Another 250 will die \nin old age from a tobacco-related illness. In comparison, only 6 of \nthese 1,000 20-year-olds will die from homicides, and only 12 will die \nfrom car accidents. And, Mr. President, these statistics only show the \nnumber of today's children and teenagers who will eventually die from \ntobacco use; millions more will spend their lives addicted to nicotine, \nand will suffer from avoidable illnesses as a result of their tobacco \nuse.\n\n  Mr. President, most of today's kids do not know these statistics, and \neven if they know them, they often don't believe them. Last Sunday's \nNew York Times contained interviews with a group of Texas teenagers who \nsmoked. When asked about the health warnings listed on cigarettes, they \nreplied with comments such as ``I heard they have a cure for cancer \nnow.'' and ``I figure that if they really were so bad for you, they \nwouldn't be selling them everywhere.'' While these kids don't know \nabout the health effects of smoking, they certainly know about the \ndifferent brands of cigarettes. Last year, the tobacco industry spent \nabout $5 billion advertising their products, and much of this money was \nspent on marketing that appeals to kids. As just one example, consider \nthe cartoon character Joe Camel. Six-year-olds are as familiar with Joe \nCamel as they are with Mickey Mouse. Kids can send away for posters, T-\nshirts, and sandals with Joe Camel emblazoned all over them. Can it be \nany coincidence that after the Joe Camel campaign was introduced, \nCamel's market share among underage smokers jumped from one-half of 1 \npercent to 33 percent?\n  Mr. President, the second statement in my sense-of-the-Senate \ndiscusses one of the most effective measures the Federal Government can \ntake to reduce children's use of tobacco. The statement simply says \nthat raising the Federal excise tax on tobacco products will prevent \nhundreds of thousands of American children and teenagers from smoking.\n  Mr. President, I do not consider this statement a matter of opinon--I \nconsider it a fact. It has been proven in study after study. For \nexample, a researcher at Harvard's School of Public Health concluded \nearlier this year that every 10 percent increase in cigarette prices \ncauses demand among teenagers to decline by as much as 14 percent. And \na researcher from the Business School at Duke University released a \nstudy just last month projecting that a 10 percent increase in the tax \non cigarettes would save approximately 5,200 lives a year. These are \njust two of the studies proving my point. There are many more.\n  And it doesn't take a professional researcher to figure out that \nraising the tobacco tax will discourage kids from smoking. Last \nSunday's New York Times article included an interview with an 18-year-\nold girl who had been smoking since she was 12. When asked if she could \nthink of a way to get people to quit smoking, she replied:\n\n       Hike the price. If it was $4 a pack, I wouldn't smoke. Of \n     course, I don't want them to do that, but I think if they \n     were serious about it you'd get a lot of people saying, \n     ``That's too much money for a smoke, so forget it.''\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate should act on this young girl's suggestion. \nThe third statement of this resolution calls \n\n[[Page S 11791]]\non the Senate to do just that--to protect the health of children and \nteenagers by raising the excise tax on tobacco. This statement is the \nlogical conclusion of the two previous statements. If we are serious \nabout protecting our children from addiction, disease, and premature \ndeath, then we must take effective action to discourage them from using \ntobacco. And, as study after study has shown, raising the tobacco tax \nis one of the--perhaps the--most effective way of reducing children's \nand teenagers tobacco use. National health organizations, including the \nAmerican Medical Association and the American Cancer Society, strongly \nsupport this approach, calling for a dramatic increase in the tobacco \ntax in order to help deter young people from becoming addicted. My \nresolution also states that the revenues resulting from this increase \nshould be used, at least in part, to fund Federal health programs. In \nthis way, tobacco can help to offset a portion of the more than $22 \nbillion in costs which it imposes on the Federal Government each year.\n  Mr. President, just last month the head of the National Institute on \nDrug Abuse stated that ``We're not only not making progress on getting \nsmoking down among our children--we're beginning to lose the battle.'' \nMr. President, it is time that the U.S. Senate joined the fight. \nApproving the sense-of-the-Senate can be the first step.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/07/senate-section/article/S11790-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11791-S11793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 160--MARKING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE ANTI-GREEK POGROM \n                     IN TURKEY ON SEPTEMBER 6, 1955\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                              S. Res. 160\n\n       Whereas, in September 1955, there existed a Greek minority \n     population of 100,000 in Istanbul, Turkey;\n       Whereas, on the night of September 6-7, 1955, a pogrom \n     against the Greek community began in Istanbul;\n       Whereas, anti-Greek rioters attacked, pillaged, gutted and \n     destroyed more than 2,000 Greek homes, 4,200 Greek shops and \n     stores, 73 Greek Orthodox churches, 52 Greek schools, eight \n     Greek cemeteries, all three major Greek newspaper plants, and \n     dozens of Greek factories, hotels, restaurants and warehouses \n     in Istanbul;\n       Whereas, 15 Greeks were killed in the pogrom or died \n     subsequently, and 32 were seriously injured;\n       Whereas, as many as 200 women were raped by rioters;\n       Whereas, the U.S. Consul General in Istanbul reported that \n     police stood idly by or cheered on the rioting mobs;\n       Whereas, the State Department received confirmation of \n     ``elaborate advanced planning for widespread destruction of \n     the property of the indigenous Greek community,'' involving \n     careful preparations by many individuals;\n       Whereas, American journalist Frederick Sondern, Jr., \n     writing at the time for Readers Digest, described the events \n     of that night as ``.  .  .  one of the wildest eruptions of \n     mob fury and hysteria in modern times  .  .  .'';\n       Whereas, homes of Greek officers stationed at NATO \n     headquarters in the Turkish city of Izmir were also attacked \n     and destroyed;\n       Whereas, rioters attacked and burned down the Greek \n     Consulate in Izmir and the Greek Pavilion at the Izmir \n     International festival;\n       Whereas, Turkish authorities failed at the time to convict \n     a single rioter, out of thousands, for any crime committed \n     during the pogrom;\n       Whereas, five years later, after a military coup in Turkey, \n     the former Prime Minister and Acting Foreign Minister at the \n     time of the pogrom were charged with, and convicted of, \n     numerous criminal actions, including the instigation of the \n     anti-Greek riots;\n       Whereas, the pogrom marked the beginning of the end of the \n     Greek community's presence in Istanbul, numbering about 2,000 \n     in 1995;\n       Whereas, September 6, 1995 will mark the 40th Anniversary \n     of the pogrom; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the Sense of the Senate that the \n     President should (1) Take all appropriate steps to observe \n     and commemorate the loss of life and property, and the \n     numerous injuries and offenses, which took place during the \n     pogrom by proclaiming September 6, 1995 as a day of \n     remembrance for the victims of these attacks; and\n       (2) Urge all Americans to honor the victims of the pogrom \n     in the appropriate manner.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \ncommemorating the anti-Greek pogrom that took place in Istanbul and \nIzmir, Turkey, on the night of September 6-7, 1955. With the coming \n40th anniversary of this horrible event, this resolution is meant to \ncommemorate the tragic losses and horrific destruction of these riots \nand to honor its victims.\n  In September 1955, the Greek minority population in Istanbul numbered \nover 100,000 people. Today, slightly over 2,000 remain. This pogrom \nmarked the beginning of the end of the Greek community's presence in \nIstanbul and became ``* * * one of the wildest eruptions of mob fury \nand hysteria in modern times * * *'' as the journalist Frederick \nSondern, Jr., writing at the time in the Readers Digest, described.\n  Rioters killed 16 Greeks, and wounded 32 more. And it is reported \nthat as many as 200 Greek women were raped on this one night.\n  Moreover, anti-Greek rioters wantonly attacked, pillaged, gutted, and \ndestroyed more than 2,000 Greek homes, 4,200 Greek shops and stores, 73 \nGreek Orthodox churches, 52 Greek schools, 8 Greek cemeteries, all 3 \nmajor Greek newspaper plants, and dozens of Greek factories, hotels, \nrestaurants, and warehouses in Istanbul. At the time, the World Council \nof Churches placed the damages at $150 million. Other sources reported \nthe damage to be double that amount.\n  Similar attacks occurred in Izmir, Turkey at the same time when \nrioters attacked and burned down the Greek Consulate and the Greek \nPavilion at the Izmir International Fair, as well as attacking the \nhomes of several Greek officers stationed at the NATO headquarters \nthere.\n  During this time, the U.S. State Department reported extensively on \nthe pogrom, and described the destruction as ``extremely widespread,'' \nadding ``* * * only a very small percentage of community property \nappears to have escaped molestation.''\n  Mr. President, I am submitting this resolution so that the victims of \nthis pogrom are not forgotten and the perpetrators know that their \nvicious attacks will not pass into history without condemnation and \nhopefully redress, to the extent that this could be done. Just as \npogroms in the former Russian empire, during and after the Russian \nrevolution ended the lives of thousands of Jews, these pogroms cannot \nbe forgotten or denied. History must remember.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I ask unanimous consent that dispatches \nfrom the U.S. State Department concerning the pogrom, as well as a \nlisting of the deaths during the riots, be made a part of the Record. \nThese documents were reprinted in the 1992 Helsinki report, ``Denying \nHuman Rights & Ethnic Identity: The Greeks of Turkey.''\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution and honor \nthe victims of this despicable act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Appendix B\n\n     From: Amcongen, Istanbul.\n     To: The Department of State, Washington.\n     Subject: Damage caused to Greek Orthodox community \n         establishments during the September 6 Riots.\n       A survey of the damage inflicted on public establishments \n     of the Greek Community of Istanbul during the rioting on the \n     night of September 6-7 shows that the destruction caused has \n     been extremely widespread. In fact, only a very small \n     percentage of community property appears to have escaped \n     molestation. Although there are as yet no figures available \n     assessing the damage sustained, the number of establishments \n     attacked and the nature of the destruction caused in the \n     course of the night under reference convey a clear picture of \n     the scope of the devastation. In most cases the assault on \n     these establishments involved a thorough wrecking of \n     installations, furniture, equipment, desecration of holy \n     shrines and relics, and looting. In certain instances serious \n     damage was inflicted on the buildings themselves by fire.\n       Information received from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate \n     shows that of the 95 houses of worship listed on the books of \n     the Archbishopric of Istanbul 61 were either completely or \n     partially damaged. Eight of them became the victims of \n     flames. The religious edifices thus affected are identified \n     as follows:\n       1. Aghia Triada, Taksim--Wrecked, pillaged and destroyed by \n     fire.\n       2. St. Constantin, Kalyoncu Kulluk--Wrecked, pillaged and \n     destroyed by fire.\n       3.

Aghici Therapon--Damaged.\n       In addition to the above religious establishments the \n     following properties belonging to the Monastery of St. Sinai, \n     said to contain irreplaceable objects of art of Byzantine \n     origin and religious relics of great value, apparently, also \n     suffered serious destruction and pillage:\n       1. Monastery of St. Georges ti Krimnou, Heybeli Ada.\n       2. Monastery of St. Georges, Fener.\n       3. Monastery of St. Georges, Tenikoy.\n       Reports show that the dependencies of the religious \n     edifices hit were also not spared and that very serious \n     damage was inflicted on presbyteries and well-appointed \n     community meeting quarters, libraries, dispensaries attached \n     to these establishments.\n       Among the Greek churches heavily attacked also figures the \n     church of the Greek Catholic Uniate at Hamal Basi, Bayoglu. \n     Report has it that the presbytery of the said church and the \n     congregational school attached thereto were also severely \n     damaged. As a matter of fact three other Catholic churches \n     having no connection whatever with the Greek community, are \n     reported to have also suffered serious damage during the \n     rioting.\n       Reports on hand indicate that the rioting crowd hit with \n     particular frenzy at two important Greek Orthodox community \n     centers; the central cemetery at Sisli and the cemetery of \n     the Patriarchs at Balikil. The former sustained particularly \n     extensive destruction. Crosses and statues were knocked down, \n     sepulchers and vaults opened and the remains of the dead \n     removed and dispersed. At Balikli, the sarcophaguses of the \n     Greek Orthodox Patriarchs were desecrated.\n       As for the Greek Orthodox clergy itself, considering the \n     scale and severity of the acts of violence recorded, it \n     appears that only a relatively few were exposed to the fury \n     of rioters. According to information given by the \n     Patriarchate only one aged Orthodox priest, monk Chrysanthos \n     of Balikli, is believed to have been killed during the \n     rioting. Since his body has not been recovered he is listed \n     as missing. It is supposed that he perished during the \n     burning of his church. The principal dignitaries of the \n     Orthodox church who were maltreated during the disturbances \n     and made to suffer indignities are reported to be the \n     following:\n       The Metropolitan of New Cesarea, Weaudor.\n       The Metropolitan of Troy, Bogacikey.\n       The Metropolitan of Derkos, Therapia.\n       The Metropolitan of Chalchida, Kadikoy.\n       Bishop Panphilion, Balikli.\n       Bishop Ilioupolios, Arnarutkoy.\n       The Archdeacon of the Patriarchate, Yenikoy.\n       Extensive damage also seems to have been suffered by the \n     educational establishments of the Greek community. At least \n     36 of the 48 schools of the community are reported to have \n     been more or less seriously damaged. The principal victims \n     are the Zappeion Girls' College at Taksim and the Megali \n     Scholi Boys' College of Phanar, both princes of the \n     community, the Theological School at Heybeli, and the high \n     schools at Haskoy, Edirne Kapu, Bakirkoy, Gelata, Taksim and \n     Arnavutkoy. The elaborate dispensary of the Takrim High \n     School and several public soup kitchens operated in \n     conjunction with these educational institutions were also \n     demolished. A list of the schools hit by the rioters is given \n     below:\n       1. The Greek Catholic School at Hamal Basi.\n       2. The Zappeion Girls' College, Taksim.\n       3. The Megali Scholi Boys College, Phanar.\n       4. The School of Haskoy.\n       5. The School of Evanghelistria.\n       6. The School of Gelata.\n       7. The School of Ortakoy.\n       8. The School of St. Constaintin, Beyoglu.\n       9. The School of Bakirkoy.\n       10. The School of Boyacikoy.\n       11. The School of Kurtulus.\n       12. The School of Yenikoy.\n       13. The School of Ferikoy.\n       14. The Theological School of Heybeli Ada.\n       15. The School at Nane Street.\n       16. The School of Aynali Cesme.\n       17. The School of Arnavutkoy.\n       18. The School of Aghia Triada, Taksim.\n       19. The School of Bebsk.\n       20. The School of Besiktas.\n       21. The School of Kandilli.\n       22. The School of Cengelkby.\n       23. The School of Kuzgunouk.\n       24. The School of Uskudar (Teni Mahole).\n       25. The School of Xakikoy (Yeldegirmen).\n       26. The School of Cafer Aga.\n       27. The School of Balat.\n       28. The School of Lonca.\n       29. The School of Edirne Kapu.\n       30. The School of Samatya.\n       31. The School of Longa.\n       32. The School of Buyakdere.\n       33. The School of Tarabya.\n       34. The School of Buyuk Ada.\n       35. The School of Ioakimeion Parthenagogheion.\n       36. The School of Kentrikon Parthenagogheion.\n       Efforts are now being made to immediately repair some of \n     the damage to make possible opening of these schools by the \n     end of this month. To that effect a preliminary aid of TL \n     110,000 has been allocated to the Community by the Turkish \n     authorities. Special appropriations are also expected for the \n     repair of damaged religious institutions and cemeteries \n     since, neither the community itself nor the Patriarchate is \n     in a position to provide adequate funds for the purpose. As \n     the allocation of such funds will require legislative action, \n     an emergency relief of TL 200,000 is announced for urgent \n     repair work.\n       Though not specifically community property, it might be \n     appropriate to consider in the present report also the damage \n     sustained by the Greek language press of Istanbul. All three \n     principal dailies, the APOYEVMATINI, the TACHYDROMOS and the \n     EMBROS suffered heavy losses. The first two had both their \n     offices and printing establishments completely wrecked. In \n     the case of the EMBROS only its offices were destroyed since \n     it had no printing press of its own. The APOYEVMATINI \n     (circulation 10,000), the most heavily hit, managed to resume \n     publication two weeks after the rioting. Its losses alone are \n     estimated at half a million lirae. The TACHYDROMOS \n     (circulation 5,000) has as yet not been able to recuperate \n     from the blow but is scheduled to appear in the near future. \n     The EMBROS (circulation 7,000) reappeared a few days after \n     the disturbances. The weekly OKROIDS (circulation 5,000) \n     managed to continue publication without interruption though \n     its offices were also heavily wrecked. Like the EMBROS it has \n     no printing press of its own.\n       As pointed out in the opening paragraphs of this report a \n     monetary assessment of the damage caused to Greek Community \n     property in the course of the September 6 riot \n\n[[Page S 11793]]\n     has as yet not been attempted. Very general estimates on the part of \n     community and church leaders would indicate that it goes into \n     millions of Turkish liras. The Department will be informed as \n     soon as a substantive estimate is available.\n       For the Counsul General.\n                                                       Betty Carp,\n                                                Assistant Attache.\n                    Appendix C: Deaths in 1955 Riots\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       Manner of death/ \n        Name             Age             Place            source \\1\\    \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[Priest]                      90  Baloukli..........

As our Nation becomes increasingly reliant \non foreign energy sources, it is important for us to conduct research \nregarding production of domestic oil and natural gas. In our efforts to \ncut Federal spending, we must make sure we do not end the valuable \nresearch taking place at the naval petroleum reserves.\n  The naval petroleum reserve No. 3 is located in Casper, WY. The \nfacility conducts a number of research projects including various \ncooperative research programs with the University of Wyoming, private \nindividuals, and the State of Wyoming. As our Nation's domestic oil and \ngas reserves continue to decline, it is vital that we continue to \nresearch enhanced recovery techniques to locate and produce these \nvaluable resources. The NPR-3 facility plays an important role in \nconducting this research for our Nation's energy producers.\n  I hope the Secretary of Energy will consider the important role the \nnaval petroleum reserves play in providing research for our Nation's \ndomestic oil and gas producers as this issue moves forward.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/07/senate-section/article/S11794-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      JENNIFER KNOX, ``THE WALL''\n\n   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, so often we rush through our \nlives here in the U.S. Senate facing daily issues, debates, constituent \nconcerns and the press of daily business, never pausing to reflect on \nthings outside of Congress; important pieces of the American \nexperience. Every once in a while an event occurs, totally unexpected, \nwhich gives you pause to think about truth, meanings, and priorities.\n  That occurred for me last week when a wonderful family stopped by my \noffice from Washington State: a pair of grandparents, Kenneth and Pat \nStaley, and their two grandchildren, Jennifer and Ben Knox. They had \ndriven cross-country, 3,000 miles, to visit the Nation's Capitol and \nfor Jennifer, 12, to receive a poetry award.\n  I asked, as I often do, what they saw here that impressed them most. \nJennifer told me that one memorial in particular impressed upon her so \ndeeply that she had written a poem, which she was gracious enough to \nshare with me.\n  Today I share it with my colleagues because I think it speaks so \nprofoundly as to why we should take the time and money to erect \nmemorials for our Nation's heroes.

Mr. President, I rise today to draw attention to an \ninsightful speech recently delivered by Anthony Harrigan, counselor of \nthe United States Business and Industrial Council Education Foundation, \nat a June conference at the University of Colorado.\n  Mr. President, this is a speech which every Senator should study and \nmemorize. In great detail, Tony outlines the economic crisis that \nAmerica faces in this day of global competition.\n  All too often, America focuses on the short term--next quarter's \nprofit, next year's tax rate, minute changes in the interest rate. Our \ncompetition, notably Japan and other Eastern economies, does business \ndifferently. They look to the long term. Instead of vilifying the \nGovernment, they use and work with the Government to grab global market \nshare. And while they overtly kowtow to the mantra of free trade, they \nwork to trade in an unfree manner that is in the best interest of their \ncountries.\n  Mr. President, Tony Harrigan exposes the Western myth of free trade. \nIf we continue to go down the road offered by this dream, we will \ncontinue to lose and our standard of living will continue to decline. \nAs Mr. Harrigan explains, America will end up only an industrial shell \nof its former self. Instead of controlling our destiny, we will depend \non others and lose our economic sovereignty.\n  Mr. President, let us not allow the new world order to destroy the \nfreedoms that we cherish. To that end, I urge all my colleagues to read \nthis speech. I ask that the text be reprinted in the Record.\n  The speech follows:\n                 The Economic Crisis of the First World\n\n\n               the fear of a post-constitutional america\n\n                         (By Anthony Harrigan)\n\n       Ladies and Gentlemen: When the Soviet Union imploded, the \n     nations of the First World--the United States among them--\n     envisioned smooth sailing into the 21st century. There was \n     much talk of a huge ``peace dividend.'' This optimistic \n     vision of what lay ahead has been severely eroded, if not \n     shattered, by a variety of developments, including strife in \n     Bosnia, Somalia, Haiti, and even within the Russian \n     Federation. At the same time there have been ominous economic \n     problems, conflicts and challenges--the near economic wars, \n     the on-going economic deterioration of Africa, crushing \n     economic problems within the former Soviet Union, the \n     economic stagnation of much of Western Europe, the Mexican \n     debt crisis, high unemployment in Britain, France, and other \n     allied nations, and deindustrialization and underemployment \n     in the United States.\n       Indeed there are several crises facing the First World, \n     including a moral crisis and a threatening crisis with rogue \n     states with ambitious military agendas that aim at becoming \n     nuclear armed states.\n       Today, let us consider the economic crisis of the First \n     World. In the United States, tremendous attention is devoted \n     to economic issues, to topical issues, that is--tax and \n     interest rates and monthly and quarterly changes in the trade \n     deficit, housing starts, and similar matters. And a \n     superficial prosperity in the United States causes us to \n     divert attention from the long-range, deeper problems and \n     threats. It is important to remember that in 1928 economists, \n     and political and business leaders didn't consider the \n     possibility that America was on the brink of a economic \n     collapse that would produce a deep depression until America \n     entered World War II. Have we a clearer vision today?\n\n[[Page S 11795]]\n\n       Here and there one finds students of the world economy who \n     warn of another enormous economic crisis with grim \n     implication for our First World societies and political \n     institutions. One of these far-sighted economic observers is \n     Sir James Goldsmith, the Franco-British financier. Two years \n     ago, he began to voice ominous warnings. He said that in the \n     case of Western Europe, with some 20 percent unemployment,\n      ``the critical mass is here for implosion and social \n     upheaval and political instability on a global scale.''\n       He predicted that the Bolshevik revolution of 1917 will \n     pale into insignificance when compared to this upheaval. And \n     the situation in Western Europe has worsened since he issued \n     that warning.\n       Now the United States hasn't this kind of unemployment \n     problem, except in our inner cities. The overall employment \n     rate for the nation as a whole has risen a bit but under-\n     employment has risen on a colossal scale. Millions of \n     Americans have jobs that don't provide sufficient income to \n     support a family--even with husband and wife working. And \n     many of these millions don't have the benefits associated \n     with the good jobs that existed in the decades after World \n     War II.\n       Dr. Edward M. Lutwak of the Center for Strategic and \n     International Studies in Washington has analyzed this \n     problem. Dr. Lutwak has observed: ``The problem in question \n     is the unprecedented sense of personal economic insecurity \n     that has rather suddenly become the central phenomenon of \n     life in America, not only for the notoriously endangered \n     species of corporate middle managers, prime targets of \n     today's fashionable downsizing and re-engineering, but for \n     virtually all working Americans except tenured civil \n     servants--whose security is duly resented.''\n       The reasons for the economic insecurity felt by millions of \n     Americans are numerous and complex. A key element is \n     exploding technology which has made many jobs as out of date \n     as buggy-making. And this has made much employment temporary \n     in nature, thereby endangering working people and their \n     families who don't have advanced technical skills or the \n     education to obtain such. But there are other powerful forces \n     at work; and these forces have a tremendous bearing on \n     Europeans as well as Americans. These forces cause the \n     displacement of European and American-made goods, wipe our \n     jobs on both sides of the Atlantic, and produce the most \n     terrible anxieties, as well as threatening, as Kevin Phillips \n     and written, to cause the descent of Europe and North America \n     into Third World status.\n       It is important to reflect on the words of Sir James \n     Goldsmith. In an article published in The Washington Times, \n     November 27, Sir James said: ``During the past few years 4 \n     billion people have suddenly entered the world economy. They \n     include the populations of China, India, Vietnam, Bangladesh \n     and the countries that were part of the Soviet empire, among \n     others. These populations are growing fast. In 35 years, that \n     4 billion is forecast to expand to more than 6.5 billion. The \n     nations where those 4 billion live have very high levels of \n     unemployment and those people who do find jobs offer their \n     labor for a tiny fraction of the pay earned by workers in the \n     developed world. That means that new entrants into the world \n     economy are in direct competition with the work forces of \n     developed countries.''\n       This is a situation unprecedented in the history of the \n     older industrial countries, meaning the countries of the \n     West. And the industrial production of the new industrial or \n     industrializing countries, China, for example, is directed in \n     large measure at capturing the domestic markets of the \n     Western countries and, thereby, acquiring hard Western \n     currencies for their own purposes--for a massive military \n     buildup in the case of China. Simultaneously, therefore, the \n     Western countries are losing their internal markets on which \n     their peoples depend and are financing new military \n     challenges. Europeans, chiefly the French, are increasingly \n     mindful of this threat. But the United States is fixated on \n     Third World countries as trading partners, not as a \n     developing military threat. This kind of fixation is nothing \n     new. A decade ago, the great business interests of the United \n     States were desperate and determined to sell the most \n     advanced technological equipment to the Soviet Union--\n     products such as super-computers and ball bearings for \n     missile installations. The U.S. Department of Commerce made \n     every effort to push such sales, despite the strategic \n     implications of such sales.\n       Blindness to the Crisis of the First World could cause us \n     to descend precipitously along the road to instability and \n     collapse.\n       Sir James Goldsmith is not alone in sounding the alarm. \n     There are other keen observers of the world scene who share \n     Sir James's concerns. One of these is Arnaud de Borchgrave, \n     the Belgian-born writer and editor, who has written in \n     warning: ``By putting one's ear to the rail, one can hear the \n     distant rumble of social upheaval.''\n       He adds: ``Jobs are a global crisis. The 24 Organization \n     for Economic Cooperation and Development nations--the world's \n     wealthiest--now have a mind-numbing 35 million on the dole.''\n       He added: ``No one knows what the critical mass of \n     unemployment is.''\n       He wrote: ``But when the legions of Europe out of work \n     realize that no one seems to have an answer to the shed-jobs-\n     to-cut-costs dilemma, the ingredients for a continent-wide \n     social explosion will be in place. This is now known as the \n     unacceptable force of capitalism.''\n       He reported that 50 percent of Europe's unemployed have \n     been made to feel unwanted for a year or longer.\n       In Europe there is anger and unrest associated with the \n     unemployment. If one reads the London Financial Times, one \n     gets an idea of the severity of the problems from Spain to \n     Ireland and from Italy to Scandinavia. As European jobs are \n     exported to Asia (one-third of Europe's steel comes from the \n     Far East), powerful populist movements are growing--movements \n     which insist on national identity, control of national \n     borders against a flood of migrants and imported goods. These \n     movements are strenuously opposed to what they see as \n     economic and cultural homogenization which would level \n     incomes worldwide for the benefit of the financial interests.\n       On neither side of the Atlantic is there sufficient \n     appreciation of the growing anger. And many commentators \n     blithely ignore the problem. They look at the underlying \n     economic problem in strictly economic terms, dismissing the \n     human dimension. For example, an editor of Kiplinger's \n     Letter, has asserted that the U.S. is reindustrializing, not \n     deindustrialzing, observing that U.S. factories are producing \n     goods more efficiently--more goods with fewer people. But \n     that's precisely the point. Scores of thousands have been \n     thrown out of work in the name of efficiency and global \n     competition. The economic commentators are thinking of \n     society in terms of the cost-price ratio, not the terms of \n     people.\n       Part of the problem is that so many economic commentators \n     persist in employing euphemisms for very serious societal \n     problems.\n      One of the favorite euphemisms is ``rationalizing'' of \n     business. This is how an important British press voice \n     referred to the layoff of 6,500 workers by the Rolls-Royce \n     company in Scotland. It is doubtful that it makes a worker \n     and his family happier or more accepting if he is told \n     that his livelihood is being ``rationalized'' out of \n     existence, especially if the work is being shifted to \n     Malaysia or another Far Eastern country. The Rolls-Royce \n     announcement was greeted with ``anger and dismay in \n     Scotland.'' Did you note, by the way, at the time of the \n     Kobe earthquake that among the damaged facilities was \n     Caterpillar's tractor factory. The jobs at Kobe were \n     exported from Peoria, Illinois. ``Down-sizing'' is another \n     euphemism. In the last few years, IBM, Xerox, and many \n     other industrial giants have been down-sized, with scores \n     of thousands of highly skilled workers--blue collar, white \n     collar, and managerial--laid off. What's happening, in \n     fact, is that the United States is being downsized. For \n     generations, young Americans have been taught the virtues \n     of self-sufficiency, hard work, cooperation, and loyalty. \n     But these virtues are dismissed in an era of \n     ``rationalization'' and ``down-sizing.'' They don't \n     prevent giant enterprises from shipping jobs abroad. And \n     national legislators seem blind to the problem or to the \n     growing public anger at the abandonment of hard-working \n     citizens, the type who made America.\n       Euphemisms in the economic areas mask deeply disturbing \n     phenomena. The March 31 issue of the Forward pointed this out \n     with great clarity. A column in that newspaper noted: ``If an \n     American company closes a plant here and ships its equipment \n     to China, that will be called an `export.' It will be an \n     `export' that will not add, but will subtract, jobs from \n     America.''\n       ``Another case: Component parts from America will be \n     shipped to Mexico, to be assembled there and sold \n     exclusively, by law, in America. The shipments in Mexico will \n     be listed as an `export,' although nothing was exported \n     except American jobs that once assembled the product here.''\n       ``Or another case: Component parts for a dishwasher or a \n     car are imported from Third World countries. The labor in the \n     parts makes up 80 percent of the labor in the completed \n     product. When sold to the elite of some Third World country, \n     the value of the finished product is listed as an `export.' \n     ''\n       ``And so we list as exports the exports of jobs, the export \n     of products we imported, the export of products that are \n     never sold to another country. We figment these `exports' to \n     fictitious `emerging markets' to conceal the fact that we are \n     moving jobs out of America to other countries where \n     manufacturers are using cheap--often child and slave--labor \n     to make things, carrying the labels of American companies, to \n     be sold in America.''\n       The failure of mainstream European leaders to understand \n     this anger is leading to political fragmentation. There is \n     evidence of a growing divide in Europe. The Financial Times \n     says this was reflected in the vote on the Maastricht Treaty, \n     with the professional middle class in favor and ``two thirds \n     of working people against it.'' The glue that held together \n     the center-right parties is dissolving, in large part ``under \n     the impact of European integration and the worldwide move \n     towards free trade,'' said the Times. The opponents of \n     globalism and economic homogenization surely will become a \n     powerful force on both sides of the Atlantic. The Perot \n     movement of 1992 was an indicator of coming change. Much of \n     the Perot message had to do with betrayal of the economic \n     interests of ordinary Americans, those whom a writer for \n     Fortune magazine referred to (February, 1995) as ``the have-\n     less half of the middle class.''\n       Americans and Europeans soon may begin to understand the \n     price of the transnational ``free market,'' the globalist \n     vision of those who are contemptuous of the losers in their \n\n[[Page S 11796]]\n     countries' populations and who seek the protection of the nations where \n     they are headquartered but who disavow any responsibility to \n     the interests of their nations. Where this leads one can't \n     predict, but one recognizes a loss of living standard \n     expectations and expectations on the part of many millions \n     who are squeezed out in the game of globalist competition. \n     These are citizens who are shoved to the margins, \n     irrespective of the promises of Western democratic \n     government. The prospects are dismal for many Americans and \n     Europeans even as some elements in their nations profit \n     enormously from globalism. In our time, greed overwhelms \n     patriotism, as evidenced in the opposition to trade policies \n     which would safeguard the economic well-being of millions of \n     ordinary Americans who have lost or will lose their jobs.\n       Something is very wrong when a company decides to maintain \n     only its head office and, possibly, its sale force in its \n     home country, and transfers production to low wage countries. \n     I submit it's immoral to eliminate one's national work force \n     and transfer production abroad. The argument has been that \n     the losses will be made up in advance products. But, as Sir \n     James Goldsmith has noted, when the French signed a $2.1 \n     billion contract with South Korea for high speed trains, it \n     produced only 800 jobs in France. More and more aircraft \n     contracts with Asian countries mean shifting large parts of \n     the production process to those countries. The believers in \n     the theology of total free trade seek a worldwide market in \n     goods, services, capital, and yes, labor. That means the \n     hollowing out of American manufacturing enterprises. it means \n     that U.S. workers have to compete with Chinese workers who \n     earn twenty cents an hour.\n       The focus of the major financial interests is not on the \n     United States, the American economy, or the needs of the \n     American people. Indicative of this lack of focus, of an \n     alternative focus, was a symposium held last May in China \n     under the auspices of the International Herald Tribune, which \n     is jointly owned by The New York Times and The Washington \n     Post. The paper, to use its language, invited to China, a \n     ``limited number of largest multinational corporations with a \n     stake in the future of the Chinese economy.'' It would be \n     interesting to know the names of these multinational \n     corporations, which are headquartered in the United States, \n     where their investments are being made, and especially, how \n     much is being invested in China and other Asian countries and \n     how much in the U.S. Finally, what percentage of their goods \n     manufactured abroad are sold in the American market? This is \n     information that the American people need to know, which \n     Congress is not trying to obtain for them.\n       The American people have paid a hellish price for this \n     focus on the economic future of countries such as China, \n     which are earning huge profits from penetrating the U.S. \n     domestic market in order to challenge the United States. The \n     price is not only in lost American jobs but stagnated \n     communities, deteriorated wages, the drying up of small \n     businesses, and dependence on export markets, meaning \n     dependence on foreign regimes and their financial maneuvers. \n     The greatest loss, of course, is America's economic \n     sovereignty.\n       Those who defend globalization, despite these losses, argue \n     that the United States can more than make up for them by \n     training unskilled workers. But this training is not the \n     answer to the problem of unemployment in Europe, or \n     unemployment in the United States--the proliferation, that \n     is, of jobs that don't pay enough to provide even a minimal \n     standard of living. Even The Economist magazine, which is an \n     ardent supporter of globalization, recognizes that ``wages at \n     the bottom are lower in America'' than in Europe. And it \n     admits that ``training can even be the royal road to ruin.'' \n     Those interested in so-called ``rationalizing'' of jobs can \n     gain more advantage by eliminating jobs where there is \n     demarcating of jobs based on skills rather than establishing \n     frequent, costly job training programs. And the presentation \n     of job training as the magic bullet ignores the fact that \n     employers prefer younger, supposedly more flexible workers \n     than middle aged workers who have lost their jobs through \n     corporate ``downsizing.'' In any case, what are so-called \n     redundant workers to be trained for? Our global competitors \n     aren't without skilled workers or brains.\n       It is politically fashionable to speak of empowering \n     Americans--meaning restoring them to a condition of \n     individual responsibility and local control--both worthy \n     objectives. But the most important empowerment involves both \n     the restoration of their family values, moral values in the \n     public environment, and economic empowerment. Over 15 years, \n     they have lost economic power enjoyed by previous generations \n     of Americans.\n       There are many who profess to believe in democratic \n     principles and a moral approach to the organization of \n     American society but who show disdain for the ordinary \n     American. An example of this was an article by Washington \n     Post columnist Richard Cohen (February 2) in which he \n     lambasted popular opposition to the $40 billion Mexican \n     bailout. He declared that the people ``aren't always wise.'' \n     To be sure, it was their money, their credit, which was on \n     the line. And so it is with the grand globalist economic \n     schemes. That ordinary Americans suffer in the process seems \n     to be of little concern to those who predict vast \n     opportunities in so-called emerging markets such as China. \n     But there's no reason to believe that the American people, \n     apart from Wall Street investors, stand to benefit from a \n     huge trade deficit with China.\n       The dark scenario I present here is not simply one person's \n     vision. A Shell International Petroleum Co. economist, Peter \n     Kassler, has presented a scenario called ``Barricades'' which \n     envisions social and economic chaos under the GATT trade \n     regime, with unrelenting jobs cuts and downward pressure on \n     wages in industrial countries. Business Week (December 19, \n     1994) said that: ``Potent opposition is growing against the \n     politicians who would further weaken a nation's power to set \n     its economic course.''\n       It reported on the so-called ``anxious class'' on both \n     sides of the Atlantic, noting that in Britain wages are \n     stagnating and that nearly 90 percent of new jobs in the U.K. \n     are part-time. In France, Sir James Goldsmith says hard-nosed \n     corporations press for lower wages at home or ``rush to the \n     Third World to exploit cheap labor.''\n       The conditions described here constitute the so-called New \n     World Order, the transnational world order. This New World \n     Order already has played havoc with the lives of millions of \n     Americans and Europeans. The existence of a $150 billion \n     trade deficit with Asia--for the United States, that is, is a \n     feature of the New World Order and derives from the economic \n     priorities of those who favor the transnational outlook. But \n     this New World Order may go the way of other new world orders \n     in the 20th century--the socialist, communist, and Nazi new \n     world orders. And the struggle over the latest New World \n     order will focus on a variety of questions, involving what \n     one wrote (Washington Post, January 29, 1995) referred to as \n     ``intertwining forms of governance, ideology, cultural life, \n     and the protection and distribution of goods''--and, I would \n     add, morality.\n       As a people, as a civilization on both sides of the \n     Atlantic, we have not found our way through this thicket of \n     issues, forces, and problems. I suspect that we haven't a \n     great deal of time to repair the fabric of our civilization \n     and also meet the economic challenges it faces, as well as \n     deal with the internal stresses and anxieties--and anger--\n     provoked by economic policies and tendencies. Business Week, \n     a certifiable establishment journal, asserted (December 19, \n     1994) that if we don't find our way that ``There could be \n     hell to pay,'' a logical conclusion. If Americans and \n     Europeans, the working people, don't get the rewards they \n     believe they deserve, that their countries' striving over \n     generations seemed to ensure, the result will be strife, \n     revolution, that is, in one form or another. The anxiety \n     level is rising, and if the standard of living is whittled \n     away by runaway globalist policies, the backlash will be like \n     nothing we have seen in the post-World War II history of the \n     North Atlantic nations. What form it will take is unclear at \n     this time. But it surely will occur. Precisely how the \n     economic crisis will impact society in moral terms also \n     remains in the realm of the unknown. One thing is certain: \n     The Atlantic countries will not simply accommodate themselves \n     to diminished expectations and diminished results. And there \n     will be a massive vote of no-confidence in the political and \n     cultural leadership elites in the West who have steered us \n     into decline, or who have been indifferent to the dangers and \n     tolerated decline.\n       Dr. Winifred McClay, an historian at Tulane University, has \n     written that need exists for a ``consolidated or nationalized \n     political and economic order.'' Such an order would overcome \n     the establishment notion that national sovereignty and \n     economic independence are things of the past. It would put \n     public policy in a new moral framework, a framework of \n     respect for all Americans and American interests. How do we \n     achieve a new nationalist, as opposed to a globalist, \n     economic policy? The answer could be the subject of many \n     lectures. But I submit that the essential first step is to \n     defang the transnational of multi-national companies, the \n     money power that increasingly holds U.S. policy and the \n     American people in thrall. And how do we go about defanging \n     them? By restricting their operations, placing limits on \n     those who are headquartered in the United States and seek the \n     protection of the United States while rejecting any special \n     loyalty to America. If they shift their manufacturing \n     operations to low-wage Third World countries in order to sell \n     their slave wage-made goods in the American market, then let \n     them be subject to penalties. In other words, we strike at \n     their profits. And the foreign-headquartered multinationals \n     would be subjected to the same barriers employed by the \n     Japanese when the latter protect their national economic \n     interest. There is nothing radical about such an approach. It \n     is what our great-grandfathers supported when the Sherman \n     Anti-Trust Act was written into law to block the operations \n     of the monopolistic domestic cartels of the late 19th \n     century. And I submit that the new policies of limitation \n     would have the same moral purpose as the Sherman Act, which \n     was\n      passed to protect ordinary Americans from exploitation.\n       As a traditional conservative I regard problems of moral \n     decline and economic threat as two faces of the same coin. I \n     believe that in recent years, as a result of the emergence \n     and power of the transnational corporations and the \n     transnational globalist \n\n[[Page S 11797]]\n     international organizations, that we have departed from the ways \n     prescribed by our forebears in the U.S. Constitution and from \n     their moral instructions as evidenced in the Preamble to the \n     Constitution with its dedication of our system of government \n     to the promotion of the general welfare. We need a new \n     emphasis upon virtue, authentic justice, recognition of \n     shared experience and shared devotion to the common good--all \n     that America is about, as our Founding Fathers ordained in \n     the Constitution. And as a traditional conservative, who \n     fears a post-constitutional America, I look for wisdom and \n     understanding wherever I can find it--even in what may seem \n     the most unlikely sources. I found evidence of it in a \n     statement by former Gov. Jerry Brown of California, not \n     someone I have quoted favorably before. Interviewed by \n     Chronicles magazine, a conservative intellectual journal, he \n     said we: ``need enrichment of the community and real \n     deconstruction of the workings of the global economy, global \n     institutions--the central banks, the General Agreement on \n     Tariffs and Trade, the World Bank, the multinational \n     companies--and of the way in which our lives are being \n     embedded in a runaway, large-scale corporate, global culture \n     that is undemocratic, inhuman, and destructive.''\n       The late Russell Kirk, the great conservative thinker who \n     spoke at these institutes for so many years, could have \n     written these words. They are in the spirit of Edmund Burke \n     and the Founding Fathers, and they provide us with goals for \n     the moral recovery, community strengthening, and economic \n     safeguarding of the American people and nation. If we embrace \n     this understanding, adopt this new direction for our national \n     affairs, and wake to the need for a restoration of the moral \n     virtue that characterized our republic and our civilization \n     in the past, we should be able to overcome all the challenges \n     and reinvigorate the public and private order built upon our \n     priceless heritage in the Western world.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/07/senate-section/article/S11794-5", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SUZANNE MARIE BEEDE\n\n Mr. HATFIELD.

Mr. President, several days ago a bomb exploded at \nthe home of Guy Pence, a U.S. Forest Service ranger who lives and works \nin Carson City, NV. Fortunately, no one was injured, although Mr. \nPence's wife and three children were in the house at the time of the \nexplosion. My colleagues might recall that the Forest Service's Carson \nCity office, where Mr. Pence works, was also bombed several months ago. \nNeedless to say, the recent incidents of violent, terrorist activity \ndirected at Federal employees and Federal land management agencies in \nthe State of Nevada and elsewhere represent a disturbing trend that \nwill undoubtedly result in the loss of life if the perpetrators are not \napprehended.\n  Mr. President, I want to make it clear at the outset that I do not \nclaim or represent to know who or whom is behind these bombings; no one \nhas been arrested or claimed responsibility to date. What I can tell \nyou, though, is that by every indication, the person or persons \nresponsible for these acts are riding a wave of anti-Federal Government \nsentiment. Clearly, the controversy over the role of two Federal law \nenforcement agencies, the ATF and FBI, in both the Randy Weaver \nincident and the Waco tragedy, has heightened public cynicism toward \nthe Federal Government--the rise of militia groups in many States is \nevidence of this. Perhaps more relevant to the bombings in Nevada, \nhowever, is the rise of the county supremacy movement. People \nassociated with this movement are upset with what they view as the \nFederal Government's overly intrusive role in grazing, mining, and \nother activities on public lands. They would like to see \nresponsibilities for managing these lands delegated to local \ngovernmental entities.\n  Mr. President, it is apparent that the incendiary rhetoric espoused \nby some of those in the county supremacy movement has created an \natmosphere that promotes extremism. What began as a legitimate \nphilosophical difference of opinion over the management of Federal land \nhas been transformed into a call to battle for many. Last March the \nJustice Department was forced to life a lawsuit against Nye County, \nprimarily in response to physical threats made against Forest Service \nemployees by county officials. While the lawsuit may settle the legal \nissue of who has jurisdiction over public lands, I am skeptical that \nthe fringe elements of the county supremacy movement will abide by the \nrule of law.\n  I would hope that the Members of this body, particularly my \ncolleagues from the West, would recognize that unless efforts are made \nto tone down the rhetoric on public land issues, it is only a matter of \ntime before someone, most likely a Federal employee in Nevada, is \nseriously injured or even killed.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/07/senate-section/article/S11797-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11797-S11798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                CONGRATULATIONS TO CONCORDIA UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, 90 years ago, in the basement of \na Portland, OR, Lutheran church, Concordia College was founded. Two \nyears later, its founder moved the college to a 5-acre plot in \nNortheast Portland and erected the first building of Evangelical \nLutheran Concordia College.\n  That spring of 1907 was a very special time in the life of \nConcordia--a new location, a new building, a recognizable presence. The \nyear 1995 ushers in another new era for this college. On August 26, the \nboard of regents, faculty, staff, students and friends of Concordia \nwill gather to celebrate Concordia College's transition to its new \nstatus as Concordia University.\n  From 1905 through 1995, this institution has experienced a wealth of \nsignificant, laudable accomplishments. I would mention 1946, when \nConcordia reached junior college status, 1977 when the college was \ngranted 4-year status and 1987 when the Board of Regents adopted a \nsuccessful planning strategy known as the Keller Plan, after education \nexpert and consultant George Keller.\n  When the college was made up of 17 young men and an $800 budget, in \n1905, it would have seemed implausible that 90 years later it would \nhave 1,000 men and women students, a Health Care Administration program \nranked among the top five in the country and the only baccalaureate \ndegree program in Environmental Remediation and Hazardous Materials \nManagement--an extremely important program, especially given the \nserious energy issues facing the Pacific Northwest.\n  Today, Concordia College has five schools: arts and sciences, \nbusiness, health and social services, teacher education, and \ntheological studies. In the fall of 1996, these five schools will \nbecome five colleges designated under Concordia University. Throughout \nthis transition, Concordia's mission of developing leaders for the \nchurch and leaders for society has remained constant. It has remained \ncommitted to the spiritual growth of its students and \n\n[[Page S 11798]]\nthe rigorous academic standards of its courses.\n  I wish to congratulate all those who have had a partnership in the \ngrowth of Concordia College, its faculty, staff, and students. I would \nalso like to mention the outstanding leadership of Concordia's \npresident, Charles E. Schlimpert, its Board of Regents and the \nConcordia College Foundation Board of Directors. The direction they are \nproviding will lead Concordia University into a bright future.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Concordia University's formal mission \nstatement be printed in the Record.\n  The statement follows:\n\n                           Mission Statement\n\n       Concordia University, of the Lutheran Church-Missouri \n     Synod, is a center of higher learning that assists students \n     in their lifelong quests for full realization of spiritual, \n     intellectual, social, physical, relational and emotional \n     development. Professional education, grounded in the liberal \n     arts and enriched by relevant co-curricular activities, will \n     strengthen the Church and world community by encouraging the \n     development of Christian values, and an attitude of service \n     among Concordia University students.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/07/senate-section/article/S11797-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  CONGRATULATING MARTIN C.M. LEE ON RECEIVING THE 1995 INTERNATIONAL \n HUMAN RIGHTS AWARD BY THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION LITIGATION SECTION\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, tomorrow, in Chicago, the American \nBar Association's litigation section will present its 1995 \nInternational Human Rights Award to Martin C.M. Lee, the chairman of \nthe Democratic Party in Hong Kong. The award is a high honor which Mr. \nLee has earned for his efforts to win full democracy for the people of \nHong Kong and to safeguard the rule of law as the territory nears its \nJune 30, 1997, reversion to the People's Republic of China. I would \nlike to take this opportunity to extend my warmest congratulations to \nMartin Lee and submit for the record an article by former Attorney \nGeneral Dick Thornburgh which appeared on July 30, 1995, in the \nWashington Post.\n  The article is called, ``A Blow to Hong Kong's Future.'' The blow \nDick Thornburgh refers to is the recent agreement by Great Britain and \nthe People's Republic of China to set up a new high court for Hong Kong \naccording to terms that violate the 1984 Joint Declaration. The terms, \nwhich include restrictions on jurisdiction and limits on foreign common \nlaw judges, have dealt a powerful blow to the colony's long tradition \nof judicial independence. Dick Thornburgh's article reports that the \nHong Kong Government of Chris Patten has criticized the American Bar \nAssociation for bestowing its award on Mr. Lee. As the article says, \nthe Hong Kong Government is disturbed that ``Lee, one of several \nleading lights in the democratic community, has been calling the court \ndeal what it is: A sellout.''\n  China has made the future of Hong Kong's democrats painfully clear by \nannouncing its intention to abolish Hong Kong's Legislative Council \n[Legco], abrogate the bill of rights ordinance, and destroy the rule of \nlaw. Over the next 2 years, we Americans must stand with Martin Lee and \nhis fellow democrats as they stand up for the future, and autonomy they \nwere promised.\n  I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n               [From the Washington Post, July 30, 1995]\n\n                      A Blow to Hong Kong's Future\n\n                          (By Dick Thornburgh)\n\n       What government recently denounced an organization that was \n     planning to bestow an international human rights award on its \n     most prominent democrat? No, not Burma. Not Nigeria. It was \n     the British government of Hong Kong, which, although not yet \n     in its final days, is conducting a fire sale of the \n     protections that the rule of law built up over a century.\n       This month the American Bar Association's litigation \n     section announced it would award Martin Lee, chairman of the \n     Democratic Party of Hong Kong, its 1995 International Human \n     Rights Award at its meeting in Chicago on August 8. A top \n     Hong Kong government official promptly denounced the ABA, and \n     continued the Hong Kong government's mounting attacks on Lee \n     himself.\n       The Hong Kong government of Chris Patten has reason to be \n     alarmed by the ABA award. It will bring Martin Lee and his \n     criticisms of Great Britain's double-cross of Hong Kong to \n     the attention not only of the ABA's approximately 350,000 \n     members but to all Americans distressed by China's arrest of \n     American activist Harry Wu, and the PRC's long record of \n     human rights abuses.\n       Less than two years from now, Hong Kong will be transferred \n     to the PRC under the terms of the Sino-British Joint \n     Declaration. Under that 1984 agreement, both Great Britain \n     and China pledged Hong Kong would thrive under an arrangement \n     Deng Xiaoping called ``one country, two systems.'' Since \n     then, however, China has reneged on virtually every one of \n     its commitments, pledging to abolish the Legislative Council \n     (Legco) and abrogate the bill of rights ordinance, and \n     seeking to destroy the rule of law. The British Hong Kong \n     government has stood by and done nothing.\n       In early June, the Hong Kong government signaled its final \n     retreat. British and PRC negotiators cut a deal on the Court \n     of Final Appeal, the new court needed to replace London's \n     Privy Council as Hong Kong's high court. The deal violates \n     the Joint Declaration in a number of respects, including \n     restricting the number of foreign common law judges on the \n     bench. Such judges have contributed to Hong Kong's highly \n     regarded judiciary, and they will be crucial to the court's \n     ability to resist PRC interference.\n       The deal also injects the future Beijing-appointed chief \n     executive into the judicial selection process, another break \n     with tradition. Most important, the British capitulated to \n     Beijing on the court's jurisdiction. The court may not rule \n     on acts of state ``such as'' defense and foreign affairs. \n     These two words, to be interpreted by a party organ in \n     Beijing, could prevent the court from hearing virtually \n     anything Beijing chooses, including challenges to state \n     power.\n       Finally, British and the PRC agreed not to set up the court \n     until July 1, 1997, despite previous agreement to get it up \n     and running much earlier. British appointees and pro-China \n     members approved legislation establishing the court as \n     proposed on July 26.\n       So why is the Hong Kong government so worked up over the \n     award to Lee? Lee, one of several leading lights in Hong \n     Kong's democratic community, has been calling the court deal \n     what is a sellout. After building up a successful law \n     practice and chairing the Hong Kong Bar Association, he \n     entered politics in 1985, becoming the legal community's \n     first representative in Legco through the government's \n     byzantine ``functional constituencies'' system. These Legco \n     members are chosen by tiny franchises representing business \n     and professional groups such as real estate developers and \n     bankers.\n       In Hong Kong's first-ever democratic elections in 1991, Lee \n     won the most votes of any candidate, while pro-democracy \n     candidates overall took 17 of 18 democratically selected \n     seats. Lee, his Democratic Party and independent democrats \n     are expected to outpoll pro-China candidates for the 20 seats \n     open in elections this Sept. 17, the last elections before \n     the PRC takeover. (The increase in democratic seats from 18 \n     to 20 was the centerpiece of Patten's highly touted 1994 \n     reform package.) China has pledged to abolish Legco, and \n     recently announced that it will set up a parallel, appointed \n     legislature well before 1997.\n       Beijing already had its sights on Lee--having ejected him \n     from a committee to draft Hong Kong's so-called ``mini-\n     constitution'' for supporting the demonstrators at Tianamen \n     Square. Lee is a thorn in Governor Patten's side. And he will \n     be a thorn in China's side. Unless something changes, we can \n     all look forward to the time, a few years on, when Beijing in \n     turn denounces an organization for bestowing a human rights \n     award on Martin Lee.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/07/senate-section/article/S11798-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, AUGUST 8, 1995\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

All Members should expect a late night \nsession on Tuesday in order to make progress on both of those bills.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/07/senate-section/article/S11798-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S 11799]]\n\n\n                            ORDER FOR RECESS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I would like to take about 5 minutes or \nless to discuss an item that I will be bringing up on the defense \nauthorization bill. I have what you might consider a very minor \namendment but one that gets at the basic issues that I have been trying \nto present to my colleagues on mismanagement in the Department of \nDefense.\n  My amendment deals with the fleet of executive aircraft and the VIP \nhelicopters. Most of these airplanes are known as the operational \nsupport airlift aircraft.\n  I want my colleagues to know that this amendment comes from studying \npositions taken by people within the Defense Department or outside the \nCongress of the United States. So my amendment does not come from an \nidea that I dreamed up.\n  My position rests on sound ground because I think it is a studied \nposition made by a lot of people that we in this Congress ought to \nrespect. It is based on two very recent reports: a Department of \nDefense IG report dated June 1995; a GAO report also dated June 1995. \nBut that is not all. My thinking on this issue is based upon a mountain \nof Department of Defense studies. And these all point in one direction, \nthat we should cut the number of planes in this operational support \nairlift fleet.\n  I would just like to tell my colleagues where I am trying to go with \nthis amendment. During the upcoming debate that will happen later on \nthis week on the Defense authorization bill, I am going to talk about a \nlong string of Department of Defense reports and recommendations to cut \nthe OSA fleet.\n  In February 1993, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. \nColin Powell, recommended a reduction of this fleet of aircraft. In \nSeptember 1994, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General McPeak, \nrecommended a reduction in this fleet of aircraft. In May of 1995, the \nDepartment of Defense Commission on Roles and Missions recommended a \nreduction in the OSA fleet of aircraft.\n  The Department of Defense Commission on Roles and Missions was \nchaired by Mr. John P. White. Mr. White recommended reductions in the \nOSA fleet just before becoming Deputy Secretary of Defense.\n  Mr. President, this issue has been studied to death, not by Chuck \nGrassley's own research, but by my merely reading report \nrecommendations made by people within the Department of Defense by \npeople at the General Accounting Office, people that we ought to have \nsome respect for.\n  So how many studies does it take to cut a Pentagon program? The \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Chief of Staff of the Air \nForce, and now the Deputy Secretary of Defense have all recommended \ncuts in this fleet of VIP aircraft. I think that most Members of this \nbody would respect the judgment of people like Colin Powell, General \nMcPeak, and Deputy Secretary of Defense White. When they say that this \nought to be done, then it seems to me we ought to do it.\n  It kind of bothers me that these recommendations, once they are made, \njust do not happen. Why do we have to do it in the Congress? Why do I \nhave to bring it to the attention of my colleagues to make it happen? \nWhen I got done reading the May 1995 roles and missions report, I \ndecided to write a letter to Mr. White. My letter to Mr. White is dated \nJuly 12, 1995. I hoped Mr. White might be willing to help me develop a \nplan to downsize this fleet of aircraft. I want to know if he would be \nwilling to work with me in developing a plan to carry out his own \nrecommendations.\n  Mr. White's reply to my letter is dated July 31, 1995. I ask \nunanimous consent to print this correspondence in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 1995.\n     Hon. John P. White,\n     Deputy Secretary of Defense, Pentagon, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: I am writing to you about the need to \n     reduce the Department of Defense's (DOD) fleet of Operational \n     Support Airlift (OSA) aircraft.\n       The DOD Inspector General and General Accounting Office \n     (GAO) have just concluded independent reviews of how these \n     aircraft are used and how much these operations cost the \n     taxpayers. Copies of those reports are attached for your \n     consideration. Both clearly indicate that many of these \n     flights are wasteful and unnecessary.\n       The GAO found, for example, that the Andrews AFB, Maryland \n     to Wright-Patterson AFB near Dayton, Ohio is the heaviest \n     traveled OSA route. Both locations are readily served by \n     commercial airlines offering LOW government contract \n     airfares. Continental and United Airlines have 5 to 6 flights \n     each way between Washington and Dayton every workday. The \n     one-way airfare on Continental is $98.00. The cost to move \n     comparable numbers of passengers from Andrews to Wright-\n     Patterson on an OSA C-21 aircraft is at least 3 to 4 times \n     higher than on Continental Airliners--if all appropriate \n     expenses are included.\n       There is no way to justify the use of military aircraft for \n     routine travel between destinations like Washington, D.C. and \n     Dayton, Ohio. Unfortunately, the bulk of OSA flights are \n     between cities like Washington and Dayton--cities connected \n     by convenient and efficient commercial airline service. In \n     most cases, this service is provided by government contract \n     carriers at discount prices.\n       Mr. White, I bring this particular issue to your attention \n     for one simple reason. As the Chairman of the most recent \n     ``Commission on Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces,'' you \n     concluded that ``there are too many OSA aircraft . . . and \n     recommended changes to eliminate excess capacity and save \n     money.'' Your findings and recommendations--as presented in \n     the May 1995 report--are fully consistent with a long list of \n     similar DOD studies. All agree on one point: Inventories of \n     OSA aircraft exceed wartime requirements. Reductions are now \n     in order.\n       Well, Mr. Secretary, shortly after recommending cuts in the \n     OSA fleet, you became the Deputy Secretary of Defense. So \n     this is where ``the rubber meets the road.'' It's time to \n     make the cuts that you recommended. I have developed my own \n     plan for ``eliminating excess capacity and saving money.'' A \n     copy of my plan is attached for your review. It would reduce \n     the OSA fleet by 50 percent by the end of fiscal year 1997 \n     and would save about $550 million annually, according to the \n     Congressional Budget Office.\n       I would be the first to admit that it is very difficult for \n     Congress to successfully legislate a solution to a problem \n     like this--without the cooperation of the department \n     involved. I would much prefer to work with you in developing \n     a more acceptable solution. With that in mind, would you \n     please review my plan and make any suggestions you consider \n     appropriate. I would like to be in a position to offer a \n     proposal when the defense authorization and appropriations \n     bills are brought to the Senate floor for debate.\n       Your cooperation in this matter would be appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                  Deputy Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 31, 1995.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley, This is in response to your letter \n     of July 12, 1995, concerning your proposed amendment to the \n     Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 1996 to reduce the \n     Department of Defense's Operational Support Airlift (OSA) \n     aircraft fleet.\n       As a result of the Commission on Roles and Missions \n     recommendation, the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff is \n     conducting a study to validate the size of the OSA fleet \n     needed in wartime, based on supporting two major regional \n     conflicts (MRCs) which occur nearly simultaneously. During \n     this study, slated for completion this fall, the Joint Staff \n     will evaluate Service and Theater CINC-stated-requirements to \n     avoid unnecessary duplication or overlapping requirements. At \n     the same time, we are implementing a plan under which the \n     Transportation Command will closely monitor the peacetime \n     scheduling and patterns of use of these aircraft.\n       On the basis of these efforts, we will determine the most \n     effective and efficient organizational structure to schedule, \n     maintain, and operate the fixed-wing OSA fleet based upon a \n     combination of wartime effectiveness and peacetime \n     efficiency. Until I see the results of these analyses, it \n     would be premature for me to endorse a legislative approach.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    John P. White.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, quite frankly, Mr. White's letter to me \nis a disappointment. Mr. White says that the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff ``is conducting a study to validate the size of the OSA \nfleet in wartime.'' Now the committee has signed off on this approach. \nAnother study is \n\n[[Page S 11800]]\na delaying tactic. I think that is all it is, quite frankly.\n  I said a moment ago our OSA fleet has been studied to death. As \nchairman of the Department of Defense Commission on Roles and Missions, \nMr. White concluded that the fleet of airplanes was too big and that it \nshould be cut down to size. Well, this is where the rubber meets the \nroad. Mr. White is the top dog over in the Pentagon now. He occupies a \nvery top position. Mr. White is now in a position to give some \ndirection and guidance, and his recommendations in the roles and \nmissions report tells me that he already knows what that direction \nshould be.\n  So what is he waiting for? The time has come to stop studying the \nissue. More study is a waste of time and, most important, a waste of \nmoney. The Department of Defense, under Mr. White's direction, should \ndevelop a plan to downsize this fleet of aircraft. How many of these \nairplanes are really needed? How should the fleet be managed? How \nshould the Department dispose of the unneeded airplanes? Those are the \nquestions that must be addressed.\n  I do not see my amendment as the magic solution, by the way. My \namendment was merely a starting point. I am not convinced that my \nproposed number, whatever I might pick, whether it be 20 percent, 30 \npercent, 40 percent, or 50 percent, might be the right number. But I do \nnot think we can settle for ignoring the recommendations of Colin \nPowell, the recommendations of General McPeak, the recommendations of \nthe roles and missions report under Mr. White's directive. I do not \nbelieve we can ignore the General Accounting Office that there are more \nairplanes than are needed. Only 9 percent of these planes were used in \nthe Persian Gulf war. It is time to downsize the fleet. I think that we \nought to take a first step this year during the debate on the defense \nauthorization bill to make a downpayment on the recommendations that \nhave been made by Colin Powell, General McPeak, and by Mr. John White. \nI want to see us start down the road in that direction, the direction \nproposed by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, White, and I want that \nfirst step to be meaningful and to be significant.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/07/senate-section/article/S11799-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11800-S11802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FAMILY SELF-SUFFICIENCY ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, few debates have had greater importance \nthan the one we have begun this week. A number of us have been working \nnow for many months in preparation for this debate. I want to thank \nMembers on both sides of the aisle for the work that has been done thus \nfar, and let me in particular commend the ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Moynihan, for his leadership and the continued \neffort he has made to bring us to this point.\n  I also feel the need to, again, reiterate my gratitude to Senators \nBreaux and Mikulski for the leadership they have given our caucus on \nthe issue of welfare reform; Senators Dodd and Kennedy for all of the \nhelp they have given us with regard to the need to consider children as \nwe deal with this issue; and Senators Moseley-Braun and Conrad on the \nFinance Committee for their efforts.\n  Let me also cite the tremendous cooperation and support that we have \nbeen given from the administration, Democratic Governors, and local \nofficials. For many months now, all of them, and many more within our \ncaucus, have come forth to give us their best ideas and to produce what \nwe hope will be one of the best work products that we have had since \nthis Congress has begun.\n  Mr. President, the result of that effort has been a remarkable degree \nof unity within our caucus about the need for welfare reform and about \nthe way we bring it about. We support a new concept which we call Work \nFirst, a concept which incorporates many very critical principles that \nwe as Democrats feel strongly about, that we as Democrats can unite on \nand reach out to our Republican colleagues and hope that, working \ntogether, we can achieve meaningful welfare reform on a bipartisan \nbasis this year.\n  First and foremost, as we consider those principles, Mr. President, \nour belief is that the emphasis needs to be put on work; that we end \nwelfare as we know it; that we abolish the old infrastructure; that we \ncreate the incentives and the opportunities that must be created if, \nindeed, we are going to put work first.\n  So we begin by requiring that all able-bodied people go to work, get \njobs, obtain the skills, do what is necessary to ensure that they break \ntheir dependency on welfare.\n We recognize that in order to do that, we have to provide tools that \ndo not exist today. So as we abolish the AFDC Program and the old JOBS \nProgram, we recognize that new tools must be put in place if indeed we \nare going to give people opportunities and the real hope that they can \nbreak that cycle of dependency, that they can go out with confidence \nand get the jobs that they need to get.\n\n  We also recognize that even though it may not be a part of welfare \nreform, it is very difficult to tell anybody today that they are to go \nout and get a minimum-wage job, work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, \nand still be below the national poverty level. That is unacceptable.\n  If we are going to make work pay, we have to provide not only the \neconomic incentives, but the opportunities and the confidence necessary \nso that indeed we can break the cycle of poverty, as well as the cycle \nof dependency. Breaking the cycle of poverty, hopefully this year, will \nmean an increase in the minimum wage, to ensure that men and women can \nwork 40 hours or more a week and not be condemned to poverty in spite \nof their best efforts.\n  The second principle, Mr. President, is a recognition that there are \nimpediments to ending welfare as we know it and to getting those jobs \nthat exist today. We must address those impediments if indeed we are \ngoing to get the job done. Our belief is that the two most critical \nimpediments are the fear of losing their health insurance and the lack \nof adequate child care.\n  First, they fear that once they get a job, especially if it is a \nminimum-wage job, they will lose their health insurance, they will have \nno protection for themselves or their children, because Medicaid will \nno longer be provided.\n  They also know that they have a Hobson's choice of getting a job or \nstaying on welfare and taking care of their children. They do not want \nto be in a position of saying, I want to get that job, I want to go out \ninto the private sector and obtain a good, meaningful, good-paying \njob--but I do not want to leave my children at home unattended. What am \nI going to do with my kids? How many families would be willing to leave \ntheir young children at home while they went out to get a minimum-wage \njob, which is, in part, what we are asking people to do today. That, \ntoo, is unacceptable. We cannot ask a young parent to do that. We have \nto find a way to ensure that their legitimate concerns are addressed in \nterms of health care, as well as in terms of child care.\n  So what we do in our Work First plan is extend Medicaid for another \nyear to give people the opportunity to create the financial means to \nbuy their health insurance. We do the same thing with child care. We \ntell them, look, we are going to care for your children, we are going \nto find a way, working with the States, to create the infrastructure \nnecessary to see that your children are cared for. We are not going to \neffectively force you to leave them at home. We are not going to make \nyou leave them unattended. We recognize how many problems are created \nat home when there is no adult supervision. That is the second \nprinciple--recognizing the impediments to work today and dealing with \nthem.\n  The third principle is to ensure the safety net for children \ncontinues. Children should not be required to pay for the problems \ncreated by their parents. If we are going to break the cycle of \ndependency, it ought to be the goal of every Senator to strengthen the \nchild, to give them the care, the direction, the nutrition, the \nprotection that they need so that they never find themselves on welfare \nin the first place. Creating that mechanism of ensuring that children \nare protected has to be a fundamental principle of welfare reform, \nregardless of what else we do with their parents looking for work.\n  A fourth principle is to recognize today that we actually penalize \nhusbands for staying at home and staying \n\n[[Page S 11801]]\nmarried. We actually penalize them for living at home and playing the \nrole of father. Today, if a welfare recipient is married, that person \nis ineligible for the full benefits created through the welfare system. \nThat is wrong. So we eliminate the penalty for married welfare \nrecipients. We say we want to encourage families to stay together. We \nwant the mother and father in that house together. We want to do \neverything we can to preserve the family unit.\n  We require tough child enforcement mechanisms and expand job \nplacement and training for absent fathers. We have had the opportunity \nto consult with scores of people from around the country, and the word \nwe get time and time again from virtually every expert is that if \nindeed you really want to stop welfare dependency, if you want to break \nout of the problems we have today, you have to find ways to keep the \nfamily together. We want to do that. We do that by eliminating the \npenalty for married welfare recipients, strengthening child support \nenforcement, encouraging absent fathers to stay home and to get the job \nskills they need, without penalizing them.\n  Fifth, Mr. President, we recognize, as so many people have alluded to \ntoday, that if we are going to do this, we recognize the big \ndifferences between and among States. Ohio and South Dakota are \ndramatically different in many respects. South Dakota's largest city is \nabout 125,000 people. We have only 10 communities with more than a \nthousand people, and 300 communities with fewer than a hundred people. \nWe recognize that welfare in South Dakota is vastly different from \nwelfare in other parts of the country. So we must give States the \nflexibility and the opportunities to create new mechanisms that adapt \nto the problems, needs, and concerns of people within each State. We \nrecognize that the current system is too constrained, is too \nprescriptive, is too dictatorial in coming up with ways to allow States \nthe opportunity and the freedom and flexibility to do what they know, \nin many cases, has to be done to combat the problems in the welfare \nsystem.\n  Next, we want to combat teen pregnancy. Here, too, there is no \nsecret, magical, one-size-fits-all solution. We realize, as Senator \nMoynihan and others have spoken about many times, we have no way of \nknowing for sure what we can do to break the cycle of illegitimacy, to \nensure that teen parents will not continue in the practices and the \ndirection they often take at an early age. We want to stop children \nfrom having children. We want to create whatever mechanisms are \nnecessary to ensure that children are children first and parents \nsecond. To do that, we require that teen mothers, if unfortunately they \nbecome pregnant, stay in school and stay at home; and that, in those \ncases where home is not the appropriate place, they be given second-\nchance home opportunities, living in an environment that is loving, \ncaring, protective, and reassuring. Second-chance homes can do that.\n  We believe very strongly that whether it is at home or whether it is \nin a new home, teen mothers cannot be put by themselves, cannot be \nforced to take all of the responsibilities that comes with rearing a \nchild, with little or no resources, and expected to rear that child \nproperly. That does not work.\n  So once a child has a child, and that child has a child, and that \ncycle goes on and on, it is no wonder we have the incredible \ndelinquency problems and the problems with childhood abuse and the many \nserious problems that come with it.\n  Finally, we recognize that there are many loopholes in the Food Stamp \nand SSI Programs that we believe have to be addressed. We clamp down on \nwaste and abuse and recognize there are ways not only to save money but \nto administer these programs much more effectively. So we believe that, \nthrough all of these principles, we can enact a substantial degree of \nreform and bring about a change in welfare to the degree that it has \nnever been brought about before. We are optimistic that in working with \nthese principles, we can do a great deal to change the direction of \nwelfare as we know it in this country.\n  I believe that, in many cases, the Work First plan stands in contrast \nto the bill offered by many of our Republican colleagues. The latest \nversion of the Republican bill is a significant improvement over the \nFinance Committee draft that passed a couple of months ago. But I would \ncite among the many differences between Work First and the current \nRepublican plan four fundamental differences that I think have to be \naddressed.\n  The first has to do with work. We both recognize that work has to be \na priority. We both recognize that we have to put new emphasis and a \nnew direction to the opportunities there are for work. The big \ndifference, of course, comes in resources. Both of us have a \nrequirement that, by the year 2000, 50 percent of those people on \nwelfare will be required to work. Fifty percent.\n  I am told today that about 10 percent of those people on welfare \nultimately get jobs. So we are asking for a 5-fold increase in our \nsuccess rate in the next 5 years. A 5-fold increase, from 10 percent to \n50 percent. I am not talking about ``participation.'' I am talking \nabout actual work.\n  Today we judge our success largely by participation. That is, if you \ncome into the office and you demonstrate you are looking for a job, you \ncan qualify for all the welfare benefits that may be provided.\n  We say participation is not good enough anymore. Now what we want to \ndo is say you really have to have a job before we consider this case \nclosed. You have to be out there working prior to the time we are \nwilling to call this particular case a success.\n  The problem is that, to obtain that 5-fold increase in the next 5 \nyears, I believe we will need resources to do it. It is not just going \nto happen. We are talking about providing skills. We are talking about \neducation. We are talking about a new infrastructure which will make \nwelfare offices employment offices.\n  If we are going to do that, the States and the Federal Government \nmust work in partnership to ensure that we can accomplish all that we \nknow we can accomplish in a very short period of time. A five-fold \nincrease in real jobs is a major responsibility.\n  The difference between the Democratic bill and the Republican bill is \nthat over the next 5 years, the Republican bill will cut $70 billion in \nthe assistance to be provided to the States to do just that.\n  What we are telling the States through the Republican bill is that we \nwant you to get the job done, but we will cut $70 billion in resources \nbefore you are given the chance to do it.\n  Mr. President, I do not see how that is possible. If, over the course \nof this debate, we can figure out how we can ask the States to \naccomplish five times what they are doing today with $70 billion less \nin resources, that explanation, I think, is one the Governors will want \nto hear for themselves.\n  The second major difference between the Republican plan as it has \nbeen presented and the democratic Work First plan is our emphasis on \nchildren. There are about 14 million welfare recipients today. Mr. \nPresident, 9 million of the 14 million are children. We believe if \nthose children are going to be cared for, if those children are going \nto get out of this incredible dependence they find themselves in as a \nresult of being born into welfare families, then indeed we have to \nensure that they are nourished, they are given the education, they are \ngiven the loving care they need and deserve. If they are given all \nthose things we had when we were growing up--we had the encouragement, \nwe had the nutrition, we had the education, we had the loving care--\nthen maybe they will have a fighting chance. The reality is that these \nchildren are too often born into situations where none of that exists.\n  Mr. President, I think it is very critical if we want to ensure that \nthose children have a chance, then it seems critical to me that we \ncreate and ensure that the safety net continues for those children, so \nthey never have to face what their parents are facing.\n  Second, as I said a moment ago, it is so important that if we are \nhonest and serious about telling mothers they have to get a job--\ntelling young mothers and fathers, for that matter--it is not going to \nbe enough to be dependent upon welfare in perpetuity, if that is going \nto happen, we have to realize that 60 percent of all AFDC families have \nat least one child under the age of 6. Mr. President, 60 percent of all \nAFDC families today have one child at least under the age of 6.\n  In a recent study, these families said that the biggest reason they \ncannot go out and get a job is because there is no one there to take \ncare of that child. We do not want a bill that says we are going to \nhave to leave them at home if indeed you want benefits at all. This \nought not be what we call the home-alone bill. We do not want to see \nchildren left without protection and care.\n  The big difference here is how do we handle child care? In addition \nto the safety net, not punishing children, how do we ensure that those \nchildren are taken care of when the parents leave in the morning to go \nto work? No one can tell me that we will ever solve this problem if we \ndo not resolve that one. Child care and welfare reform are inextricably \nlinked. We cannot have one without the other. People need to understand \nthat. It is too much to ignore. We must have some realization of the \n\n[[Page S 11802]]\nessential connection between child care and welfare reform.\n  The third big difference, Mr. President, has to do with funding. I \nmentioned earlier that there is a $70 billion reduction in the \navailability of funds. The Republican bill freezes funding at 1994 \nlevels for the next 7 years. We are told that is a $70 billion \nreduction. That is just the beginning. It is not just the amount of \nmoney but how that money is provided.\n  There is no needs determination in the Republican bill. That is, \nthere is no system by which the more severe the situation, the greater \nthe resources. It is all done on a formula. That formula is really \nbased on a first-come-first-served theory.\n  A block grant is sent out based upon this formula. Whether or not it \nis enough, the money is there so long as it is available. If there are \nmore people than there are funds, it will be up to the States to decide \nwho gets it. There is no match requirement. States are not required in \nany way, shape or form to come up with a reciprocal amount of money--\nsome supplemental amount, some pool of resources--that would enable \nthem to benefit from the resources provided at the Federal level.\n  No needs determination, no match whatever. A formula that is \ndetermined in Washington, not based on severity, not based on the \nnumber of people on welfare, not based on the degree to which there are \nimaginative approaches being employed.\n  Mr. President, there is a very significant difference in the approach \nused by the Republican plan and the approach incorporated in the Work \nFirst plan.\n  Our view is that need ought to determine availability; that in some \ncases there is a greater need, regardless of population, for a lot of \ndifferent reasons. We ought to take that into account prior to the time \nwe arbitrarily make some formula decision that may or may not help some \nStates.\n  Finally, there is also a big difference with regard to the \navailability of assistance for teenage pregnancy. The Republican bill \nmakes assistance to be provided for curtailing teenage pregnancy simply \nan option to the States. They can do it or not. Regardless of their \nchoice, there is no funding available to the States to do whatever it \nis they may do. Whatever they do, they are on their own. One can guess \nwhat choice most States will make under such circumstances.\n  There is encouragement to use second-chance homes. There is \nencouragement to require that teenagers be required to stay in school \nor at home, but there is no funding. No availability of additional \nresources to see that might be something we should look at.\n  Mr. President, at least on those four principles, we have some \nfundamental philosophical differences that I think have to be addressed \nif, indeed, we are going to succeed in breaching the differences in \narriving at a bipartisan bill some time this Congress.\n  Let me make two final points with regard to welfare reform. First of \nall, as we can see from the debate already today, and for that matter \nlast Saturday, this ought to be a lively debate, a spirited debate, a \ndebate in which very good points are raised--likely on both sides. I \nsincerely hope that Members of the Republican caucus will look at the \nWork First bill. I have every expectation they will consider even \nvoting for it, at some point, given the significant new concepts \nincorporated in it.\n  I hope we can have a good debate but I hope we do not arbitrarily \ndecide this thing can be resolved--this whole debate can be resolved--\nin a matter of a couple of days. I do not think it can be. This is one \nof the most consequential debates we will be taking up this year. It \nhas broad ramifications. And if we do it right we may not have to visit \nthis issue again for a long time to come, at least as it relates to our \ninfrastructure. So I do not think we ought to be rushed into final \npassage. I do not think our success ought to be judged by how few days \nwe actually take to resolve these differences and debate these points \nand come up with the best piece of legislation. So I sincerely hope we \ncan have a good debate and not arbitrarily come to any conclusion as to \nhow long a good debate may take.\n  Finally, let me say I hope it can be a bipartisan effort. I do not \nsee it as necessarily a Democratic or a Republican issue, but it is \ngoing to be hard to be bipartisan if Republicans engage, once again as \nthey did earlier this year, in negative political attacks when the \ndebate has barely begun. It is wrong and deeply disappointing that \nRepublicans would attack five Democratic Senators who have participated \nin the debate, who have made significant contributions to this effort, \nwho may differ in some cases with Republicans on how we resolve these \noutstanding issues--but in good faith participate in the debate--and \nthen be attacked politically simply because they may disagree. I would \nadd that they have been attacked erroneously. Some of the attacks now \nbeing leveled against five of my colleagues in the Democratic caucus \nare wrong. They are outright fabrications. I hope the media take the \ntime to look into the claims and then check the facts, because if they \ndo they will find that not only are these attacks wrong and \nshortsighted, but they simply do not represent the facts or the voting \nrecords of those who have been the subject of these unfortunate attacks \nin the last couple of days.\n  We can do this either way. I recall vividly some of the criticism \nRepublicans had last year, for the partisan nature of some of the \ndebate on health care. I recall how unfair they thought it was when \nsome of the debate was politicized. On the other side, there was great \nconcern about the Harry and Louise ads. We heard a lot about targeted \nads in States and districts around the country. Both sides raised a lot \nof questions about whether or not that was the right way to debate an \nissue as important as health care was.\n  It was wrong then and it is wrong now. It is wrong now to politicize \nthis debate at the very beginning of what I hope will be an opportunity \nfor us to deal with this issue in a productive, meaningful way, coming \nto some resolution sometime this session of Congress to one of the most \nimportant and challenging issues of our day--welfare reform. I believe \nwe can do it. I believe we can work together and, in spite of some of \nour deep differences philosophically, overcome those differences and \ncome up with a plan that works a lot better than the one we have today.\n  That is not going to happen if we contaminate the debate with sharp \npolitical attacks against Members on either side. So I hope cooler \nheads will prevail, and I hope those responsible for those ads will \nhave second thoughts and the good common sense to pull them before it \nis too late.\n  Mr. President, noting no other interest in debate, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/07/senate-section/article/S11800-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECESS UNTIL 9 A.M.
