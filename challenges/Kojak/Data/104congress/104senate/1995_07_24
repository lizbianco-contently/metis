Mr. President, for several days in the last few weeks, we \nhave attempted, as a bipartisan group, to develop an agreement, which \nwe have been able to come close to on lobbying reform, but not very \nclose on the so-called gift ban.\n  One of the insistences we had from the other side was that we start \nat 9 o'clock this morning--that we start at 9 o'clock this morning. \nHere we are at 9:35, and we see no one here, and they are refusing to \ncome, do not want Members to lay anything down, do not want Members to \ntalk, unless we do it in morning business.\n  Now, Mr. President, it seems, if you are going to insist on \nsomething, you ought to be part of the agreement. We find that this is \nhappening too much of the time. I do not like to be here at 9 o'clock \non Monday morning any more than anyone else. We are here. We are \nprepared. We are ready. So, where is the other side?\n  Mr. President, I think it behooves all Members, if we are going to \nstart, if we want to start, we ought to do it at the time we agreed \nupon. I have already had my cup of coffee, as I am sure the Presiding \nOfficer has. He did his swims this morning, his pushups, and he is here \nready to go, but we are sitting here.\n  My statement has brought both doors open on the other side. That \ndelights this Senator very much. So, after 35 minutes of pleading that \nwe want someone here to start debate, which was insisted upon, I hope \nthat we can start and not force this side to come when the other side \ndoes not appear.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to start the debate in a \npositive \n\n[[Page S10512]]\nway. There have been a lot of conversations going back and forth by \nboth Senators on both sides of the aisle, Senators interested in \nlobbying reform legislation and gift rule changes. I think we have made \nprogress. I felt like everything was going in a positive way.\n  We did come in right at 9 o'clock. Ordinarily, there is at least a \nSenator or two waiting, ready to make some comment in morning business. \nThis morning we did not have them. We have one key Senator who is going \nto need to be involved in this discussion, Senator McConnell, who is on \nhis way, I believe, from the airport. So I think it is important that \nwe begin with an open and positive debate and that we not start making \naccusations.\n  I know that the Senator from Kentucky has been working very hard. He \nis here ready to go. I am ready to go. I suggest, Mr. President, that \nwe go ahead and begin the debate, sort of set out the basic parameters \nof where we are and move forward. We may have some amendments that will \nneed to be offered. Some will be agreed to, I am sure, on lobbying \nreform. Our hope is that we can have genuine reform.\n  Personally, this Senator feels we need to tighten up the rules with \nregard to lobbying disclosure. I have always said we should err on the \nside of disclosure. Now, what is included in that disclosure is very \nimportant. It is not just technical language.\n  We need to make sure that it does not chill the ability of individual \ncitizens at the grassroots level to talk with their Senators or their \nCongressmen. It is applicable to both bodies. I think that the concerns \nthat we had in that area last year have been addressed, and everybody \nfeels now grassroots lobbying by individual citizens, certainly, would \nbe allowed under this legislation.\n  We need also to make sure it does not just become a paperwork \nnightmare. We need reasonable, logical reporting. I think we are moving \nin that direction.\n  Mr. President, I suggest we go ahead and begin with opening \nstatements. I am sure that the Senator from Michigan would like to make \nan opening statement. We will take it from there.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/24/senate-section/article/S10511-4", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10512-S10531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LOBBYING DISCLOSURE ACT OF 1995\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1060) to provide for the disclosure of lobbying \n     activities to influence the Federal Government, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, before I proceed, let me ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator McCain be added as a cosponsor. I see he was \ninadvertently left off of S. 1060 and S. 1061. I ask he be added to \nboth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me say to the Senator from Mississippi, I, like him, \nhope that we can reach an agreement relative to lobby disclosure, \nparticularly as there has been some progress made on lobbying \ndisclosure. In conversations over the last few days, we have a way to \ngo, but on this subject we have made some progress. That progress, I \nhope, will continue today so we can come up with a strong lobby \ndisclosure bill.\n  This Senate approved overwhelmingly a lobby disclosure bill last \nyear. It was an overwhelming vote. When the bill came back from \nconference, there were a few changes in it. Those changes were utilized \nby some Members of this body as the basis of opposition to the entire \nbill. There was dispute over the meaning of those changes. Some people \nsaid that those changes would chill grassroots lobbying and the \nopportunity for individual citizens to lobby their Members. There was \nno such intent, and we believe no such language.\n  That is last year's debate. In any event, this year's bill does not \ncontain the language which was pointed to. That, by the way, was \nlanguage which was added by the House of Representatives and in \nconference. As I remember, there was no objection to that language. \nThat became sort of the lightning rod here.\n  Again, that language is not included in this version, just the way it \nwas not in the version that last passed the Senate with, I think, over \n90 votes in the last Congress. So, we are going to renew our effort \nhere today to address one of the most intractable issues that has been \nfaced by the Congress over the last 50 years, and that is to try to \nreform the loophole-plagued lobbying disclosure law.\n  The lobbying disclosure act was passed in 1946. It was called the \nLobbying Regulation Act at that time. Within a few years, President \nTruman pointed out to the Congress that there were already so many \nloopholes in that bill, that Lobbying Regulation Act, that it, for all \nintents and purposes, needed reform by 1948. So the principal bill that \ngoverns the regulation of lobbyists, passed in 1946, was already, \nwithin 2 years, pretty useless, confusing, and in need of reform.\n  President Truman asked the Congress to do exactly that. They did not \npay heed. If they had paid heed we would not be here today. That is \nalmost 50 years ago that the President of the United States told the \npublic and the Congress that the act they had passed to require the \nregistration of paid, professional lobbyists, was not doing its job.\n  The purpose of that bill was to try to get folks who were paid to \nlobby Congress to disclose who is paying them, how much they are being \npaid, and to lobby Congress on what issue. That was the purpose of the \nact that was passed almost 50 years ago.\n  Then again, in the 1950's, there was an effort made to reform the \nLobbying Registration Act. Senator McClellan spearheaded an effort to \nreform the lobbying registration laws because, again, by then there \nwere so many holes in it there were more holes than there were cheese; \nthere were more loopholes than there was law. But Congress did not heed \nSenator McClellan's call in the 1950's. If they had, we probably would \nnot be here today.\n  In the 1960's, lobbying reform was taken up by the Senate, passed, \nbut was not passed by the House of Representatives. If it had, maybe we \nwould not be here today.\n  In 1976, lobbying reform was passed by both Houses of Congress but in \ndifferent versions. They were not reconciled in conference. If Congress \nhad acted in 1976, and they got close, we would not have to be here \ntoday.\n  Decade after decade, there has been an effort to close the loopholes \nin lobbying registration, to make sense of these laws, and they have \nfailed.\n  In 1978, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee was so divided \nover lobbying registration that it could not even report out a bill. \nLast year we came close, we came within a hair of passing both lobbying \nregistration reform and a gift ban, but it got caught up in the last \nfew days of the Congress, the bill was filibustered here and, as a \nresult, was not passed.\n  A lot of different issues defeated lobbying reform over the last 4 \ndecades. Sometimes it was the definition of lobbying. Sometimes it was \nwhether or not the executive branch should be covered. Sometimes it was \nthe threshold for coverage. Sometimes it was a question of disclosure \nof expenditures to stimulate grassroots lobbying or the disclosure of \ncontributors to lobbying organizations. Decade after decade, reasons \nwere given for why we could not reach agreement on lobbying reform and \ndecade after decade it has been frustrated.\n  So it has been a long and a sad history, in terms of trying to reform \nlaws whose purpose it is to put a little sunshine into the area of paid \nlobbyists. Senator Cohen and I sought to address these issues when we \nintroduced S. 2276, in the 102d Congress. We reintroduced basically the \nsame measure in the 103d Congress, and we got that bill through the \nSenate. That was S. 349. But then it fell a few votes short, as I said, \nwhen it came to the floor.\n  We are trying to address these issues again in S. 101, now in S. \n1060, which has a few additional modifications, and I believe there \nwill be some further modifications on the Senate floor today.\n  The right to petition government is a constitutionally protected \nright. Lobbying is as much a part of our governmental process today as \non-the-record \n\n[[Page S10513]]\nrulemakings for public hearings. Lobbying is part of democratic \ngovernment, an inherent part of it, a constitutionally protected part \nof constitutional and democratic government. But the public has a right \nto know, and the public should know, who is being paid to lobby, how \nmuch they are being paid, on what issue.\n  If we want the public to have confidence in our actions, this \nbusiness has to be conducted more in the sunshine. Lobbying disclosure \nwill enhance public confidence in government by ensuring that the \npublic is aware of the efforts that are made by paid lobbyists to \ninfluence public policy. In some cases, such disclosure, perhaps, will \nencourage lobbyists and their clients to be sensitive to even the \nappearance of improper influence. In other cases, it is likely to alert \nother interested parties of the need to provide their own views in \ndecisionmaking.\n  The lobbying disclosure laws that are on the books today are useless. \nIn the 102d Congress, the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government \nManagement, which I then chaired--Senator Cohen was then the ranking \nmember of it; and our roles have been reversed now--our subcommittee \nheld a series of hearings on the lobbying disclosure laws. We learned \nthat these laws are plagued by massive loopholes, confusing provisions, \nand an almost total absence of guidance on how to comply with them. For \nexample, the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act, the basic lobbying \nregistration law now on the books, to which I referred, the law that \nwas passed in 1946, covers only lobbying of the Congress on matters of \nlegislation, not lobbying of the executive branch. And that law has \nbeen interpreted to cover only those who spend the majority of their \ntime in personal meetings with Members of Congress.\n  As you can see from that loophole, that is not going to cover many \npeople right off the bat. The way it has been interpreted, this basic \nlaw, is that in order to be covered, you have to spend a majority of \nyour time actually in personal meetings with Members. There are not too \nmany people who spend the majority of their time in personal meetings \nwith Members of Congress, probably including our own secretaries. So, \nif you spend time with staff under this interpretation, with staff of \nthe Members of Congress--and that is where, most of the time, lobbyists \nspend their efforts--that does not even count under that interpretation \nof the lobbying registration.\n  There are many other loopholes that have been discovered in that \nbasic act. As a result of these loopholes, the General Accounting \nOffice found that fewer than 4,000 of the 13,500 individuals who are \nlisted in the book ``Washington Representatives'' were registered under \nthe act.\n That is less than a third.\n\n  Despite the fact that three-quarters of the unregistered \nrepresentatives interviewed by the General Accounting Office said that \nthey contact Members of Congress and their staffs, that they deal with \nFederal legislation, and that they seek to influence actions of the \nCongress and the executive branch, the failure of these individuals, \nthe organizations to register, does not mean that they are violating \nthe law as it stands, because as it stands, again, there are more \nloopholes in this law than there is law.\n  The definition of lobbying is so narrow that few professional \nlobbyists are actually required to register under the laws that have \nbeen strictly interpreted. Moreover, most lobbyists who do register do \nnot disclose anything to anybody which is of much use. The minority of \nlobbyists who do register tell us that they have incurred such expenses \nas a $45 phone bill or a $10 taxicab fare or $16 in messenger fees. \nOthers who decide to register provide lists of prorated expenditures \nfor salaries, rent, and other expenses. There is no public purpose that \nis served by most of the disclosures that we currently get, but just \nfrom a minority of people who actually register and from a minority of \npeople who lobby who take the time to register.\n  At the same time, we are getting a lot of useless information from \nthe relatively few that do register. We are not getting the most basic \ntype of information that was intended by the statute, which is the \ntotal amount that is being spent on lobbying and for what purpose.\n  The lobbyists are supposed to disclose their purpose. Many just \nsimply state--those again who do register--that they lobby on ``issues \nthat affect business operations of the client\" or ``general legislative \nmatters,'' or ``all legislation affecting the industry that they \nrepresent.''\n  That language is so general that it does not reveal anything. Worse \nstill, only a small amount of the money that is spent on lobbying \nactually gets disclosed. For instance, in 1989, the Legal Times \nestimated the gross lobbying revenue of 10 of the biggest and best \nknown Washington lobbying firms, and they estimated that revenue to be \n$60 million. However, a review of the lobbying reports that were filed \nby those 10 firms revealed that they reported combined lobbying \nreceipts from all clients of less than $2 million.\n  By the way, they also reflect total expenditures of $35,000. Just to \nshow you how distorted, how absurd, how useless these documents are \nwhere we do have people who register, we have three figures to keep in \nmind in that survey. This is a 1989 survey of the Legal Times estimate \nof the revenue of the 10 top firms of $60 million. When you look at \ntheir disclosure forms, they disclose revenue of $2 million and \nexpenditures of $35,000.\n  So what is disclosed is perhaps 3 to 4 percent of the revenue coming \nin in terms of revenue, and what is disclosed in terms of expenditure \nis a fraction of a percent of the money which is being received.\n  Another study was made. This time, six top defense contractors \nreported to the Department of Defense that they spent a combined total \nof almost $8 million lobbying Congress in 1989. By comparison, when you \nlook at the report filed by the six for the same six companies under \nthe Lobbying Regulation Act, there was a total of less than $400,000 in \nlobbying income.\n  So the contractors reported $8 million in lobbying expenses but their \nlobbyists disclosed a total of $388,000 in terms of their revenue. That \nis a total disconnect between what contractors report to the Department \nof Defense that they are spending on lobbying and what their lobbyists \ndisclose in terms of their receipts from those same six contractors.\n  Our existing lobbying laws have been characterized by the Department \nof Justice as ``inadequate'' and ``unenforceable,'' in effect. Those \nare their words, and that is charitable. The lobbying laws are a joke, \nand they are a bad joke, and they are a bad joke for everybody who is \ninvolved--first and foremost for the public, but they are also a bad \njoke for the lobbying community themselves.\n  The current laws breed disrespect for the law because they are so \nwidely ignored. They have been a sham and a shambles since they were \nfirst enacted 50 years ago. At this time the American public is so \nskeptical that their Government really belongs to them. Our lobbying \nregistration laws leave more lobbyists unregistered than registered.\n  Our subcommittee studied this subject in some detail. In 1993, we \nfiled a report that I want to quote from because it contains in some \ndetail the problems with lobbying disclosure laws and will give us a \nnecessary understanding of what the problem is.\n  There are four major lobbying disclosure statutes currently in \neffect. Here I am quoting from the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1993, the \nReport of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, that was filed on \nApril 1, 1993.\n  There are four major lobbying disclosure laws currently in effect:\n\n       The Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act, the Foreign Agents \n     Registration Act.\n\n  That is called FARA.\n\n       And two provisions included in the HUD Reform Act \n     applicable to the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development, and the Farmers Home Administration, and section \n     1352 of Title 31 of the so-called FARA amendment. At least \n     two other statutes that require registration of lobbyists are \n     included in the Public Utility Holding Company Act and the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Act.\n\n  Each of these statutes, the four basic statutes, imposes a different \nset of disclosure requirements on a specific or on a specified group of \nlobbyists. Because the coverage overlaps--some lobbyists may have to \nregister under two or even three different statutes because each of the \nstatutes excludes major segments of the lobbying community \n\n[[Page S10514]]\nfrom coverage--many professional lobbyists do not register at all. As \nPresident Clinton stated in his book ``Putting People First,'' we need \nlegislation to ``toughen and streamline lobbying disclosure.''\n  First, the Lobbying Regulation Act--and I am continuing to quote from \na portion of this report because it, again, identifies what the \nspecific problems are with the current laws and will set the framework, \nI think, for our debate today.\n\n       The Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act enacted in 1946 \n     requires registration by any person who is engaged for pay \n     for the ``principal purpose'' of attempting to influence the \n     passage or defeat of legislation in the Congress. A covered \n     lobbyist is required to disclose his or her name and address, \n     the name and address of the person by whom he or she is \n     employed, and in whose interest he or she works, how much he \n     or she is paid and by whom, who all of his or her \n     contributors are, and how much they have given, an account of \n     all money received and expended, to whom paid and for what \n     purposes, the names of any publications in which he or she \n     caused articles or editorials to be published, and the \n     particular legislation that he or she has been hired to \n     support or oppose,\n      lobby registration forms are required to be filed with the \n     clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate prior \n     to engaging in lobbying and updated in the first 10 days \n     of each calendar quarter so long as lobbying activity \n     continues. Violation of the act is a misdemeanor, \n     punishable by a fine of up to $5,000 or a sentence of up \n     to 12 months. Any person convicted of this offense is \n     prohibited from lobbying for 3 years.\n\n  The report continues, and again we are talking about the current law:\n\n       A 1986 Governmental Affairs Committee report on lobbying \n     disclosure indicates that the lobbying act was a hastily \n     considered law which was subject to no hearing, little \n     committee consideration, and almost no floor debate.\n\n  And that 1986 Governmental Affairs Committee, quoted in this report, \nsaid the following:\n\n       As the staff director of the joint committee later \n     conceded, the lobbying act was less than precisely drafted \n     legislation. Questions arose immediately about who was \n     covered under its definitional standards, the extent of its \n     reporting requirements and liability under its criminal \n     enforcement provision. Rather than settling the issue of \n     lobbyist influence, the act served only to make things more \n     confusing. Witnesses testified that the act was in many \n     respects an unsatisfactory law; that its effectiveness was \n     limited and that the provisions are in urgent need of \n     strengthening and revision if the objectives of the framers \n     are to be fully realized. Over the last 40 years, there have \n     been numerous unsuccessful attempts to address problems in \n     the lobbying act.\n\n  Now, the committee report first looks at the question of coverage of \nthe act, and I continue to quote from this report:\n\n       The Lobbying Regulation Act covers any person who is \n     engaged for pay for the principal purpose of attempting to \n     influence the passage or defeat of legislation in the \n     Congress. In United States v. Harris, in 1954, the Supreme \n     Court ruled that a narrow construction of the act was \n     required to avoid unconstitutional vagueness. There are \n     several gaps in the coverage of the lobbying act as construed \n     in the Harris case.\n       These include the following:\n       1. The act applies only to lobbying of legislative branch \n     officials, not to lobbying of executive branch officials.\n       2. It covers only efforts to influence the passage or \n     defeat of legislation in Congress, not other activities with \n     members and staff.\n       3. It has been interpreted by many to cover only efforts to \n     lobby Members of Congress directly, not efforts to lobby \n     congressional staff.\n       4. It covers only persons whose principal purpose is \n     lobbying. This language has been interpreted by many to mean \n     that the act applies only to people who spend a majority of \n     their time lobbying.\n\n  The report continues:\n\n       Taken together, these gaps in the coverage of the act could \n     mean that only a lobbyist who spends a majority of his or her \n     working time in direct contact with Members of Congress is \n     actually required to register. For this reason, it is not \n     surprising that many lobbyists view registration as \n     voluntary.\n\n  Not as compulsory.\n\n       As a result, it appears that a significant number of people \n     who engage in activities that the general public would view \n     as lobbying do not register at all and probably are not \n     required to do so. For example, the General Accounting Office \n     found that almost 10,000 of the 13,500 individuals and \n     organizations listed in the book ``Washington \n     Representatives\" were not registered under the Lobbying \n     Regulation Act. GAO interviewed a small sample of the \n     unregistered Washington representatives listed and found that \n     three-quarters contacting Members of Congress and \n     congressional staff deal with Federal legislation and seek to \n     influence actions of either Congress or the executive branch.\n\n  The report continues:\n\n       The rate of registration by nonprofit organizations that \n     engage in lobbying activities does not appear to be much \n     better. For example, the committee reviewed the lobbying \n     registrations of 18 nonprofit organizations that reported \n     legislative expenses in excess of $300,000 each to the \n     Internal Revenue Service in tax year 1991 and found that half \n     of these organizations did not have even a single active \n     registered lobbyist in that year. The failure of these \n     organizations and individuals to register does not mean that \n     they are violating the law as it is written today. What it \n     does mean is that the definition of lobbying in the Lobbying \n     Regulation Act is so narrow and full of loopholes that few \n     people are actually required to register.\n\n  The next issue which is addressed by this report relates to \ninformation disclosed.\n\n       The lobbying act requires ``a detailed report under oath of \n     all money received and expended by a lobbyist'' during each \n     calendar quarter, to whom it is paid and for what purpose. \n     The forms expand upon this requirement by requiring reporting \n     of specific line items of an organization's expenditures such \n     as printed or duplicated matter, office overhead, rent, \n     supplies, utilities, etc, telephone and telegraph, travel, \n     food, lodging and entertainment, wages, salaries, fees and \n     commissions, public relations and advertising. Each lobbyist \n     is required to attach an addendum to his or her disclosure \n     statement listing the recipient, date and amount of each such \n     expenditure. Lobbyists who comply with this requirement file \n     sheets of paper listing expenditures such as $45 phone bills, \n     a $6 cab fee, a $16 messenger fee and prorated salaries, in \n     one case for $1.31. In addition, some lobbyists provide lists \n     of restaurants where they have paid for lunch.\n\n  Continuing to quote from this report--and in this case the quote of a \nstatement that I made during the subcommittee hearing:\n\n       ``The people who did register are giving us information \n     which in many cases is utterly irrelevant. Here is one with a \n     telephone bill, $98.65. Underneath that, taxi fares, zero. \n     Why? Various carriers, no single expenditure of $10 or more. \n     Another firm is trying to prorate salaries for us to show how \n     they are apportioned to cover activities. Here is a salary \n     for a young man named Graves. His prorated salary, $6.50. \n     Someone named Young, $3.38. Someone named Horton, we are \n     told, the United States Government is told a man named Horton \n     was paid $1.31 in relation to lobbying activities. Just a \n     flood of irrelevant information pours in to us. Something is \n     basically wrong.''\n\n  And now quoting from the report again:\n\n       The disclosure record of nonprofit organizations engaging \n     in lobbying does not appear to be much better than that of \n     for-profit lobbying firms. The committee reviewed the \n     lobbying registrations filed by 5 nonprofit organizations \n     that reported nearly $5 million in lobbying income to the \n     Internal Revenue Service in the year 1991 and found that \n     while some of these organizations filed detailed reports \n     under the Lobbying Regulation Act, they reported barely \n     $200,000 in total lobbying expenditures to the Congress.\n       There appear to be two basic reasons for these low levels \n     of reported expenses.\n       1. Despite the requirements of the Lobbying Regulations \n     Act, many lobbyists do not appear to report income or \n     expenses at all. At the request of the subcommittee, the \n     General Accounting Office reviewed more than 1,000 lobbying \n     reports filed in 1989 and learned that few lobbyists actually \n     comply with the disclosure requirements. The GAO found that \n     fewer than 20 percent of the lobbyists included the required \n     attachments detailing expenditures. Almost 90 percent \n     reported no expenditures for wages, salaries, fees or \n     commissions, more than 95 percent reported no expenditures \n     for public relations and advertising services, and more than \n     60 percent of the lobbyists reported no expenditures at all \n     during the period covered.\n       2. The narrow definition of ``lobbying'' as it is used in \n     the act means that disclosure and full compliance with the \n     law simply is not very revealing. Since the Lobbying \n     Regulation Act is generally considered to cover only meetings \n     with Members of Congress, many lobbyists disclose only income \n     and expenses directly associated with such meetings. For \n     example, suppose that a lobbyist received $1 million from a \n     client for 5,000 hours of work at $200 per hour.\n       If the 5,000 hours of work included only 10 hours of direct \n     meetings with Members of Congress, many lobbyists would \n     report only $2,000 in income--\n\n  That is of the million dollars that they actually got.\n\n     even if the rest of the time was spent preparing for such \n     meetings and additional meetings with staff.\n       There are similar problems with the disclosure of the \n     lobbyist activities or objectives. The registration forms \n     require each lobbyist to ``state the general legislative \n     interest\" to the person filing and set forth the legislative \n     interest by citing short titles of statutes and bills, House \n     and Senate number of bills where known, citations of statutes \n     where known, whether for or against such statutes and bills.\n       While many lobbyists provide lists of specific bills of \n     interest in each quarterly reporting period, others provide \n     description of \n\n[[Page S10515]]\n     their interest that are so general that they reveal virtually nothing. \n     Like ``all operations in Congress that affect operations of \n     the client''; like ``general legislative interest''; like \n     ``matters pertaining to defense and military legislation''; \n     like ``all legislation affecting the insurance industry''; \n     like ``all legislation affecting the railroad industry.''\n       Overall, the General Accounting Office found that only 32 \n     percent of the reports that they reviewed stated titles and \n     numbers of statutes and bills that were subject to lobbying \n     as required by the statute.\n\n  Now, a third problem that is described in this report with the \ncurrent basic statute that covers the operation of lobbyists. Before I \ngo on to that, I want to just repeat how useless some of this \ninformation is that we currently require, how the current laws perform \na disservice to the country because they do not disclose what is \nintended to be disclosed, but how they also are useless and burdensome \nto the people who we need to disclose information.\n  How in the name of Heaven is it of any use when we are told that \nsomebody named Graves as a pro rata expenditure of his salary was paid \n$6.56; someone named Young was paid $3.38 as a pro rata part of his \nsalary to lobby Members of Congress on some issue. Someone is sitting \nthere typing up these forms that are filed, which tell us absolutely \nnothing of value. Somebody has to divide someone's salary of how many \nminutes that person spent with a Member of Congress and figure out that \nperson named Young had $3.38 of his salary pro rated to some meeting \nwith the Senator from Michigan or the Senator from Mississippi.\n  Someone named Horton was paid $1.31, we are told in some form. This \nis the fault of the laws that we have kept on the books for 50 years. \nThe minority of professional lobbyists who file disclosures are giving \nus that information, which is what they feel they are required to give \nus, which takes time to prepare and which is utterly useless \ninformation. These laws are a disservice to everybody and they have to \nbe reformed.\n  This has been going on 50 years; 50 years this sham has been going \non. We have tried to repair it, we have tried to reform it, we have \ntried to correct it, but we have failed for five decades, for one \nreason or another. And I am hopeful that finally today we are going to \nbe able to pass something in the Senate which we can call true reform \nwhich is going to finally tell us in a useful way--everybody that has \npaid money to lobby is going to tell us what the total amount is that \nthey are paid in useful form and on what issues they are lobbying \nCongress or the executive branch.\n  Obviously, we are leaving off people who are paying small amounts of \nmoney. I think $10,000 is going to be the threshold that we are going \nto use in a 6-month period. But where you pay a professional lobbyist \nmore than that amount of money, at that point, we are going to trigger \nsome useful information under our bill rather than to keep on the books \nthese utterly useless laws which breed disrespect for the law in \ngeneral and, where they are followed, provide the country with utterly \nuseless information which nobody can understand or put into a useful \nform.\n  As we said at the subcommittee hearing, this is a pretty dismal \npicture of a law that is not functioning as a law, that has been \nfestering on the books too long. We either ought to clean it up, make \nit relevant, or get rid of it, and that seems to me to be the \nalternative.\n  The second major act which applies to lobbyists is the Foreign Agents \nRegistration Act. Again, quoting from the committee report:\n\n       This act was passed in 1938. As the Supreme Court explained \n     in 1943, FARA was a new type of legislation adopted in the \n     critical period before the outbreak of the war. The general \n     purpose of the legislation was to identify agents of foreign \n     principals who might engage in subversive acts or spreading \n     foreign propaganda and to require them to make public record \n     of the nature of their employment.\n\n  The committee report continues:\n\n       In 1966, in response to overly aggressive lobbying by \n     foreign sugar companies, FARA was amended to cover a broader \n     range of foreign activities and interests. Since that time, \n     the focus of the act has shifted from the regulation of \n     subversive activities to the disclosure of lobbying on behalf \n     of foreign business interests. FARA requires any person who \n     becomes an ``agent of a foreign principal'' to register with \n     the Attorney General within 10 days thereafter. The term \n     ``agent of a foreign principal'' includes, subject to certain \n     exemption, any person who engages in political activities on \n     behalf of a foreign government, political party, individual \n     corporation, partnership, association or organization.\n       Each FARA registration statement must include, among other \n     information, a comprehensive statement of the registrant's \n     business, a complete list of employees and the nature of the \n     work that they perform, the name and address of every foreign \n     principal for whom the registrant is acting, the nature of \n     the business of each foreign principal and the ownership and \n     control of each and copies of each agreement with a foreign \n     principal.\n\n  The report continues:\n\n       In addition, each registrant is required to file a \n     supplemental disclosure statement every 6 months updating its \n     registration and detailing all past and proposed activity on \n     behalf of foreign principals. Supplemental statements are \n     required to include, among other information, a detailed \n     accounting of income and expenses and a list of all meetings \n     with Federal officials on behalf of foreign principals.\n\n  First, the report looks at the coverage of FARA. FARA requires any \nperson who acts ``as an agent of a foreign principal\" to register with \nthe Attorney General and disclose his or her activities. However, broad \nexemptions to FARA's registration requirements appear to have resulted \nin spotty disclosure of foreign lobbying activities. The two most \nfrequently cited exemptions apply to: First the practice of law in \nformal or informal proceedings before U.S. courts and agencies, and \nsecond, activities on behalf of a foreign-owned company in the United \nStates that are in furtherance of bona fide commercial, industrial or \nfinancial interest of the U.S. company.\n  Now, the lawyers exemption. The so-called lawyers exemption to FARA \nexempts attorneys who provide legal representation to foreign \nprincipals in the course of established agency proceedings, whether \nformal or informal. This exemption was adopted because the Congress \ndetermined that disclosure under FARA serves no useful purpose in legal \nproceedings where full disclosure of the agent status and identity of \nhis or her client is required. Because terms such as ``legal \nrepresentation in established procedures'' are not defined in the \nstatute or the implementing regulations, the applicability of this \nexemption has been left to case-by-case determinations by the Justice \nDepartment and by respective registrants themselves.\n  The Justice Department stated that the lawyers exemption applies only \nto services that can only be performed by an attorney and only in \nproceedings established pursuant to either statute or regulation. A \nletter from the Justice Department stated that ``The proceeding must be \none established by the agency questioned pursuant either to statute or \nregulation.'' The Department interprets legal representation to include \nthose services which could only be performed by a person within the \npractice by law--practicing law. However, the Justice Department was \nnot able to identify any written guidance or other public documents \nwhich reflect its present interpretation of this issue.\n  Now, perhaps for this reason, the Justice Department's interpretation \nof the lawyers exemption does not appear to be widely known or followed \nby attorneys who represent foreign clients. Interviews by subcommittee \nstaff reveal that some attorneys take the view that the lawyers \nexemption applies only in cases where there is a docketed case with \nformal appearances entered, while others believe that virtually any \nservice that they provide falls within the exemption, even when they \nhave extensive contacts with executive branch officials on a regulatory \nissue of broad impact. Experts on the statute generally agree that the \nscope of the exemption is not clear.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I ask unanimous consent that some \nadditional pages from the committee report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               b. The ``Domestic Subsidiaries'' Exemption\n\n       The ``domestic subsidiaries'' exemption to FARA excludes \n     from coverage any activities in the bona fide commercial, \n     industrial or financial interests of a domestic company \n     engaged in substantial operations in the United States, even \n     if the company is foreign-owned and the activities also \n     benefit the foreign parent corporation. Again, little formal \n     guidance on the application of this exemption is available. \n\n[[Page S10516]]\n\n       The Justice Department's letter to the Subcommittee states \n     that the primary test for the applicability of the domestic \n     subsidiaries exemption is ``whether the presence of the \n     domestic person is real or ephemeral, in short, whether the \n     domestic person is a viable working entity or a so-called \n     `front' or `shell'.'' However, the Justice Department letter \n     also states that the domestic subsidiaries exemption does not \n     apply when a local subsidiary is making efforts to expand the \n     U.S. market for foreign goods. In particular, the letter \n     cites as definitive a passage in the legislative history \n     which states that--\n       [w]here *  *  * the local subsidiary is concerned with U.S. \n     legislation enlarging the U.S. market for goods produced in \n     the country where the foreign parent is located *  *  * the \n     predominant interest is foreign.''\n       The Justice Department interpretation has not been \n     memorialized in published guidance and does not appear to be \n     widely known or followed by representatives of foreign \n     principals. Some take the position that this exemption \n     applies to any lobbying activity on behalf of domestic \n     subsidiaries of foreign corporations. Others believe that the \n     issue is whether the parent corporation ``controls'' the \n     subsidiary in such a way that it can be seen as controlling \n     the lobbying. A third category of lobbyists argue that the \n     exemption applies only to ``commercial'' matters such as \n     contract awards and landing rights determinations.\n       The widespread confusion over the proper application of \n     FARA exemptions and the lack of clear written guidance from \n     the Justice Department has left broad latitude for individual \n     representatives of foreign principals to reach their own \n     conclusions as to whether registration is required. As one \n     lobbyist who is registered under FARA explained:\n       ``I can argue the commercial exemption for subsidiaries \n     almost any way ***. I think it is entirely up to the judgment \n     of the registrant, or potential registrant.''\n       The result is spotty disclosure, and in some cases no \n     disclosure at all, of significant lobbying activities.\n       For example, the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government \n     Management reviewed a heavily lobbied 1989 effort to overturn \n     a decision by the Customs Service regarding the tariff \n     classification of imported jeeps and vans. Although this \n     issue was of great importance to foreign manufacturers of \n     sport utility vehicles and exclusively involved the treatment \n     of imports, almost none of the lobbying activity in this case \n     was disclosed under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.\n       Of the 48 people identified as lobbying Customs and/or \n     Treasury on behalf of those who opposed the Custom decision, \n     only six were registered under FARA. Three of the six who \n     were registered worked for a single firm and were covered by \n     a single registration; almost all stated that they registered \n     out of an abundance of caution and probably were not required \n     to do so. The reason for this non-disclosure is that \n     virtually all lobbying against the Customs decision was \n     viewed as exempt from coverage under FARA pursuant to either \n     the lawyers' exemption or the domestic subsidiaries' \n     exemption. Consequently, only a small fraction of the \n     lobbying activities conducted on behalf of foreign companies \n     were disclosed under FARA.\n\n                       2. Disclosure Requirements\n\n       Each FARA registration statement must include, among other \n     information, a comprehensive statement of the registrant's \n     business, a complete list of employees and the nature of the \n     work they perform; the name and address of every foreign \n     principal for whom the registrant is acting; the nature of \n     the business of each foreign principal and the ownership and \n     control of each; and copies of each agreement with a foreign \n     principal.\n       In addition, each registrant is required to file a \n     supplement disclosure statement every six months, updating \n     its registration and detailing all past and proposed activity \n     on behalf of foreign principals. Like the Lobbying Regulation \n     Act, FARA required detailed accounting of expenses such as \n     cab fares, copying, and telexing. In addition, and unlike the \n     Lobby Regulation Act, FARA requires a complete listing of \n     each federal official with whom the registrant has met during \n     the reporting period.\n       The Justice Department interprets FARA's disclosure \n     provisions to require that registrants detail even activities \n     unrelated to their registrations--such as providing advice or \n     legal representation on matters that would not otherwise \n     require registration. This means that engaging in even a \n     single ``registrable'' activity exposes the entire scope of a \n     registrant's activities to public disclosure requirements.\n       As a Justice Department representative explained at the \n     Subcommittee's hearing--\n       ``Senator Levin. So if you have one contact with a \n     Government official and have to register, you then have to \n     disclose everything that you do for that principal even \n     though all those other activities would not cause you to have \n     to register ***?\n       ``Mr. Clarkson. If you have one contact that is of a \n     registrable nature, yes, you would have to register and then \n     you would disclose your activities.\n       ``Senator Levin. [Then] you agree with the interpretation \n     that you have to disclose all hundred [activities] even \n     though only one of them required you to register?\n       ``Mr. Clarkson. We not only agree with it, that has been \n     our practice. I have no problem with that.''\n       Perhaps because the FARA disclosure requirements are so \n     extensive, the General Accounting Office has found that half \n     of the registered foreign agents do not fully disclose their \n     activities on behalf of foreign principals and more than half \n     fail to meet statutory filing deadlines. The deficiencies \n     identified by GAO included conflicting responses to \n     questions, failures to list contacts with government \n     officials, failures to disclose finances, and failures to \n     include supplemental statements as required.\n\n                  3. The Administration of the Statute\n\n       The Department of Justice enforces FARA largely by sending \n     letters and making phone calls to registrants and potential \n     registrants. The chief of the Department's Registration Unit \n     estimates that about seven or eight formal notices of \n     deficiency were sent out from 1988 to 1991. This compares to \n     62 deficiency notices sent out by the Department over a \n     similar three-year period in the early 1970's.\n       The Department has both criminal and civil injunctive \n     enforcement authority under the statute. However, the statute \n     does not authorize either civil monetary penalties or \n     administrative fines. As a result, a few court cases, either \n     civil or criminal, have ever been initiated under the Act. \n     The Justice Department initiated about ten cases in the \n     1970's, but did not file any in the 1980's.\n       The Registration Unit also conducts inspections to review \n     the files of registrants and make sure that they have \n     accurately disclosed their activities. Inspections are \n     conducted on a nonconfrontational basis: they are always \n     announced in advance, and some registrants are given an \n     opportunity to amend their filings prior to the inspection.\n       In 1989, the Registration Unit conducted 14 inspections; in \n     1990, only four inspections were conducted. These numbers are \n     down substantially from the mid-seventies, when the Unit \n     conducted 166 inspections in a period of a year and a half \n     and announced its intention to inspect every registered \n     foreign agent within a period of three years.\n       Six of the inspections conducted in 1989 and 1990 were of \n     lawyer-lobbyists or other firms engaged in lobbying-type \n     activities. Several of these inspections identified \n     significant deficiencies in the lobbyists' registrations. For \n     example, one inspection report indicates that the registrant \n     had routinely filed disclosure statements which noted only \n     that the firm provided ``legal representation'' for its \n     numerous foreign principals. The registrant failed to \n     indicate that it was involved in extensive lobbying \n     activities, or to disclose the numerous federal officials who \n     were contacted in connection with these activities.\n       In a second case, a registrant failed to disclose meetings \n     with dozens of federal officials, despite the fact that these \n     meetings were listed in its client billing documents. The \n     undisclosed contacts included meetings with the Secretary of \n     Commerce, the Deputy Attorney General, the Deputy Secretary \n     of Defense, the Deputy Secretary of State, the U.S. Trade \n     Representative, and several Members of Congress. The \n     registrant also failed to disclose almost $200,000 in income \n     and expenses on behalf of its foreign principals.\n       In neither of these cases did the Department of Justice \n     seek to sanction the registrant. In each case, the registrant \n     was simply asked to amend its registration statement to \n     provide the missing details.\n       By contrast, other inspection reports identify dozens of \n     so-called deficiencies that are of questionable significance \n     at best. For example, one report indicates that the \n     registrant accurately identified dozens of meetings with \n     federal officials, but failed to report such activities as \n     suggesting themes for a visiting foreign leader to address in \n     a speech to the U.N. and sending a thank-you note to a \n     federal official after a meeting (the meeting itself was \n     disclosed). The remedy in this case was the same as in the \n     case of the firm that failed to disclose meetings with the \n     Deputy Secretaries of State and Defense: the registrant was \n     required to amend its registration statements.\n       While those who register under the Act are subject to \n     routine Justice Department inspection of their books and \n     records, those who do not register are not subject to any \n     review of their records short of a criminal investigation. In \n     one instance reviewed by the staff, an attorney for leaders \n     of the Cali (Colombian) drug cartel was reported to have \n     lobbied the Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff and \n     State Department officials, proposing amendments to \n     international treaties that would make it harder to extradite \n     foreign drug kingpins to the United States--without \n     registering under FARA.\n       When the Justice Department's Registration Unit inquired as \n     to why the attorney had not registered, the attorney told \n     them that he had engaged in lobbying activities in his \n     personal capacity, out of general interest in the treaties, \n     and not in his capacity as an attorney for cartel members. \n     Because the Justice Department did not have the authority to \n     investigate further without initiating a criminal case, it \n     did not inquire further into the matter.\n       In short, the incentive for representatives of foreign \n     interests to avoid the burdens of registration under FARA is \n     exacerbated by the Justice Department's apparent inability to \n     investigate those who are not registered. While those who \n     register under the Act are required to make extensive \n     disclosure of all registrable and unregistrable activity and \n     are subject to Justice Department inspection \n\n[[Page S10517]]\n     of their books and records to verify the information disclosed, those \n     who do not register are not subject to any review of their \n     records short of a criminal investigation.\n       As Senator Cohen concluded at the Subcommittee hearings on \n     FARA, the statute is plagued with problems:\n       ``The broad exemptions contained in the Act appear to \n     permit significant lobbying efforts on behalf of foreign \n     companies to go undisclosed * * *. There appears to be \n     genuine wide-spread confusion and disagreement concerning the \n     breadth of these exemptions * * *. There is also considerable \n     confusion and an absence of specific guidance as to what \n     information is required to be disclosed by those agents who \n     do in fact register * * *. There may also have been instances \n     where the Department of Justice has failed to impose \n     sanctions in cases of serious violations, while at the same \n     time devoting significant department resources to require \n     agents to amend their statements to include minor and \n     irrelevant facts.''\n\n\n           c. the byrd amendment and the hud disclosure laws\n\n       The Byrd Amendment, which was enacted in October 1989 as a \n     part of an Interior Appropriations bill, is codified at 31 \n     U.S.C. 1352.\n       The Byrd Amendment prohibits the expenditure of \n     appropriated funds to influence the award of a contract, \n     grant, or loan. Subject to certain exceptions, any payment \n     for such lobbying out of non-appropriated funds must be \n     disclosed by the recipient of the contract, grant, or loan. \n     The recipient is required to disclose the name and address of \n     each person paid to influence the award, the amount of the \n     payment, and the activity for which the person was paid. \n     Regulations implementing the Byrd Amendment require the \n     disclosure of each contact made with a federal official to \n     influence the award of the contract, grant, or loan.\n       This disclosure must be filed with the awarding agency at \n     the time the contract, grant, or loan is requested or \n     received. Each agency head is required to compile the \n     information collected and submit it to the Secretary of the \n     Senate and the Clerk of the House twice a year, on May 31 and \n     November 30, Failure to file a disclosure form is subject to \n     a civil penalty of $10,000 to $100,000, to be levied under \n     the procedures of the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act.\n       Section 112, of the HUD Reform Act, which was enacted in \n     December 1989, two months after the Byrd Amendment, is \n     codified at 42 U.S.C. 3537b. This provision, like the Byrd \n     Amendment, imposes disclosure requirements on people who make \n     expenditures to influence the decisions of HUD employees with \n     respect to the award of contracts, grants, or loans. Section \n     112 goes beyond the Byrd Amendment by covering any other HUD \n     management actions that affect the conditions or status of \n     HUD assistance, and by requiring disclosure by lobbyists as \n     well as clients.\n       Section 112 required disclosure of the income and expenses \n     of lobbyists, to whom the money was paid, and for what \n     purposes. Section 112, unlike the Byrd Amendment, does not \n     require the disclosure of specific contacts with federal \n     officials. Knowing failures to disclose under the HUD law are \n     subject to civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 or the \n     amount of the payment to the consultant, whichever is \n     greater. Any person on whom a civil monetary penalty is \n     imposed is barred from receiving any payment in connection \n     with an application for HUD contracts, grants or loans for a \n     period of three years.\n       Section 401 of the HUD Reform Act, codified at 42 U.S.C. \n     1490p, creates a slightly different set of disclosure \n     requirements for persons attempting to influence financial \n     assistance awarded by the Farmers Home Administration. Under \n     Section 401, lobbyists are required to register and disclose \n     their name and address, the nature and duration of any \n     previous federal employment, and the name of their clients. \n     They are then required to file, on a quarterly basis, a \n     detailed report of all money received and expended, persons \n     to whom payments were made, and any contacts with federal \n     employees for the purpose of attempting to influence any \n     award or allocation of assistance.\n       The penalties for violating Section 401 include the \n     rescission of the assistance, the debarment of the violator, \n     and a civil penalty of up to $100,000 in the case of an \n     individual or $1,000,000 in the case of an applicant other \n     than an individual. Despite these strong penalties, the \n     provision is so little known that the Department of \n     Agriculture failed to identify it in response to a CRS \n     request to identify any statute requiring persons \n     representing private interests before the Department to \n     register or otherwise disclose their lobbying activities and \n     or contacts with agency officials.\n       The Byrd Amendment and the HUD disclosure provisions were \n     enacted in response to scandals at the Department of Housing \n     and Urban Development. According to published reports, top \n     HUD officials in the Reagan administration awarded large \n     discretionary grants to developer who retained well-connected \n     and favored consultants as lobbyists. At House hearings on \n     the scandal in 1989, one of these lobbyists agreed that the \n     work he did could be described as ``influence peddling''.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995--this \nis the bill in front of us today--will end the chaos, close the \nloopholes, and fix the badly broken current system.\n  The bill before us today will ensure that we finally know who is \npaying, how much, to whom, to lobby Congress and the executive branch.\n  This bill would cover all professional lobbyists, whether they are \nlawyers or nonlawyers, in-house or independent, whether they lobby \nCongress or the executive branch, or whether their clients are for-\nprofit or nonprofit. The bill is not intended to, and should not, \ncreate any significant new paperwork burdens on the private sector. \nIndeed, it would significantly streamline lobbying disclosure \nrequirements by consolidating filing in a single form and in a single \nlocation, instead of the multiple filings that are required under \ncurrent laws. Our bill would replace quarterly reports with semiannual \nreports. It would authorize the development of computer filing systems \nand simplify forms.\n  Our bill would substantially reduce paperwork burdens associated with \nlobbying registration by requiring a single registration by each \norganization whose employees lobby, instead of separate registration by \neach employee lobbyist. The names of the employee lobbyists, and any \nhigh-ranking Government position in which they served the previous 2 \nyears, would simply be listed in the employer's registration form. Our \nbill would simplify reporting of receipts and expenditures by \nsubstituting estimates of the total, bottom-line lobbying income by \ncategory of dollar value, like the forms that Members of Congress use \nfor disclosure.\n  They would substitute those estimates for the current requirement to \nprovide 29 separate lines of financial information, with supporting \ndata--most of it meaningless. To further ensure that the statute will \nnot needlessly impose new burdens on the private sector, the bill \nincludes specific provisions allowing entities that are already \nrequired to account for lobbying expenditures under the Internal \nRevenue Code to use the same data collected for the IRS for our \ndisclosure purposes as well.\n  The bill also includes de minimis rules to ensure that small \norganizations and other entities located outside Washington will be \nexempt from registration, even if their employees make occasional \ncontacts. As the bill is written, it would exempt from registration any \nindividual who spends less than 10 percent of his or her time on \nlobbying activities and any organization whose lobbying expenditures do \nnot exceed $5,000 in a semiannual period.\n  We intend to offer an amendment to increase those thresholds to 20 \npercent and $10,000 respectively, to ensure that we do not place \nunreasonable burdens on individuals and organizations that are not \nprofessional lobbyists.\n  In short, we have exempted small organizations from registration \nrequirements, as long as those paid lobbying activities are minimal. We \nhave carefully avoided imposing any burden at all on citizens who are \nnot professional lobbyists but who merely contact the Federal \nGovernment to express their personal views.\n  Now, the so-called grassroots lobbying provision in last year's \nconference report, to which some objected in the last Congress, are not \nin the bill before us today. They were not in the original Senate bill \nlast year. They were added in the House, or modified and accepted in \nconference--without much opposition, by the way. In fact, I do not \nthink there was any opposition in the conference. But what we have \nreturned to is the original Senate provisions on these points, as they \nwere adopted by the Senate last year.\n  In particular, this bill deletes definitions of grassroots \ncommunications, deletes requirements to disclose persons paid to \nconduct grassroots lobbying communication, deletes the requirement to \nseparately disclose grassroots lobbying expenses, deletes the \nrequirement to disclose if someone other than the client pays for the \nlobbying activities, and deletes all references to individual members \nof a coalition or association as clients.\n  Let me just repeat that, because this became such a contentious issue \nlast year. The grassroots provisions, which were in the conference \nreport, and which became the subject of so much contention on the \nSenate floor here last fall, are not in this bill, just the way they \nwere not in the Senate bill as \n\n[[Page S10518]]\nit originally passed the Senate last year.\n  Now, there have been a number of other concerns raised about our \nbill. We are going to be offering an amendment later on to address some \nof these concerns.\n  First, we are going to further reaffirm that the bill does not cover \ngrassroots lobbying by adding a specific statement that lobbying ``does \nnot include grassroots communications or other communications by \nvolunteers who express their own views on an issue.'' That is the first \npart of the amendment. Just to make it absolutely clear that we are not \ntrying to, in any way, cover communications by people who are \nexpressing their own views on an issue, we are going to make that \nexpress statement to address any lingering concern that people have in \nthat area.\n  Second, our amendment will address concerns that the bill might reach \nsmall groups and local organizations that engage in only incidental \nlobbying. We want to assure people that we are not trying to reach the \nsmall group, the local organization, who pay someone to lobby, or who \nspend money on paid lobbying activities, but whereas only incidental \nlobbying.\n  What we are doing is increasing the amount of time--the threshold--we \nare increasing the amount of time that must be spent on lobbying to be \nconsidered a lobbyist. We are increasing that from 10 to 20 percent of \na person's time over a 6-month period.\n  What that means is a person would now have to spend more than 5 weeks \nlobbying full-time in a 6-month period to be considered a lobbyist. And \nwe are increasing the exemption for small organizations that spend \nminimal dollar amounts on lobbying, we are increasing that amount from \n$5,000 to $10,000 in a 6-month period, and we are specifying that \nmultiple lobbying contacts are required for a person to be considered a \nlobbyist.\n  In addition, our amendment is going to address concerns about an \nindependent agency being created to administrator and enforce this act. \nThis concern is that somehow or another that an independent agency \ncould become a rogue bureaucracy and could impair first amendment \nrights.\n  What we are doing in our amendment is eliminating the provision that \nestablishes the new agency. We are going to entrust all filing \nrequirements to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House \nof Representatives who handle them now. We are going to permit the \nexecutive branch to provide guidance to potential registrants on how to \ncomply through the Office of Government Ethics, but not giving that \nagency any investigative or enforcement power responsibility.\n  We are eliminating the enforcement provisions of the bill altogether \nand replacing them with a simple provision, providing a civil monetary \npenalty for violations, and we are reducing the maximum penalty for \nviolation from $100,000 to $50,000.\n  In addition, the amount would lengthen the period of time for filing \nregistrations and reports from 30 days to 45 days. We will permit \nnonprofit others to file duplicate copies of the IRS form 990 in lieu \nof disclosure of dollars spent on lobbying under the bill. We will \nclarify that written materials provided in response to a specific \nrequest do not count as lobbying, regardless of whether the request is \noral or written.\n  These amendments, a series of changes which we will make in our own \nbill by amendment, should remove concerns that the bill could impose \nregistration and reporting requirements on organizations that engage in \nonly incidental lobbying. We are removing the independent agency. We \nwill address the concern that we are empowering an executive branch \nagency to audit investigative review, sensitive lobbying communications \nor deter citizens from exercising their first amendment rights through \narbitrary or selective enforcement.\n  At the same time, we are making these changes to address those \nconcerns, we are going to leave intact the heart of the bill, which \nplugs loopholes in the current lobbying disclosure laws and ensures all \nprofessional lobbyists have to register and report who is paying them, \nhow much, to lobby Congress and the executive branch, on what issue.\n  We are going to require that if our bill passes, regardless of \nwhether or not the paid lobbyist is a lawyer or a nonlawyer, whether or \nnot the client is profit or nonprofit, and whether or not the lobbyist \nis an in-house lobbyist or a lobbying firm.\n  Mr. President, while we want to avoid unnecessary burdens on the \nprivate sector, we must ensure that the public gets basic information \non that critical point--who is paying who, how much to lobby Congress, \nand the executive branch, and on what issue.\n  We will oppose any effort to eliminate important disclosure \nrequirements or to exclude coverage of lobbying on certain types of \nissues or to limit disclosure to legislative branch lobbying, or to \nraise the thresholds in the bill to unrealistically high levels.\n  In the last Congress, the Lobbying Diagnosis Closure Act was adopted \nby the Senate by a 95-to-2 vote. A conference report was then passed by \nthe House and sent to the Senate for final consideration.\n  Unfortunately, objections to certain provisions related to grassroots \nlobbying made it impossible to enact the bill at that time. Those \nprovisions are not in this version, just as they were not in the Senate \nbill when this bill passed the Senate last year.\n  The fact is, 95 Members of this body are on record as favoring a \nstrong lobbying disclosure bill. Mr. President, there was a recent \npublic opinion poll, 1993, a little over a year ago, where voters were \nasked who wields the real power in Washington. The answers should \nenergize Members to act. The answer in that public opinion poll was--\nand again, the question, who has the real power in Washington?--7 \npercent said the President; 22 percent said Congress; 50 percent said \nlobbyists. Mr. President, 50 percent of the American people feel that \nlobbyists wield the real power in Washington--more than twice as many \nas feel that we bear the real power and have the real power in \nWashington, and over 7 times as many as feel that President Clinton has \nthe real power in Washington.\n  Lobbying disclosure is one of three pillars of reform. If we are \nserious about increasing public confidence in this democratic \nGovernment, we have to address at least three fundamental issues. One \nis lobbying disclosure. That is before the Senate in this first bill. \nSecond, is gifts. That will come before the Senate in the next bill we \ntake up. The third is campaign finance reform.\n  Mr. President, I indicated that we have an amendment which will make \na number of changes. Before I send that amendment to the desk I want to \nrepeat them, because they address issues which have been raised and \nwhich are, I believe, important to all Members of this body.\n  The first provision of this amendment will reaffirm that the bill \ndoes not cover grassroots lobbying by adding the specific statement \nthat lobbying does not include grassroots lobbying communications or \nother communications by volunteers who express their own views on an \nissue.\n  The amendment that we will offer also makes it clear that we are not \nreaching small groups and local organizations that engage in only \nincidental lobbying. We are doing that by increasing the amount of time \nthat a person must spend lobbying, paid to lobby, from 10 to 20 percent \nof that person's time during the reporting period, and we are \nincreasing the exemption for small organizations that spend minimal \ndollar amounts on lobbying from $5,000 to $10,000 during that 6-month \nperiod.\n  Also, we are specifying that multiple lobbying contacts are required \nfor a person to be considered a lobbyist--a single lobbying contact \ndoes not count. All three of those must exist before the person fits \nthe definition of a lobbyist.\n  We are also addressing the concerns about the creation of an \nindependent agency to administrator and enforce the act by eliminating \nthe provisions creating that agency. We are doing a number of \nadditional things in this amendment, as I indicated in my prior \ndescription of the amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1836\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. With that, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Cohen and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S10519]]\n\n       The Senator from Michigan, [Mr. Levin] for himself and Mr. \n     Cohen, proposes an amendment numbered 1836.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as I said earlier this morning, I think it \nis important to point out again that every Senator on both sides of the \naisle agrees that there needs to be lobbying reform. There are a number \nof changes that can be made that are long overdue, as a matter of fact. \nUnfortunately, in past years these issues have been bogged down by \ncrowded schedules, sometimes partisan politics, sometimes \nmisunderstandings. But for whatever reason, it has not been done. I \nthink we have a chance to accomplish that today, and we intend to work \ntogether in a bipartisan effort to accomplish that goal.\n  I do want to point out at the beginning, the majority leader, Senator \nDole, to help facilitate this effort, did create a Bipartisan Senate \nGift and Lobbying Reform Task Force to study these issues and develop \nproposals for reform. The leader set up this task force at a time when \nmost Members were skeptical that anything could really successfully be \ncrafted as a compromise.\n  I am pleased to report that the task force has met, we have had a lot \nof discussions, and I think significant progress on the issue of \nlobbying reform has been accomplished and we are moving toward a \nbipartisan bill. I specifically would refer to several of the points \nthe Senator from Michigan has just noted, the proposals that are \nincluded in the amendment he just sent to the desk.\n  He changes the language with regard to grassroots lobbying efforts \nand adds additional guarantees and clarification that this is not \nintended to and will \n\n[[Page S10520]]\nnot in any way chill the efforts of our citizens and our constituents \nwho come to Washington to try to seek redress from the Government to \ncontact their Senators. That is a very important change from last year.\n  We can go back and think again about the history of how we got that \nlanguage in the bill last year. Last year it was added in conference. \nMembers originally, I think, did not object to it because they had not \nreally had a chance to assess what the ramifications might be, but, as \nSenators started looking into it, their concerns grew. But that has \nbeen clarified and will not be a problem here today.\n  Also, changes have been made with regard to incidental lobbying that \nI think are very important. Some people will have occasion just to make \nan indirect, maybe one-time contact with a Senator or staffer that \ncould qualify as incidental, and that would have language that would \naddress that concern.\n  I think it is important that the threshold in this compromise \nalternative is being raised. I believe the language that was in the \noriginal bill was at $2,500 for an individual lobbyist. I believe that \nwas too low. Some significant movement has been made in that area. The \npenalty, while we feel if there is a blatant or repeated violation of \nthe disclosure rules there should be an opportunity for some maximum \npenalty, I think it was excessive in the original Levin bill. Also, to \nincrease the filing period from 30 to 45 days just makes fundamental \ngood sense--gives them time, at least, to comply with the filing \nrequirements.\n  So I think all of those are very positive movements, and I think we \nwill be able, hopefully, to narrow areas where we need discussion down \neven further very shortly.\n  Before I delve into the details of some of the task force work, I \nwould also like to begin by commending the members of the task force \nfor their time. The Senate minority whip, Wendell Ford--Senator Ford \nfrom Kentucky has been very helpful in cochairing this task force. The \nSenator from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, who has for a long time been \ninterested in serious lobbying reform, has assisted the efforts and, as \nchairman of the Ethics Committee, has been very involved. The chairman \nof the Rules Committee, Senator Stevens; Senator Ashcroft; Senator \nBreaux; Senator Cohen; Senator Dodd; Senator Feingold; Senator \nLautenberg; Senator Levin; Senator Reid; Senator Rockefeller; Senator \nSimpson; and Senator Wellstone have all been involved in this effort.\n  As I noted, we have made significant progress in the lobby area. It \ndoes not appear that as much progress has been made in the gift-rule \narea. That will come up next. But we will continue to work on that also \nthroughout the day.\n  Last month, when the Senate Lobbying Reform Task Force was created, \nwe started to have these conversations that have led to some \nagreements. I think we have reached some changes that will lead us to \nsound policy, not just political sound bites. We want to continue to \nwork in that area.\n  But the task force has identified some areas that we still are very \nmuch concerned about and we want to work on. One of those is the \ndefinition of a lobbyist. The definition of a lobbyist--it is very \nimportant that we have a clear understanding of that. The original bill \nwas, I think, way too broad and would have required a constituent back \nhome, who maybe would have only come to Washington once a year, to \nregister as a lobbyist. We feared this might be a deterrent to some \nconstituents to actually doing what they might be entitled to under the \nConstitution. To avoid this situation, we have already reached an \nagreement on two significant changes in this area of definition of a \nlobbyist.\n  First, I believe both sides of the aisle have agreed to increase the \npercentage of time an individual must spend lobbying to be considered a \nlobbyist from 10 to 20 percent. Second, we are in the process of \nnegotiating changes in the level of compensation a lobbying firm or \norganization must receive in order to be required to register. The \noriginal bill, as I noted, only exempted firms receiving under $2,500, \nand organizations receiving under $5,000 for other organizations. The \nlevel is clearly too low. While this level might be appropriate under \ncurrent law where lobbyists are only required to report contacts made \nwith actual Members, the compromise we are working on would go beyond \nthat, and I think we need to change the levels that are involved. We \nare talking about maybe even the involvement of contact with staff. So \nwe are discussing a change of those limits even more. I do not think we \nhave reached a final agreement, but we are getting closer.\n  It is very important we do not begin this process by finding a way to \ncreate a new, additional Federal agency, as was originally included in \nthis bill. I feel particularly strongly about that. To set up another \norganization with more people being employed at the Justice Department \nreally is just not called for. I understand Senator Levin has agreed we \nwould change that. And it would require that lobbyists register with \nthe Clerk of the House or the Secretary of the Senate within 45 days of \ntheir first lobbying contact. That is a major movement.\n  We should not create this new agency at the Justice Department or \nanywhere else. We should continue, basically, with the reporting \nreceptacle that we have now, and they will be able to deal with it \nbecause I do not think there is going to be a great expansion in the \nnumber of filings. But we will just have to see how that will work out.\n  There is one other point we continue to have disagreement on, and \nthat is whether or not the executive branch should be included. The \noriginal Levin bill also included lobbying of the executive branch, and \nwhile this may or may not be a desirable goal, we are concerned about \nincluding coverage of the executive branch.\n  The President has the authority to require lobbying disclosure by \nExecutive order, if he wishes to do so. The President recently created \na Lobbying Reform Task Force with the Speaker of the House, and their \nefforts may have some recommendations later on to change the coverage. \nBut I think we should not preempt that.\n  Let us make this applicable to the legislative branch. That is where \nwe work. That is what we are really trying to deal with. There will be \nother processes and other ways that you can deal with whether or not \nthe executive branch should be covered.\n  So I know that Senator Levin and others have been working on this a \nlong time. Senator McConnell I see is on the floor and will want to \ncomment.\n  I am very pleased that the majority leader went ahead and scheduled \nthis early in the week rather than late in the week where this \nlegislation might have been in a crunch with other legislation. We can \nconsider it today, and hopefully come to a conclusion before the day is \nout on at least lobbying reform. And then we will see what we can do on \ngift reform.\n  Mr. President, in view of the fact that Senator McConnell is here, I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me thank my good friend, the \nmajority whip, for the effort he has made to move this issue along. I \nthink all of are us are grateful to him for his leadership.\n  I also want to commend the Senator from Michigan, Senator Levin, for \ncoming a long way, it seems to me, in the proper direction with the \nlatest alternative which he has suggested.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important to remember what the \nfundamental issue before us is. The Constitution of the United States \ngives to each American citizen the right to petition the Congress. And \nthe courts have held that there is no distinction among those who \npetition the Congress and are not paid to do so and those who petition \nthe Congress and are paid to do so. In other words, a citizen does not \nwaive his or her constitutional rights simply because they are paid to \nrepresent a group that does not have the time to come to Washington and \ndo the job themselves.\n  So there is no constitutional distinction between lobbyists and \nnonlobbyists when it comes to the protective constitutional right to \npetition the Congress. That is at the heart of this debate. Of course, \nthe surface appeal facing lobbyists is overwhelming. But the \nConstitution is designed to protect the individual.\n  So what we are seeking to achieve here, I think as the majority whip \n\n[[Page S10521]]\n  pointed out there is a good chance we may well achieve it, is a \nconsensus effort here to strengthen the lobby laws but not to \ndiscourage people from exercising their constitutional rights.\n  I might say, at least as far as this Senator is concerned, that it \nseems appropriate, as we look to require further disclosure from \nlobbyists, that we consider not exempting those who lobby for the \nnonprofit sector and that we consider not exempting those who lobby for \nthe Government sector. There are governments, State, and local \ngovernments, and even arguably divisions in each part of the Federal \nGovernment, the so-called legislative affairs offices of each Cabinet \nat the Federal Government, that are also seeking to influence us and to \npush us in the direction arguably of expanding the Government; or to \nspend more money on Government programs.\n  One of the things I hope we can take a look at in the course of this \ndebate is whether or not the distinction between those who lobby for \nthe private sector and those who lobby for the Government sector or the \nnonprofit sector is a valid distinction. Why is it that one kind of \nactivity designed arguably to promote the free enterprise system is \nsomehow suspect and another kind of lobbying activity to promote the \nexpansion of Government is somehow not suspect? So one of the things we \nwill be discussing in the course of this debate is whether that is an \nappropriate distinction.\n  But, Mr. President, my friend from Arizona is here. He is prepared to \noffer an amendment which I personally believe, having talked with him \nabout it, is a good amendment. I will not speak any longer at this \npoint. I am going to make an opening statement later this morning.\n  But I want to commend the Senator from Michigan for the movement that \nhe has made. I think we are moving in the direction of coming together \nhere and passing a landmark piece of legislation.\n  So with those opening observations, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank both the Senator from \nMichigan and the Senator from Kentucky. I realize the volatility of \nthis issue. I realize the difficulty involved in it. There is no doubt \nthat there are very strong arguments on both sides.\n  Mr. President, I say to my friend from Michigan--and I intend to do \nthis later in the day--but I believe that one of the reasons there is \nsuch a diversity of view here is that there is not a defining standard \nas to what is expected in the way of gift rules.\n  I remember quite a few years ago when there were some very stringent \ngift rules enacted for the executive branch. I think the Senator from \nMichigan remembers, as I do, that there was great gnashing of the teeth \non how it would not work, and that it would be impossible to enforce, \net cetera. But it has worked.\n  I urge both my colleagues to look at the rules as far as gifts are \nconcerned that apply to the executive branch of Government. It has \nworked. It is fair. I have not heard, at least in recent years, \ninordinate complaints that it is an unworkable situation. Very frankly, \nthe gift ban as it exists today as far as the executive branch, it \nseems to me should apply to the legislative branch. The members of the \nexecutive branch are subject to the same lobbying, and the same \ninfluences because decisions of enormous consequence are made in the \nexecutive branch.\n  I look at the Defense Department and see that multibillion-dollar \ndecisions are made in the executive branch which have frankly very \nlittle input from time to time from the legislative branch. Yet, I \nbelieve it was back in the 1970's, that a very stringent gift rule was \nenacted in order to cure some of the problems that existed in the \nexecutive branch, and those seem to be working today.\n  Very fundamentally, Mr. President, these gift bans are $20 and $50 \naggregated. As far as the gift limit is concerned, gifts of $20 or less \nare allowable, with an aggregate limit of $50 from any one source in \nany given calendar year. There is no difference between in State and \nout State, difference for lobbyists versus nonlobbyist, and a Member \nmust document all gifts received and make such information available \nevery 6 months. The definition of a gift would be basically the same as \nis being proposed but it would be expanded to include meals and \nentertainment.\n  As far as charitable events are concerned, payment of meals, if the \nstaff member participates in a meal or dinner event. Exemptions would \nbe that there is no difference between in State and out of State, and \nno difference between lobbyists and nonlobbyists. Meals up to $20 from \nany source would be allowed. Meals of any value may be accepted from \ncharitable organizations if the Member attends an event sponsored by a \ncharity, and substantially participates in those activities.\n  Finally, if there is entertainment associated with a Member's trip, \nthese should be paid for by the Member if the value exceeds the gift \nlevel ceiling.\n  Again, since there seems to be significant differences between both \nsides of the aisle, I would urge my colleagues to go back and look at \nthe rules that pertain to the executive branch of Government which have \nworked now for nearly 20 years. And I would suggest that would be a \nvery important place we could begin, and perhaps reach some agreement \nhere before we consume the entire week with debate on this obviously \nvery emotional issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the pending \namendment in order to propose an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1837\n\n                 (Purpose: To repeal the Ramspeck Act)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1837.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . REPEAL OF THE RAMSPECK ACT.\n\n       (a) Repeal.--Subsection (c) of section 3304 of title 5, \n     United States Code, is repealed.\n       (b) Redesignation.--Subsection (d) of section 3304 of title \n     5, United States Code, is redesignated as subsection (c).\n       (c) Effective Date.--The repeal and amendment made by this \n     section shall take effect 2 years after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment basically repeals the \nRamspeck Act, the act, which as I understand, was enacted around 1940. \nIt provides an unequal playing field for those members of staff in \nCongress who have worked here. It is obsolete and unfair. The time has \ncome to terminate it.\n  It provides exclusive privileges to legislative and judicial branch \nemployees attempting to secure career civil service positions within \nthe Federal Government. The Ramspeck Act makes a special exception to \ncertain competitive requirements of civil service positions for \nindividuals who have served 3 years in the legislative branch or 4 \nyears in the judicial branch.\n  Under this act, legislative branch employees are given competitive \nstatus for direct appointment to a civil service position if they are \ninvoluntarily separated from their job, and they are allowed 1 year \nfrom their date of separation in which to exercise this privilege. \nFurthermore, the Ramspeck Act waives any competitive examination which \nranks applicants for jobs for individuals who are former legislative or \njudicial branch employees. Therefore, if a competitive exam is given to \nrank candidates for a certain civil service position, a select group of \ncontestants are permitted by the Ramspeck Act to effectively skip a \nhurdle, yet they are assured of being able to be selected for the job.\n  Finally, individuals appointed under that act become career employees \nin the civil service without regard to the tenure of service \nrequirements that exist for other civil service employees. Most people \nwho have successfully competed for a position within the civil service \nmust then serve a 3-year probationary period before they achieve career \nstatus with their agency. Ramspeck appointees, however, are \n\n[[Page S10522]]\nafforded with career status immediately.\n  Mr. President, I wish to point out very clearly the amendment will \nhave no impact on any former Senate or House employee who lost their \njob in the last election. I think it is very important that we point \nthat out. The results of this last November's election caused a very \nlarge number of involuntary job losses among legislative employees from \nthe other side of the aisle. Republican staffers have utilized their \neligibility under the Ramspeck Act to gain preference as have others, \nso this amendment would not be enforced for 2 years in order to allow \nthose individuals who were displaced by last year's election to have \nthe same opportunity that others have had for the last 40 years.\n  Mr. President, not only is the act itself very wrong but there have \nbeen several cases that have really been egregious. The GAO issued a \nreport in May of 1994 concerning the Ramspeck Act, and they were able \nto come up with several examples of how really egregious some of the \nindividuals have been in taking advantage of this legislation.\n  They point out a case, and I quote from page 63 of the GAO report:\n\n       The individual reestablished her Ramspeck eligibility by \n     returning to Congress after 9 years and 11 months and \n     remaining in the position for 5 days.\n\n  Mr. President, what that means is the individual had left her \nemployment here in the Congress, had been gone for 9 years and 11 \nmonths, returned to work for a Member of Congress for 5 days and \nthereby reestablished eligibility and then obtained a job with the \nDepartment of the Interior.\n\n       The individual's qualifying employment had been obtained in \n     Congress from 1975 to 1982. After positions both in and out \n     of Government, she accepted a noncareer schedule C position \n     with the Department of Interior in October 1991. On November \n     6, 1992, after making inquiries about her Ramspeck Act \n     eligibility and noncompetitive career appointment \n     opportunities at the Department of Interior, the individual \n     resigned from her noncareer position with the Department of \n     Interior. On the same day, DOI approved a new career position \n     to which the individual was subsequently appointed. She began \n     work for a congressional committee on November 9, 1992, \n     knowing that it was a 1-week special project. On November 10, \n     she applied for and on November 12 was approved for a \n     noncompetitive appointment to the new career position at the \n     Department of Interior under the Ramspeck authority. The \n     appointment became effective on November 16.\n\n  Another case:\n\n       The individual reestablished his Ramspeck eligibility by \n     returning to congressional employment after 4 years and \n     remaining in a position for 8 days with a Congressman who had \n     not been reelected. The individual had worked in Congress \n     from 1967 to 1989. He then held a noncareer SES appointment \n     at the Department of Interior until he resigned on November \n     30, 1992. At the time of his resignation, he was earning \n     $112,100 per year. On December 1, 1992, the individual \n     returned to a position on the staff of a Member of Congress. \n     The position paid $1,200 per year. The following day, the \n     individual obtained the Member certification that he would be \n     involuntarily separated because the Member had not been \n     reelected. Therefore, the individual would be eligible for a \n     noncompetitive career appointment under the Ramspeck Act. On \n     December 3, the individual applied for a new career position \n     at the Department of Interior. DOI created the position on \n     November 24 and on the same day requested, authorized and \n     approved a personnel action to appoint the individual \n     noncompetitively under the Ramspeck Act to the new position. \n     All this took place days before the individual had resigned \n     from his noncareer position.\n\n  Another case:\n\n       The individual established her Ramspeck eligibility by \n     returning to congressional appointment after 5 years and 7 \n     months and remaining in the position for 12 days. The \n     individual, who had worked in Congress from 1970 to 1987, was \n     given a temporary appointment on June 11, 1987 and on June 21 \n     was converted to a permanent noncareer schedule C position at \n     the GM-14 level. On June 15, 4 days later, the position was \n     upgraded to the GM-15 level and the individual was promoted \n     to the position on July 17. The individual resigned from the \n     noncareer position on December 5, 1992, and 2 days later \n     joined the staff of a Member of Congress who was planning to \n     retire. She obtained a Ramspeck certification on December \n     14--\n\n  That is 9 days later.\n\n     stating that she would be involuntary separated because the \n     Member was retiring. The individual terminated her employment \n     on December 18.\n\n  That is 13 days later.\n\n     and applied to DOI for a noncompetitive career appointment \n     under the Ramspeck Act on December 21. She received a career \n     appointment on January 11, 1993 in the same office in the \n     Department of Interior from which she had resigned. A \n     position to which she was noncompetitively appointed had been \n     created in July 1992, and it apparently had remained vacant \n     since that time. The new career position had some of the same \n     duties and responsibilities as the GM-15 noncareer position.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator from Arizona yield for a \nquestion or comment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. I wish to commend the Senator from Arizona for his work in \nthis area. I must confess that when he first called the Ramspeck Act to \nmy attention earlier this year, I had no idea really what was involved. \nHe at that time agreed that he was going to try to educate us all a \nlittle bit better and he would be back with an amendment in this area \nlater on this year. He is fulfilling that statement today.\n  As I have gotten into Ramspeck, I think he has a very good point. \nThis is something that should absolutely be changed. Most Americans \nhave no idea what is involved here and I daresay most Members of \nCongress. Most of us just were not aware that there was any kind of \nspecial arrangement whereby a Member of a congressional staff could \nwind up getting preferential treatment in employment in the executive \nbranch.\n  Is that basically what happens under the existing law? If you are on \na congressional staff, you can go over to the executive branch under \nspecial consideration and get a position on a noncompetitive basis, is \nthat the way it could properly be summed up?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes. This bill was signed into law in 1940, and there is \nno doubt that it was an attempt to help individuals who had worked in \nthe legislative branch obtain employment. We all know that the vagaries \nof the electoral process dictate that--and sometimes the death of \nMembers. But that may have been valid in 1940. I am not prepared to \njudge the wisdom of this body at that time, but clearly at this time it \nis not only inappropriate but also there have been some very egregious \nabuses of the system as it existed.\n  The system alone was bad, but then when we have people who go over \nand serve on the staff of a Member of Congress for 7 days or for 20 \ndays, who have not been working in Congress--as I mentioned, one of \nthem had not worked in Congress for 7 years and 3 months, went over, \nworked for 20 days for a Member of Congress and then got a GS-15 \nposition, which is a permanent position, as the Senator from \nMississippi knows. That is really something we need to do away with. I \nappreciate the question.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. I \ncertainly agree with him and will support his amendment when we get to \na vote on it later on today.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, could I just mention in closing, I ask \nunanimous consent that several articles here, one from the National \nJournal, one from the Wall Street Journal, and an editorial from the \nArizona Republic be made printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Arizona Republic, Nov. 19, 1994]\n\n                         Losers Get Spoils, Too\n\n       We've all heard the adage about the spoils going to the \n     victor. The impending changeover to Republican control of \n     Congress is a good example. That means thousands of patronage \n     workers on Capitol Hill--from committee staffers to drivers \n     and telephone operators--the vast majority of whom were \n     appointed by Democrats, could be looking for work.\n       ``Could'' is the operative word here, thanks to a little-\n     known federal law called the Ramspeck Act. Under the law, \n     named after the Georgia congressman who authored it decades \n     ago, congressional employees who lose out in the political \n     shuffle are given first preference for civil service jobs in \n     the federal bureaucracy. That's right! Even the losers stand \n     to gain taxpayer-paid spoils.\n       As a practical matter, most low-level congressional workers \n     who will lose their majority party positions--committees in \n     the new Congress, for example, will have more Republican \n     staffers than democratic appointees--will likely have to find \n     jobs elsewhere. But the cream of the crop, most of them top \n     congressional aides, lawyers and policy experts, will be able \n     to go to the head of the employment line for jobs in the \n     executive branch under the Ramspeck Act.\n       The Clinton White House will be under immense pressure to \n     accommodate these Democratic Party loyalists, says Mark R. \n     Levin, \n\n[[Page S10523]]\n     director of legal policy for the Washington-based Landmark Legal \n     Foundation. Writing in The Wall Street Journal, Levin \n     observes that these are the same individuals ``responsible \n     for drafting the onerous, big-government approach that the \n     voters rejected on Nov. 8.''\n       Under Ramspeck, hundreds of these policy-makers could \n     ``burrow'' into large federal departments and agencies \n     throughout the country, Levin says, and ``continue to impose \n     their liberal views on the public.'' The law applies to \n     congressional staffers with three years or more of service \n     who lose their jobs due to ``reasons beyond their control . . \n     . such as death, defeat or resignation'' of their bosses. \n     Thus, they are allowed to avoid normal competitive procedures \n     for filling federal jobs and gain immediate career status, \n     with civil service protection, when hired.\n       When the shoe was on the other foot a few years ago and the \n     outgoing Bush administration sought to find jobs in the \n     federal bureaucracy for its top staffers, then-Democratic \n     Rep. William Clay, a champion of labor rights, condemned the \n     process. ``Burrowing in,'' as he put it, ``is an insidious \n     practice that undermines the civil-service system, takes jobs \n     away from better-qualified career employees and could \n     sabotage the efforts of the new administration to carry out \n     the will of the people.''\n       We couldn't have said it better.\n       Levin suggests that the new Republican Congress repeal the \n     Ramspeck Act. It is, after all, precisely the kind of double \n     standard that has served to set official Washington apart \n     from the rest of the nation and which helped to fuel the \n     grass-roots rebellion that turned Democratic incumbents out \n     of office.\n       ``Make the former Hill staffers find real jobs in the \n     private sector,' urges Levin. And as an added bonus, he says: \n     ``If they ever come back to government, they will be more \n     sensitive to the needs of working Americans'' who have no \n     such exempts written into law for poor job performance. \n     Getting Washington to play by the same rule as the rest of us \n     ought to be high on the next Congress' agenda.\n                                                                    ____\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 15, 1994]\n\n                          They'll Never Leave\n\n                           (By Mark R. Levin)\n\n       When the American people fired the Democrat majority in \n     Congress last week, they also sent thousands of congressional \n     staffers into the private sector--or did they?\n       The House Republicans have set up a transition committee, \n     headed by Rep. John Boehner (R., Ohio), to examine the 40-\n     year-old Democrat patronage system. Rep. Boehner's spokesman \n     infoms me that there are some 13,000 committee staffers and \n     patronage employees in the House, the vast majority of whom \n     work for, or were appointed by, Democrats. (This does not \n     include the untold hundreds of individuals who work on the \n     personal staffs of congressmen.)\n       Although Rep. Boehner has sought, but not yet received, a \n     complete list of these jobs from the Democrats, it is \n     estimated that several hundred of the patronage employees \n     serve as doorkeepers, barbers and beauticians, printers, \n     photographers, elevator operators, security personnel, \n     furniture movers, drivers, telephone operators, librarians \n     and the like.\n       Padding the public payroll with friends and loyalists is \n     not particularly new, but it is wasteful and ought to be \n     eliminated. However, the real issue in terms of policy and \n     governing involves the fate of Congress' shadow government--\n     i.e., what will come of the thousands of soon-to-be \n     unemployed Democratic staffers who are responsible for \n     drafting the onerous, bit-government approach that the voters \n     rejected on Nov. 8? These are the folks who wrote such \n     oppressive legislation as the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation \n     Act of 1993 (which brought us retroactive taxation, among \n     other things), the Elementary and Secretary Education Act \n     (which federalizes such local educational curriculum), and \n     the Endangered Species Act (which threatens private property \n     rights).\n       If the Republicans keep their promise to cut a third of \n     Hill jobs, such a reduction--plus the turnover of a majority \n     of the committee staff positions from Democrats to \n     Republicans--will result in an unprecedented, large-scale \n     exodus of these shadow legislators. But where will they go? \n     Many of the staffers are lawyers. Not even in Washington are \n     there enough legal or lobbying positions to employ most of \n     them. And few businesses can use the remaining aides, many of \n     whom have nothing\n      but Capitol Hill experience. That's where the Ramspect Act--\n     a decades-old law widely known to most Hill dwellers--\n     comes in. This law allows out-of -work staffers to find \n     employment among the ranks of career civil servants in the \n     executive branch. The only requirements are that the ex-\n     staffer must have worked a minimum of three years in \n     Congress, must be qualified for the position (of course, a \n     position can be created to ensure that the applicant \n     qualifies), and must exercise his Ramspeck eligibility \n     within a year of losing his congressional job.\n       Upon receiving a Ramspeck appointment, the former \n     congressional aide receives the same job security and \n     protection as a civil servant. In fact, he becomes a civil \n     servant who can only be removed from his new position for \n     cause--a rare event in our federal bureaucracy.\n       There will be immense pressure on the Clinton \n     administration to hire Democratic congressional aides. And \n     since there are only a relative handful of political jobs the \n     White House can offer, federal departments and agencies may \n     be pressured to accommodate them through Ramspeck \n     appointments. This would enable hundreds of congressional \n     staffers to burrow into large federal departments and \n     agencies throughout the country.\n       Why is this a concern? Every year thousands of pages of \n     regulations are written, imposed, interpreted and enforced by \n     workers employed in the executive branch. These individuals \n     make decisions every day that affect our lives. There is a \n     real danger, therefore, that many of the same congressional \n     staffers whose bosses were just deposed by the American \n     people will assume important decision-making positions in the \n     federal bureaucracy, permitting them to continue to impose \n     their liberal views on the public.\n       The incoming Republican leadership should take immediate \n     steps to prevent the possible abuse of Ramspeck hiring. For \n     one, the future speaker, Newt Gingrich, and senate majority \n     leader, Bob Dole, should write immediately to each federal \n     department and agency head, advising them that come January \n     1995, appropriate oversight will be exercised to determine \n     whether (and the extent to which) Democrat congressional \n     staffers have merely relocated from the halls of Congress to \n     the bowels of the bureaucracy. The GOP leaders should also \n     consider legislation abolishing the Ramspect Act, which is \n     intended to protect congressional staffers at the taxpayer's \n     expense.\n       Make the former Hill staffers find real jobs in the private \n     sector. There's an added bonus here: If they ever come back \n     to government, they will be more sensitive to the needs of \n     working Americans.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the National Journal, March 1994]\n\n                              Ramspecked!\n\n                           (By Viveca Novak)\n\n       (The 1940 Ramspeck Act allows some congressional aides to \n     circumvent the traditional civil service hiring process and \n     secure immediate--and highly coveted--career status. But \n     critics say that ``Ramspecking'' is as good a symbol as any \n     of what's wrong with the labyrinthine federal personnel \n     system.)\n       Phyllis T. Thompson, known to most as Twinkle, got lots of \n     experience working on Interior Department issues on the \n     staffs of Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., and the Senate \n     Select Committee on Indian Affairs. In 1987, she was rewarded \n     with a political appointment to Interior's Bureau of Land \n     Management. But in December 1992, not long after Democrat \n     Bill Clinton was elected President, she jumped back to \n     Capitol Hill--oddly, to the staff of Sen. Steven D. Symms, R-\n     Idaho, who had not run for reelection and would be leaving \n     office on Jan. 3.\n       Thompson worked for Symms for 11 days. Then she suddenly \n     resurfaced at Interior, drawing an annual salary that's \n     somewhere from $69,000-$90,000 in a career civil service job \n     for which she was given preferential consideration.\n       Thompson was engaged in a neat bit of ``Ramspecking.'' The \n     bizarre-sounding maneuver is great for those who can use it, \n     but not so great for those who happen to believe in a purer \n     merit system or who get edged out of jobs or promotions by \n     Ramspeckers. Although Vice President Albert Gore Jr's \n     National Performance Review sparked some hope of sweeping \n     changes in the federal bureaucracy, sources who worked on the \n     ``reinventing government'' report said that Ramspecking and \n     other preferential hiring systems, which have drawn much \n     criticism over the years, are too hot to handle and probably \n     won't be taken on.\n       The 1940 Ramspeck Act, named for its chief House sponsor, \n     gives a leg up on executive branch jobs to congressional and \n     judicial branch employees with at least three years of total \n     service who are ``involuntarily separated'' from their jobs--\n     if their bosses die, retire or are defeated, for instance, or \n     if their jobs are restructured out of existence. They avoid \n     the regular competitive process and are given immediate--and \n     highly coveted--career status.\n       In short, its a perk.\n       Make no mistake about it: The Ramspeck Act, which results \n     in maybe 100 or so appointments a year, may seem like little \n     more than a speck in center of a federal work force that \n     includes about two million workers, not counting the U.S. \n     Postal Service.\n       ``When we're fighting about whether or not there are going \n     to be RIFs [reduction in force], whether or not there are \n     going to be buyouts,'' said Robert M. Tobias, the president \n     of the National Treasury Employees Union, ``this doesn't get \n     to the top of the list.''\n\n\n                           gaming the system\n\n       But in an environment in which the federal bureaucracy is \n     under intense scrutiny as part of a high-level effort to make \n     it more efficient and more responsive Ramspecking is as good \n     a symbol as any of what can be so disheartening about the \n     labyrinthine federal personnel system. Seemingly well \n     intentioned, the law can be used to good effect, according to \n     some who have had experience with it. But schemers have found \n     ways to game the system while staying within the letter of \n     the law. And even when it's used as directed, critics say, \n     it's circumvention of the traditional civil service hiring \n     process weakens the system and erodes morale. \n\n[[Page S10524]]\n\n       ``The Ramspeck Act is discriminatory,'' Fredric Newman, a \n     retired director of civilian personnel for the Army, said, \n     ``It contradicts the merit system, and I tried to avoid \n     applying it.''\n       Donald J. Devine, who headed the Office of Personnel \n     Management (OPM) from 1981-85, wrote a memo to Clinton after \n     the election in which he urged him, among other things, to \n     get rid of the Ramspeck Act. ``It's one of the innumerable \n     provisions undermining the merit principle.'' Devine said in \n     an interview. ``There's no real justification for it. It's \n     basically one of countless benefits of the legislative \n     branch.''\n       The 1992 election provided laboratory conditions for \n     observing the two principal species of Ramspeckers. First, \n     there was a change not only in Administration, but also in \n     party. Former Capitol Hill aides who'd gotten political jobs \n     in the Republican executive branch were looking for\n      life rafts in the career civil service--various ways to \n     burrow in. Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., sent the General \n     Accounting Office (GAO) a list of 150 names and 50 \n     department or agency reorganizations that his office had \n     received complaints about in this regard, some of them \n     involving Ramspecking. The GAO's final report is expected \n     out in a few weeks.\n       Second, 1992 brought the largest exodus of Members of \n     Congress since 1948, and attached to each lawmaker were \n     several aides who were faced with the prospect of finding new \n     employment. Morton Blackwell, a conservative activist, was \n     running seminars in House Annex I on how to Ramspeck. \n     ``Conservatives must match the Left's mastery of the Ramspeck \n     Act,'' he declared (although statistics don't indicate that \n     either party has a lock on this). ``Dedicated conservatives \n     now can use non-competitive routes to secure career \n     employment in the federal government. . . . In government, \n     personnel is policy.''\n       Without a presidential contest in the wings, Ramspecking of \n     the first type will be little practiced until 1996 or later. \n     But the 1992 election brought plenty of it, some of which \n     looked fishy under even a lenient threshold of acceptance \n     transition behavior.\n       OPM, investigating complaints about 14 Ramspeck \n     appointments at the Interior Department in 1992 and early \n     1993, found that seven political appointees had returned to \n     Congress for periods of only a few days to a few weeks. This \n     reestablished their Rampseck eligibility; the law doesn't \n     require an employee's three years of congressional service to \n     be continuous, but it does require that the Ramspeck transfer \n     take place within a year of leaving Capitol Hill. While such \n     brief appearances on the Hill between political and Ramspeck \n     jobs seem to be technically permissible, OPM report called \n     them cause for ``grave concern.'' The report went on to say \n     that ``it is difficult to conceive that the act was intended \n     as a means to convert political executive branch employees \n     into career civil servants.''\n       OPM zeroed in on two cases. One was that of Timothy \n     Glidden, who held a political appointment as legal counsel to \n     then-Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. Glidden, a former \n     congressional aide, quit his job at Interior shortly after \n     the election and went on the payroll of Rep. John J. Rhodes \n     III, R-Ariz., who'd just have been defeated. He worked there \n     from Dec. 1-8, earning all of $26.67. Then he returned to \n     Interior with a Ramspeck appointment as a program analyst in \n     the Office of American Indian Trust.\n       Some officials of the Interior Department apparently \n     weren't surprised. According to OPM, the job was created for \n     Glidden even before he left. (Glidden told OPM's \n     investigators that he was unaware of that.) The report \n     branded Rhodes' hiring of Glidden and Glidden's return to the \n     Interior Department ``a cynical manipulation of the Ramspeck \n     authority to achieve a preordained result, the placement of \n     [Glidden] in a position especially designed for him.''\n       OPM also assailed the recent career path of Hattie \n     Bickmore, who'd worked on Capitol Hill for eight years before \n     she accepted a political appointment in 1991 as a special \n     assistant in the Minerals Management Service. But she left \n     that position for a one-week job (Nov. 9-13) with the Senate \n     Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight of Government \n     Management, at the request of Sen. William S. Cohen of Maine, \n     its ranking Republican--a particularly ironic placement \n     because the committee sometimes investigates complaints about \n     Ramspeck abuses. On Nov. 16, she was appointed under Ramspeck \n     authority to a career\n      GM-15 position in Interior's Take Pride in America program.\n       Bickmore told OPM, among other things, that she wanted to \n     qualify for retirement benefits, for which she'd be eligible \n     in February 1994. And, she said. ``it's a known fact that \n     it's all right to go back [to the Hill] to get Rampseck \n     eligibility reestablished.''\n       But OMP found this case to be much like Gidden's: \n     Affidavits and other evidence indicated that a job was being \n     created for her to return to before she even left. ``No \n     reasonable person examining the total situation in these two \n     cases could conclude that these two appointments met either \n     the letter or the spirit of the Ramspeck Act.'' OMP said. \n     Besides having prearranged, custom-made jobs waiting for them \n     at Interior Glidden and Bickmore couldn't argue that their \n     departures from their short stays on the Hill were \n     involuntary.\n       OPM recommended that both Glidden and Bickmore be \n     terminated. Bickmore was fired, and lost her appeal to the \n     Merit System Protection Board on March 15 of this year. \n     Glidden departed as well. though it could not be ascertained \n     whether he retired or was fired.\n       OPM fond these two cases the most egregious because jobs \n     were created for them, said Michael D. Clogston, the \n     assistant director of its compliance and evaluation office. \n     ``But we found in a number of cases, people were going up [to \n     the Hill] for a quick cup of coffee, in effect.'' he said. \n     ``That conferred upon them eligibility to get a job in the \n     executive branch. And a lot of people are of a mind that if \n     you went up for quick cup of coffee, that in itself was \n     enough to violate the spirit of the law.''\n       The Rampseck process ``was started for these poor devils \n     who worked long years on the Hill and fond themselves out of \n     a job because their boss lost or died.'' Clogston added, ``In \n     the cases we looked at, none of them fit those \n     circumstances.''\n\n\n                          the silver parachute\n\n       Most who use the Rampspeck privilege come straight from the \n     Hill after the lawmaker they've worked for leaves Congress. \n     That was the intent behind the law. Its legislative history \n     indicates that Members wanted to provide something for the \n     loyal aides, who had little job security and could, through \n     no fault of their own, be out of work overnight. Because\n      they usually had some expertise to offer, the reasoning \n     went, why not allow them to put it to use in another \n     branch of government?\n       There was also a strong ``me too'' motivation. ``If there \n     is justification for `blanketing' into permanent civil \n     service positions many thousands of persons, there is \n     certainly justification for granting this opportunity to \n     employees of the legislative branch,'' said the conference \n     committee's report from 1940, which also noted that a similar \n     provision was available to White House employees.\n       ``On Capitol Hill, you've got these people who are \n     professionals and have no civil service protection--people \n     who have put in years of service, who have some \n     qualifications and know their areas,'' said Edward J. \n     Gleiman, the chairman of the Postal Rate Commission and a \n     former staff director of the Senate Governmental Affairs \n     Subcommittee on Federal Services, Post Office and Civil \n     Service, which Pryor chairs.\n       Said a former Senate administrative assistant in recounting \n     the vagaries of life on Capitol Hill, ``John Heinz's staff \n     goes out to lunch and comes back and they're out of a job.'' \n     Heinz, a Republican Senator from Pennsylvania, was killed in \n     an airplane crash in 1991.\n       And some who are on the hiring end of things, in federal \n     departments and agencies, say that Ramspecking offers other \n     advantages. ``Generally, I think it's probably a useful \n     thing,'' said Thomas S. McFee, the assistant Health and Human \n     Services (HHS) secretary for personnel. ``These people have \n     had unusual experience and can make a valuable \n     contribution.'' Ramspecking cuts time-consuming red tape that \n     would otherwise mean advertising a position, ranking and \n     evaluating applicants and so forth. McFee pointed out--and \n     Ramspeck candidates must qualify for the positions they take.\n       According to a survey by National Journal, HHS had by far \n     the largest number of Ramspeck hires--17--of all federal \n     departments and agencies in the 13-month period beginning in \n     December 1992; Interior had 9 and the Agriculture and \n     Veterans Affairs Departments each had 8. Over all, at least \n     80 workers were hired as Ramspeck appointments in that period \n     (several agencies didn't respond).\n       Some congressional offices were especially adept at \n     Ramspecking. Former Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., for \n     example, sent three aides to dry land that way after he lost \n     in 1992. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee--\n     after its chairman, Quentin N. Burdick, D-N.D., died--managed \n     to Ramspeck four of Burdick's people. When the House Select \n     Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control went out of business \n     early last year, two of its employees were Ramspecked into \n     HHS. Former Rep. Mike Espy, D-Miss., took some aides with him \n     as political appointments when he became Agriculture \n     Secretary; he took three more under the Ramspeck Act.\n       For all its seeming humanitarian utility, however, the \n     Ramspeck Act seems to have more critics than it does fans or \n     neutral observers.\n       ``If you believe in separation of powers, why give \n     preference to legislative branch employees?'' a federal \n     personnel expert asked. ``This is a special privilege that \n     ought to be examined. If we're truly to have an apolitical \n     civil service, these kinds of things shouldn't go on. They \n     denigrate the underlying principles of an open and \n     competitive civil service.''\n       Ramspecking is sometimes used as a kind of political \n     appointment, but with indefinite security. Applications for \n     jobs with Ramspeck certifications attached were a common \n     sight in the White House personnel office in the early days \n     of the Clinton Administration.\n       ``I would argue that it's really not necessary,'' said Mark \n     Abramson, the president of the Council for Excellence in \n     Government, a not-for-profit organization of former public \n     officials. ``The political people can get political \n     appointments at any time through Schedule C or non-career SES \n     [Senior Executive Service]. I just don't see any reason to \n     give special treatment to congressional staff \n\n[[Page S10525]]\n     members, I think it's outlived its usefulness, if there ever was one. \n     There's political appointments and then there's the career \n     process.''\n       And clearly, congressional offices can manipulate the \n     process. One gambit plays off the fact that employees are \n     eligible for Ramspecking not only if the Member they work for \n     leaves Congress, but if their office goes through a \n     restructuring that leaves them out of work.\n       ``If [a staff member] is interested in a civil service job, \n     congressional offices will go through the motions of \n     restructuring and certify them for Ramspeck,'' the staff \n     director of a Senate office said. ``If [it] doesn't hurt \n     anything, we will try to do it for them. Of course, we don't \n     say we did it at their request.''\n       Offices also ``sometimes say they've restructured and they \n     haven't,'' one aide added. ``The way I look at it is, the \n     quality of life here is pretty low. It's long hours and low \n     pay, and for people with a family,\n      it's hell. If there are small ways we can bend the rules to \n     make things easier, we do it.''\n       Making things easier for a congressional aide, however, \n     doesn't necessarily make things easier for those on the other \n     end of the process.\n       ``They come in with the support of a Congressman or a \n     Senator, and you're told as a manager that this person is \n     coming in at a given level,'' said a former agency manager \n     who now works for the White House. ``There are sometimes \n     complaints filed by other employees, but the grievances don't \n     hold up because it's legal.''\n       A supervisor's resentment over being forced to hire someone \n     rarely has happy consequences. Stephen Hoddap, a staff member \n     of the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee for three \n     years and a 17-year veteran of the National Park Service \n     before that, wanted to Ramspeck back to the Park Service \n     after his boss, Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino, R-Calif., was \n     defeated in 1992. He became the assistant superintendent of \n     Shenandoah National Park over the objections of the \n     superintendent, who was told to hire him by higher-ups. \n     According to Hoddap, when he arrived, all his duties were \n     taken away and he had nothing to do. ``I had no job,'' Hoddap \n     said. He left after two months, returning to his old position \n     on the Hill but this time attached to Rep. Don Young, R-\n     Alaska.''\n       For career civil servants who are hoping to advance, \n     Ramspeck and other preferential appointments, which are often \n     at the highest levels, can ``shoot morale right to the \n     bottom,'' said a former employee of the Small Business \n     Administration, who saw such appointments bottle up the \n     promotion hopes of career civil servants in his office. ``It \n     affects quality of work, motivation and incentive to \n     achieve.''\n       Ramspeck isn't the only preferential hiring loophole in the \n     federal personnel system. There are, for instance, a veterans \n     preference, a preference for those who have served in the \n     Peace Corps, a measure that in some cases gives priority to \n     Native Americans--even a preference for people who have \n     worked in the Panama Canal system. The huge number of special \n     hiring authorities and arrangements makes it clear that \n     merit--supposedly the backbone of federal personnel policy--\n     is far from the only yardstick used in sizing up candidates.\n       ``The general concept of having a congressional person go \n     to the head of the class is hard to justify in a merit \n     system,'' the staff director of a Senate committee said. \n     ``But the precedent has been set: the merit system has been \n     encroached on in other ways. Veterans get preference, I can't \n     justify that, either. We're talking about characteristics \n     that have nothing whatever to do with the ability to do the \n     job.''\n       ``The merit system is very disjointed, and the definition \n     of merit is something that truly needs to be reexamined.'' \n     Patricia W. Ingraham, a professor of public administration at \n     Syracuse University's Maxwell Graduate School of Citizenship \n     and Public Affairs, said, ``It's a word that in many ways has \n     lost its meaning.''\n       The multiple layers and tangled strands of the federal \n     personnel system were spotlighted by the National Performance \n     Review's report last fall: The 850 pages of federal personnel \n     laws, 13,000 pages of OPM regulations and 10,000\n      pages of the Federal Personnel Manual don't make for \n     efficient and productive government, Gore declared. And \n     there's been some progress. Recently the manual was \n     slashed to 1,000 pages. Federal departments and agencies \n     are supposed to be developing their own hiring guidelines.\n       But doing away with or reforming Ramspeck and its brethren \n     would require legislation, and no one expects the Clinton \n     Administration, for all its reinvention efforts, to tackle \n     preferential hiring systems head-on. ``There was an early \n     look at this,'' a participant in the National Performance \n     Review said. ``The decision was made not to tackle it. It was \n     a strategic decision; we could have lost the whole ball of \n     wax. Why throw up red herrings that would have Congress \n     pissed off at us?''\n       The constituency for Ramspeck, after all, is Congress \n     itself.\n       ``People are staying so far away from this, ``a top aide to \n     a congressional committee that deals with personnel matters \n     said. ``You have some trying to eliminate it, others saying \n     it serves a legitimate purpose. But the debate would be \n     around this being a perk for congressional staff, and I for \n     one would not relish that in the current atmosphere'' in \n     Washington.\n       Some would simply argue for better policing of the Ramspeck \n     Act to prevent abuses. Currently there's no central oversight \n     of Ramspeck appointments, something the GAO may recommend in \n     its forthcoming report. OPM's review of Glidden's case and a \n     few others covered only the Interior Department and was \n     prompted by a large number of complaints and by requests from \n     a Senate committee: it is the only such review that OPM has \n     ever done, and the agency has no authority or plans to \n     routinely examine Ramspeck placements.\n       Meanwhile, this year is shaping up as one that will bring \n     turnover on Capitol Hill rivaling that of 1992. As lawmakers \n     retire, run for other office or take their hits at the polls, \n     their staffs will be looking for someplace nice and safe to \n     land--someplace like the civil service. Look for plenty of \n     Ramspeck appointments to wash into the executive branch, \n     triggering the usual complaints from career civil servants--\n     particularly because, as the federal work force, and \n     especially midlevel management, is downsized, there will be \n     more competition than ever for a limited pool of jobs.\n       Potential Ramspeckers, start your engines. Demand for \n     Ramspeck certification forms is starting to pick up again at \n     the House Clerk's Office, according to records coordinator \n     Robert Duncan. It's a handy bit of paper to have in your hip \n     pocket come election time.\n                          A LAWMAKER'S LAMENT\n\n       What a legacy. Imagine if, after years of public service, \n     many people mentioned your name only in connection with an \n     employment perk for congressional staff, if they mentioned it \n     at all. In this case, even those who know the ins and outs of \n     the Ramspeck process have no idea who the man was; his name \n     has become a verb.\n       Georgia Democrat Robert Ramspeck served in the House from \n     1929-45, a portion of which time he chaired the Civil Service \n     Committee; during his last two years, he was Democratic whip. \n     In the 1950s, he chaired the Civil Service Commission \n     (subsequently absorbed into the Office of Personnel \n     Management and the Merit Systems Protection Board).\n       Ramspeck seemed to be acting in the interests of long-\n     suffering congressional aides when he introduced legislation \n     to give them an edge in getting into more-secure government \n     jobs if they were thrown out of work on Capitol Hill.\n       Making a living was a subject near and dear to Ramspeck's \n     heart. His colleagues reportedly were surprised when Ramspeck \n     resigned from Congress at the end of 1945 to take a job as a \n     lobbyist (yes, it was ever thus) with the Air Transport \n     Association. In March of the following year, his byline \n     appeared under the headline ``I Couldn't Afford to Be a \n     Congressman'' in a first-person piece for Collier's magazine. \n     Ramspeck wrote that on a Member's $10,000-a-year salary, he \n     could ``barely skin by,'' especially because at that time \n     lawmakers financed their own reelection campaigns and there \n     was no provision for retirement pay. Ramspeck proposed a \n     retirement system for Members similar to one that executive \n     branch employees had. It passed, but ``editorials denounced \n     us as moochers, as hogs in the public trough . . . the entire \n     Congress was besmeared,'' Ramspeck wrote, and the law was \n     rescinded. Congress eventually got its own retirement system.\n       Ramspeck, incidentally, had other complaints about Congress \n     that seem eerily familiar nearly 50 years later. Among them: \n     ``I have known of some cases of scared voting by good men who \n     could foresee nothing but disaster for themselves if they \n     antagonized certain groups.''\n       Ramspeck died in 1972.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the National Journal, April 1995]\n\n                       A Safe Haven for Ex-Aides?\n\n                          (By Michael Crowley)\n\n       The 1940 Ramspeck Act, designed to help congressional \n     employees who become unemployed ``involuntarily through \n     circumstances beyond their control'' find federal \n     jobs, has been put to good use since the November elections. \n     Now it's being put under the microscope.\n       Suspecting that use of the act would surge after the \n     election left hundreds of Democratic aides jobless, Senate \n     Governmental Affairs Committee chairman William V. Roth Jr., \n     R-Del., asked the General Accounting Office (GAO) in November \n     to tally Ramspeck appointments.\n       The GAO did, and found a 500 per cent increase in the over-\n     all-rate of executive branch appointments since November, as \n     compared with the first 11 months of 1994. The 74 Ramspeck \n     Act appointments since November are already more than triple \n     the 21 in the first 11 months of last year.\n       Roth, who says that he is ``shocked'' at this apparent \n     inconsistence with attempts to downsize the federal \n     government, has asked for more GAO reports, although he plans \n     no further action at this time.\n       Even before the elections, congressional aides had their \n     eyes on Ramspeck opportunities. Last fall, the House \n     Administrative Assistants Alumni Association, a group that \n     helps former congressional staff members find new employment, \n     held a seminar offering tips on finding Ramspeck jobs.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I hope that my colleague from Mississippi \nand my colleague from Michigan, if they \n\n[[Page S10526]]\nagree with this amendment, would also be amenable to adding this \namendment, if there is a compromise, which I believe there will be, to \neither the gift ban or the lobbying ban or the combination of the two. \nI would appreciate their consideration on that.\n  Mr. President, I will not ask for the yeas and nays because I have \nsome anticipation that this amendment may be agreed to by both sides, \nalthough Senator Glenn, who has worked on this issue extensively, would \nprobably want to be involved in the consideration of this amendment.\n  Also, Mr. President, let me mention that there was a hearing held, \nthanks to the distinguished Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, in \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee. I do not think there was any doubt \nthat the testimony presented in that hearing was clear that this law \nlong ago outlived its usefulness, if it ever had any.\n  So I want to thank the Senator from Mississippi for supporting this \namendment. I hope that the Senator from Michigan can. And although we \ncould bring this legislation freestanding, I think it might be \nappropriate as an amendment on this bill since this legislation is an \nattempt to do away with some practices to which the American people \nobject.\n  Again, I want to congratulate the Senator from Mississippi, the \nSenator from Kentucky, and the Senator from Michigan, as well as \nSenators Feingold and Wellstone. I hope we can reach an agreement on \nthis gift ban issue. I do not think it reflects great credit on this \nbody when we seem to be arguing over whether $20 or $50 is an \nappropriate amount of money to purchase a vote of a Member of Congress. \nI hope that we can reach some level of accommodation and comity so that \nwe reflect well on this body and the Congress as a whole.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me be brief, while the Senator from \nArizona is on the floor. I am not as familiar with the amendment as \nothers on the Governmental Affairs Committee, so I cannot comment at \nany length on this point.\n  I just have one question I would like to ask the Senator from \nArizona, however, and that is, I believe Senator Stevens has suggested \nsome language which had been added to one version of the amendment \nwhich would have allowed, I believe, the past experience of the \nlegislative staff to be considered at the time of the appointment. I am \nnot familiar with the language, but I am wondering, I gather that \nlanguage is not part of the Senator's amendment. We are trying to get \nhold of Senator Stevens relative to that language. I understand Senator \nPryor has not yet arrived at the Capitol. I know that he had an \ninterest in this legislation as well. I do not know what his position \nis relative to the amendment, however, and I do not want to suggest \nthat he opposes it. He might not. I just do not know. He is en route to \nWashington from Arkansas.\n  I just make those two comments for the information of my friend. \nParticularly I do want to alert him to the fact that I understand \nSenator Stevens did have language which was added at one point which \nwas not in this form. We are trying to alert Senator Stevens so he will \nbe aware of it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COHEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I would like to offer a few comments this \nmorning in support of the legislation dealing with lobby disclosure and \ngifts for Members of Congress.\n  I think it is clear that the level of cynicism and disillusionment of \nthe American people about the performance of Government and the \nintegrity of public officials has reached rather historic heights. I \nthink what helps fuel that sense of outrage is the public sense that \nthe system is not serving the public good but instead is being \nmanipulated by so-called special interests that serve their own ends. I \nwould like to take a few moments to talk about the special interests \nand this anti-Government feeling that is so pervasive throughout the \ncountry.\n  It seems to me that the word ``politician'' over the years has always \nbeen taken in a negative fashion. We hear radio commentators, for \nexample, talk about ``the politicians.'' It is not said in a \ncomplimentary sense but rather a negative one. I have always preferred \nto use the phrase ``public official'' or ``public servant,'' because I \nthink that is basically what we are sent here to be, and that is to \nserve the public's interest. Again, the word ``politician'' has that \nnegative connotation or spin, and I suspect the words ``lobbyist'' and \n``special interest'' fall in the same category.\n  Everyone who serves in the House and Senate understands that we are \nnot specialists. We are great generalists. Perhaps in our past lives as \nprivate citizens, we had some degree of specialty. Mine was as a trial \nattorney. I tended to specialize in certain fields within that practice \nof trial work.\n  Coming to Congress, I no longer was able to specialize by virtue of \nthe fact that I had to have a much broader view of things. I had to try \nto make myself as knowledgeable as possible in a great variety of \nareas.\n  So I became, like most of us here, a generalist. Of course, we are \nall familiar with the expression that a generalist is someone who reads \nless and less about more and more until he knows absolutely nothing \nabout everything. I do not think we all fall in that category but, \nnonetheless, we often have to float along the top of issues by virtue \nof the very volume of issues we are required to confront. So when we \nhire people to work for us, our staff members, we try to hire the best \nand brightest to make sure that they are well informed on the issues \nthat we are going to confront during the course of a legislative \nsession.\n  Lobbyists also play a very important role in our system. They are not \nto be derided or denigrated or criticized or condemned. They, in fact, \nare hired as experts to represent the people who, indeed, have special \ninterests that come before the Congress. The notion somehow that \nspecial interests are antidemocratic could not be more wrong. Indeed, \nour Founding Fathers determined that our country was comprised of \nspecial interests. Virtually everybody in the country has a special \ninterest.\n  If you are talking about farmers who want subsidies or other \nGovernment programs to assist them in the production of their products, \nthey are clearly a special interest. If you talk about homeowners who \nwish to have a tax deduction for interest payments on their mortgage, \nthat clearly is a special interest. It is a policy we have adopted to \nencourage people to become homeowners but, again, it is a special \ninterest. We have business men and women who would like to have \naccelerated depreciation schedules so that they can continue to \nmodernize their businesses. That is a special interest. You can go to \nany facet of our society, and virtually everyone has a special interest \nin Government policies.\n  Perhaps one of the clearest examples of this came about many years \nago when I was flying on Delta Air Lines from Bangor to Washington. As \nI boarded the plane, a flight attendant stopped me, and she said, ``Are \nyou bothered by all of those lobbyists down in Washington every day?'' \nI could see by her facial expression that she, in using the term \n``lobbyist,'' saw them as some sort of evil affliction upon our system.\n  I said, ``Frankly, I am never bothered by a lobbyist in Washington.''\n   The only people who lobby me intensely are flight attendants who \ninsist that I preserve their tax-free travel status. There was a \nmeasure under consideration by the Senate Finance Committee some years \nago to tax so-called fringe benefits. Many flight attendants, instead \nof receiving direct compensation, get free travel benefits for \nthemselves and their spouses. Congress was considering taxing those \nbenefits as income. So every time I got on the plane, guess what \nhappened? I was lobbied by the flight attendants, saying, ``Please do \nnot touch our tax-free travel benefits.''\n\n  A point I was trying to make to the flight attendant was that she, in \nfact, was a lobbyist. She was lobbying me, as were her colleagues, on \neach and every occasion I got on a plane. It was another case of \nlobbying on behalf of a particular special interest. \n\n[[Page S10527]]\n\n  So we have this notion that somehow lobbyists are an evil upon the \nsystem--that is wrong--and that special interests are somehow also \nsomething to be condemned, when, in fact, they are an inherent part of \nour system. People organize along the lines of their special interests. \nWe can see many people here in the galleries today, visitors to \nWashington. They may be on school vacations or family vacations. They \ncome to the Senate and to the House to sit in the galleries to look \nupon the system at work. For the most part, they cannot take the time \nout of their daily lives--and they probably cannot afford it--to be \nlobbying Members of Congress on a regular basis. But they may have a \nvery special interest. They may have a very special interest in \nlegislation that will have a major impact upon their businesses, upon \ntheir professions, upon their lives. And so what many are forced to do, \nby circumstances, is to hire an expert, hire a trade association, or \nhire a law firm that has developed expertise over the years to better \narticulate their viewpoints and to bring their views to the attention \nof the legislators who are elected to represent them. That is all part \nof our system. That is exactly what the democratic system is all about.\n  The difficulty, of course, comes when there is a misperception that \nit is the special interests who hire the lobbyists who are gaining \naccess and unfair advantage over the general commonweal, the general \npublic good. That is where the cynicism starts to set in when there is \na perception that just a few key people are being paid very high \ndollars in order to shape and influence and alter public policy in ways \nthat are very damaging to the overall good of the country.\n  That, Mr. President, is why we are here today to talk about lobbying \ndisclosure, because the current system is simply a sham. It does not \nwork. The laws are confusing, vague, overlapping, and duplicative. They \nrequire some to register--not many. Those who do register file \ninformation which is virtually meaningless. And so the cynicism starts \nto set in once again.\n  We can recall that during the last Presidential campaign, when Ross \nPerot started to call the attention of the American people to those \nhigh-priced lobbyists and special interests in Washington controlling \nthe destiny of the American people, he struck a cord, a deep cord of \npublic approval. What we need to do is to reform the system in a way \nthat provides uniformity, that provides simplicity, and that provides \nclarity. Those are the goals that Senator Levin and I have been \nstriving to achieve for several years now.\n  Frankly, we found during the course of the hearings on this \nlegislation that there was not great disagreement from the lobbying \ncommunity itself. They were, in fact, eager to have some piece of \nlegislation, comprehensive in nature, that would lay out with clarity \nexactly what are their responsibilities. So we tried to address the \nissue of who is required to register? Who is being paid to lobby? How \nmuch is that person or organization or firm or association being paid \nto lobby? And to lobby on what?\n  So basically, who is being paid how much to lobby on what? Those were \nthe essential ingredients of the legislation we have proposed in past \nsessions. Regrettably, there was a good deal of misunderstanding in the \nfinal days of the last session that delayed action on the bill. I \nbelieve this is an issue that cannot continue to be delayed without \ncontributing to this deep sense of cynicism that continues to exist \namong the American people.\n  It is my hope that as we discuss this today, and focus, also, on the \nissue of gifts, we can reach agreement. I might say that few of us \nbelieve that any Member of this body or the other body is going to be \ncorrupted by a steak dinner or a pocketknife or some other token that \ncomes through a Member's office during the course of a year. \nNonetheless, it is an issue that we have to address.\n  I think Senator McCain struck precisely the right note when he said \nwe should not be arguing whether the gift limit should be $20, $50, or \n$100. The issue is whether there should be any at all. Should we try to \nremove the seeds of discontent, even though we feel that it has been \nperhaps mischaracterized, that it is a false perception? Nonetheless, \nit is a deeply held perception, so we ought to remove it.\n  Mr. President, Senator Levin and I have proposed an amendment to the \nlobby disclosure bill which is designed to meet the objections of our \ncolleagues. We think that it fairly does that. First, as Senator Levin \nalready indicated, the grassroots lobbying provisions that were \nincluded in last year's conference report that caused such controversy \nare no longer included in this bill. They are excluded. The pending \namendment would go even further to the extent there is any uncertainty \non this point. It provides additional clarification that the bill does \nnot apply to grassroots lobbying or other communications made by \nvolunteers to express their own views.\n  The amendment also doubles the thresholds when individuals or \norganizations are required to register as lobbyists. It eliminates the \nprovisions that would establish a new agency to administer and enforce \nthe law. It maintains the current system of having reports filed with \nthe Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House.\n  I understand the concern on the part of our colleagues, who say, \n``Here they go again, another new layer of bureaucracy. Here is a brand \nnew agency that is going to be created with all the attendant levels of \nbureaucratic delay and redundancy.'' I think there was a measure of \nmerit to the concern. Our problem was that we did not know where to put \nthe repository for the reports. We have agreed, however, that we do not \nwant to complicate this matter and create another bureaucratic layer of \nduplication for the people who have to file. So we have agreed to \neliminate that provision.\n  Finally, the amendment would strike the enforcement provisions and, \ninstead, provide the Secretary or the Clerk to notify lobbyists who may \nbe in violation, and refer possible violations to the appropriate U.S. \nattorney if no corrective action is taken.\n  We have tried to accommodate our colleagues' concern that this is \nsomehow going to turn into a witch hunt of lobbyists who might have \nmade innocent mistakes. That is not our intent at all. I have tried to \nindicate by my own comments that I believe lobbyists provide a valuable \ncontribution to the legislative process. We, frankly, cannot function \neffectively without having lobbyists who represent ``special \ninterests,'' who are in fact the American people. We need their \nexpertise to be brought to our staffs and to us, and to weigh their \nviews. That really is what we are elected to do--to weigh the relative \nmerits of the case made by those advocates who are hired by the \nAmerican people to come to us to urge a particular position.\n  As long as a system is open to everybody, the American people will \nbenefit. The danger is when there is a perception that only a few big \nlobbyists are getting through, only a few big special interests are \ngetting through, only the ones who can afford to hire the high-priced \nindividual can get through. That is where the cynicism comes in, and \nthat is what we have to do our level best to seek to eradicate.\n  We want to make sure that the public is fully aware of who is being \nhired, by whom, how much they are being paid, and to do what. As long \nas there is full disclosure of those activities, then at least there is \nhope that we can reduce that level of distrust, that level of \nalienation, that level of cynicism.\n  Mr. President, I hope as we move through the afternoon's debate that \nwe can arrive at an understanding or accommodation. We have tried to \ntake into account our colleagues' concerns. We believe that we have \nmoved substantially in that direction, to remove any doubts about what \nthe goal ought to be.\n  I think the goal is shared by all--simplification, uniformity, and \nclarity. Those are the goals that Senator Levin and I seek to achieve, \nand I believe with a measure of good will demonstrated throughout the \nday we can arrive at a consensus where there will be virtually \nunanimous consent for the legislation that will emerge. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me first thank my friend from Maine for \nthe continuing contributions which he has made to political reform. \n\n[[Page S10528]]\n\n  This bill before the Senate on lobby disclosure is one of three \npillars of reform. He has been steadfast in his support of lobby \ndisclosure reform. Whether I have chaired the subcommittee or he has \nchaired the subcommittee, we have worked together on this through a \nnumber of Congresses.\n  Hopefully, we will be able to pass a strong bill today to put an end \nto a situation which breeds total disrespect for law. We have a number \nof laws on the books that purportedly require lobbyists to register and \ndisclose but are both a sham and in a shambles--and have been that way \nfor decades.\n  Hopefully, we will not only pass a strong bill here today on lobby \ndisclosure and lobby reform, but we can at long last get a bill that \npasses the House, gets through a conference, and gets adopted by both \nHouses in exactly the same form. When that happens, I am sure we will \nbe celebrating together just as we have worked so hard together through \nthis past decade and a half on this and so many other subjects. I want \nto thank him for his leadership in this area.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be relatively brief. First, I \nthank Senators Levin and Cohen for their very fine work, and I am very \npleased to be an original cosponsor. As all of my colleagues know, we \nhave taken up lobbying reform first and then later we will take up the \ngift ban legislation.\n  I think both Senators make a compelling case. We really have not made \nany changes since the late 1940's--I think, since 1948. The point is, \nfor those that are paid to lobby, whether lobbying legislators or \nmembers of the executive branch, this is part of the way in which we \nconduct politics in Washington, DC. People in the country have a right \nto know who is being paid to lobby and have a right to have some \nunderstanding--or a clearer understanding, let me say--of the kind of \nscope of those activities. I think that is what we are trying to do in \nthis lobbying reform effort.\n  Mr. President, again, I think this goes to the heart of \naccountability. I think it goes to the best of good government. I \ncertainly hope that this very important lobbying reform effort will \nbear fruit and we will pass a reform measure.\n  Senator Cohen said it well as I was coming in. I believe what I heard \nhim say, that it was absolutely nothing to do with the denigration of \nthe work of any particular lobbyist, that is not it at all. It has much \nmore to do, again, with just making sure that it is a political process \nthat is open and accountable. That is the issue.\n  I commend both Senators for their very fine work, and say that I am \nvery proud to be a part of this. It is also true, Mr. President, and I \nwant to be clear, we will take up gift ban later on. That is not what \nis on the floor right now.\n  We have two different amendments--two different initiatives--that we \nwill be dealing with separately. I do think, however, there is an \nimportant connection, namely, as we move forward and pass--and I \nbelieve we will, I believe we must--a comprehensive gift ban reform and \nas we put some restrictions on this. It is very important. Obviously, \nif we are going to have some very clear restrictions about what \nlobbyists can give, then it will not work if only a small fraction of \nthose who are actually paid to lobby are ever really listed, or if we \ndo not have a clear idea as to who the people are who are getting paid \nto lobby, or we have no clear idea of what their scope of activities \nare. Those measures, in a policy sense, are very closely related.\n  Mr. President, the last point--and let me again point out for \ncolleagues that gift ban is later; right now it is lobbying reform. One \nmore time, in 1994, 88 current Senators, 85 veteran Senators and 3 of \nthe 6 freshman Senators who served in the House of Representatives in \n1994 voted in favor of the comprehensive gift ban bill which we will \nhave on the floor tonight or tomorrow. I just would say to those \nSenators that I think there was a reason for that kind of broad-based \nsupport. I hope people will not retreat from that or essentially change \ntheir positions or flip-flop, or whatever characterization can be used.\n  Mr. President, this is an issue that people in the country feel very \nstrongly about. I think it goes beyond just the gift ban reform. I \nthink it has more to do with the very strong sense that people have \nabout politics in Washington.\n  The Senator from Kentucky and I have many disagreements in these \ndifferent areas, but I personally think--and I apologize to the Senator \nif I am being presumptuous--but I personally believe there is one very \nstrong area of agreement, which is that neither Senator would be in \npublic service if we did not believe in our work. I reject the across-\nthe-board bashing and denigration of public service, whether it is \nDemocrats or Republicans or Independents. I think it takes us nowhere \ngood as a nation.\n  My very strong feeling about this is that the sooner we move forward \nand pass what I think would really be some strong reform measures, \ncredible reform measures, that changes some of the political culture in \nthe Nation's Capital, the better off all will be. We need to let go of \nit. I think people want us to let go of it. I think we have at the \nmoment, whether tonight or tomorrow or whenever we get to gift ban, \nsome very major differences.\n  I say to my colleague later, when we get a chance to debate this, \nbecause I do not want to move in on the lobbying reform time, but I \nthink that at the moment, at least, the Republican proposal has just \nsome gigantic loopholes, large enough for a truck to drive through.\n  Later on tonight, not now, Mr. President, I will include an editorial \nfrom the New York Times on Saturday called ``Republican Gift Fraud.'' \nFrankly, before it is all over, I think we can pass a strong \ncomprehensive gift ban legislation.\n  To give but one example, if we essentially say any gift under $100 is \nfine, lobbyists or others, and it does not aggregate, in theory, every \nday of the week someone can be taking Members out or paying for a \nticket to an Orioles game or whatever. This is where there is agreement \nand disagreement.\n  On the agreement part, I do not actually think that Senators ``are \nfor sale.'' I do not look at any of this as sort of representing the \nwrongdoing of individual officerholders.\n I just do not believe that is what it is about. But at a systemic \nlevel, I must say that what people of Minnesota say to me is, ``Look, \nSenator, people do not come up and ask to take us out to dinner.''\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Does the Senator from Kentucky have a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I want to commend the Senator for his observation, \nbecause I do think there is a lot of rhetoric about people selling \ninfluence for lunch. I appreciate the observations of the Senator from \nMinnesota that is clearly not the case.\n  I also think that the only thing I agree with my friend from \nMinnesota about is, I think, on the gift issue, it is time to get it \nover with one way or the other. I think it is time to make a decision. \nI think we will have a good debate about what is appropriate; hopefully \nin restrained tones, without a lot of implications that things are \ngoing on that are clearly not going on.\n  So I commend the Senator from Minnesota for his observation that any \nsuch suggestions that Members of the Senate are selling influence for \nlunch are absurd. And I hope we can have a high-level, appropriate \ndebate on this issue. Second, I agree with the Senator from Minnesota, \nI think it is time to wrap it up on the gift rule and, hopefully, we \nwill be able to do that later tonight or first thing in the morning.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky \nagain. I said to my colleague from Michigan I did not want, now, to \nmake gift ban the focus. We are now on lobbying reform. Of course the \ndisagreement the Senator from Kentucky and I have, and I think also \nwith the Senator from Michigan and others, that while I do not think \nthe issue was the wrongdoing of an individual officeholder, that was my \nposition--while I reject the denigration and the bashing of public \nservice and people who are in public service because I am very proud \nthe Minnesotans have given me this opportunity to be a Senator--on the \nother hand, I think as I started to say, when people in Minnesota come \nup to me--you may have had the same thing happen to you, Mr. \nPresident--what people say is, ``Look, Senator, in all due respect, \npeople do not offer to take us \n\n[[Page S10529]]\nout. Lobbyists are not asking us to go out to dinner. They are not \nalways contributing tickets for games, they are not paying for us to go \nto various events in the country, for our travel for ourselves or our \nspouses. And we do not think it is appropriate that you take those \ngifts either. Because whether or not this leads to undue influence, it \ncertainly seems that way to us.''\n  I must say that it does become a part of the pattern of influence in \nWashington. It does become a part of the political culture in this \ncity. And that is what makes it so profoundly wrong.\n  So, while I am not here to bash individual Senators or \nRepresentatives, or point the finger and say that somebody sold out for \na particular lunch, I would say in the aggregate this is the way in \nwhich business is now conducted that does lead to a situation where too \nfew people have way too much access and way too much say. And too many \npeople, too many of the people we represent, are left out of the loop. \nThat is why I think this will be such a fundamental debate later on.\n  Mr. President, we may get to it tonight or we may get to it tomorrow. \nI think we ought to be voting one way or another and we ought to be \nheld accountable.\n  Again, I say to all of my colleagues, last year, 85 Senators and 3 of \nthe 6 freshman Senators who served in the House, voted for this measure \nthat Senator Levin, myself, Senator Feingold, Senator Lautenberg, \nSenator McCain and others have worked on. So I do not see why in the \nworld now, especially when everybody has been talking about reform, \nthere would be a retreat from this.\n  The majority leader himself, I think, last October 15 came out on the \nfloor and said: No lobbyist lunches, no entertainment, no travel, no \ncontributions to legal defense, no fruit baskets, no nothing. It could \nnot be clearer. We will get to that later on.\n  At the moment, I say to colleagues, I hope there will be a coming \ntogether over the next couple of days. First, we will pass a good, \nstrong, lobbying reform effort. This is very significant, what Senator \nLevin and Cohen have been working on. This goes to the heart of a \nreally important reform issue that, by the way, people in the country \ncare fiercely about.\n  It is not true that people in the country are not focused on good \nGovernment, are not focused on making Government more open and more \naccountable. This goes to the heart of that. So I think it is \nimperative that we come together and pass a strong reform effort in the \nlobbying reform area.\n  The same thing could be said for the gift ban, Mr. President. The \nsame thing can be said for the gift ban. For my own part, I would like \nnothing better than to see Senators on both sides of the aisle come \ntogether and support two major reform initiatives in these two decisive \nareas, lobbying reform and gift ban.\n  On the other hand, when it comes to gift ban, given what I have seen \non the Republican side so far, I do not view that as a step forward. I \nview it as a great leap sideways or backwards. If that is the case, \nthen we will have a major, major debate and then all of us will be held \naccountable. But I say to colleagues: People in the country are serious \nabout this. I think we can come through for people.\n  If we do, I think it will be good for the Senate. I think it will be \ngood for the political process, the legislative process, in the \nfuture--in the distant future when many of us are no longer serving \nhere. I think we can feel like we made a huge difference. And I \ncertainly think it will go a significant ways toward restoring some \nconfidence that I think people yearn to have in our political process.\n  The missing piece is the campaign finance reform piece which I also \nhope we will take up later.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first let me thank our colleague from \nMinnesota for the tremendous energy and leadership which he has \ndisplayed in a whole host of reform efforts; first, on the gift ban, \nbut also very actively involved in lobbying disclosure reform as well, \nand campaign finance reform. Those three reforms are the three most \ncritical reforms that we need around this place if we are going to \nrestore public confidence in Government. It is at a low point. It is \ntragic when that occurs. When public cynicism runs deep about a \ndemocratic Government, Government has to act to restore that public \nconfidence. That is what we are in the midst of doing.\n  That famous handshake between the President and the Speaker of the \nHouse in New Hampshire was over that issue, reform. They spoke about a \nlot of other issues. They spoke about welfare reform and they spoke \nabout a whole host of issues at that meeting with seniors. They talked \nabout Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security. But when it came down \nto a handshake, where they reached to each other and said we have a \ndeal, what that deal related to was political reform.\n  The people want us to change the way we do business in Washington. \nThey want to feel, and they are entitled to feel, that this Government \nis their Government. When the public opinion polls show that the \nmajority of Americans feel that lobbyists are the real power in \nWashington and only 22 percent think Congress is the power, and 7 \npercent think the President is the power, we must act to restore \nconfidence that in fact their elected representatives will control the \npower in Washington.\n  Lobbying reform is the first item we are taking up. Hopefully, again, \nwe are going to be able to do what no Congress for the last 50 years \nhas done, which is to plug the loopholes in lobby disclosure laws which \nhave resulted in these laws being useless and probably worse than \nuseless.\n  How could a law be worse than useless? First of all, its presence on \nthe books, if it is ignored, breeds disrespect for law. If the public \nis told there are lobby disclosure laws on the books, which there are, \nand if it knows most paid lobbyists do not register because of the \nloopholes in the law, then those laws are worse by being there than if \nthey were not there at all. Better if you have no laws than to have \nlaws that are such a sham and in such a shambles. Nothing breeds \ndisrespect much more for law than having a law on the books, which is \naimed at doing something, which totally fails to do something.\n  Another reason why it is worse than nothing to have those laws on the \nbooks is because it is producing ream on ream of paperwork, which takes \ntime to produce, time to prepare, time to file, time to maintain, and \nwhich is giving us almost useless information, information which is not \nin a form which is useful to anybody. So we know probably a majority of \nthe paid representatives in this town are not registering because of \nthe loopholes in the law and those that do are giving us information \nwhich is not in a form which is usable by anybody.\n  So what we are engaged in here is to try to address the first big, \nmajor reform which is required if we are going to restore public \nconfidence in Government and that is the lobbying disclosure bill, \nwhich is a bipartisan bill. Let me emphasize this. Senator Cohen has \nbeen working with me, Democrats and Republicans have been working on \nthis issue, for a long time. The same thing is true with the gift ban. \nWe have Democrats and Republicans who are supporting a strong gift ban.\n  So we are going to continue to try to work together today to see if \nwe cannot finally pass a lobbying disclosure bill, and then once that \nis addressed and once that is resolved move on to the gift ban \nlegislation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me just reinforce one point that \nSenator Levin made. Again, I do not know anybody in the Senate that has \nprovided more leadership for reform of good government than the Senator \nfrom Michigan over the years.\n  I do not know if it is the conventional wisdom here any longer, but \nat one point in time I think the conventional wisdom here in the \nCongress, Representatives and Senators, Democrats and Republicans \nalike--I make a nonpartisan point here--was these reform issues, \nlobbying disclosure reform, comprehensive gift ban reform, and also \ncampaign finance reform. But let me take the lobbying disclosure reform \nand gift ban reform. \n\n[[Page S10530]]\n\n  I think that unfortunately too many Democrats and Republicans alike \nbelieve that these reform issues are of interest to ``goo-goo,'' good \ngovernment, people. There has been a certain cynicism about it. But it \nis just not true. There have been a lot of public interest \norganizations that have been at this for years--Public Citizen, Common \nCause. You could go on an on. But the much more important point is that \npeople yearn for good Government. They yearn for a political process \nthey can believe in. These are no longer, if they ever were, reform \nissues. These are really issues that people talk about in their \nkitchens and their living rooms. I just think that we make a huge \nmistake when we try to stonewall the change.\n  So my hope, starting with lobbying disclosure reform and then with \ncomprehensive gift ban reform, is that before the debate is over, we \ncan in the next several days be very proud, all of us, that we will \nhave made some huge changes, significant changes, positive changes. I \nthink, if there is stonewall, to come up with measures that sort of \nhave the label of reform but the closer you look at them the more \ndubious they are--in fact, they do not meet the credibility test--I \nthink the worse off all of us will be.\n  So let us start with the lobbying disclosure reform. I say to the \nwhip, let us move forward, let us come together, and let us pass \nsomething that we are all proud of. Then let us try to do exactly the \nsame thing with comprehensive gift ban reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I indicated earlier I think we can see \nthe light at the end of the tunnel in terms of the lobby disclosure \nbill. The Senator from Michigan indicated Friday afternoon, as he has \nfurther indicated this morning, his willingness to make some \nadjustments that I think move us a long way toward a truly bipartisan \nlobby disclosure bill.\n  The Senator from Michigan indicated that he is willing to double the \nthreshold in terms of definition of a lobbyist from 20 percent of time \nspent over 6 months. That is something we are actively discussing now \nat the staff level in the hope of resolving it. The Senator from \nMichigan is also willing to double the threshold for registration and \nreporting by organizations. That certainly is a step in the right \ndirection of protecting people's ability to petition the Congress. And \nthe Senator from Michigan is making further efforts to clarify the \ngrassroots lobbying communication exemption. Of course, that is \ncritically important. These folks have constitutional rights, too, and \ndeserve not to have them walked on by the Congress.\n  In addition to that, I think an important step in the right direction \nis the elimination of a new Government agency. Frankly, Mr. President, \nthe last thing we need to do in this almost $5 trillion debt \nenvironment is to create yet another Government agency with yet more \nresponsibility. It seems to me, the whole thrust of the 103d Congress \nis to go in the direction of less government. And clearly this bill \nought to be consistent with that.\n  Mr. President, let me say that I think we need to reform our lobby \nregistration and disclosure laws. I think we are on the threshold of \nbeing able to accomplish that in a way that does not unduly interfere \nwith the rights of citizens, whether they are paid or not paid, to \npetition the Government because the courts make no distinction. You do \nnot waive your constitutional rights because you are paid to represent \na group that may be too busy to come to Washington. That is what \nlobbyists largely do, represent American citizens who choose not to \nbecome experts on legislation and employ someone else to speak for \nthem. There is nothing un-American about that. Under the Constitution, \nwe have the obligation not to interfere with this constitutional right \nto express ourselves that each of us enjoy.\n  Mr. President, with regard to the original bill, S. 101, the bill had \nset up a new Government agency. As I said earlier, we commend the \nSenator from Michigan for discarding that. It seems to me that clearly \nwas not a good idea, and that moves us in the direction of passing this \nlegislation.\n  The original bill, in my view, would have chilled the exercise of \nconstitutional rights, and would have caused some who were inclined to \ncontact the Congress with their views to simply refrain from doing so \nbecause of the fear of prosecution. The disclosure and reporting \nrequirements in the original bill were clearly elaborate, and apply to \nvirtually anyone with business before the Congress. And that would have \nthe effect of keeping people from expressing their views to us. From my \nperspective, that is exactly the wrong message to be sending to the \nAmerican people. We should welcome them to Washington. We should be \nglad to receive their views. We should not be making it so difficult \nfor people to communicate with Congress that they choose to stay home \nand avoid telling us how they feel.\n  Third, the original bill, it seems to me, had some difficulties with \nregard to creating a patchwork of lobby regulations. It contained a \nhost of exemptions that did not make sense. For example, why are public \nofficials exempt? If the American people have a right to know how much \nthe American Soft Drink Association, for example, spends on lobbying, \nthen why not the city of New York, the State of California, or the U.S. \nConference of Mayors?\n  Fourth, the original bill touched on grassroots activity. That goes \ndown a road we do not need to go. And the Senator from Michigan is \ntrying to make adjustments to clear that up. I commend him for that. We \nare working on that at the staff level as we speak to try to further \nclarify where we may be on that so that we can move forward with a \ncompromise.\n  I have been working on an alternative. My alternative is clear and \nconsistent. And most importantly, it is simple and will get those who \nlobby Congress registered so the public knows who is influencing public \npolicy. Let me explain what the alternative I may propose would do.\n  First, the main problem with the lobby law is that it only reaches \ncontacts with Members of Congress. Clearly, we all agree that those \ngroups and individuals who contact Congress for the purpose of \ninfluencing matters pending before Congress, even if they contact \nstaff, should be registered. So our alternative would apply to those \nwho make more than a single contact with legislative branch officials \non behalf of a client for the purpose of influencing any pending matter \nbefore Congress. And any pending matter means more than legislate. It \nmeans oversight hearings, investigations, and anything that is within \nthe jurisdiction of a Member of Congress. The definition of lobbyist \nalso includes the preparation and planning for lobbying meetings.\n  But where we disagree with the Senator from Michigan, at least in his \noriginal version, is the amount of time spent on lobbying that it takes \nto meet the definition of lobbyists. The Senator from Michigan has \nmoved in our direction. I want to commend him again for that by raising \nthe threshold to 20 percent of his or her time lobbying, therefore \nbringing you within the scope of the bill. Our concern is that such a \ndefinition could catch within its net those who work outside of \nWashington who have very limited contacts with Congress. So the \ndefinition I would prefer is to set the threshold at 25 percent. But \nobviously we are not too far apart here, a difference between 20 and 25 \npercent; that is, someone who spends one-quarter of his or her time, or \na substantial part of his or her professional life, lobbying would then \nfall within the requirements of the alternative.\n  Another major difference is the scope of our bill. Senator Levin's \noriginal bill would reach executive branch lobbying as well as \nCongress. To accomplish that, Senator Levin in his original bill \ncreated a new Federal agency to enforce and administer the law. We part \ncompany with the need to address the executive branch lobbying and the \nestablishment of a new Government agency to enforce the new law.\n  Now the Senator from Michigan has taken a different tack on that at \nthis point, and I am pleased he has. I think that certainly makes it \nmuch more likely we can finish up this legislation on a bipartisan \nbasis. As I indicated earlier, the American people did not send us here \nto create more Federal Government, and the movement away \n\n[[Page S10531]]\nfrom it is certainly welcomed, certainly by me and I think many on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  The Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House are well \nsuited to continue receiving lobby registration forms. These offices \ncan improve the dissemination of this information, making it more user \nfriendly for the public. That is what our alternative aims to do.\n  As far as the executive branch coverage, an item we are still \ndiscussing here as we hope to work this matter out, my view is it is \njust not necessary. Contacts with the executive branch are highly \nregulated under the Administrative Procedure Act. Regulations are \nformulated by a very detailed process that allows interested parties to \nparticipate. And Congress always has oversight and legislative power \nover regulations issued by Aencies. Administrative adjudication is also \na formal process.\n  Moreover, we know from the experience of the health care task force \nrun by the First Lady that efforts by the executive branch to make \npolicy in secret generally backfire anyway. And a legal challenge has \nresulted in that particular case in all of that information becoming \npublic.\n  So, Mr. President, from our point of view, we should clean up our own \nhouse. Let us get the right coverage of lobbyists who lobby us here in \nthe Congress. Let us get information related to their work properly \navailable and disclosed to the public. Let us not make registration and \ndisclosure so cumbersome that we signal to the American people that \ntheir voices are simply not welcome here in Washington. We want their \ninput. We encourage Americans to join organizations that represent \ntheir views, and we hope they will let us know what they think.\n  When James Madison wrote Federalist No. 10, he envisioned a \ncompetition of ideas from, as he put it, ``factions.'' Today, we would \ncall those factions lobbyists. We who are elected to represent our \nconstituents are called upon to build consensus among the various \nfactions. Where we are unable to build consensus, we are called upon to \nchoose from among the competing ideas put forward by the lobbyists or, \nif you will, the factions.\n  So there is nothing wrong with lobbying. It is not an evil thing. It \nwas envisioned by the Framers. It is part of our Constitution's first \namendment which protects free speech and petitioning the Government \nwith grievances.\n  And finally, while lobbying is an honorable profession, we want to \nmake sure that those who abuse the public trust they hold as lobbyists \nare punished for their misdeeds. We propose to let the U.S. attorney \nprosecute those who violate the law. The first offense would be subject \nto civil sanctions and subsequent offenses would be subject to criminal \npenalties. We want lobbyists to register; we want their activities \ndisclosed, but let us not chill protected constitutional rights in the \nprocess.\n  Mr. President, the discussions on this matter are proceeding. And \nagain, let me say we are hoping we can achieve at least close to a \nconsensus on the lobby disclosure bill which we can pass by an \noverwhelming margin sometime later today or tonight.\n  Mr. President, I do not see anyone else wishing to address the \nSenate. Therefore, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. McCain). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, there are active negotiations underway on \nlanguage in the lobby reform bill. I think we are making progress and \nsome important changes and agreements have already been reached. There \nare a few areas where, obviously, there is still some disagreement or \nsome lack of clarity as to what it would do.\n  Since the principals are here on the floor, it would be helpful, I \nbelieve, if we go ahead and recess until a time certain to allow the \nprincipals in this legislation to talk directly.\n  Also, we hope, when we come back in after that recess, we will be \nable to get an agreement on a specified time, agreed-to time to vote on \nor in relation to the McCain amendment. It may be other amendments will \nbe ready at that time, but at least we would like to get an agreement \nto get a vote at 5:45 on the McCain amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/24/senate-section/article/S10512-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, this is a discussion the Senator and I \nchoose to have now, possibly tonight, and then I would imagine through \ntomorrow as well. We will be involved in I think a major debate about \nthe gift ban reform effort.\n  I thought that the Senator from Wisconsin and I might talk a little \nbit about what is at issue here. I will start out for a few moments, \nand then we will go back and forth. I have some questions which I want \nto put to the Senator, and I think he has some questions he wants to \nput to me as well.\n  Mr. President, just to be crystal clear, there is no question in my \nmind that people in the country really, as I have said before, yearn \nfor a political process that they can believe in, one that really is \naccountable, that is open, and that has real integrity.\n  We have been working on a gift ban. I ask the Senator from Wisconsin \nhow long we have been working on this comprehensive gift ban \nlegislation with Senator Lautenberg and Senator Levin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. It seems like we have been talking about it for about 2 \nyears. We sort of came to this in different ways. I got here in the \nSenate, and I just knew that as a State senator from Wisconsin, we had \na law that said you cannot even accept a cup of coffee from a lobbyist. \nI understood that in the 10 years I was in the State senate. I was a \nlittle surprised to find out they did otherwise here.\n  So we put this in effect for myself and my staff, and then I found \nout independently that the Senator from Minnesota, from another reform-\nminded State, was working an overall bill that would apply that to all \nMembers of Congress. We obviously crossed paths and thought that would \nmake sense as part of a broader effort to try to get the influence of \nbig private money a little bit more out of Washington. We got other \nsupporters as time went on. That is how it really started.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me go on to say to my colleague \nthat we have become close friends. We come from a similar part of the \ncountry, and we come from reform-minded States.\n  It is interesting. I became interested in this initiative because \nshortly after I had been elected, I was on a plane. A guy came up to \nme, without using any names, by the way. I will not for a moment say \nthere was anything about the conversation that I would call corrupt. \nBut he came up to me and asked me whether I liked athletics. I said, \n``I love \n\n[[Page S10532]]\nathletics. My children and I have been involved in athletics, and \nSheila and I just love it.'' He said, ``Senator, we would be very \npleased for you to have tickets. We represent a certain industry, and \nwe have tickets for all sorts of different games,'' and everything \nelse. I thanked him. Then I sat down and started thinking to myself. I \nwas a college teacher for 20 years. I had been on this plane, you know, \na few times and nobody had ever come up to me and asked that point. I \nthought, What is it that has changed? It must be the institutional \nposition.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. If the Senator will yield, I had a similar experience \nwhen I first became a member of the Wisconsin State Senate. Nobody had \never come up to me on the State capitol ground and said, ``Senator, do \nyou like lobster?'' About a week after being a member of the State \nsenate, one of the lobbyists came up, put his arm around me, and said, \n``We are just delighted to have you here, Senator. Do you and your wife \nenjoy lobster tail?'' It took me about a minute to realize what was \ngoing on. Being from Wisconsin, that was illegal. It is not, though, at \nthe Federal level. But it sort of dawns on you that suddenly people are \na little more interested in socializing and buying you dinner possibly \nbecause you have been elected to public office.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me go on and engage in a discussion \nwith my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, about what is at \nissue here. S. 101 is the comprehensive gift ban measure.\n  By the way, Mr. President, 88 Senators--the Senator from Tennessee \nwould be excluded because he was not in the Senate or the House last \nCongress--but 88 Senators voted for exactly S. 101, this comprehensive \ngift ban initiative.\n  Again, I say to my colleague, it is extremely important in terms of \nthe public, in terms of our connection with the people we represent, \nthat people hold strong with this position. One of features of S. 101 \non the gift ban is that we simply say when it comes to lobbying--let us \njust talk about that--there are just no gifts, period. We have a $20 \nminimum.\n  The McConnell initiative allows lobbyists to give Members an \nunlimited number of gifts up to $100 each. As it turns out, I thought \nat one point in time that this meant every day a lobbyist could take \nthe Senator from Wisconsin or the Senator from Tennessee or the Senator \nfrom Minnesota out for a meal here in Washington, dinner in Washington, \nor a ticket to an Orioles game, or whatever the case might be, and that \nevery single day, as long as it was up to $100, it could be done in \nperpetuity because there is not even an aggregate limit.\n  Now, as it turns out, it is per occasion--breakfast, lunch, dinner, \nmuch less all sorts of things per occasion. Lobbyists can give us gifts \nas long as it is under $100, and there is no aggregate limit.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I would like to quantify that example. Under the \nstrictest interpretation of the McConnell proposal, the one that would \nchange S. 101, even if you interpreted it to mean that you could only \ngive $100 a day of food and wine and so on, it would mean that every \nlobbyist and every individual could give each Member of Congress \n$36,500 of those kinds of things. And is not the Senator really saying \nthat is not even what it means, that it is worth more than that, more \nthan $100 a day per person for everyone in the universe, for every \nMember of the Congress?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The $100 adds up to $36,500 a year.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Per person.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. So actually we do not even have a $36,500 limit.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is the strictest interpretation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is the strictest interpretation of what we have \nin the McConnell-Dole initiative.\n  I say to my colleague from Wisconsin that I would view this not as a \ngreat step forward but a great leap backward.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I agree. If the Senator will yield, you can argue that \nthis is just slightly tougher than current law that says that if a gift \nis over $100, or a meal is over $100 and it is less than $250, I guess \nyou can accept it but you are banned from over $250. But the \ncontributions under $100 do not count. They do not count toward that. \nThis puts into the law forever a permission, a right, if you will, to \ntake anything up to $100 a day from everyone.\n  So it really is worse because it formalizes potentially in a statute \nas opposed to a resolution, depending on how it comes out, this \npractice as something that is permitted and maybe even encouraged in \nWashington.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. So this alternative McConnell-Dole proposal, in the \nname of reform, in many ways essentially solidifies, if you will, the \nculture of politics as we know it right now in the Nation's Capital.\n  Let me go on and ask my colleague a couple of other questions.\n  By the way, I would say this alternative proposal that we have takes \nus a long way from I think what the majority leader on October 15 of \nlast year said, which was that ``no lobbyists' lunches, no \nentertainment, no travel, no contributions to legal defense funds, no \nfruit baskets, no nothing.''\n  This proposal that we now get from the other side certainly takes us \na long way from that.\n  The second part of this proposal would allow privately financed \nvacation trips in the form of charity golf, tennis and ski events to be \naccepted by Members from lobbyists, as I think we could accept that for \nourselves, our spouses, our family.\n  I would ask my colleague. This is the alternative proposal. Does he \nsee this as reform or does he see this as having that sort of, if you \nwill, look of reform but, again, an open-ended proposition where we \nhave lobbyists and special interests paying for skiing, paying for \ntennis, or paying for vacations for ourselves and our families?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. If the Senator will yield, I think he correctly \nidentified the other day that there are two provisions in this \nMcConnell proposal that really gut the bill from having the name \n``reform'' properly attached to it.\n  You can call anything you want reform--welfare reform or health care \nreform. Unless it changes things positively, it is not that.\n  Really, these two provisions, the one the Senator talked about in \nterms of $100 a day and the allowing of charitable trips to be \ndetermined not by an across-the-board rule or any real standards but \njust by the Senate Ethics Committee, which is, of course, controlled \nand in fact is constituted by Members of the Senate, it means you are \nreally not taking away any sort of strict rule that says we are not \ngoing to allow that at all.\n  So I think the combination of those two provisions makes it \nimpossible to call this reform but at best window dressing, and I think \nthe American public would be very distressed to learn what is still \npermitted under either the travel portion or the meals and gift \nprovisions.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Wisconsin \nthat if we want to as Senators support different charities, I think it \nis important we be there at these events. I think there is a way in \nwhich Senators, Democrats, and Republicans alike, have an important \nrole to play. But the point is we should do that on our own expense. If \nwe care enough about those charities, then we pay our own way.\n  I think that is the point. We do not need to have lobbyists paying \nour way, in which case then it becomes another big loophole. It seems \nto me, I say to my colleague from Wisconsin--I would be interested in \nhis reaction--and I said this earlier in the Chamber, I am not \ninterested in across-the-board denigration of public service. I believe \nin public service. So does my colleague from Wisconsin. So do \nRepublicans and Democrats alike.\n  It seems to me we ought to let go of these special favors, these \nperks, these gifts. We ought to let go of it. If you want people to \nbelieve in us, if you want people to believe in the outcome of this \nprocess, if you want people to have more confidence in the Senate and \nin the House and in politics in Washington, DC, then let go of these \ngifts. Would my colleague agree with me?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I agree. I cannot believe that this great institution \nwants to continue to have its reputation and its history really being \nbesmirched by some of these ``Prime Time'' programs and others that are \nable to take what perhaps is an isolated instance in the \n\n[[Page S10533]]\ncase of certain Members of Congress and show them playing tennis with \nlobbyists and just cast doubt on the whole institution. There have been \nenough problems already. I really have to believe that this institution \nwill rise up and say we do not want this.\n  In fact, I say to the Senator from Minnesota, even the lobbyists do \nnot really want this in a lot of cases. I flew out here this morning \nand two or three of the prominent lobbyists from Wisconsin said, ``We \nhope you win on this thing.'' They are tired of this expectation that \nif one telecommunications giant takes somebody out to dinner, does not \nthe other one have to. So they want to be free of this. They want to be \nprofessionals, most of them, as well.\n  If we just have a per se rule as in Wisconsin--lobbyists cannot do \nit; legislators cannot do it--it frees everyone from this sort of murky \nquestion of should I really do that even though it does not look very \ngood and seems inappropriate? It is very important for everyone \ninvolved. I think in most cases people have the best intentions here. \nWe need the per se rule and should not leave it up to the Senate Ethics \nCommittee to say this charity or that trip makes sense or does not.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the Senator from Wisconsin makes an \ninteresting point. I am a little embarrassed that I did not make this \npoint earlier, which is that you talk to many of the lobbyists and they \nsay they would be pleased to see this pass. So in a way, this \ncomprehensive gift ban proposal--I said comprehensive, S. 101 we have \nbeen working on. I did not say the alternative, the McConnell-Dole \nalternative, which frankly does not pass the credibility test. It is \nnot comprehensive. It is not strict and it does not put an end to this \npractice. I think people will be very angry with it, and therefore I \nhope actually in the next 2 days we will have reached some agreement \nthat all of us can pass something of which we are proud. Otherwise, it \nwould be a gigantic debate.\n  If I could just make one additional point, I think this comprehensive \ngift ban proposal is important, first of all, for the public so they \ncan have more confidence in our process, for all of us, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, and for the lobbyists. And I say to my colleague \nfrom Wisconsin, for me the issue has never been the wrongdoing of an \nindividual office holder. I am glad the Senator put it the way he did. \nI am not interested in some of these exposes--this, that and the other \n--which I think kind of miss the mark. I do not see--and I hope I am \nright--the wrongdoing of a lot of individual office holders, but I \nthink there is a more serious problem and it is systemic.\n  What this is all about, this comprehensive gift ban proposal is all \nabout, is the fact that some people have too much access. They have too \nmuch say over what we do in the Senate and too many people in Wisconsin \nand Minnesota and Tennessee and Michigan are left out of the loop. \nPeople do not like that. They do not feel well represented. They do not \nlike the idea that certain lobbyists and special interests that those \nlobbyists represent have so much clout here and they are left out.\n  That is another reason why I think we have to pass a tough \ncomprehensive gift ban reform. Would my colleague agree that there is \ncampaign finance, there is lobbying disclosure, and there is gift ban--\nall of these reform measures are almost more important than each of \nthem singularly?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would agree. I like to call it the \ncircle of special influence in Washington. There are different links in \nthe chain: the gift problem, the campaign finance problem, and the \nproblem of the revolving door, where Members of Congress or their staff \nmembers work here and then go to work for special interests and \nlobbying back right away.\n  It is only one part of it, the gift ban. But one of the things that \nbothers me about this gift issue that the Senator mentions is the fact \nthat this involves the access issue. There is a serious problem for any \nMember of the Senate. The Senator and I represent millions of people. \nIt is so hard to equitably balance distributing your own time for your \nconstituents. It is obviously difficult to meet with them individually. \nIf there is something out there, whether it be trips or meals, that \ninvolves a substantial amount of extra time for certain people because \nthey happen to provide these certain things, that distorts our ability \nto equitably spend time with constituents.\n  I think it is embarrassing to even have to come out on the floor and \ntalk about this. It seems to me to be so simple that we should just ban \nit. It is not that we have not wanted to dispose of it. I can assure \nyou the Senator from Minnesota and I and the Senator from Michigan \nwould like nothing better than to have this over with. We do not want \nopportunity after opportunity to debate this. But there has been a real \neffort, frankly, under both Republican and Democrat leadership, to move \nthis issue off to the side. We want it resolved.\n  I would like to just have to no longer be able to point out to people \nthat in my office we have received in the last 2\\1/2\\ years--and this \nis sort of the small part of this, but it is the really silly part of \nit--1,072 gifts, from inexpensive calendars to coffee mugs, T-shirts, \nmotor oil, spark plugs, cast iron bookends, a Japanese mask, fruit \nbaskets, cakes, cheese, pecans, sausage, eggs, steaks, almonds, onions, \ngarlic, honey, bread, peaches, sweet potatoes, sugar, chocolate, candy \nbars, tea, coffee, dates, barley mustard, wine, Girl Scout cookies, and \nthree lollipops.\n  Do people not have better things to do than to prepare these little \npackages for Members of the Senate and the House so they can say that \nthey, too, have handed out some goodies to the Senators' offices? We \nhave serious business to do here. For our staff members to be bothered \nwith 1,072 of these little well-intentioned gifts is just another \nexample how this process does not make sense. And if we just banned it, \nwe would be able to focus more clearly on what we should really be \ndoing, which is the work of the people who elected us.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, we have about used up our time. Let me \njust close this way. The New York Times--I do not know if my colleague \nsaw this--on Saturday had an editorial called ``Republican Gift \nFraud.'' And quite frankly--and we have not even begun to look at the \nRepublican proposal, or at least the McConnell proposal--there are \nenough loopholes in here to drive huge trucks through. I think it is \nvery dangerous to call something reform which in fact maintains this \ncurrent practice of enabling lobbyists and other professional interests \nto give us gifts, gifts that we receive and take.\n  I do not think that will do a thing to restore public confidence in \nthe process, and in fact I think people will be furious to not see this \npractice ended.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. If the Senator will yield, I just want to say that I \nremember--the Senator and I talked about this--the biggest cheer we \nheard in the lobby out here in the reception area last year was the \nmoment when the gift ban was defeated. There was a cheer that went up \nin the room apparently from some of the interests that were involved in \nthis. I can assure you, based on the points made about the McConnell \namendment, if that passes, it will again be a victory for those who \nwant to continue the current system. It cannot possibly be called \nreform, as the Senator from Minnesota has pointed out.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I agree. Let me conclude with an editorial today. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that this editorial be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Prove It's Not for Sale\n\n       Once again, supporters of ethics reforms see the U.S. \n     Senate trying to save an endangered species: the \n     congressional freebie. This week the Senate is bound to act \n     on the long-diverted lobbyist gift ban sponsored by five \n     persistent senators, including Paul Wellstone of Minnesota \n     and Russ Feingold of Wisconsin.\n       This gift ban measure should pass as is. In fact it has \n     passed previously, only to be put aside in the service of \n     political goals and to mollify senators who believe that free \n     football tickets and golf vacations come with the job.\n       For all the talk over the last few years about reforms in \n     how Congress conducts itself, it is obvious that the \n     assumption of special privilege is the province of neither a \n     Republican- nor Democratic-led federal legislature. The \n     assumption of personal privilege for lawmakers is so embedded \n     in the institution's culture that giving up perks ordinary \n     citizens do not enjoy has become as \n\n[[Page S10534]]\n     tough as balancing the federal budget. Making the matter more difficult \n     is the fact that senators know they have to be ``for ethics \n     reform.'' So the politics of freebies involves diversion and \n     dilution. The anti-reform dynamic aims to stop a \n     comprehensive ban by pushing one that meets appearances of \n     reform without reducing the flow of trips and free meals.\n       Also designed to weigh against a comprehensive gift ban is \n     one of the parliamentarian's oldest tricks: send a \n     controversial issue to a committee to be chewed up. The \n     Senate's bipartisan task force on lobbying reform has the \n     potential to assure that the sugary river of senatorial gifts \n     is drawn down one hummingbird-sized sip at a time.\n       The comprehensive gift ban may cramp some senators' style, \n     but it is an important step in restoring public confidence. \n     The current climate about politics and its practitioners says \n     the Senate must prove it is not for sale, one member at a \n     time, to special interests that provide seats on the 50-yard \n     line and a winter break in the tropics.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this is from the St. Paul Pioneer \nPress, a paper that both of us in Wisconsin and Minnesota receive. The \nlast paragraph reads as follows:\n\n       The comprehensive gift ban may cramp some Senators' style, \n     but it is an important step in restoring public confidence. \n     The current climate about politics and its practitioners says \n     the Senate must prove it is not for sale, one Member at a \n     time, to special interests that provide seats on the 50-yard \n     line and winter break in the tropics.\n\n  That is stated quite directly. I think the Pioneer Press speaks for \nthe vast majority of people in the country. Some of it may be \nperception. I do not always assume because people take gifts that that \nleads to some sort of awful private deals that take place between \nlobbyists and Senators. I do not make that assumption at all.\n  But I say to my colleagues, it is time to let go of these perks. It \nis time to let go of these privileges. It is time to no longer take \nthese gifts. It is time to no longer have lobbyists pay for vacations \nfor ourselves and our spouses, and we ought to end this. It is time to \nrestore some confidence on the part of the people we represent in this \npolitical process.\n  A lot of our colleagues think that we are the only ones interested in \nthese issues. That is not true. People in the country care fiercely \nabout this. I hope in the next couple of days that there will be \nlobbying disclosure reform, gift ban reform--maybe there will be give \nand take, I say to my colleague. Maybe we will come together around \nsome initiatives that will not be everything we want, but I do not \nthink either one of us or any of us who have worked on gift ban are \ngoing to accept a proposal that does not meet the test of representing \nsignificant reform.\n  Then eventually--and I thank my colleague for his work on this--we \nwill get to campaign finance reform. When we reform this political \nprocess, we will be dealing with the root issue, and the root issue is \nmany, many people in the United States of America have lost confidence \nin the Nation's Capitol. They do not believe this Capitol belongs to \nthem. By God, we have to make sure it does--we have to make sure not \nonly they believe it, but that that is the case, this Capitol belongs \nto them. This is only one step in that direction, but it is an \nimportant one. I hope all of our colleagues will support comprehensive \ngift ban reform.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/24/senate-section/article/S10531-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10534-S10535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE CHILDREN OF BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I think it is fairly clear that we are \nheading toward some kind of a military climax in the Bosnian situation. \nPrecisely what is going to happen I do not know. None of us knows. But \nthere is likely to be more bloodshed in the immediate future, and I \nhope not a continuation of the constant agony and bloodshed that we \nhave seen these past few years since 1991.\n  I have a citizen from Illinois by the name of Al Booth who says we \ntook children out of Germany, Austria, and England in the very \ndifficult years prior to and during World War II, saved a great many \npeople, and that we ought to be doing something to save the children of \nBosnia today.\n  It is not simple. I have talked to Bosnian officials. My office has \ntalked to the International Red Cross people. The Red Cross people said \nif you had taken them out by bus or by any kind of vehicle or by plane, \nand the plane is shot, there would be substantial criticism. There are \nat least some in the Bosnian Government who feel that to take the \nchildren out almost means you are sending a signal that the Government \ncannot continue, that it is going to collapse. It is a difficult \nsituation.\n  At this point I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter from Al Booth that was printed in the Chicago Tribune about this \nsituation.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, June 19, 1995]\n\n                           Bosnia's Children\n\n       Chicago.--The children of Bosnia should not be allowed to \n     become the slaughtered innocent victims of the intensified \n     fighting.\n       In 1937 a kindertransport was organized in Germany, before \n     Hitler closed the door, when the British government made \n     10,000 visas available for German children. Seven thousand \n     children were rescued--75 percent Jewish and 25 percent \n     Christian. (Only 1,000 children arrived in the U.S. from \n     Germany--with parents, relatives or alone--in 1938 and 1939.)\n       Several European countries are organized to accept refugee \n     children. There they would be closer to home. These countries \n     are very experienced on matters relating to refugees.\n       The UN is in the best position to organize the transfer of \n     children of any ethnic group out of Bosnia. To do so at this \n     time would certainly make it plain to those forces attacking \n     the ``safe havens'' that at long last the NATO countries and \n     the U.S. wish to put an end to using snipers to kill children \n     and mortars to kill civilians. The Air Force would be there \n     to protect the children.\n       We may not be able to stop ethnic violence or expanded \n     civil wars, but we should be able, at this moment, to take \n     the initiative to remove children and women.\n       A kindertransport program is long overdue in Bosnia. Those \n     children who came out of Germany and Austria left their \n     parents behind, and almost all never saw their parents again. \n     We have a better chance of that not happening this time, but \n     we must get the children out of Bosnia now, before they \n     become orphans and victims.\n\n                                                     Al Booth,\n\n                                                        President,\n                                   International Music Foundation.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, in response to that letter, he received a \nletter from the consul general of France. Let me just read two \nparagraphs from this letter. The consul general read Al Booth's letter \nin the Chicago Tribune:\n\n       In addition to its participation in the organization of an \n     air shuttle in Sarajevo and the creation of a central \n     pharmacy in Bihac, the French Government evacuated more than \n     200 Bosnian children between 1993 and 1994.\n       Furthermore, a private association called ``Equilibre,'' \n     with the support of our Regional Councils, organized in \n     November 92 the temporary evacuation of 1045 mothers and \n     children. This operation was repeated in 1994 for 1000 \n     children and their mothers.\n\n  For a total of 2,045.\n\n       This time the operation concentrated on the children whose \n     health was failing and who could not have spent the winter in \n     Bosnia.\n\n  He says these operations would not have been possible without the \nsupport of the French Government in particular regarding the retention \nof temporary permits for the accompanying adults.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter of \nthe French Consul General.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Consulat General de France,\n\n                                       Chicago, IL, July 11, 1995.\n     Mr. Al Booth,\n     International Music Foundation, Chicago, IL.\n       Dear Mr. Booth: I read with much interest your letter \n     published in the Chicago Tribune of June 19, 1995, and sent a \n     copy to the French Foreign Ministry, who have provided me \n     with the following information.\n       In addition to its participation in the organization of an \n     air shuttle in Sarajevo and the creation of a central \n     pharmacy in Bihac, the French Government evacuated more than \n     200 Bosnian children between 1993 and 1994.\n       Furthermore, a private association called ``Equilibre'', \n     with the support of our Regional Councils, organized in \n     November '92 the temporary evacuation of 1045 mothers and \n     children. This operation was repeated in 1994 for 1,000 \n     children and their mothers. This time the operation \n     concentrated on the children whose health was failing and who \n     could not have spent the winter in Bosnia.\n\n[[Page S10535]]\n\n       These operations would not have been possible without the \n     support of the French Government, in particular regarding the \n     obtention of temporary permits for the accompanying adults.\n       I hope that this information answers, at least in part, \n     your concerns which we entirely share about the fate of the \n     children (and other members of the civilian population) who \n     are caught up in the daily horrors of the war in Bosnia-\n     Herzegovina.\n       With best regards,\n                                                    Gerard Dumont,\n                                                   Consul General.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I do not know if anything can be done. But \nI think we ought to do everything we can to save these children, if \npossible, in this horrible, horrible situation in which they find \nthemselves. Obviously, these would only be volunteers.\n  Let me say for those who have fears of the religious implications, \nbecause these are mostly Moslem children, though not entirely. There \nare a number of Bosnian families in the United States as well as in \nWestern Europe who, I am sure, would be willing to take these \nchildren--not all of them obviously, but many of them would--so that \nthey could be raised in homes where there is a Bosnian culture and a \nMoslem background. So the religious factor should not be a barrier to \ngoing ahead.\n  Again, Mr. President, I do not have any good answer. But I do think \nthis idea of somehow saving these children, or as many of them as we \ncan, is just a sound, simple, humanitarian thing to do. I hope that \nsomehow we can do something.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/24/senate-section/article/S10534-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10535-S10536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LOBBYING DISCLOSURE ACT OF 1995\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to talk about the \nbill that is on the floor.\n  Mr. President, I think that we are coming to a very important time in \nthis Congress, and that is the time that we are going to be dealing \nwith reform of our lobby laws, and later the gift laws that apply to \nMembers of Congress.\n  Mr. President, it is important that we have Government in the \nsunshine.\n  The bill that is before us, lobby reform and lobby control, is an \nimportant one, and we have passed a similar bill in previous \nCongresses. Last year, I voted for a bill that would have required more \ndisclosure of lobbying efforts without in any way though infringing on \nthe right of individuals to seek an audience or a time with their \nMembers of Congress.\n  We do not want to do anything that would keep a teacher who happens \nto be a member of a teachers organization from directly contacting a \nMember of Congress. But there are many lobbying activities that may now \nnot be disclosable that should be disclosable. I know the Members of \nour parties on both sides of the aisle are working on a compromise \nright now, and I hope we can come up with something that will provide \npublic information of everything that is going on, every contact that \nis being made by a registered lobbyist or someone representing a lobby \ngroup. I think it is very important that the people of this country \nknow who it is seeing Members of Congress when we are talking about \nimportant legislation.\n  We are also going to be taking up gift reform, and that is another \nimportant issue. I think it is important we have contribution limits, \nand we do have contribution limits. And I have voted to make those \ncontribution limits even lower. We also have limits on how much you can \ntake in a gift, which may be a T-shirt or it may be a basket of fruit \nor it may be something very small but that someone gives you just as \nthey would give you if you worked in any office.\n  I wish to just say that those are appropriate limits. We do now have \nlimitations which I think are very appropriate. I think we must be very \ncareful as we go into the debate on gift ban not to go to such a level \nthat you would then be able to be prosecuted for something which would \nreally be inadvertent.\n  For instance, if you go to a zero gift, then presumably if you have \ncoffee and doughnuts or a lunch with someone who happens to be a friend \nwho may also work for a corporation or may be a teacher, then are you \ngoing to violate a ban on gifts?\n  I do not think anyone who is thinking rationally believes that just \nbecause you talk to someone or have lunch with someone or dinner with \nsomeone or a group gives you a T-shirt that is going to affect the way \nyou vote on important public policy issues. These are things that \nhappen in offices all over our country. It is the way people show \nnormal appreciation for a friendship or for working together on some \nkind of issue. So I think we have to be very careful to make sure we do \nthe things that would keep you from being able to abuse the ability to \nreceive a gift without going to such a length we then allow for \nselective prosecution by people who do not have good will or for \ninadvertent things to happen that do not mean anything but nevertheless \nwould put you in the position of a technical violation.\n  Mr. President, I just think as we go forward we need to keep in mind \nthat everyone wants openness in Government, reporting of things that \nare received, without in any way, though, keeping a normal person from \nbeing able to contact or have the minimal ability to send a flower or a \nT-shirt to someone who they have worked with on an issue and had a good \nresult or want to show some appreciation.\n  I go to functions across my State, and I may go to the chamber of \ncommerce and make a speech to a chamber of commerce banquet. They will \nsend me flowers or they will send something from the city, a cup or \nsomething. I appreciate that. I think it is a nice gesture. It makes me \nthink of that city. I have things all over my office, cups and candy \njars and things from the city of Lamar, from the city of Gainesville, \nor the city of Houston, or the city of Dallas. We cannot stop normal \nbehavior, normal appreciativeness, contact with chambers of commerce or \nteachers or unions. That just does not make sense.\n  So I hope we will keep the commonsense test as we go forward. I do \nnot think anyone believes that being able to have the normal course of \nbusiness is in any way prohibiting a fair look at legislation.\n  So I just hope common sense will be the test, Mr. President. I think \nit is very important that we make improvements. I think we are doing \nthat. I think as we go along and we see what works and what does not \nwork or what is falling through the cracks we will take the steps to \nclose those loopholes. That is what we are trying to do, and I hope we \nwill have a good result. I hope we will have a big lobby reform vote \ntoday, just like we did last year. It was something like 96 to 5 that \nthe lobby reform bill passed last year, but then it got hung up in \nconference, and it got changed and did not pass.\n  So I hope we can pass a good bill this year; that it will go through \nconference and that it will be an overwhelming, bipartisan effort to \nclose the loopholes we have in the law today. But let us make sure we \nhave enough common sense that an inadvertent error which really does \nnot make a difference does not cause someone who does not have good \nwill or good intentions to be able to prosecute or in any way build \nsomething up so that it makes a criminal out of a public servant.\n  It is not easy to be in public service at this point in time, and I \ncertainly do not want to harass people who are just trying to do what \nis right by having some kind of law that would allow a technical \nviolation. So let us go forward in a positive and bipartisan way and \nsee if we cannot work to close the loopholes that are there and have \nsunshine in Government. That is what we all want, and that is what I \nthink we can come to agreement on if we will just look at the big \npicture and put common sense in the equation.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, what is the pending business of the Senate? \n\n\n[[Page S10536]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is amendment No. 1837 to \nthe bill, S. 1060.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nbusiness be set aside and that I be allowed to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1838\n\n (Purpose: To amend title I of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to \n       require a more detailed disclosure of the value of assets)\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1838.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . DISCLOSURE OF THE VALUE OF ASSETS UNDER THE ETHICS IN \n                   GOVERNMENT ACT OF 1978.\n\n       (a) Income.--Section 102(a)(1)(B) of the Ethics in \n     Government Act of 1978 is amended--\n       (1) in clause (vii) by striking ``or''; and\n       (2) by striking clause (viii) and inserting the following:\n       ``(viii) greater than $1,000,000 but not more than \n     $5,000,000, or\n       ``(xi) greater than $5,000,000.''.\n       (b) Assets and Liabilities.--Section 102(d)(1) of the \n     Ethics in Government Act of 1978 is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (F) by striking ``and''; and\n       (2) by striking subparagraph (G) and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(G) greater than $1,000,000 but not more than $5,000,000;\n       ``(H) greater than $5,000,000 but not more than \n     $25,000,000;\n       ``(I) greater than $25,000,000 but not more than \n     $50,000,000; and\n       ``(J) greater than $50,000,000.''.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the amendment is somewhat straightforward. \nWhat it does is attempt to update the categories that we have for \ndisclosure. It does not attempt to give full valuation or more accurate \nvaluation of the lower amounts. What it does do is address the cutoff \nwe now have in the statute. Right now someone may have an asset worth \n$100 million but would report it only as above $1 million.\n  A recent article in Roll Call, I think, illustrates some of the \nambiguities of our current disclosure statutes. They listed the top 10 \nlawmakers they felt had substantial assets serving in both the House \nand the Senate.\n  As the chart adjacent to me shows, what resulted from our disclosure \nwas something of a misrepresentation, if you assume Roll Call's numbers \nare correct. Let me emphasize, I do not know that Roll Call's estimates \nare correct. They may well be incorrect. What is quite clear is that \nour disclosure categories are not complete. An asset worth $150 \nmillion, or perhaps even more, is reported on the disclosure form \nsimply as over $1 million.\n  Is there a difference in the potential conflict of interest, is there \nare difference in the significance of assets that might be $200 or $300 \nmillion versus $1 million? I believe so. Such substantial amounts tend \nto indicate control, tend to indicate the level of interest that is \nquite different than simply something that might be above $1 million as \nis shown on the disclosure form.\n  This amendment adds new categories. There is nothing magic in what we \nsuggest. We do provide modest relief from that $1 million limit. It \ncreates a category of $1 million to $5 million. It creates a category \nof $5 million to $25 million. It creates a category of $25 million to \n$50 million and a category of over $50 million.\n  The amendment does not attempt to cover all possible values. Someone \ncould well criticize it for not having more subcategories. It could \nwell be criticized because it does not differentiate assets over $50 \nmillion. But it is meant to provide at least some additional definition \nto these categories that have become so inadequate in terms of \ndisclosing accurately assets that we require to be reported.\n  Being in a statute form as it is, it will apply not only to the \nSenate but to the House of Representatives and to the executive branch \nas well.\n  I think the amendment is straightforward. It is meant to give us a \nclear picture in our disclosure forms and more accurately alert Members \nand the public to potential conflicts of interest.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am not \ntrying to stop the Senator from offering his amendments. But those who \nhave a vital interest in this particular part of the legislation that \nwe are debating here this afternoon are not available. I am caught in \nthe position of protecting this side without having the advice and \ncounsel of those Senators that are now negotiating to try to work \nsomething out.\n  I am not trying to prevent the Senator from introducing amendments. \nBut pretty soon we will have three or four amendments out here, and I \nam not sure where we are going to be. That will be the pending \namendment when they come back, and they may want to go back to the \noriginal amendment. There may be a unanimous consent agreement which \ncan be reached.\n  Will the Senator give me an opportunity to check before he offers his \namendment and let me see if there is any disagreement with what he is \ntrying to do?\n  Mr. BROWN. Surely.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if my colleagues are going to continue to \ndiscuss this subject for a bit, I intend to speak for 10 minutes as in \nmorning business, unless it interrupts the flow.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/24/senate-section/article/S10535-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10536-S10537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to speak on the floor briefly \ntoday because this is the week of the 30th anniversary of the Medicare \nProgram. I indicated last week, and will again this week, that I think \nit is important at a time when so much of our country talks about what \nis wrong with our country, for us occasionally to talk about what is \nright and what works, and to talk about success.\n  We have been talking for the last several weeks about regulatory \nreform. I have come to the floor to talk about the fact that most \npeople probably do not know in the last 20 years we have made enormous \nprogress in cleaning America's air and water.\n  We now use twice as much energy as we did 20 years ago, yet we have \ncleaner air in America. We have cleaner water, rivers, streams, and \nlakes in America than we had 20 years ago. No one 20 years ago would \nhave predicted that would be the case.\n  Why is that? Is it because the big corporate polluters in America who \nare dumping this into our airshed and the water--the pollution, \neffluence, and the chemicals--because they woke up and said, ``I know \nwhat I ought to do for America. I ought to stop polluting.'' That is \nnot what happened.\n  What happened is Congress decided that the American people deserve \nand want clean air, they want clean water, and we will put in place \nregulations that require it. We wrote regulations in this country that \nsaid polluters have to stop polluting.\n  We have had enormous success as a result of it. It is a healthier \nplace to live, better for us and better for our \n\n[[Page S10537]]\nkids. Yes, it is a nuisance for those who used to pollute. But it is a \nbetter policy for our country, to stop the pollution, and make that \ncost a part of the cost of doing business.\n  Now, we have a lot to celebrate, including successful clean air and \nclean water regulations and safe food regulations. We also have the \nopportunity, I think, to celebrate the success of a Medicare program \nthat works. Yet, rather than celebrating the success of a program that \nworks, we are now seeing that program under attack.\n  This is a more and more curious, yet in some ways predictable, I \nthink, agenda that I watch in this Congress. The Contract With America \nis the foundation of the agenda, and the Contract With America is \nbilled as a set of new directions and new ideas. In fact, there is \nnothing new about it at all. It represents the same old tired ideas, \nthe ideas that somehow if the big get more, the little will be helped.\n  Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys, back in the 1930's, had a song with \na lyric that stated it pretty well: ``The little guys pick the cotton \nand the big guys get the money; the little bee sucks the blossom and \nthe big bee gets the honey.'' So it is with the agenda now in Congress.\n  I could talk about the agenda at some length. I actually want to talk \nabout Medicare. This is one part of it, in the Washington Post article \n``Curbs on Media Mogul,'' ``Congress Moves to Ease Media Ownership \nCurbs, Could Reshape Industry.'' What does this mean? That Congress is \ntaking action to eliminate the restrictions on how many television \nstations one person or corporation can own. I guarantee in 10 years we \nwill have half a dozen companies owning almost all of America's \ntelevision stations. Good for our country? I do not think so. Good for \na few rich companies and investors? You bet your life it is.\n  Regulations--we ought to deal with silly and unnecessary regulations, \nbut we ought not retreat on clean air, clean water, and safe food \nregulations in order to satisfy the appetite of the wealthy and the big \ninterests. It does not make sense to me.\n  ``Food Stamp Block Grants Eyed as a Way of Breaking Welfare Reform \nStalemate.'' Some have an agenda of deciding that hunger is not a \nnational issue. So we will decide we will not have a national food \nstamp program, we will have 50 State programs, if they choose to use \nthe money for that. Curious agenda, in my judgment.\n  ``The Treasury Subcommittee of House Appropriations Votes To Decide \nTo Make It Easier for Felons To Purchase Guns.'' It is a curious and \nstrange agenda but part of the same pattern. Same tired old ideas.\n  Line-item veto--we voted for a line-item veto bill here in the \nSenate. I voted for it. I have voted for it a dozen times in a dozen \nyears. Yet, we are now told by the Speaker of the House it does not \nlook like we will have a line-item veto bill this year.\n  Last week, a little article in the paper says ``Gingrich Gets $200 \nMillion in New Pork.'' Now, we will not have a Democrat President that \nwill get a line-item veto to veto this sort of thing. Why? Because some \nwho talked about the line-item veto are much more interested in \nproducing pork than they are in producing a line-item veto.\n  But I wanted to speak just for a moment about Medicare. I think the \nMedicare Program is a success. Yes, we have some financing problems in \nthe outyears. Part of the reason that we have those financing problems \nis because of the success of the program. People live longer in this \ncountry today. They have better health care than they had previously. \nIn fact, on a monthly basis, we now have 200,000 new Americans each and \nevery month that become eligible for Medicare. That does cause some \nreal strain.\n  But the success is this: 40 years ago we had less than 50 percent of \nour senior citizens who had any health care coverage at all. This year, \nit is 99 percent of our senior citizens who have health care coverage.\n  I have been to plenty of places in the world where there is no health \ncare coverage for senior citizens. I have seen the sick and I have seen \nthe dying who have no access to health care because they are poor. In \nmany countries, that means 95 or 99 percent of the people. I have been \nto those countries.\n  I have seen the hospitals with dirt floors--to the extent they are \nlucky enough to get to a hospital--with dirt floors and no doors in the \ntropics down in Central America. I have seen the worst of medical \nconditions.\n  Most importantly, I have seen what it does to people when they grow \nold and have no access to health care. I saw it in my hometown before \nMedicare, at a time when my father asked me to drive an elderly \ngentleman to the hospital in Dickinson, ND, who was dying; a fellow \nwith no money, no hope, an elderly man, no health insurance. Still, as \nhe was 2 or 3 days away from death, he was worried about how he would \npay a hospital bill.\n  Part of that has changed because we put in place in the mid-1960's a \nMedicare plan. I might say those in my party--I was not here then--\nthose in my party who had the courage and foresight to fight and vote \nfor it, had to do so at the expense of being called a bunch of \nsocialists by a lot of folks who were not willing to vote for it.\n  I think we ought to celebrate the success of the Medicare Program and \nwhat it has done for our country. This is a year, and this is a week, \nthe anniversary of the 30th year of the Medicare Program, that has \nadvanced the interests of our country and its seniors.\n  I say to those who believe that we ought to give a big tax cut, the \nbulk of which go to the rich, and decide we need to cut Medicare, and \nthey do not relate to one another, it is pretty inescapable to me when \nyou advance a tax cut, the bulk of which go to the wealthiest \nAmericans, and say to senior citizens, ``We are sorry, we cannot fully \nfund Medicare,'' that the tax cut for the wealthy comes out of the \nMedicare Program. We can do better than that. We can decide together \nwhat we voted on in the 1960's as a Congress has been enormously \nsuccessful for the elderly people in this country--for all of America, \nfor that matter. We can decide not to threaten the Medicare system, but \ndecide to work together to strengthen it.\n  That is a matter of public will. I hope the American people would \ndecide that there is something to celebrate here in programs that work; \nmost especially, the Medicare Program. I hope in the next 2 or 3 \nmonths, as we sort through this fiscal policy dilemma, we will decide \nnot to embrace the radical agenda that says a tax cut for the rich--\nthat they claim will help the rest--at the expense of total and \nadequate coverage for America's senior citizens who need it, earned it, \nand respect it. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, is leader's time reserved?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask that I may use some of my leader's \ntime without interfering with the ongoing debate on lobbying reform. We \nare making progress on lobbying reform. I appreciate that. I hope we \nhave will have a unanimous vote for a strong bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/24/senate-section/article/S10536-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10537-S10538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BOSNIAN ARMS EMBARGO\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the opposition to lifting the United States \narms embargo in Bosnia and Herzegovina has been an elaborate exercise \nin buying time.\n  It has been more than 11 months since the Senate last voted to lift \nthe arms embargo in Bosnia. Following that vote, the administration \nworked with the distinguished Senator from Georgia on a compromise--the \nNunn-Mitchell provision--which ultimately was adopted.\n  The Nunn-Mitchell compromise essentially provided time, time for the \nBosnian Serbs to sign the contact group plan; time for UNPROFOR to \nimprove its performance; and time for the administration to work out a \nmultilateral lift of the arms embargo.\n  That is what it was supposed to do. Any one of these things have \noccurred not because of the lack of good intentions on the part of the \nSenator from Georgia, Senator Nunn, I might add, because he certainly \nexpected these things to happen.\n  Mr. President, 11 months later the situation is far worse than when \nthe Senate last voted 58 to 42 to unilaterally lift the arms embargo in \nBosnia. Thousands have died, tens of thousands have been forced from \ntheir homes, homes which were in the U.N. safe havens.\n Tens of thousands more are facing the same fate in Bihac, Sarajevo, \nand Gorazde. Furthermore, NATO is \n\n[[Page S10538]]\ndangerously close to losing what credibility it still has, and the \nUnited States is no closer to exercising leadership in a new direction.\n  President Clinton called me last week to ask for more time--he asked \nme to delay the vote on the Dole-Lieberman legislation until after the \nLondon meeting. And certainly we were pleased to oblige the President. \nWherever we can, we want to work with the President of the United \nStates, particularly in foreign policy areas.\n  But now the London meeting has come and gone and there is no change \non the ground in Bosnia. The London conference did not result in a \nreaffirmation of the U.N. obligation to defend the U.N. safe havens. \nThe conferees wrote off Srebrenica and Zepa, vowed to protect Gorazde--\nat some point, that point not being clear--and declined to respond to \nthe dramatically worsening situation in Bihac and Sarajevo.\n  So I guess what they have said, in effect, is if there are six safe \nhavens we may be willing to protect one--one out of the six.\n  Yes, there were modifications to the dual key arrangement, but the \ndual key remains. The bottom line is that the London meeting did not \nresult in significant change in approach. It did not result in a new \npolicy. It essentially reaffirmed business as usual with the \npossibility of a few displays of force sometime in the future.\n  So the commander of the Bosnian Serbs, General Mladic--who, \ninterestingly enough, was delivered the London conferees' ultimatum in \nBelgrade--is probably not shaking in his boots, but more likely \nlaughing all the way to Bihac.\n  Today there are reports of more NATO military planning. But planning \nwas never the problem. Executing those plans was and still is the \nproblem. This debate has never been about policy options, but about \npolitical will.\n  It is high time the Clinton administration abandon its flimsy excuses \nfor the United Nations' pitiful performance, shed the false mantle of \nhumanitarianism, and face the reality of the U.N. failure in Bosnia.\n  I intend to take up the Dole-Lieberman legislation tomorrow and hope \nwe can vote tomorrow and have a clear-cut vote. It is not a partisan \nvote. It is supported strongly by colleagues on both sides of the \naisle. This is the Senate of the United States speaking, not Bob Dole, \nnot Joe Lieberman, not a Democrat, not a Republican--but the U.S. \nSenate. The clock has run out and now is the time for the United States \nto fulfill its role as the leader of the free world, do what is right \nand what is smart. Now is the time to pass the Dole-Lieberman \nlegislation.\n  We have an obligation to the Bosnian people and to our principles, to \nallow a U.N. member state, the victim of aggression, to defend itself. \nI listened to George Stephanopoulos at the White House yesterday on \ntelevision, saying if we lifted the arms embargo, as proposed by myself \nand Senator Lieberman and other Republicans and Democrats, we were \ngoing to Americanize the war. How? All we are suggesting is to give \nthese people the right to defend themselves as they have under article \n51 of the U.N. Charter. We are not asking American ground troops, not \nsuggesting American ground troops, not suggesting American involvement. \nBut the spin machine at the White House is saying, ``Oh, this is going \nto Americanize the war.'' Nothing can be further from the truth.\n  Let me again reiterate, this is a Senate effort--not a Republican \neffort, not a Democratic effort, but a bipartisan, nonpartisan effort--\nto protect the rights of innocent people, an independent nation, a \nmember of the United Nations, which under article 51 of the U.N. \nCharter has the right to self-defense. In 1991, we imposed an illegal \nembargo on Yugoslavia. There is not a Yugoslavia anymore. It is gone. \nIt is now Bosnia, it is now Serbia, now Slovenia, now Croatia--it is no \nlonger Yugoslavia. The embargo has been illegal from the start. We \nhave, in effect, tied the hands of one side and said, OK, you cannot \nhave any heavy weapons, but you go out and fight the aggressors, and, \nif you lose, we will provide humanitarian aid.\n  I just suggest we have gone on long enough. I have great respect for \nthe U.N. protection forces who are there. Two members of the French \nforce lost their lives over the weekend; one was seriously wounded. \nOthers have lost their lives in this effort--British, Dutch, \nPakistanis--a number have lost their lives. But it has been a failed \npolicy, and I believe it is time that the world recognize the policy \nhas failed and time to give these people, the Bosnians, an opportunity \nto defend themselves.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the majority leader might yield for a brief \nquestion?\n  Mr. DOLE. Sure.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the majority leader's yielding. I have been \nstruggling with the question of the resolution. I have not decided \nwhether to support the resolution this week or not, but I ask the \nquestion: If the will of the Senate were to agree to this resolution, \nwhich would then result in a changed course with respect to Bosnia and \npotentially a rearming of the Bosnian Moslems, does the Senator from \nKansas, the majority leader, feel that ultimately American troops would \nbe required to help extricate the U.N. forces at some point?\n  Mr. DOLE. Of course none of this would take effect--we would not lift \nthe embargo--until they were gone. But I would be willing to support \nthe President to extricate the U.N. protection forces. It seems to me, \nas a member of NATO we have that obligation. I know the views of the \nAmerican people are very mixed, as I saw in the polls. But in my view, \nafter they have been removed--if we have to help extricate them, I \nthink we should. We should support the President in that effort.\n  Second, when it comes to training the Bosnians, we helped the \nAfghans. We did not send anybody to Afghanistan. We helped train. We \nprovided weapons. The same in El Salvador. I believe that can be done \nwithout Americanizing anything. Plus, what they want, as the Senator \nfrom North Dakota knows, are Russian weapons. They are familiar with \nRussian weapons, and they are readily available. So I am not certain \nthey would need a great deal of training.\n  But it just seems to me--and it is not just because I watch \ntelevision, it is not just because I visited there 5 years ago when all \nthis was just beginning to ferment--I think anybody, any objective \nobserver, would say no, no U.S. ground troops. We could even question \nairstrikes, but certainly no Americanization. But, finally, let us give \nthese innocent people a chance to defend themselves. That is all they \nare asking.\n  I thank my colleague from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/24/senate-section/article/S10537-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10538-S10540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LOBBYING DISCLOSURE ACT OF 1995\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to offer my very strong support for \nS. 1060, the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995.\n  This legislation is similar to that reported out by the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, which I was privileged to chair during the last \nCongress. Senators Levin and Cohen, in particular, deserve our words of \nhigh praise for their diligence and persistence in tackling such a \nthorny area and coming up with an effective and pragmatic bill.\n  Mr. President, there is blessed little credit given to those who \nbring up things like this. There is a lot of opposition. But these are \nthe things in the committee we used to jokingly call the ``grunt work'' \nof Government--the grunt work of Government--the good Government issues \nthat too often are not brought to the floor, and when they are brought \nto the floor, usually cause very little attention to be paid.\n  Senator Levin was President of the Detroit City Council before he \ncame to Washington. I have heard him talk many times about how he came \nin here with a burning purpose of doing regulatory reform, for \ninstance. We have been having that on the floor the last couple of \nweeks.\n  Now on lobbying reform, ethics in Government matters. That may be a \ncolumn note someplace, a short column note at the very best, usually, \non items like this. But they are items which become vitally important \nfor long-term \n\n[[Page S10539]]\nGovernment in this country and how our people look at Government, \nbecause we live in an age when, for whatever reason, people have lost \nconfidence in their Government.\n  There is a pervasive cynicism, if not outright skepticism, about the \nintegrity of Government institutions to carry out and serve the \npublic's interest.\n  Part of this distrust is the perception that Congress in particular \nis beholden to special interests and that ordinary people cannot rise \nabove the din of lobbyists having special access to and currying favor \nfrom Members of Congress or top officials in the executive branch.\n  I personally do not subscribe to this view. I feel it is more myth \nthan reality. However, as long as the perception is there, doubt and \nsuspicion will linger.\n  In my view, the issue is about access and accountability. We want to \nreturn power to the people. At long last, everyone will be able to know \nwho is paying what to lobby whom on which subject and on which issue.\n Whether it is a special tax loophole or a pork barrel project, people \nwant to know what is going on. The sunshine is always the best \ndisinfectant.\n\n  I am sure that most of us would much rather be talking and meeting \nwith those who elected us--our constituents--than some smooth-talking \nlobbyist. I, for one, was elected to represent the people of Ohio. And \nthey are who I want to hear from and will always give top priority to.\n  This bill provides for the effective disclosure of paid lobbyists who \nare trying to influence Federal legislative or executive branch \nofficials in the conduct of Government actions. It also affords us the \nfullest opportunity for citizens to exercise their constitutional right \nto petition the Government.\n  Nothing in this bill whatsoever would either restrict or prohibit our \nconstituents from writing, from calling, or from meeting with us. \nSenators Levin and Cohen have clarified that. They have also removed \nthe so-called grassroots lobbying provision which was used to thwart \nour efforts to get this bill enacted into law prior to adjournment last \nyear.\n  This legislation makes commonsense reforms in the registration and \ndisclosure process. It replaces the myriad of lobbying disclosure \nlaws--some with giant loopholes--with a single, uniform statute \ncovering all professional lobbyists. It also streamlines the disclosure \nrequirements to ensure that the public is provided with meaningful \ninformation, not some undecipherable code. The legislation also \nestablishes a workable system to administer and enforce compliance with \nthis act.\n  I think we are at a crucial crossroads, in my view, over the role of \nGovernment and people's respect for it. I believe this bill will \nenhance the public's awareness of and confidence in the functioning of \ntheir Government. It makes sure that public officials are accountable \nfor their actions. I think it will discourage lobbyists and their \nclients from engaging in less than proper activities.\n  Let me say this about lobbyists. I do not turn lobbyists away. I \nwelcome their information a lot of times because a lot of times they \ncan give you details of or insight into this particular area of \nexpertise that is welcome and should be considered. But to try and tie \nthat lobbyist up with whether they made a contribution or not is \nabsolutely wrong.\n  In short, effective lobbying disclosure would ensure that the public \nFederal officials and other interested parties are aware of the \npressures that are brought to bear on public policy. Now more than \never, so to speak.\n  At a time when major health and safety laws or regulations are being \ndebated on the Senate floor, the public is entitled to know what \nlobbyists we are meeting with in the back rooms, who they are \nrepresenting, and why they are here. Are they just passing through to \nsay ``hello?'' Are they here to persuade us to offer or support an \namendment to benefit a particular business or industry?\n  Effective public disclosure will build confidence in this body and \nerase the doubts and suspicions that the public is shut out from the \npeople's business.\n  So I think the changes proposed by Senators Levin and Cohen are \nsensible and they strengthen the workings of the bill. They deserve our \ncredit for leading this effort, though I regret we were prevented from \nacting upon this last year.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, has a quorum been entered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not in progress.\n  Mr. GLENN. I withdraw the request for a quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Ohio.\n  Mr. President, with regard now to the status of the situation on the \nfloor, we are on the bill. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Brown amendment No. 1838 is the business \nat hand.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, with the approval of the Senator from \nColorado, may I ask that his amendment be withdrawn. My amendment \nshould not take 5 or 10 minutes, unless the Senator from Colorado \nwishes to go forward.\n  Mr. BROWN. It would be appropriate to temporarily set it aside.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be \ntemporarily set aside and that we go forward with this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I thank my friend from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1839\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit certain exempt organizations from receiving \n                            Federal grants)\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1839.\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . EXEMPT ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n       An organization described in section 501(c)(4) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall not be eligible for the \n     receipt of Federal funds constituting an award, grant, \n     contract, loan, or any other form.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, that amendment is rather succinct.\n  I believe that the amendment I have just put forward embodies an \nabsolutely critical component of any truly meaningful lobbying reform. \nThe amendment is identical to a bill which I was pleased to introduce \nwith Senator Craig last Friday which has already attracted over a dozen \ncosponsors.\n  By unanimous consent, Mr. President, we now split the underlying \nlegislation into two complementary components--lobbying reform and gift \nban legislation. I think all of us must agree that the issue of \nlobbyists' gifts to Senators must be dealt with in any attempt to \nprotect the ethical framework of our activities here. I commend my \nfriend from Michigan who came here when I did, Senator Levin, and many \nothers who have worked so diligently on these issues of lobbying and \ngifts--and Senator McConnell and so many others.\n  But my amendment gets to the heart of another major piece of the \npuzzle, one which we have inadequately dealt with thus far. This is the \nother side of the coin. This is about Congress' gifts to lobbyists in \nthe forms of grants, loans and other benefits.\n  Very simply, Mr. President, my amendment would forbid the delivery of \nFederal grant money to any 501(c)(4) organization--501(c)(4). Please \nhear that very seriously constricted and limited impact. This is an \nabsolutely vital and fundamental and long overdue reform.\n  I trust my colleagues may be fully aware of the relevant sections of \nthe Internal Revenue Code pertaining to tax-exempt organizations. If \nso, they will see why this reform is absolutely necessary, and should \nbe, I think, uncontroversial.\n  First, let me assure my colleagues who may be wary upon initially \nhearing of this legislation. This amendment does not affect charities, \nnor any of the other tax-exempt groups which Members will certainly \nwish to protect, and should.\n  This amendment would not affect any organization that is organized \n\n[[Page S10540]]\n  under section 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(5) or 501(c)6 or any of the other 25 \ncategories, or maybe more, if I recall, of the Internal Revenue code. \nAnd I would remind my colleagues that 501(c)(3), which is not affected \nby this legislation, this amendment--this is the one that encourages \nactivities, that are, and I quote directly from the code, 501(c)(3)'s \nare not affected by this amendment, are to ``Relieving the poor and \ndistressed,'' or for ``Advancing religion or education.'' Thus, this \namendment would not affect the Salvation Army, nor any other of the \neducational institutions in your State or any ``charities.'' Nor would \nit affect the tax-exempt groups that file under 501(c)(5) or 501(c)(6) \nof the Internal Revenue Code. These organizations include the labor \norganizations, and business organizations, groups such as the chamber \nof commerce, and the AFL-CIO--not dealt with here; no impact at all.\n  This amendment deals very directly with section 501(c)(4) only. You \ncan read that, the big lobbyists, the big boys and girls, and quite a \nlist. That is the category that some organizations have chosen to file \nunder when they want to spend an unlimited amount of money on the \nlobbying of the Congress. Unlike a 501(c)(3) which has a floating cap \non how much can be spent on lobbying, there is no such cap on a \n501(c)(4), none.\n  This means that an organization under 501(c)(4) can under current law \nenjoy a tax exemption, enjoy receiving the Federal grant money and \nenjoy spending untold millions--that is the number, untold millions--\nlobbying the Congress. This is huge loophole benefiting the powerful \nlobbyists at the expense of the collective interests of our citizenry. \nIt is small wonder that we have such difficulty here casting votes to \nbenefit the average citizen and Americans when we are simultaneously \nsubsidizing the programs and activities of some of our largest lobbying \ngroups. This is a reform that absolutely must be made, and soon. And \nthere is no better place than I think the time today because there is a \nfundamental basic incompatibility between the current construction of \n501(c)(4) law and the delivery of Federal grant money.\n  I feel, after looking at it as carefully as I can, that rather than \nto design the limitations on the lobbying, or other advocacy activities \nof the 501(c)(4) organizations, that we should simply acknowledge that \nthis is not the provision of the Tax Code under which altruistic, \ncaring, charitable groups file. They do not file under 501(c)(4). But \nrather, this designation attracts those groups that are organized \nprincipally to lobby the Federal Government, and do so without \nfinancial limitations.\n  There are, of course, and be assured, countless fine organizations \ndoing good work and good works, organized under 501(c)(4) of the Tax \nCode.\n And if they wish to continue their administration of Federal grant \nmoney, certainly we should encourage them to file as a 501(c)(3) or any \nother available provision of the Tax Code.\n\n  My amendment would not prevent the truly altruistic groups from doing \njust that, but if they wish to enjoy the benefits of 501(c)(4) and also \nenjoy the special privilege to lobby just as many bucks as their bank \naccount will allow, then they should not be paid off in Federal grant \nmoney.\n  I hope we might receive bipartisan support for this amendment, good \nbipartisan support. I have heard some of my colleagues take the floor \nat other times during this year to state that such lobbying activities \nshould not be underwritten by the Federal Government. I have heard some \non the other side of the aisle say that the NRA in particular should \nnot be receiving Federal grant money. Many concur.\n  So this is the Senate's chance to put an end to these conflicts of \ninterest. I hope the Senators on both sides of the aisle will support \nthis needed reform and vote to curtail the delivery of grant money to \nthese, the most powerful lobbying groups and organizations in America. \nIt is really a fundamental test of our sincerity in removing the \ndecisionmaking process from obvious conflicts of interest. I ask my \ncolleagues for their support with regard to the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I will yield to Senator Brown whenever he wishes the \nfloor, but let me speak another few moments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/24/senate-section/article/S10538-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON.

Mr. President, before the Senator from Wyoming leaves \nthe floor, I listened carefully to the explanation of his amendment, \nand I wanted to commend him for what I think is an outstanding \namendment, a very important contribution to the underlying legislation. \nI fully intend to support him and encourage this effort. I wish to \nthank him for his leadership in this area.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky. No one \nhas been more vitally involved in these issues than my friend from \nKentucky, Senator McConnell. And those are powerfully reliable words. I \nappreciate it very much.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Currently the Simpson amendment No. 1839 is \npending.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, it is not my intention to preclude further \ndebate on the Simpson amendment. Obviously, I join him in the hopes \nthat it will pass and be accepted. But would the Senator be comfortable \nif I temporarily set it aside and move back to the Brown amendment?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we temporarily set aside \nthe Simpson amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1838\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, are we now considering the Brown amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, the Brown amendment is now the pending \nbusiness.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, it is my intention to offer three \namendments for consideration of the body. The first one, as we have \nspelled out, is the reporting categories; that they are meaningful in \nreporting the value and, as we have already discussed, a current \nlimitation of closing the valuation at $1 million could be very \nmisleading.\n  The second amendment I hope to offer is one that deals with qualified \nblind trusts. Currently, the statutes under which we operate provide \nthat a recipient or beneficiary of a qualified blind trust is allowed \nunder a qualified blind trust to be advised of the total cash value on \na periodic basis.\n  Our amendment, the second amendment we will offer, simply would make \nit clear that if one is advised of their total cash value, under the \nstatutes, of a qualified blind trust, that total cash value--not the \nvalue of the assets underneath but the total cash value--is disclosed.\n  The third amendment is one that will deal with personal residences \nthat exceed $1 million. While there may be very few of these--at least \nI do not anticipate there would be very many--there is a tax \nimplication which was passed by previous Congresses in regard to \nvaluation of a residence. That tax rule that Members are familiar with \ninvolves financing of a personal residence in excess of $1 million and \nimposes limitations or, to be more precise, limits the deductibility \nfor tax purposes. Inasmuch as that tax provision exists and raises \npotential conflict of interest for Members voting who might come under \nthat provision, the third amendment would provide for the reporting of \npersonal residences in excess of $1 million. \n\n[[Page S10541]]\n\n  Mr. President, as I understand it, Members are now considering the \nfirst amendment, which would expand our reporting categories, and it \nwould be my intention to allow this to proceed under a voice vote, if \nthat is the wish of Members of the Senate, so that we could maximize \nthe use of our time.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, it will be my intention to lay down the \nother amendments that I have referred to. So I rise at this point for \nthe purpose of offering an amendment. First, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the pending Brown amendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1840\n\n (Purpose: To amend title I of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to \nrequire the disclosure of the value of any personal residence in excess \n                             of $1,000,000)\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1840.\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . DISCLOSURE OF THE VALUE OF ANY PERSONAL RESIDENCE IN \n                   EXCESS OF $1,000,000 UNDER THE ETHICS IN \n                   GOVERNMENT ACT OF 1978.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 102(a) of the Ethics in Government \n     Act of 1978 is amended by adding at the end thereof the \n     following:\n       ``(8) The category of value of any property used solely as \n     a personal residence of the reporting individual or the \n     spouse of the individual which exceeds $1,000,000.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 102(d)(1) of the Ethics \n     in Government Act of 1978 is amended by striking ``and (5)'' \n     and inserting ``(5), and (8)''.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this second amendment is quite \nstraightforward, and it was the reason I thought it appropriate to \nallow it to be read in full. What it does is fill a gap in our \nreporting requirements. Since we have specific legislation that \nprovides separate tax treatment if someone borrows more than $1 million \non a personal residence, there is currently an issue before Congress in \nterms of a tax policy where the ownership of a residence in excess of \n$1 million in value presents a potential conflict of interest.\n  Thus, this amendment would fill the gap in our current reporting \nrequirements. It would allow disclosure of personal residences that are \nin excess of $1 million or, I should say more precisely, it provides \nfor that disclosure and would provide information with regard to \npotential conflict of interest when voting on tax issues of that kind.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the second Brown \namendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1841\n\n (Purpose: To amend title I of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to \n require an individual filing a financial disclosure form to disclose \n the total cash value of the interest of the individual in a qualified \n                              blind trust)\n\n  Mr. BROWN.

The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1841.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST IN QUALIFIED BLIND \n                   TRUST.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 102(a) of the Ethics in Government \n     Act of 1978 is amended by adding at the end thereof the \n     following:\n       ``(8) The category of the total cash value of any interest \n     of the reporting individual in a qualified blind trust, \n     unless the trust investment was executed prior to July 24, \n     1995 and precludes the beneficiary from receiving information \n     on the total cash value of any interest in the qualified \n     blind trust.''\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 102(d)(1) of the Ethics \n     in Government Act of 1978 is amended by striking ``and (5)'' \n     and inserting ``(5), and (8)''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the \n     amendment made by this section shall apply with respect to \n     reports filed under title I of the Ethics in Government Act \n     of 1978 for calendar year 1996 and thereafter.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, Brown amendment No. 1841 deals specifically \nwith qualified blind trust. Under the current statutes, we provide an \nexception or an exemption from reporting, and it is done only in an \narea where a trust is involved and where it meets the standards of \nqualified blind trust under law.\n  Under the statutes of a qualified blind trust, the beneficiary of \nthat trust is allowed to receive certain information. The beneficiary \nis allowed to be advised of the earnings of that trust, which is \nobviously necessary for tax purposes, and also under the law is allowed \nto receive information of the total cash value of that trust and can be \nreported to the beneficiary as often as four times a year under the \ncurrent statute.\n  Ironically, though, we have exempted the beneficiary from disclosing \nthat information which they are allowed to receive under the terms of \nthe qualified blind trust. This amendment merely provides that the \ntotal cash value be reported, along with the other information in \nsomeone's disclosure. It does not require disclosure of the assets in \nwhich the trust is invested. But it does provide that the beneficiary \nof that trust report the information that they receive from the trust; \nthat is, the total cash value.\n  Mr. President, there is a specific exemption included in the third \nBrown amendment, that is amendment No. 1841. That exemption is this: If \nsomeone is the beneficiary of a qualified blind trust and that trust \nwas executed prior to today and the terms of that trust precludes the \nbeneficiary from receiving information on the total cash value, then \none need not report it.\n  So while the statute allows people to receive information on the \ntotal cash value, it is certainly possible that some Members operate or \nreceive benefits under a trust that does not advise them of that total \ncash value. It would be our intention to not push those Members into a \ndifficult bind under these circumstances and, thus, we have provided \nthis exception; that is, if the terms of the trust do not allow the \nbeneficiary to be advised of its total cash value, then the Member \nwould be exempt from having to report that information; that is, it \nwould not have to report the information that they do not have and \ncannot get under the terms of the qualified trust.\n  The change, though, is this: If someone has a qualified blind trust \nand is advised under the terms of that trust the total cash value, then \nthey would no longer be exempt from reporting that. It, in effect, puts \nMembers on equal footing. It seems to me this fills a very important \nloophole in our current disclosure provisions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we temporarily set aside \namendment No. 1841 and return to the Brown amendment No. 1838.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, just briefly, I want to commend the \nSenator from Colorado for three excellent amendments that I think fit \nthe spirit of the underlying legislation, and I want to commend him for \npresenting them. I fully intend to support them and hope the Senate \nwill as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator the Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a question on amendment No. \n1841?\n  Mr. BROWN. Sure.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As I understand the amendment, the categories of total \ncash value of any interest of the reporting individual would be the \nsame categories as are provided by law for other assets; is that \ncorrect?\n\n[[Page S10542]]\n\n  Mr. BROWN. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So if Brown amendment No. 1838 were adopted, it would be \nthe new categories as provided in Brown amendment No. 1838 that would \nbe applied to the blind trust situation.\n  Mr. BROWN. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. On Brown amendment No. 1840, the one relating to the value \nof a house, is it my understanding that the valuation of the home would \nbe done in accordance with one of the various methods of valuation \nwhich are currently allowed for other assets?\n  Mr. BROWN. That is correct, in my understanding. The Senator, I know, \nis well versed in this and may be willing to straighten me out on this, \nbut my understanding is you can report historic costs if you do not \nhave a firm fix on what the current valuation is.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My recollection is, and I am not sure I do have any \ngreater knowledge than my friend from Colorado, but my recollection is \nthat there are at least three methods of valuation which are allowed \nfor real estate. You can take cost--I think there is a depreciation \nfactor--historic valuation, there is a tax assessment valuation and \nthere are a number of other ways, perhaps. But whatever it is that is \nallowed for real estate under the current requirements would be allowed \nwhen it comes to the valuation of a home under Brown amendment No. \n1840; is that correct?\n  Mr. BROWN. That is correct. I might say that it certainly would not \nbe my intention to require in any way an annual appraisal or something \nlike that. I think the alternatives that exist in law, at least in my \nview, are more than satisfactory for reasonable disclosure.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we are attempting to determine whether or \nnot there are Senators that wish to debate any of the three Brown \namendments, and pending that determination, I ask that the amendments \neither be laid aside so that we can return to some other business, or \nif anybody else wishes to come to the floor to debate the bill or any \nof the amendments which have already been laid aside, that they do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, for clarification purposes, I wanted to \nmention for the Record what I think is an important aspect of this. \nAmendment No. 1841, which deals with the qualified blind trust, uses \nthe term ``total cash value.'' The reason that we use that term is that \nit is the precise language that the current statute uses; that is, the \ncurrent statutes provide that you can have a trust that qualifies as a \nqualified blind trust and still report to the beneficiary the total \ncash value. So that is the origin of that.\n  In contacting the Ethics Committee, we sought to learn what was meant \nby the term ``total cash value.'' We are advised that they do not have \nan independent legal opinion on the use of that term, even though they \nhave questions about its usage in filing. But we are also advised that \nthey believe that it means and relates to, in effect, the value of the \ntrust, market value of the trust, the value it would have if the trust \nwere converted to cash on the current market.\n  It seems to me that is a reasonable definition, and it is certainly \nwith that understanding in mind that we have used that term; that is, \nto give full disclosure to what is the current value under the current \nmarket conditions of the value of that trust, those trust assets.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield for an \nadditional question which relates to line 1 on page 2. It says there, \n``the category of the total cash value of any interest of the reporting \nindividual.''\n  I want to see if my understanding is correct. Is the cash value of \ninterest related purely to the value of the asset? And is my \nunderstanding correct that this amendment does not require the \ndisclosure of income from that asset? Or is that already required under \nlaw?\n  Mr. BROWN. It is my understanding that the law already requires the \nreporting of income accruing to the beneficiary of the trust, but in \nthe past has not required the disclosure of the total cash value of the \nunderlying assets.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So whatever the current law is relative to disclosure of \nincome from the qualified blind trust, it is not affected by this \namendment?\n  Mr. BROWN. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1839\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, last week I introduced legislation on this \nfloor to deal with the very topic that the Senator from Wyoming came to \nthe floor earlier this afternoon to introduce, an amendment to the \nlobby reform bill that is now pending before the Senate. The issue is \nthe Federal Advocacy Reform Act of 1995, and to be able to deal with it \nin the amendment form tied to this is most appropriate.\n  For a few moments this afternoon I would like to talk briefly about \nthe scope of this amendment and why I think it is so important for us \nto consider in the context of Federal lobbying.\n  People are correctly focused on lobbyists and gifts to legislators as \nthe Senate convenes today to debate these important topics. But I think \nwe also need to worry about Government's gifts to lobbyists. Some of my \ncolleagues would say, ``Senator, what are you talking about?'' But the \nSenator from Wyoming, Al Simpson, this afternoon very clearly laid out \nthe growing phenomenon in this country of more and more Federal tax \ndollars going in the form of contracts and grants, and in some \ninstances outright gifts, to advocacy groups which then allows them to \nuse the tax base, the tax dollars of this country, to argue their maybe \nvery narrow point of view. The question is, is this in the best \ninterests of our country? Should we allow these kinds of things to go \non?\n  It is not a new question that we ask. Mr. President, 75 years ago \nSenators stood on this floor and clearly argued that Federal tax \ndollars should not be used for the purpose of advocacy for a narrow or \nsingle purpose. But Federal tax dollars should at least be spread for \nthe common good and they should be cautiously used, but in all cases \nthe common good or the broad base of the American public's interests \nought to be at mind.\n  Over the last good number of years, we have watched grow to a point \nnow where over $70 billion annually in the form of grants go out to a \nbroad cross-section of interests across this country, and in many \ninstances, then, we find those tax dollars right back here on the \ndoorstep of the U.S. Capitol, being advocacy dollars for sometimes a \nvery narrow, specific point of view.\n  I think it is now time for this Senate, as we debate the broader \nquestion of lobbying, to argue, is that the right thing to do? With \nnearly a $5 trillion debt, a $200 billion deficit, and the very real \nconcern that this year for the first time this Congress is going to \nestablish increasingly narrow and tighter public priorities as to where \nour dollars get spent, is it not time we do the same in this area and \nwith these categories?\n  Our associates and friends in the House are approaching it from a \ndifferent point of view. Amendments will be offered before the \nappropriations process over there that will deal with more than the \n501(c)(4) category inside the Internal Revenue Code that the Senator \nfrom Wyoming and I are discussing this afternoon. They will talk about \nthe ``not for profits'' and ``for profits,'' the 501(c)(3)'s and all of \nthose that fall under the broad category of section 501 of the IRS \nCode.\n  But, today, our amendment is very clear and it is narrow. It says \nthat, for those not-for-profit advocacy groups, who choose to be, for \ntheir purpose, advocating a point of view, that they should be \ndisallowed from receiving Federal dollars. It is very straightforward \nand very simple in its approach.\n  When I introduced S. 1056 last week, Senator Simpson worked with me \nin the cosponsorship of that, along with my colleague from Idaho, Dirk \nKempthorne, and Senator Coverdell, Senator Gregg, Senator Nickles, \nSenator Lott, Senator Kyl, Senator \n\n[[Page S10543]]\nGrams, and Senator Faircloth, and it was only but for a few moments on \nFriday that I worked that issue. Obviously it is one of great concern \nand I think very popular, and it ought to be debated here on the floor \nand tied to this important legislation we are dealing with this \nafternoon.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a position paper \ndeveloped by the Heritage Foundation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Heritage Foundation]\n\nRestoring Integrity to Government: Ending Taxpayer-Subsidized Lobbying \n                               Activities\n\n       To compel a man to furnish funds for the propagation of \n     ideas he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical.--\n     Thomas Jefferson.\n\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       The federal government subsidizes lobbying by tax-exempt \n     and other organizations through grants and contracts to \n     advocacy groups. Each year, the American taxpayers provide \n     more than $39 billion in grants to organizations which may \n     use the money to advance their political agendas.\n       Federal funding of private advocacy is not limited by \n     ideological scope. Organizations to the left and right of the \n     political center use taxpayers' funds to promote their ideas \n     and positions. Almost every interest in America--from \n     agriculture to zoology--has one or more organizations \n     receiving government funding. Recipients range from the \n     American Association of Retired Persons, which received over \n     $73 million in a one-year period, to the American Bar \n     Association, which received $2.2 million. Over the past forty \n     years, Congress has helped create a vast patronage network or \n     organizations that enjoy tax-preferred status, receive \n     federal funds, and engage in legislative or political \n     advocacy. The days of big city political machines disbursing \n     patronage may be coming to an end, but the disbursement of \n     financial dividends to political friends is a prominent \n     feature of the federal budget. As Heritage Foundation Senior \n     Fellow Marshall Breger has written:\n       ``Lacking the imprimatur of democratic consent, government \n     subsidy of private advocacy can be seen for what it is--the \n     public patronage of selected political beliefs. That these \n     advocacy subsidies are rarely made openly but are often \n     disguised through grants and contracts for legitimate\n      public functions merely underscore the dangers inherent in a \n     system of expansive government subsidy.''\\1\\\n     Footnotes at the end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Clearly, the right to petition government to redress \n     grievances should not be infringed. Individuals and \n     organizations using funds from the private sector should be \n     encouraged to engage in the legislative and political \n     process. It is an entirely different matter, however, to \n     employ the coercive power of the federal government to force \n     taxpayers to finance organizations which lobby Congress or \n     other government entities. It is every bit as unjust to force \n     liberal taxpayers to fund organizations on the right as it is \n     to force conservative taxpayers to finance organizations on \n     the left. The fundamental principle is that it should be \n     anathema to force taxpayers to underwrite advocacy with which \n     they disagree.\n       Taxpayer funding of advocacy organizations is wrong--\n     fiscally, morally, and logically. It is fiscally \n     irresponsible to spend federal revenues on activities that \n     provide no meaningful return to the American people. It is \n     morally wrong for the government to take sides in any public \n     policy debate by assisting the advocacy activities of an \n     elite few. And it is logically wrong for the government to \n     fund activities that often result in lobbying for increased \n     federal expenditures. The reasons are summarized aptly by \n     George Mason University professor James T. Bennett and Loyola \n     College professor Thomas J. DiLorenzo in their comprehensive \n     study, Destroying Democracy.\n       ``A large number of individuals with strong views can \n     express their preferences by contributing funds to a group \n     that promotes that issue. With tax-funded politics, however, \n     a small number of zealots with access to the public purse can \n     obtain resources from government to advance its views even \n     though few individuals in society share the group's \n     philosophy. Whenever government funds any political advocacy \n     group, it effectively penalizes those groups that advocate \n     opposing public policies and provides a distinct advantage to \n     the group or groups that it favors in the clash of \n     ideas.''\\2\\\n\n\n                         the funding of faction\n\n       The Founding Fathers recognized the dangers of factions in \n     a republic. James Madison wrote in Federalist Number 10 that \n     ``Among the numerous advantages promised by a well-\n     constructed Union, none deserves to be more accurately \n     developed than its tendency to break and control the violence \n     of faction.'' Madison defined faction as ``a number of \n     citizens, whether amounting to a majority or minority of the \n     whole, who are united and actuated by some impulse of \n     passion, or of interest, adverce to the rights of other \n     citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the \n     community.''\n       What the Founding Fathers referred to as factions we now \n     call special interests. Instead of restraining factions, \n     however, the federal government today subsidizes them. This \n     distorts the political process by favoring one faction over \n     another and by nourishing\n      a network of special interests--a welfare-industrial \n     complex--with a direct self-interest in a growth of the \n     welfare state. The financial cost to the taxpayer is far \n     higher than the amount funneled to these organizations. \n     Each one not only lobbies for its contract or grant, but \n     also advocates for bigger, more expensive social welfare \n     programs, further complicating efforts to put the nation's \n     fiscal house in order. Moreover, while these organizations \n     often claim that the money they receive helps the less \n     fortunate, the reality is that it bolsters their own \n     political power, perks, and prestige.\n       The advocacy network and its leaders contribute to what \n     author James Payne has referred to as a ``culture of \n     spending'' in Washington which makes it extremely difficult \n     to trim government programs: ``Leaders of such federally \n     dependent interest groups should not be seen as representing \n     independent citizen opinion. They are quasi-governmental \n     officials with a vested interest in the spending programs \n     that benefit their organizations.''\\3\\\n       Not every dollar given to an advocacy group goes directly \n     to political advocacy activities. However, federal dollars \n     are fungible. Every federal dollar frees private resources to \n     be spent on political, lobbying, and other advocacy \n     activities. Moreover, federal funds make the organization \n     appear to be a larger force in the political arena than it \n     would if it were totally reliant upon private contributions. \n     For example, the National Council of Senior Citizens receives \n     96 percent of its funding from the federal government.\n       The NCSC is but one of many advocacy organizations \n     receiving federal funds. Here are just a few other examples:\n       The AFL-CIO benefited from more than $2,000,000 between \n     July 1993 and June 1994. According to the AFL-CIO News \n     Online, the AFL-CIO used the Memorial Day recess to increase \n     pressure on Members of Congress with its ``Stand UP'' \n     campaign: ``In those [5 targeted] districts, the AFL-CIO \n     provided radio ads and coordinators to work with local union \n     officials and legislative action committees. Other activity \n     included direct mail, jobsite leafleting, phone call drives \n     using the AFL-CIO's toll-free hotline, petition drives, town \n     meeting attendance, and letters and columns submitted to \n     local newspapers.''\\4\\\n       Recently, the Service Employees International Union \n     produced a newspaper advertisement opposing tax cuts and \n     efforts in Congress to slow the growth of welfare and \n     Medicare. SEIU claims Congress is attempting to ``loot'' \n     welfare programs and ``steal'' from low-income home-energy \n     assistance to help finance ``corporate special interests.'' \n     The ad lamented the impact on Fannie Johnson and her family \n     in Ohio.\\5\\ This labor special interest benefited from \n     $137,000 in taxpayer funding in 1993 (for an ``anti-\n     discrimination public education campaign''). Terminating it \n     would eliminate the tax burden of nearly 30 families just \n     like Ms. Johnson's in Ohio.\n       Families USA--a driving force behind the Clinton big-\n     government health care plan, including the failed last-ditch \n     attempt to revive it last summer through a nationwide bus \n     tour\\6\\--received $250,000 from the taxpayers between July \n     1993 and June 1994.\n       The Child Welfare League of America received more than \n     $250,000 in federal funding, then turned around and launched \n     an ad campaign to increase welfare spending. The League ran \n     an advertisement opposing the Contract With America's welfare \n     reform bill which charged that ``More children will be \n     killed. More children will be raped.''\\7\\\n       The National Trust for Historic Preservation received \n     approximately $7 million from the federal government in FY \n     1994--22 percent of its budget. In the same year, the Trust \n     ``launched a lobbying campaign against the Disney project'' \n     in Northern Virginia.\\8\\ In 1993, it ``lobbi[ed] Congress to \n     expand the historic rehabilitation tax credit.''\\9\\ The \n     group's president, Walter Mondale's former chief of staff \n     Richard Moe, said the full credit would cost ``$1.4 billion \n     over five years.''\\10\\\n       The American Nurses Association received nearly $1 million \n     between July 1993 and June 1994 from the U.S. taxpayers. In \n     1994, the ANA endorsed the Gephardt health care plan and \n     actively lobbied for it. According to the union's own press \n     release announcing this endorsement, ``The American Nurses \n     Association is the only full-service professional \n     organization representing the nation's 2.2 million Registered \n     Nurses through its 53 constituent associations. ANA advances \n     the nursing profession by ... lobbying Congress and \n     regulatory agencies on health care issues affecting nurses \n     and the public.''\\11\\ The Political Finance and Lobby \n     Reporter revealed on May 12, 1995, that two new ANA lobbyists \n     had registered.\n       The American Federation of State, County and Municipal \n     Employees, which received nearly $150,000 in the most recent \n     grant reporting period, denounced the House welfare plan, \n     saying it ``will drive more families into poverty and turns \n     its back on hardworking Americans who fall on bad times. This \n     is the small print in their evil Contract on America.'' \n     AFSCME President Gerald McEntee went on to say that ``AFSCME \n     will continue to fight for real welfare reform that includes \n\n[[Page S10544]]\n     jobs at decent wages, child care, health care and education and \n     training.''\\12\\\n       Actually, however, government funding of advocacy \n     organizations can hurt their cause. Well-grounded public \n     policy institutions prosper from strong grassroots support \n     backed by individual financial contributions. Much like a \n     profitable company, they can measure support by looking at \n     how many people were willing to open their checkbooks for the \n     cause:\n       The plain fact is that political advocacy groups will not \n     flourish on the basis of government subsidy. Rather they will \n     prosper only insofar as they develop financial roots in the \n     polity. Reliance on the government trough is no sign of the \n     commitment of your adherents to your cause.\\13\\\n\n\n                           Not a New Problem\n\n       Federally funded advocacy is not a new problem. Congress \n     recognized the potential for abuse more than 75 years ago \n     when it passed a law prohibiting the use of federal funds for \n     political advocacy. Unfortunately, the prohibition was too \n     vague, too lenient, and too weakly enforced. Put simply, \n     auditing of federal grants by the government does not provide \n     the level of scrutiny needed to root out abuse.\n       The scope of the problem can be seen by examining the \n     Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, published every six \n     months by the federal government. It details nearly every \n     federal program from which eligible individuals, \n     organizations, and governments can receive tens of billions \n     of dollars in taxpayer funding.\n       For years, congressional offices have worked with \n     constituents to help them find federal grants, in the process \n     becoming very familiar with the Catalog as a guide to \n     sources. But very few congressional staff employees have been \n     aware of abuses in the grants process. These abuses are long-\n     standing. In testimony before the House Committee on \n     Government Operations in 1983, Joseph Wright of the Office of \n     Management and Budget noted that the General Accounting \n     Office had found problems as far back as 1948.\\14\\\n       In the early years of the Reagan Administration, the OMB \n     attempted to revise OMB Circular A-122 (originally issued in \n     the final year of the Carter Administration) to redefine \n     limits on ``allowable costs'' by federal grantees. The \n     revision, first released in January 1983, was widely \n     criticized as overly broad, excessively burdensome, and \n     unenforceable.\n       One of the focal points of the initial debates was the fact \n     that the original OMB proposal apparently would have \n     disallowed the use of any equipment, personnel, or office \n     space for both federal grant and political advocacy purposes \n     if at least 5 percent of the organization's resources was \n     used for lobbying. For example, a copy machine could not be \n     used to produce flyers for a rally on Capitol Hill if it was \n     paid for--in whole or in part--by taxpayer funds. Many \n     nonprofits objected to such clear separation between federal \n     funding and political advocacy.\n       Months later, OMB Director David Stockman and General \n     Counsel Michael Horowitz withdrew the original proposal and \n     released a new draft with a more narrow definition of \n     prohibited activities. This watered-down version no longer \n     drew a clear line between allowable and unallowable costs. \n     Instead, it specified a few examples of prohibited behavior, \n     including a prohibition on reimbursement for conferences used \n     in ``substantial'' part to promote lobbying activities.\n       Unfortunately, this effort to appease federally funded \n     nonprofits and quell opposition in Congress was futile. \n     Because Congress signaled its clear opposition to working \n     with the Reagan Administration to curb federally funded \n     lobbying activities, despite the fact that all parties \n     acknowledged such behavior was inappropriate, A-122 failed to \n     improve substantially the restrictions on lobbyists billing \n     Uncle Sam for their activities.\n\n\n                 existing prohibitions are not working\n\n       Federal law prohibits the use of federal funds for lobbying \n     (18 U.S.C. Section 1913). However, there is no clear set of \n     guidelines as to specific prohibited practices. In addition, \n     numerous appropriations riders have been offered and approved \n     in the past in an effort to curb federally subsidized \n     lobbying. The purpose of the Reagan Administration's attempt \n     to create a more stringent version of OMB Circular A-122 was \n     to tighten the gaping loopholes in existing law and to \n     implement Congress's intent in passing lobbying prohibitions.\n       Circular A-122 drew on several distinct concepts to frame \n     the new guidelines.\n       Taxpayers are not obliged to fund advocacy they oppose. The \n     Supreme Court in 1977 ruled that taxpayers are not required, \n     directly or indirectly, ``to contribute to the support of an \n     ideological cause [they] may oppose.'' (Abood v. Detroit \n     Board of Education)\n       Freedom of speech does not depend on federal funding. In \n     1983, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the federal \n     government ``is not required by the First Amendment to \n     subsidize lobbying. . . . We again reject the notion that \n     First Amendment rights are somehow not fully realized unless \n     they are subsidized by the State.'' (Reagan v. Taxation with \n     Representation)\n       The Internal Revenue Code does not alleviate the problem. \n     The notice of the request for public comment on the second \n     revision of A-122 notes that current IRS rules threaten tax-\n     preferred organizations only if they exceed defined limits on \n     lobbying. However, the limits are not tied in any way to the \n     receipt of federal funds, leading to many of the same \n     problems from which the 1919 law prohibiting federally funded \n     lobbying suffers.\n       Unfortunately, the firestorm created by the first proposed \n     revision of A-122 led to a second draft that watered down the \n     tough initial provisions and failed to solve the problems \n     outlined by the Administration in presenting its proposals. \n     The notice of public comment on the second proposal stated \n     that its ``purpose [was] assuring compliance with a myriad of \n     statutory provisions mandating that no federal funds used for \n     lobbying purposes, and to comply, in balanced fashion, with \n     fundamental First Amendment imperatives.'' Despite the best \n     of intentions, the revised A-122 did not meet these goals.\n       A particularly serious provision of the second revision was \n     its enforcement mechanism. A popular maxim in the 1980s was \n     ``trust but verify.'' OMB Circular A-122 relied on trust \n     alone:\n       ``[T]he federal government will rely upon [the nonprofit \n     employee's] good faith certification of lobbying time below \n     25%. . . . Under the proposal, the absence of time logs or \n     similar records not kept pursuant to grantee or\n      contractor discretion will no longer serve as a basis of \n     contesting or disallowing claims for indirect cost \n     employees.''\n       In essence, this lack of verification of time spent on \n     lobbying activities permits the individual to state that he \n     is complying with the law even if that is not the case. This \n     is worse than the fox guarding the henhouse. If a nonprofit \n     is willing to violate the restrictions on advocacy, surely it \n     will have no qualms about certifying it is in compliance with \n     the law.\n\n\n                      tougher restrictions needed\n\n       Tougher laws are needed to prevent the abuse of taxpayers' \n     funds by federal grantees. There is no excuse for compelling \n     John Q. Public to support political advocacy that he opposes. \n     It is fiscally irresponsible and morally indefensible.\n       The following should be essential parts of any \n     congressional efforts to curb current abuses:\n       Truth in Testimony. Witnesses testifying before Congress \n     should be required to divulge in their oral and written \n     testimonies whether they receive federal funds and, if so, \n     for what purpose and in what amount. This will permit \n     committees to view the testimony in an appropriate light.\n       No Federal Funding for Advocacy. No organization that \n     receives federal funds should be permitted engage in any \n     thing but incidental lobbying activities, except on issues \n     directly related to its tax status.\n       No Bureaucratic Shell Games. No recipient of federal funds \n     should be permitted to maintain organizational ties to any \n     entity that engages in lobbying activity. All subgrantees \n     should be treated as it they received the funds directly from \n     the federal government. Independent Sector, an organization \n     representing hundreds of nonprofit advocacy groups, \n     unwittingly indicated the need for this in a recent report: \n     ``Although the non-profit organization received a check from \n     the local government, the local government may have received \n     some or all of its funding for this project from a Federal \n     Community Development Block Grant (CDBG).''\\15\\\n       Meaningful Auditing. The Inspectors General of the various \n     federal departments and agencies must investigate more \n     thoroughly any abuses of current law, as well as new laws \n     passed by the Congress.\n       Tough Penalties. The consequences for violating the \n     prohibition on federally subsidized lobbying must be \n     sufficient to discourage organizations from violating the \n     standards. Under no circumstances should any organization \n     that willingly and knowingly violates the prohibitions \n     receive further federal funding.\n       Representative Robert K. Dornan (R-CA) has introduced H.R. \n     1130, the Integrity in Government Act, which would prohibit a \n     recipient or paid representative of any federal award, grant, \n     or contract from lobbying in the following circumstances:\n       In favor of continuing the award, grant, or contract;\n       In favor of the actual program under which the funds were \n     disbursed;\n       In favor of any other program within the broad department \n     or agency; and\n       In favor of continued department or agency funding.\n       The Dornan legislation also prohibits tax-exempt lobbying \n     organizations from receiving federal funds. Representatives \n     Bob Ehrlich (R-MD), Ernset Istook (R-OK), and David McIntosh \n     (R-IN) also are working on legislation to remedy this \n     problem.\n       It is difficult to craft legislation that satisfactorily \n     defines prohibited activities. More-over, any bill designed \n     to redress these abuses must prevent organizations from \n     simply establishing separate bank accounts and separate \n     names. To be effective, there must be a definite and complete \n     physical separation between all federally and privately \n     funded resources.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       Taxpayer-subsidized political advocacy represents pure \n     fiscal folly and moral injustice. No hard-working American \n     should be compelled to finance lobbying activities with which \n     he disagrees. The Founding Fathers would be appalled at \n     current federal grant making. Thirteen years ago, The \n     Washington Post editorialized:\n       ``[W]e agree that there is something disturbing about \n     organizations that strongly \n\n[[Page S10545]]\n     advocate positions many sensible people find politically or morally \n     repugnant, acting at the same time as administrators of \n     government programs. It is easy to believe that the advocacy \n     groups' employees will sometimes proselytize the program's \n     beneficiaries in ways we would consider inappropriate (though \n     not unheard of) for a civil servant. Advocacy organizations \n     might also want to ask themselves whether they risk \n     compromising their own purposes by accepting government \n     money, and whether they want to assume the inevitable risk \n     that it might be withdrawn suddenly for legitimate political \n     reasons.''\\16\\\n       Abuse of federal grant funds must be stopped. Tougher \n     restrictions are needed to prevent lobbying organizations \n     from obtaining some or most of their revenue from the \n     American taxpayers. Auditing and investigation of federal \n     grantees by the Executive Branch must be strengthened. \n     However, a danger always exists that as long as government \n     funds go to advocacy organizations, the ``wall of \n     separation'' will be porous. Moreover, the less fortunate \n     would be assisted more directly by eliminating the middleman \n     who ``does well by doing good.''\n       Without restoring integrity to government by ending \n     federally funded lobbying, Congress and the President will \n     continue to squander millions of taxpayer dollars each year. \n     Political patronage should have no place in the federal \n     budget.\n       Marshall Wittmann, Senior Fellow in Congressional Affairs.\n       Charles P.

This paper spells out a broad cross-section of groups in \nthis country that receive as much as $2 and $3 million a year in tax \ndollars, under grants, directly to them, to fund a variety of \nactivities. Many of those interests engage in direct lobbying here, in \npaid advertising, in every method possible under their right of free \nspeech to cause the Congress of the United States to vote in a certain \nway.\n  It is time, I believe, that we make it very clear to those groups \nthat they have every right to exist and that their right to free speech \nis not infringed upon. But let me suggest that the right of free speech \nis not tied directly to the right to receive a Federal grant so you can \nhave free speech. While some may argue that they have the right to do \ncertain things--and I would not dispute that--we, as legislators, \nwithout question have the right to determine where the tax dollar goes. \nThat is what I am asking that the Senate decide this afternoon and I \nthink that is what the Senator from Wyoming is asking in the amendment \nhe has offered, in a very narrow section of the IRS Code, that we say \nthat the not-for-profit advocacy groups not be allowed to receive money \nin the Federal form of grant or contract or loan that in any way they \ncan use for the purpose of advocacy or for the purpose of lobbying.\n  I hope my colleagues will join with the Senator from Wyoming and \nmyself and others in the support of this amendment as we incorporate it \nin this important legislation, as we work to clarify the whole concern \nabout lobbying in our country, so that the American taxpayer clearly \nunderstands our relationship with special interests and the right of \nall special interests to come to the Congress of the United States to \nargue their point of view.\n  I strongly support that. But I do believe it is important that in \nevery way we make it clear and simple to understand how we are \napproached through the public process.\n  Mr. President, let me close with this quote from Thomas Jefferson.\n\n       To compel a man to furnish funds for the propagation of \n     ideas he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical.\n\n  Even then Thomas Jefferson was recognizing that no person's dollar \nshould be used to argue a point of view that he or she disagreed with.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nSimpson-Craig amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is not before us at this time, \nthe Chair informs the Senator.\n  The absence of a quorum having been suggested----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I withhold that. Is there a vote now which \nhas been ordered on the Simpson amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment is not before us.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it the intention of the Senator from Idaho to ask \nunanimous consent that it be in order to ask for the yeas and nays on \nthe Simpson amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is, and I would so do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Now I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Simpson \namendment be in order for the purpose of a second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1842 to Amendment No. 1839\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit certain exempt organizations from receiving \n                            Federal grants)\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I so send that second-degree amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1842 to amendment No. 1839.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the word ``Sec.'', and insert the \n     following:\n\n       . EXEMPT ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n       An organization described in section 501(c)(4) which \n     engages in lobbying of the Internal Revenue Code of 1996 \n     shall not be eligible for the receipt of Federal funds \n     constituting an award, grant, contract, loan, or any other \n     form.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the purpose of the second-degree amendment \nis to make clear what, by some people's concern, was not clear, and \nthat is what is the intent of the Simpson amendment. We are addressing \nsection 501 of the IRS Code and, in particular, the 501(c)(4) not-for-\nprofit advocacy groups who receive Federal grant money. What we are \nsaying and what the second-degree amendment clarifies is the difference \nbetween their options under this amendment; that is, they could \ncontinue to hold their 501(c)(4) status and lobby, but they could not \nreceive Federal moneys under that status.\n  If they chose to want to continue to receive Federal grants, they \nwould have the election, under the 501 section of the IRS Code, to \nbecome a 501(c)(3), and in that category, not only is the definition of \n``lobbying'' very clear, but the method by which they must handle and \naccount for their Federal dollars. The IRS is very strict and very \nclear as to the accounting and the management of those dollars so that \nthey are not commingled, so they are kept separate, so that the \norganization, without question, divides the use of those dollars, so \nthere is not the intent or the ability to use Federal dollars for the \npurpose of lobbying.\n  That is, without question, the intent of the Simpson amendment. We \nthought it was important that it be clarified. I believe the second-\ndegree amendment so clarifies.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator from Idaho yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will be more than happy to yield for the purpose of a \nquestion.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So the Senator from Kentucky is correct in assuming \nthat the purpose of the Craig second-degree amendment to the Simpson \namendment is to make it clear that a group currently qualifying under \n501(c)(4) can continue to be a 501(c)(4)----\n  Mr. CRAIG. A not-for-profit advocacy group.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. And receive Federal grants, but if Federal grants are \nreceived, that organization will no longer be allowed to lobby.\n  Mr. CRAIG. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. And is the Senator from Kentucky further correct in \ninquiring as follows: If a group currently a 501(c)(4) after the \nadoption of the Simpson amendment, as amended by the Craig amendment, \nconcluded that receiving Federal grants was critical to its mission, \nthen a logical response to the adoption of this amendment would be to \nconsider qualifying as a 501(c)(3); is that correct?\n  Mr. CRAIG. That would be correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Idaho. I think his amendment \nis very useful.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I want to thank very much Senator \nMcConnell for his precise inquiry here, and particularly Senator Larry \nCraig, my colleague from Idaho. There is no intent here to injure the \ngroups that are listed under what I use as a pretty active resource, \nthe GAO report on selected tax-exempt organizations. It gives a list of \n501(c)(4) organizations. \n\n[[Page S10547]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that list be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was

SIMPSON. Mr. President, if each of those groups or members of \nthose groups contacted their elected representatives, I am sure that \nthey would be in shock, indicating that they were going to lose \nsomething.\n  So what has occurred in this colloquy and with the second-degree \namendment is a very important reiteration of points I made when I spoke \nduring the offering of the amendment as to why the amendment is \nimportant.\n  I think it has been clarified, but let us just do it one more time \nand, perhaps, if there are any further questions, I hope those who \nresist the amendment will enter the debate so that we can assure them \nthat this amendment, now as second degreed by Senator Craig, does not \nprevent any 501(c)(4) organization from refiling as a 501(c)(3) and \nthen accepting that category's limits on lobbying.\n  The only circumstance in which they would be cut off from Federal \nfunds would be if they chose then to remain entirely under 501(c)(4), \nin effect choosing the unlimited lobbying over the Federal grants.\n  Under the second-degree amendment, they now have an additional option \nto stay in 501(c)(4) status without lobbying. So there is no attempt to \nrestrict anyone. The 501(c)(4)'s have the ability--I hope you hear \nthis--they have the ability to spend millions and millions of dollars \nwithout restriction. They have no restriction whatsoever. All we are \nsaying is that in the language now of the amendment, as amended by the \nsecond-degree amendment--I am going to read it so it will be right in \ncontext in this debate, it will now read:\n\n       An organization described in section 501(c)(4) which \n     engages in lobbying . . . shall not be eligible for the \n     receipt of Federal funds constituting an award, grant, \n     contract, loan or any other form.\n\n  That is the intent. It is, I hope, clarified now. And if there are \nthose who are not in accord with the amendment, those in opposition, \nSenator Craig and I and others--\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Yes, indeed.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I want to take this brief moment to thank the Senator from \nWyoming for his leadership in this area. As I mentioned in my comments, \nthis is an issue we have debated now for over 75 years in one form or \nanother, on one occasion or another, and the fundamental concern of \nSenators long before us was that Federal tax dollars should never be \nused for the purpose of lobbying;\n that we should never restrict the right of the citizen, or the group, \nor the organization to be an advocate before their Government, but that \nthe Government should not be promoting, by the use of those dollars, \ntheir right, or their role, or their activity as an advocacy group, \nthat they could under another category receive Federal dollars and \nperform services so defined by the grant of, or the use of, the Federal \ndollar or contract. But they could not use those or turn those dollars \nfor the purpose of advocating what might be a very narrow position and \nnot a majority position or a mainstream position of the American \npeople.\n\n  The Senator from Wyoming has, in the last good many months, been a \nstrong and outspoken leader on this issue; I think rightfully so. I \nthink the fact he has brought before the American public that literally \nbillions of \n\n[[Page S10548]]\ndollars are now being used for these purposes--and they should not be--\nhas been well taken. I am pleased that he came forth with the \namendment. It helps us clarify the use of these dollars, and I think \nthe American taxpayer will applaud his effort. I thank him for it.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I appreciate that indeed. That is a reason. There is \nanother reason, as I have observed it over the past many months. \nOftentimes, these groups that obtain Federal funding and support will \nuse that money to then lobby the Federal Government for more Federal \nsupport for their members. In other words, whatever the issue is--it \nmay be health care, or whatever it may be--they are using the Federal \nsupport to then lobby for more Federal support, to get more money from \nthe Federal Treasury for whatever issue is paramount on their screen. I \nthink that is wrong. I add that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Indeed, I yield to my friend from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As I understand the amendment, as amended by the Senator \nfrom Idaho, it would prevent an organization, such as the Disabled \nAmerican Veterans, that I see on the list here, from receiving any kind \nof a grant from the Federal Government, if they also want to use even \nfunds that are from a totally unrelated source for lobby; is that \ncorrect? In other words, the amendment of the Senator from Wyoming, as \namended, is not simply restricting the 501(c)(4) organization, such as \nthe DAV, from both lobbying and receiving a grant. But what the Senator \nis doing in his amendment, as I understand it, is now telling these \norganizations that if you get a grant from the Federal Government for \none purpose, even though you are using money from a totally different \nsource for lobbying, you may not do both; is that correct?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from Michigan, \nif I understand the question, what we are saying here is if they get \nanything from the Federal Government in the form of an award, grant, \ncontract, loan, or any other form, they can file as a 501(c)(3) \ncorporation, nonprofit, or they can stay and continue their work as a \n501(c)(4) corporation, but they cannot lobby.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Now, we have asked the members of the Finance Committee, \nor the staff of the Finance Committee that are more familiar with \n(c)(3) and (c)(4) than this Senator--I have not had any dealings with \nthis--I am simply trying to obtain information while we are getting a \nreaction from committee members and the staff. I believe there was a \nhearing on this issue, and I think it was in the Judiciary Committee or \nFinance, in the last few months on this issue.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, we have had a hearing on the issue of \n501(c)(4)'s that receive money from the Federal Government. In this \ncase, it was in the form of grants and awards. We have held a hearing.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In the Judiciary Committee?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. In the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So we are hoping that the Finance Committee members have \nsome feelings about the Simpson amendment, as amended, and that they \nwould make those feelings known, because this Senator is not able to \ncomment on some of the intricacies--or implications, I should say--of \nthe amendment. I want to be real clear on one thing. If a 501(c)(4) \norganization--and I see on this list that they include the Disabled \nAmerican Veterans, International Olympic Committee--if they receive a \ngrant from the Federal Government for some purpose totally unrelated to \nlobby, they then may not use funds from some different source, other \nthan the Federal Government, to lobby and continue to have their \n501(c)(4) status, is that correct?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. That is correct, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LEVIN. What all the implications are of that on these \norganizations, I do not know. I assume that an organization that has a \n(c)(4) status, which is allowed to lobby, presumably not using \nGovernment funds to do so, because I think that would be prohibited \nunder current law; nonetheless, that organization would then have to \nmake a choice, and I presume one of the choices would be to form \nanother (c)(4) organization for the purpose of lobbying--which would be \nallowed to lobby; put it that way--using sources other than \nnongovernmental sources. That would always be a choice.\n  Let me ask my friend from Wyoming, who is much more knowledgeable \nabout this, under current law, can a 501(c)(4) organization use a \nFederal grant or award for lobbying purposes?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, a 501(c)(4) corporation cannot, in that \nsense, use a Federal grant or award for ``lobbying\" purposes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is under current law, is that correct?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Under current law, yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Well, Mr. President, again, I am not as familiar with the \nimplications of this. It would seem to me, however, that if one of \nthese organizations wanted to create two 501(c)(4)'s, they could do so \nunder the Simpson amendment, as amended, and have one organization \naccept Federal grants for the purposes that the grants are awarded for, \nand its other (c)(4) organization be in business for whatever the \ncurrent business is, including permission to lobby, providing it does \nnot use Federal funds for that purpose, as the current law is.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I just add that the problem is this: The \nGovernment in this situation, then, is subsidizing the activities, the \nbenefits provided by the largest of lobbyists, who have this \nextraordinary advantage over all other lobbyists. And there are 25 \ndifferent section (c) corporate tax exempts; there are 25 of them--the \n(c)(3)'s, which are familiar to most of us, and the (c)(4), (c)(5), \n(c)(6), and (c)(7), et cetera. It is the subsidization of the \nactivities, the benefits provided, because they have the ability to \nspend as much as they wish. They have unlimited ability to inject as \nmuch money--if I might have the attention of my friend from Michigan, \nwho I have the deepest affection and respect for. If we are really \ngoing to do something about big, big lobbyists, then it seems to me \nthat we should direct it at the biggest ones of all, the ones who have \nunlimited ability to lobby. There is not a single restriction on a \n501(c)(4). They can spend themselves into oblivion. I say, let them do \nthat if they are going to raise their money from contributions and dues \nand the things that supposedly guide an organization's efforts and \nobjectives,\n but not in grants, and on and on, from the Federal Government. That is \nthe pitch. I am not directing it at any single institution.\n\n  In my research, I came across these extraordinary things. There are \nsome organizations listed on here that you and I probably have never \nheard of, that have millions and millions of dollars involved in \nlobbying. All we are saying is, Look, lobby to your little old heart's \ncontent. You just keep right on doing it. But if you are going to get \nGovernment support, then you are going to have to go to 501(c)(3), \nwhich is truly charitable, for religious, charitable, veterans, \neducation, compassion, whatever you have to list. Let them do that. Let \nthem go to 501(c)(3).\n  You mentioned DAV. There is not a single group here listed in the \n501(c) that could not qualify as having a charitable purpose and meet \nevery test of a 501(c)(3).\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Would it also not be true an organization such as the DAV could \ncreate an additional 501(c)(4) which would have as its purpose whatever \nthe purposes are of the current 501(c)(4), and be allowed to lobby, \nproviding it did not receive Federal grants?\n  In other words, there is an additional option. It is not just a \n501(c)(4). The Senator from Wyoming has opened the option to create \nanother 501(c)(4) which will receive Federal grants, and the original \n501(c)(4) could continue to lobby.\n  That is an additional option which the Senator does not preclude, is \nthat not correct?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. As I understand the question--I am a bit preoccupied. \nYou might ask it again.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator does not preclude an opening of an \norganization such as the DAV, creating an additional 501(c)(4) to \nreceive those Federal \n\n[[Page S10549]]\ngrants, providing that additional organization does not engage in \nlobbying activities?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, that would be my understanding. If they \ndecided to split into two separate 501(c)(4)'s, they could have one \norganization which could both receive grants and lobby without limit.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And the Senator does not in his amendment remove the \nprovision in the current law that exempts 501(c)(4)'s from paying \ntaxes, even if they engaged in lobbying activities, providing, then, \nthey are not eligible for Federal grants or awards?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. We are not, Mr. President, involved in anything more \nthan the singular amendment, saying that they shall not be eligible for \nthe receipt of Federal funds constituting an award, grant, contract, \nloan, or any other form.\n  We are not changing the tax-exempt status in that sense, although \nthere have been many suggestions in both the hearing and on the floor \nand in discussion as to what to do with these groups. It is felt that \nthis would be the most appropriate and understandable approach.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I just point out to my dear friend from \nWyoming that his amendment leaves open many possibilities to these \norganizations. His remarks suggest that somehow or another if they are \ngoing to engage in lobbying, we will remove the subsidy under this \namendment.\n  In fact, this amendment does not touch their tax-exempt status, if \nthey continue to engage in lobbying. And, in fact, this amendment does \nnot preclude, as the Senator from Wyoming phrased it, the splitting of \nan organization and the creation of another organization which could do \nthe lobbying effort while organization No. 1 receives the Federal \ngrants.\n  So offhand I do not see that this precludes 501(c)(4) from a number \nof options which it currently has, and therefore I am not in a position \nwhere I can say that I oppose it, because it seems to me it leaves open \nmany options for 501(c)(4).\n  Again, I want members of the appropriate committee to take a look at \nthis. I would not be able to accept it at this time. As one Senator, I \nhave no objection to it, but I do want to weigh the views and members \nof the Finance Committee on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1842, as Modified\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. As the maker of the second-degree, let me send a \ncorrection of that amendment to the desk. It is a clerical correction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be so modified.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the clerk would read now the \namendment, with the second-degree amendment as modified. I think it is \nstill relatively short, and I think it would clarify things for \neverybody if we would read the entire amendment, assuming the second \ndegree were adopted as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the word ``Sec.'', and insert the \n     following:\n\n       . EXEMPT ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n       An organization described in section 501(c)(4) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 which engages in lobbying shall \n     not be eligible for the receipt of Federal funds constituting \n     an award, grant, contract, loan, or any other form.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, the insert was in the previous sentence \nand it is now correct where it appears, appropriately on the second \nline. That is the intent. It is what I read into the Record a moment \nago.\n  Let me just say to my friend from Michigan, ask my friends from \nKentucky and Idaho, what we are finding is that there are groups in \nAmerica who have tax-exempt status who, in effect, really skirt very \nclosely to just truly big business. They are involved in big business.\n  I hope that maybe my friend would help in making inquiry of the tax-\nexempt status of some of these organizations--not now, but in the \nfuture--because I intend to propose additional reform, especially in \nthis area of unrelated business income tax, called the UBIT \nlegislation, taxing sources, income, royalties, and I plan to look at \nwhether we should tax royalties, tax commercial insurance income. That \nis tax legislation. That needs to go through finance.\n  Here, I am dealing only with grants to lobbyists. That is what this \nis singularly to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I know there are a number of Members that \nhave questions about the amendment. Again, I am not able to accept the \namendment at this time.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, unless the Senator from Kentucky has \nsomething, I would like to speak to this amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If I may briefly indicate that Senator Levin and I \nhave reached an agreement on the underlying bill. It is our hope to \noffer that amendment and have it voted on at 6 o'clock. I would like to \nhave a chance to explain the compromise well before 6 o'clock, but I \nhave no problem giving up the floor at this point.\n  Mr. KYL. I plan to take about 3 minutes to speak in favor of this \namendment. If the Senator would prefer to speak now, or I can go ahead.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. I, too, hope this amendment can be agreed to. It has been \npointed out there are ways around it, and that is certainly a \npossibility, should the amendment be adopted.\n  But it seems to me that, if we adopt this amendment, we will have \nmade a statement that we want people to divide their operations if, in \nfact, that is what they choose to do. They cannot be using the same \noperation, in effect, for both purposes. It is their right to divide \nthe operation, to do lobbying with one and to have the 501(c)(3) with \nthe other, and that is a possibility. But we would at least be on \nrecord as expressing our desire that Federal funds should not be used \nfor lobbying.\n  That is why I support the amendment, and I want to just express a \ncouple of other reasons why. It has been pointed out that there is a \ngreat deal of grant money that has been going to these taxpayer \nsubsidized lobbying organizations, or I should say special interest \norganizations who also lobby.\n  Mr. President, at least $39 billion in Federal grant money was \ndistributed to more than 40,000 organizations in 1990 alone, the last \nyear for which I have figures. That is money that Congress supposedly \nappropriated to help address important national needs.\n  Some of the organizations are ones that I have had an affiliation \nwith.\n  The American Bar Association, for example, received $2.2 million in \nFederal grants between July 1993 and June 1994 for such activities as \nmissing children's assistance; aging programs; justice research; \ndevelopment and evaluation; and child welfare research and \ndemonstration.\n  The American Association of Retired Persons received about $84.7 \nmillion over the same period for the senior environmental employment \nprogram and the senior community service employment program.\n  The AFL-CIO received $2 million. The National Council of Senior \nCitizens received $71.5 million or about 96 percent of its entire \nbudget from the Federal Government.\n  The problem, as has been noted, Mr. President, is that once a Federal \ngrant reaches the organizations' bank account, it simply frees up \nadditional dollars for the groups to spend on lobbying activities. Many \nof the organizations are on Capitol Hill every day, often lobbying for \nmore taxpayer money on one program or another. Congress has not only \nbeen filling the trough, but paying these groups to feed there.\n  AARP, for example, has been lobbying strenuously against Medicare \nreform. The American Bar Association staged a protest on Flag Day \nagainst the proposed constitutional amendment to protect the flag. \nCARE, another organization that receives Federal funds, has been \nlobbying against cuts in foreign aid.\n  That is all fine. It is their right. Each one of those groups is \nentitled to its views, but none has the right to use taxpayer dollars \nto underwrite its lobbying activities. The U.S. Supreme Court, in the \ncase of Regan versus Taxation with Representation, ruled unanimously in \n1983 that the Federal Government ``is not required by the first \namendment to subsidize lobbying.'' The Court went on to say, ``we again \nreject the notion that first \n\n[[Page S10550]]\namendment rights are somehow not fully realized unless they are \nsubsidized by the State.''\n  Thomas Jefferson said it best 200 years ago: ``to compel a man to \nfurnish funds for the propagation of ideas he disbelieves and abhors is \nsinful and tyrannical.''\n  The amendment directly prohibits any recipient of a Federal grant \nfrom spending those grant funds on political advocacy. I think we can \nall agree that is appropriate. And because money is fungible, it also \nsets limits on the amount of political advocacy that a grantee can \nperform with nongrant funds.\n  This amendment is not about free speech, or the right of any \norganization to petition the Government. Everyone is free to say what \nhe wants. Every group is entitled to express its views to Government \nofficials. What these groups are not entitled to is a subsidy from \ntaxpayers to do that.\n  No American should be taxed to advance the political agenda of an \norganization that he or she may have no wish to support or one that \nadvocates an agenda he strongly opposes. Subsidies for political \nadvocacy are wrong.\n  There is another issue besides lobbying at stake here. When a group \nasks for Federal funds to conduct a certain activity--whether it is the \nYMCA to serve the needs of our Nation's youth, the World Wildlife Fund \nto protect the environment, or the National Council of Senior Citizens \nto help older Americans--we should expect that the group puts the funds \nto the intended use. When dollars are commingled and spent in lobbying, \nit is the every people we want to help that are hurt most. Every dollar \nthat an organization pays a lobbyist is a dollar that could have been \nused to help a hungry child, someone who is homeless, or in need.\n  If an organization would rather lobby the Government than serve the \nneeds of the people, it should be frank about, it, refuse Federal \nfunds, and go on about its business. We can find another organization \nthat will devote the resources toward the intended purpose.\n  Mr. President, cutting aid to lobbyists should be the easiest cut we \nmake in Federal spending. We should certainly eliminate it before \nconsidering any reductions in aid to the people these lobbyists purport \nto represent--children, the elderly, the needy, and the environment, to \nname just a few. It is time to cut off Federal funding for political \nadvocacy by select groups.\n  It's time to let special interests raise their own funds to promote \ntheir points of view.\n  This amendment will do that, if not totally, 100 percent, at least in \na way that sends the message that Congress wants to send on this \nimportant issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to indicate that Senator \nLevin and I have reached an agreement on the underlying bill which he \nwill be sending to the desk shortly. We had hoped to have a vote on \nthis Levin-McConnell compromise at 6 o'clock, but there are some \nproblems on this side with regard to getting a vote at 6. But we \nthought we would go ahead and describe for our colleagues the agreement \nthat has been reached and at the earliest opportunity, it would be the \nintention of Senator Levin and my intention to get a rollcall vote on \nthis compromise.\n  Let me say first, in the category of the definition of a lobbyist, \nthe original bill by my friend from Michigan required that 10 percent \nof the time spent lobbying made one a lobbyist for purposes of the \nlegislation. The alternative that I had earlier offered said that you \nmust spend 25 percent of your time in order to meet that threshold. The \ncompromise that we have reached is 20 percent. I think it is a \nreasonable compromise, and allows us to sign off in the definition of \nlobbyist section. And the rationale is clear, that to qualify as a \nlobbyist, the individual is to have to spend more than just a casual \namount of time lobbying.\n  Second, in the area of thresholds which would trigger registration \nrequirements, the original Levin bill said that $2,500 in income \nreceived by a lobbying firm or $5,000 spent by an organization which \nlobbies--$2,500 for a firm; $5,000 for an organization--would trigger \nthe requirements. What the Senator from Michigan and I have agreed to \nis that, with regard to lobbying firms, $5,000 would trigger coverage; \nand with regard to organizations, $20,000 in expenditures by an \norganization which lobbies.\n  Here again, the rationale is that those who do not have a regular, \nongoing presence in Washington should not be required to register. My \nhope here, which my friend from Michigan has agreed to in this \ncompromise, is to not bring under the bill those folks back home who \nmay come up here occasionally but who are not in any real sense \nlobbyists.\n  Third, in the grassroots area, the issue that bogged us down last \nfall in passing this legislation last year, the original bill of my \nfriend from Michigan contained a reference to grassroots activity. The \ncompromise deletes all references to grassroots activity and no longer \nmakes any suggestion that any grassroots testimony would trigger \nregistration. This bill will not require any reporting or disclosure \nwhatsoever of grassroots activity.\n  Obviously, the goal here that the Senator from Michigan and I have is \nnot to discourage genuine grassroots activism out in America to convey \nto us the opinions of those groups on any legislation that we may be \nconsidering.\n  Fourth, in the area of administration and enforcement, Senator \nLevin's original bill created a new Federal agency with the \nresponsibility of enforcement. This bill now will create no new \nGovernment agency. The Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the \nHouse would receive reporting and disclosure forms. I think clearly \nthat is a step in the right direction. I want to thank my friend from \nMichigan for that compromise. We do not believe creating additional \nGovernment agencies is a good idea, particularly in this atmosphere of \n$5 trillion in cumulative Federal debt.\n  Finally, with regard to coverage of the executive branch lobbying, \nthe compromise of the Senator from Michigan and myself will cover those \ncontacts within the executive branch but only contacts made by \npolitical appointees; that is, schedule C's and above; Presidential \nappointees which require confirmation by the Senate and schedule C's.\n  So we have had a very good effort here to reach this agreement. I \nwant to thank my friend from Michigan for his willingness to come \ntogether here in a proposal that I think, clearly, Senators on both \nsides of the aisle ought to feel comfortable in supporting. And it is \nmy hope that at some point, preferably early this evening, we might be \nable to get a vote on this.\n  I see my friend from Michigan on his feet. I will be glad to yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, while both the Senator from Maine and the \nSenator from Kentucky are here, let me first say that the changes that \nwe are going to be sending to the desk are important ones but not as \nsignificant as the changes in the original Levin-Cohen bill which we \nhave before us. I am going to try to see if I cannot state what the \ndifferences are so that there is no confusion when people come to vote.\n  For instance, in the bill before us, the so-called Levin-Cohen, et \ncetera, bill, there is no new agency created. That point which Senator \nMcConnell just made reference to was already addressed in the \nunderlying bill. So there is no change in that regard in terms of the \namendment which I will be sending to the desk, which will be called the \nLevin-McConnell amendment. There was no new agency created in Levin-\nCohen. There is no change in that in terms of the so-called Levin-\nMcConnell amendment.\n  One of the areas of contention here is whether or not the executive \nbranch should be covered. It was the determination of Senator Cohen and \nme and others that lobbying activities include the executive branch. We \nhave had hearings in our subcommittee relative to the executive branch. \nWe had hearings into Wedtech, for instance, where the executive branch \nwas lobbied heavily by outsiders and contracts were obtained for a \ncompany that never should have gotten contracts and which cost the \nTreasury millions of dollars. That lobbying activity was never \ndisclosed because executive branch lobbying was not covered by the \nexisting law.\n  Executive branch lobbying is covered in the Levin-Cohen bill. It is \ngoing to \n\n[[Page S10551]]\ncontinue to be covered if the so-called Levin-McConnell amendment to \nLevin-Cohen is adopted. But what will not be covered, however, will be \nlobbying activities of employees of the executive branch below the \npolitical appointee level. We are not going to get to lower level \nemployee lobbying. We are going to focus on where the lobbying really \nhas an impact, which is at the higher levels of the executive branch, \nincluding the schedule C's.\n  So the key issue, however, is that the principle that we are going to \ninclude executive branch lobbying for the first time has been \npreserved. That principle was embedded in the underlying Levin-Cohen \nbill. It is retained even if we adopt the so-called Levin-McConnell \namendment to Levin-Cohen, but we will just be excluding lobbying \nactivities with certain lower level executive branch employees.\n  Next, we tried to make clear in Levin-Cohen that there was no intent \nto cover the lobbying activities of people at the grassroots. The only \nreference to grassroots in Levin-Cohen was where a registered lobbyist \nhired somebody else to stimulate grassroots activity. But then those \nexpenses would have to be included in the expenses that would be \ndisclosed by the person who is already required to register. That was \nthe sole reference.\n  There was objection to even that. It did not tell us much, in any \nevent, because it was not identified as being a separate expenditure to \nstimulate grassroots lobbying. And we decided to avoid any suggestion, \neven though there was none, to make sure that none could even be made \nthat there is any coverage of grassroots lobbying. We have removed that \nprovision that would have told us very, very little, in any event, \nsince it would not identify that the expenditure was to stimulate \ngrassroots lobbying, but simply would have included that amount in the \ntotal expenditure of somebody who is already required to register.\n  But again, I think we wanted to make sure that nobody could argue, \nrightly or wrongly, that we were covering grassroots lobbying. So we \nhave agreed to delete even the inclusion of that expenditure that \nsomeone who is already required to register would have had to have \nincluded in their disclosure form. So that is a minor change. But it is \none that we gladly accepted.\n  As far as the threshold is concerned, we have retained the threshold \nfor firms that lobby, and at $5,000. That threshold that is in Levin-\nCohen is retained at $5,000. The change that has been made is for the \nsmall organizations that lobby themselves, not by hiring a firm but \nthat lobby themselves. In Levin-Cohen, the threshold for that was \n$10,000. In the McConnell substitute, the threshold was $50,000. And \nthe agreement that we have reached is to go from $10,000 to $20,000 for \nthose organizations that lobby themselves. So just for clarification, \nLevin-Cohen said the threshold was $10,000. McConnell was $50,000, and \nwe have gone to $20,000.\n  I think that the Senator from Kentucky has covered a number of the \nother questions. I will not add to that except that I think he has \ncovered this. But in case he has not, we are simplifying disclosure \nrequirements by eliminating the requirement to disclose the specific \ncommittees that are contacted, and we are clarifying the requirement to \ndisclose lobbying on specific executive branch actions. We also are \nmaking clear that the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the \nSenate will handle all administrative tasks, including providing \nguidance for the public. I think it was our intention that the Clerk of \nthe House and Secretary of the Senate do that. But there apparently was \nsome ambiguity about it. And the Senator from Kentucky and I have \nagreed that we would make that very clear explicitly in this amendment \nthat we will be sending shortly to the desk to the underlying Levin-\nCohen bill.\n  So I want to thank again my friends from Maine and Kentucky for \nworking on the underlying bill and working for the amendment to that \nunderlying bill. I think we have a very strong lobbying disclosure bill \nthat closes the loophole--no more lawyers' loopholes--which allowed \nlawyers to be exempted from lobbying disclosure requirements. No more \nloopholes for those who did not spend all of their time lobbying \nMembers of Congress since just about nobody spends all their time \npersonally lobbying Members personally. They spend a lot of time with \nstaff and a lot of time in preparation.\n  We have eliminated every loophole we could get our hands on, and it \nis a strong lobbying bill that has also streamlined and simplified this \nprocess. I hope we can keep this bill in its strong form and that it \nwill not be diluted in any way, because, finally, we will be doing what \n50 years ago Congress thought they were doing, which is to require that \nprofessional lobbyists, persons who were paid to lobby, disclose to the \npublic who is paying them, how much, on what issue. And the important \nadd on to that original intent is that now we are going to cover the \nexecutive branch. And that is a critically important addition because \nso much lobbying activity in this town is both aimed at the executive \nbranch and aimed at Congress urging Members of Congress to weigh in \nwith the executive branch.\n  One of the difficulties with the original McConnell substitute is \nthat it had language in it which suggested that it was not covering \nlobbying activities which were aimed at getting us in the Congress to \nlobby Members for the executive branch.\n  The underlying Levin-Cohen bill and the Levin-McConnell substitute to \nLevin-Cohen are absolutely clear that lobbying activities of both the \nexecutive branch and of Congress to get us to weigh in with the \nexecutive branch are covered lobbying activities.\n  Again, let me close with thanks to my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle. We have had tremendous support here from Senator Daschle, and \nSenator Glenn, as ranking member of Governmental Affairs, has been \nabsolutely steadfast in his support for these reforms, as have so many \nother of my colleagues on Governmental Affairs. But I particularly want \nto take off my hat to Senator Cohen who, whether he was the ranking \nmember of the subcommittee we are on or the chairman of that \nsubcommittee, has been constant in his determination that we are going \nto finally close the loopholes and get paid lobbyists to tell us and \ntell the public who is paying them how much to lobby Congress and the \nexecutive branch and on what issues.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COHEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, let me take just a moment to thank my \ncolleague from Michigan and also my colleague from Kentucky. I think \nthe substitute language they have agreed to will make an improvement on \nthe underlying amendment we offered to the legislation earlier today. \nFor simplicity's sake, we might call it the Levin-McCohen bill. That \nwould perhaps clarify the fact that Levin-McConnell is amending the \nLevin-Cohen amendment and perhaps eliminate some of the confusion \nsurrounding that.\n  The changes which have been agreed upon I think do improve the \namendment in the sense that it makes it clearer; that it also will \nachieve what I believe to be an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote for the \nmeasure. It has been a long time in the making.\n  I take this opportunity to thank Senator Levin for his steadfastness \nin pursuing lobby disclosure reform over the years we have worked \ntogether.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, just for the information of our \ncolleagues, there is now a great likelihood we will be able to have a \nvote at 6 on the Levin-McConnell compromise, and even though I do not \nhave the unanimous-consent agreement in front of me to read yet, there \nis an excellent chance we will have a recorded vote very shortly.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Just so that I might comment?\n  I know there are a number of issues pending out there, a lot of \ndiscussion is still underway on the McCain amendment with regard to \nRamspeck. I understand they are very close to some agreement on that, \nso we hope maybe we can dispense with that on a voice vote.\n  We are continuing to work on both sides on the language in the Brown \namendments and hopefully something will be worked out on two of those. \n\n[[Page S10552]]\n\n  We would like to have a vote--I believe we already have the yeas and \nnays ordered--on the Craig substitute to the Simpson amendment. So I \nbelieve we could have a vote on that at 6 o'clock. And then the \nagreement on Levin-McConnell. So we would be able to move forward with \na recorded vote on two at 6 o'clock, and I believe we can work out \nseveral of these other issues on a voice vote. If we find out later we \ncannot, we can always have a recorded vote on those if negotiations do \nnot work out. So I believe we would be ready to ask for unanimous \nconsent shortly with the idea of getting a vote at 6.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield on that question.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as I understand it, the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered on the underlying Simpson amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe that is the amendment offered by the Senator from \nIdaho [Mr. Craig].\n  Mr. LEVIN. My understanding was it was on the Simpson amendment, but \nthat does not make any difference. I do not know that the yeas and nays \nare needed on the second-degree amendment. I think they may be needed, \nhowever, on the underlying amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Right. That is what we would hope to get in our unanimous-\nconsent agreement.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Then I hope this amendment, the Levin-McConnell amendment, \nthe rollcall on that, if necessary, will come immediately following. Is \nthat the intention of the Senator from Mississippi?\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe that would be appropriate. We could do it either \nway. But I think in view of the fact----\n  Mr. LEVIN. May I suggest that the vote on the Levin-McConnell \namendment come first, to give people a little more opportunity to focus \non what is in the underlying Simpson amendment, and I think we are \nready to have a vote on the Levin-McConnell amendment, which, by the \nway, has not been sent to the desk.\n  If the Senator will yield further, I wonder if he would permit me now \nto send the so-called Levin-McConnell amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would yield for that purpose so that the \nLevin-McConnell amendment can be sent to the desk. Just very briefly, I \nwant to emphasize that this once again is evidence of the substantial \nprogress that has been made by the distinguished Senator from Michigan \nand the distinguished Senator from Kentucky. A lot of details have been \nworked out. I hope the Members will have an opportunity to take a look \nat this agreement. I believe it is the basis for concluding this lobby \nreform legislation very shortly.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1843 to Amendment No. 1836\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside. The clerk will report the amendment submitted by the Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself and Mr. \n     McConnell, proposes an amendment numbered 1843 to amendment \n     No. 1836.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is amendment No. 1843 to \namendment No. 1836.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we temporarily \nset aside the pending business to go to Brown No. 3 amendment, No. \n1841.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1841\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this is the amendment that deals with \nqualified blind trust and provides for reporting of the total cash \nvalue of that if, indeed, the trust provides that the beneficiary of \nthe trust is notified under the terms of the trust. My understanding is \nboth sides have reviewed this and do not have objection to it.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am unaware of any objection to the \nBrown amendment just outlined on this side.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I know of no objections to this amendment \non this side. To be clear, this is the so-called Brown amendment No. 3 \nearlier in the afternoon.\n  Mr. BROWN. It is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on amendment No. 1841? \nIf not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1841) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to, and I move to lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nLevin McConnell amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Levin \nMcConnell amendment No. 1843 be considered a substitute for amendment \nNo. 1836.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this is a technical change. We see no \nproblem with it. There is no objection on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 1843\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nNo. 1843, of the Senator from Michigan.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett] and the \nSenator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar] are necessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 98, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 324 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--98\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl \n\n[[Page S10554]]\n\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Bennett\n     Lugar\n       \n  So the amendment (No. 1843) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Under the previous order, the question now \noccurs on amendment No. 1836, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 1836), as amended, was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1837\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I call for regular order with regard to \nthe McCain amendment No. 1837.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to call for regular \norder and that is now the pending question.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate is still not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order. Senators \nwill cease conversation.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1837, As Modified\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have a modification at the desk. I ask \nunanimous consent the amendment be modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1837), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . REPEAL OF THE RAMSPECK ACT.\n\n       (a) Repeal.--Subsection (c) of section 3304 of title 5, \n     United States Code, is repealed.\n       (b) Redesignation.--Subsection (d) of section 3304 of title \n     5, United States Code, is redesignated as subsection (c).\n       (c) Effective Date.--The repeal and amendment made by this \n     section shall take effect 2 years after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n       Add the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 2. EXCEPTED SERVICE AND OTHER EXPERIENCE CONSIDERATIONS \n                   FOR COMPETITIVE SERVICE APPOINTMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 3304 of title 5, United States \n     Code (as amended by section 2 of this Act) is further amended \n     by adding at the end thereof the following new subsection:\n       ``(d) The Office of Personnel Management shall promulgate \n     regulations on the manner and extent that experience of an \n     individual in a position other than the competitive service \n     such as the excepted service (as defined under section 2103) \n     in the legislative or judicial branch, or in any private or \n     nonprofit enterprise, may be considered in making \n     appointments to a position in the competitive service (as \n     defined under section 2102).'' In promulgating such \n     regulations OPM shall not grant any preference based on the \n     fact of service in the legislative or judicial branch. The \n     regulations shall be consistent with the principles of \n     equitable competition and merit-based appointments.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall take effect 2 years after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, except the Office of Personnel Management shall--\n       (1) conduct a study on excepted service considerations for \n     competitive service appointments relating to such amendment; \n     and\n       (2) take all necessary actions for the regulations \n     described under such amendment to take effect as final \n     regulations on the effective date of this section.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this has been agreed to by Chairman Roth \nand the Governmental Affairs Committee, and with the consent of Senator \nStevens, including language Senator Stevens added when he reported the \nlegislation out of the Civil Service Subcommittee in May regarding OPM \nand judicial regulations, to consider the experience of individuals who \nserved in the legislative branch as well as private sector; preference \nwill not be given in these regulations.\n  I thank Senator Roth and Senator Stevens for their assistance on this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further amendment or further \ndiscussion on amendment No. 1837, as modified?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I do not like to ask this question. I \nrealize we are in the Dracula stage of legislation. The Dracula rule \nappears, over the last several months, where we do not vote during \ndaylight hours but only in the evening. Otherwise, we might be wasting \nour time with our families, our wives, our husbands, our children, \nwhatever else.\n  As one who would like to spend some time with his family, I wonder if \nthe leader might be able to give us some idea whether this will be one \nof those 2 or 3 evenings a month that we are allowed time with our \nfamilies. I realize the commitment of everybody here to family values. \nI just ask that question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, a great deal of progress has been made \ntoday. That last vote was an indication of how much progress has been \nmade in working out an agreement on this legislation.\n  There is now an agreement on the McCain amendment. There are other \namendments being discussed that we could hopefully reach agreement on. \nThere are some that still may require some recorded votes tonight. The \nleader has indicated he would like for us to push on and see if we can \nwork out as many amendments as possible and get votes on others and get \nto final passage on lobby reform tonight.\n  The reason for that is we do still have to take up, under the \nunanimous-consent agreement, gift reform later on tonight or tomorrow, \nwithout votes on gift reform tonight. We do have the Bosnia resolution \npending for consideration tomorrow afternoon, and many other bills that \nwe need to complete before we get to our August recess period.\n  But the answer to the question of the Senator from Vermont is, we do \nwant to go forward. We think we can complete this legislation at a \nreasonable hour tonight.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate what the Senator from \nMississippi has said. I do compliment the Senator from Kentucky and the \nSenator from Michigan. I know from various phone calls that went back \nand forth they have done yeomen's service here today in reaching this \narea of agreement. Obviously, had they not, we could be here much, much \nlonger than we have.\n  The question I have again, for some of us who have families, is there \ngoing to be either a window or shall we tell them to all go to bed and \nget up at 1 tomorrow morning to see us? I do not mean to question \nfacetiously, but we are falling into this trend of almost Dracula \nvoting--we only vote when the Sun goes down. But some of us do have \nfamilies and would like to see them.\n  I ask the question in all seriousness, will there be a window? Will \nthere be time? Shall we make any plans to see our families?\n  Mr. LOTT. To respond further, it is very difficult to say right now \nthat could be done because we have three or four negotiations going on \nsimultaneously. We may get those worked out shortly, and then there \nwould not be a necessity for votes again in the next hour. But right \nnow, we could not indicate that there will be a window. We want to try \nto complete this before it is late tonight. That would be the best way \nso that we all could go home at 8 or 8:30.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Is there a possibility of setting the votes in the \nmorning?\n  Mr. LOTT. There is. We would have to check to see where the \nnegotiations are. There is a possibility we could have stacked votes \nlater on tonight, or perhaps even in the morning. Right now the leader \nwants us to push this forward so we can get an agreement. I believe we \ncan accomplish that. \n\n[[Page S10555]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, will the Senator not leave for a moment? \nI wonder. Whoever is putting this together, have you considered a \nsliding scale, sort of a means testing on the gifts?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will withhold, the Senate will \nbe in order.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to repeat my question. I am sure the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi took it far too seriously. Let \nme repeat it again with a big smile.\n  Some of us are wondering whether you have considered a sliding scale \non the gifts, a means testing for some of us who are in different \nconditions of finances than others. There are some who are in such \ngreat finances that they ought to be willing to have no gifts of any \ntype under any circumstances. Have you ever considered a means testing \nfor gifts?\n  Mr. LOTT. If I might respond, Mr. President, the gift rule issue will \nnot come up until later on tonight with votes not occurring on that \ntoday but tomorrow. Speaking for myself, I think that is a great idea.\n  [Laughter.]\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am going to bring that to a vote.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on amendment 1837, as \nmodified? If there is no further debate on the amendment No. 1837, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1837), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, may we have order? The Senate is still \nnot in order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Those \nparticipating in conversations will please retire to the cloakrooms. \nThe Senate is not in order.\n  The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as the majority whip indicated, we \nbelieve we are down to a relatively few amendments. There is an \nexcellent chance of finishing the bill tonight.\n  Mr. President, I see my friend from Michigan seeking recognition. So \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                  Vote Vitiated on Amendment No. 1841\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, after consulting with the Presiding \nOfficer, whose amendment I am referring to, I would ask unanimous \nconsent to vitiate the vote on the so-called Brown No. 3 amendment, \nwhich was voice voted in the last 20 minutes. There was a problem with \nit that this Senator was not aware of. I indicated that I had no \nobjection. In fact, there was some objection.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we vitiate the vote approving Brown 3 \nwith the right of the Senator from Colorado, of course, to offer that \namendment at any time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, can I inquire as to whether or not we \nreached the point where maybe we could get an agreement to dispose of \nthe Craig-Simpson modified amendment by voice vote? I understood maybe \nthat was now possible. That would rid us of the necessity for another \nrecorded vote. I am told that perhaps the other side is willing to \nagree to that now. I do have a unanimous consent request, if that is \npossible.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I do not know of a request for a rollcall vote on the \nSimpson amendment on this side. However, I would like all Members to \nunderstand that this is a very significant amendment which is going to \naffect 501(c)(4) organizations and would state that a 501(c)(4) \norganization, which includes Blue Cross, AARP, Disabled American \nVeterans, International Olympic Committee, and a whole host of other \norganizations that currently are allowed, although they have a tax \nexemption, to lobby, that under the Simpson-Craig amendment, they no \nlonger would be allowed to receive a grant or an award from the Federal \nGovernment at the same time that they are allowed to lobby.\n  I think this creates a whole host of new issues. I am not on the \nFinance Committee. Unless someone from the Finance Committee wishes to \nget into this in some detail, I do not know of any indication on this \nside for a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. DODD. If the Senator will yield, frankly, this is one Senator who \nmay want a vote. I am uneasy, I say, Mr. President. This raises a \nquestion, I say to my colleague. I am very uneasy about this list. I am \nnot sure it is a complete list of 501(c)(4)'s. Some of them may very \nwell be deserving of grants. I do not have any difficulty being lobbied \nby some of these organizations. It sounds to me like you have a few \nhere that are being targeted for some specific purpose.\n  I think we ought to think more carefully before we take a rather \nsignificant step in deciding that a whole group of very legitimate \norganizations, that may very well qualify for grants of one kind or \nanother, all of a sudden are being precluded from either doing that or \nlobbying Members of the U.S. Senate.\n  I, for one, would prefer to have a rollcall vote on this and have a \nvoice vote, and I do not know frankly what the implications are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, if I can draw the attention of my \ncolleagues back to the issue here, we had the debate which was not \nparticipated in by everyone. And I understand that. I have been here \nfor several years.\n  Let me tell you what this is. This is not an attempt to get anybody. \nThe amendment is very clear. I am going to read it.\n  Here is the amendment with regard to 501(c)(4) corporations. There \nare a lot of them. This does not have anything to do with 501(c)(3) \ncorporations, charitable corporations, the kind we think of most often. \nIt has nothing to do with universities. It has nothing to do with \n501(c)(5) corporations or 501(c)(6) corporations.\n  Remember, a 501(c)(4) corporation is tax-exempt and has unlimited \nability to lobby with unlimited sums of money. They can lobby with $20 \nor $30 million, if they wish. There is no limitation whatsoever on \nlobbying activities. That is a 501(c)(4).\n  The 501(c)(3)'s are limited to a certain amount, a million bucks. You \ncannot go over that--501(c)(5)'s and (c)(6)'s have limitations. Here is \nwhat the amendment says:\n\n       An organization described in section 501(c)(4) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 which engages in lobbying shall \n     not be eligible for the receipt of Federal funds constituting \n     an award, grant, contract, loan, or any other form.\n\n  Meaning that if a 501(c)(4) decided that they wanted to continue to \nlobby and were receiving Federal funds, they could no longer continue \nto lobby. However, if they wished to continue to receive Federal funds, \nthen they would limit their lobbying activities. They can also go into \nsplits, if they wish to split a 501(c)(4) organization. At least that \nwould be an improvement over present law, which simply says that these \ngroups can lobby. And if you are doing something with lobbying reform, \nit would seem to me you would want to do something with the one tax-\nexempt organization that can lobby with unlimited funding and still \nreceive grants from the Federal Government to do so.\n  Mr. DODD. I apologize for not being here earlier today. Like most \nMembers, I was not here in town for the debate.\n  I am looking down the list here of some of these numbers. I am told--\ncorrect me if I am wrong--there are 140,000 501(c)(4) organizations in \nthe United States.\n  Now, I am looking at a list of 20 or 30 here. Obviously, it may be a \nlist put together to cause someone like me to raise the issue, but I \nlook at the Fireman's Association, State of New York, Group Health \nAssociation--a lot of groups that may very well qualify for grants, and \nI certainly, as a Member, do not have any objection if they want to \ncome and lobby me in the office for some particular purpose. I do not \nknow why we are singling out that particular group in this particular \nenvironment.\n  Now, to me, to disqualify 140,000 organizations in the United States \nseems to go a little too far.\n\n[[Page S10556]]\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, we are not disqualifying 140,000 \norganizations of the United States. We are disqualifying those that \nreceive funding from the Federal Government, and very few of these do. \nSome receive minuscule amounts, most receive none. Here is the Mutual \nof America Life Insurance Co. with assets of $5.5 billion. I doubt that \nthey receive anything from the Federal Government for lobbying \nactivities.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask my colleague, what is the point of the amendment \nthen? If none of them is getting grants, why do we need an amendment?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. The point of the amendment is there are many tax-exempt \n501(c)(4) corporations that receive grants, awards, contracts, or \nloans, or any other form from the Federal Government and use it to \nlobby the Federal Government for more Federal money for themselves.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield on that point? I do not know who \nhas the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Wyoming yield on that point?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Certainly.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator just said that they could use the grant for \nlobbying purposes. I think that he misspoke when he said that because \nthere is a law which prohibits the use of appropriated funds for \nlobbying activities.\n  What the amendment does is something different, because we already \nhave a ban on using appropriated funds for lobbying.\n  What the amendment says is that if an organization gets funds from \nsome other source, if a 501(c)(4) gets funds from some other source and \nuses those other funds to lobby, it may not then get a grant or an \naward from the Federal Government to do some social function that is \nwithin the scope of the grant.\n  I do not think the Senator from Wyoming is suggesting--at least I \nhope he is not--that currently a 501(c)(4) can get a grant or an award \nfrom the Federal Government and use that money to pay for lobbying.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, under the present law of the United \nStates, when we are talking about a tax-exempt corporation, we are \nseeing happening in the country--this is something we have had one \nhearing on; there will be many more--where the Government is \nsubsidizing the programs and activities of huge lobbying organizations \nthat are engaged in things on the direct edge of UBIT, which is the \nunrelated business income Tax, that are involved in profitmaking \nactivities and that receive a tax-exempt status.\n  What we are saying is those organizations which lobby without limit--\nand this is the only one in the whole panoply that lobbies without \nlimit, without any kind of limitation on the amount of money they can \nspend. So if you are going to do a lobbying reform bill, it would seem \nto me that you would want to deal with the one subsection (c) \ncorporation that can spend itself into oblivion and even use Federal \nmoney in the process of receiving grants, awards, notes, whatever it \nmay be, bonuses, contracts, and we are saying you make a choice here. \nIf you are going to lobby, then you are not going to receive Federal \ngrants. If you want to receive Federal grants, you do not lobby. Take \nyour pick.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield further, I appreciate his point.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I will yield to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. All money is fungible, and if there is not a clear, tight \nbookkeeping system, as there is in a 501(c)(3), which the IRS says very \nclearly how much of its assets or what percentage of it it can spend in \nlobbying up to a universal cap of $1 million, then we went over and \ncreated a 501(c)(4) which said you can be tax-exempt and you can have \nunlimited advocacy.\n  What we have seen over the years is not only do they have unlimited \nadvocacy, and, yes, there is a rather open bookkeeping system and, yes, \nthere is a prohibition against using Federal dollars, tax dollars for \nthe purpose of lobbying, all of the money moves inside the organization \nand it is extremely fungible.\n  We are saying, if you want to retain your 501(c)(4) for lobbying, you \ncan and you should and you are tax-exempt. But if you want to do the \ngrant business, go create something else for that purpose so there is a \nclear line so the taxpayers of this country can know and know very well \nthat there is not the fungibility that is going on here, not in the \nhundreds of thousands of those organizations but in a substantial \nnumber that have taken advantage of a tax-exempt status. I do not think \nthe Senator and I, in granting that tax-exempt status, want to allow \nthem to take advantage.\n  Now, we do not want to deny them the opportunity to serve their \npublic and their membership, and they can do that by shifting their \nstatus for certain purposes.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. If my colleague will yield further, I \nwill seek time or whatever.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I might inquire of a couple things. One, I \nam told there are some 140,000 of these organizations. I do not know. \nAnd maybe there have been hearings on this by the Finance Committee. \nThis is a pretty significant step we are taking. Could I inquire of my \ncolleague from Wyoming whether or not there have been any hearings on \nwhat the implications of this are? I presume it is a Finance Committee \nmatter since it is a 501(c)(4). And what are the tax implications of \nit? I do not know if that has been done.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, we did have a hearing in the Finance \nCommittee on these issues of tax exempts, and we will have many more. \nWe did, indeed. The ``little guys'' that people have been talking about \nprotecting, grassroots and so on, they are going to be well protected \nbecause they are, most of them, 501(c)(3).\n  We are talking about a singular group of maybe 140,000--that is \nexactly correct--and we are talking about big time, big time lobbying. \nOne group spends $26 million a year on unlimited lobbying and receives \ngrants from the Federal Government. We are saying if you do that, then \nyou are no longer going to receive the grants. You can lobby to \noblivion; you can continue to do whatever you wish to do. Or if you \nwish not to receive grants or receive grants, you take your choice. Or \nyou can split into two 501(c)(4)'s, one lobbying with all sorts of \nmoney and dues, it is perfectly appropriate, without limit; or, if you \nare going to receive Federal funds, you do not lobby. You take your \npick.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for his response, Mr. President.\n  I just say again, I do not hold myself as any expert in this area, \nbut it seems to me we are taking, in my view, I do say with all due \nrespect to my good friend, a rather draconian step; with 140,000 \norganizations in this country, admittedly, by one of the authors of the \namendment, out of the 140,000 we are talking a handful that really \nstick in the craw of my colleague from Wyoming.\n  In doing so, my own view is I do not know why we ought to take \n139,900 and ask them to pay an awful price here because of what 100 \norganizations may be doing that is offensive. My view is we are \nchanging a pretty significant piece of tax law when it comes to these \norganizations. And to step forward and single out 140,000 \norganizations, most of which are pretty small operators here that have \nset up under those guidelines, I think goes too far.\n  Now, clearly, there may be some here that, because of their income \nstatus or whatever, maybe we ought to come back with another amendment \nthat deals with some of those in some specific way. But to pick on \ngroups here that literally are tiny--the Henry Ford Health Care Corp., \nthe Higher Education Foundation, they are on the list of organizations \nhere that do not seem to me to be any great threat to anyone.\n  So, Mr. President, with great respect to the authors of the \namendment, I think this just goes too far. I think we are stepping way \nover a line here. If we are going to change entirely the nature of \n501(c)(4) corporations, I think we ought to have some specific \nhearings, there ought to be specific legislation that comes up and not \nhave an amendment offered on the floor that wipes out 140,000 \norganizations from what has been up to this very moment a legitimate \ntax status. \n\n[[Page S10557]]\n\n  I say to my colleague from Idaho, money is fungible, but the fact of \nthe matter is the law is the law.\n And you are not allowed to use taxpayer money for lobbying purposes. \nThat is the law. If someone does, they are in violation of the law and \nthere are penalties associated with that.\n\n  But to suggest because there is some grant money there that somehow \nall of that leaches into the rest of this money and ends up being used \nfor lobbying purposes I think, frankly, is to suggest that somehow \npeople are out there violating the law right and left, and I do not see \nit.\n  Come back if you want to on this one, but I do not know why you want \nto take 140,000 organizations and relegate them to a very unique \nstatus--all of them in this country--because of the complaints of a \nfew.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be glad to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has yielded for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. DODD. Certainly.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I think it is important to cite here that we are not \namending the Tax Code. We are using the Tax Code to identify the group \nin lobbying, and that clarification is how I read what we are doing. I \nthink it is also fair to say that any 501(c)(4) that chooses not to get \na grant and feed at the Federal trough is exempt.\n  Mr. DODD. May I ask my colleague, for instance, why are we not \nincluding 50l(c)(6)? Those are trade associations. They are tax exempt. \nThey get Federal contracts and grants and they lobby.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Because there is an entirely different qualifying \nmechanism under the IRS Code for them, and they are watched very \nclosely and their audits are held very tightly.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague not agree they meet all the standards the \nSenator applies to this amendment?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DODD. They are trade associations. They get grants and they \nlobby. Why is there any reason to suspect they are going to be any \ndifferent in terms of their tax dollars----\n  Mr. CRAIG. The term is unlimited versus the percentages of total \nrevenue base. The IRS Code already established that. 501(c)(4) is an \nunlimited category.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Connecticut yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I yield to my colleague from Michigan.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has yielded to \nthe Senator from Michigan for a question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It seems to me the Senator from Connecticut is pointing \nout something which is very significant, which is that the proponents \nof the amendment are basically using the amendment which will ban a \n501(c)(4) organization from doing something it currently does, which is \nto both lobby with its own funds and to receive a grant for a public \npurpose somewhere else.\n  The purpose of this amendment, as I understand it, is an accounting \npurpose. The argument is made that money is fungible and, therefore, we \nhave to make sure they do not use public funds for lobbying purposes \nand that we need an accounting mechanism in order to be sure that that \nis not done.\n  In 18 United States Code section 1913, it already says that:\n\n       No part of the money appropriated by Congress shall, in the \n     absence of express authorization by Congress, be used \n     directly or indirectly to pay for any personal service, \n     advertisement, telegram, telephone, letter, printed or \n     written matter, or other device intended or designed to \n     influence in any manner a Member of Congress to favor or \n     oppose by vote or otherwise any legislation or appropriation \n     by Congress whether before or after the introduction of any \n     bill or resolution proposing such legislation or \n     appropriation.\n\n  So we already have a ban on the use of public funds for lobbying. It \nseems to me what this comes down to then is to say we are going to \nchange the rules currently lived by 140,000 organizations in order to \nmake sure that the few organizations, relatively, that lobby keep good \nbooks.\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my colleague----\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am wondering whether the Senator from Connecticut will \nagree.\n  Mr. DODD. I agree. It sounds like the ``Lawyers and Accountants \nRelief Act.'' You hire accountants and lawyers and create two \norganizations and you have met the standard. I suppose you can get \naround the law that way. I am not sure that is what we want to be doing \nnecessarily, except that a lot of smaller organizations that do not \nhave the resources are going to have to go out and hire people to do \nit.\n  For the life of me, I do not understand the value, particularly when \nthe law is clear when you use those resources.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My question to the Senator is this: Will the Senator agree \nthat an amendment might be in order that might require 501(c)(4)'s to \nmaintain clear books as to how they use Federal funds for Federal \npurposes and do not use those funds for lobbying purposes? Will the \nSenator agree that that kind of an amendment might be appropriate in \norder to address the fungibility issue of the Senator from Idaho?\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my colleague from Michigan, that would at least--I \nunderstand the heart of the argument in a sense, that the fungibility \nquestion is one that people are worried about. I suggest if we are \ngoing to do it, we might apply it to the 501(c)(6) organizations as \nwell. That at least addresses a potential problem, although to me that \nmay be solved by means other than through the amendment process.\n  Nonetheless, that would at least make some sense to me. But to wipe \nout 140,000 organizations--as I say, I do not hold myself out--I just \nhappened to walk on the floor and heard this amendment was coming up, \nand it seemed to go too far. I do not have a particular brief; no one \ntalked about it. I looked at the list and said, ``Why are we taking \n140,000 organizations in this country that are 501(c)(4) organizations \nand all of a sudden applying a standard that I think goes beyond the \npale?'' That is all I feel about it. I do not have a particular brief \nfor it. It just seems to go too far for me.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Connecticut, \nafter 16 years of legislating on the floor, I remember one incident \ndistinctly. We went for 5 days of debate--I was managing the bill--and \nsuddenly in the door came one of our colleagues. He happened to be on \nour side of the aisle and had paid no particular interest in the \nmeasure, and suddenly just went for it tooth and fang. I thought, well, \nthat is interesting.\n  Mr. DODD. Did he win or lose?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Oh, he lost.\n  Mr. DODD. I had a feeling that was the answer.\n  [Laughter.]\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Directing my remarks to the Chair, of course, rather \nthan my colleague from Connecticut, let me just say we are not wiping \nout anybody. We are not in the business of wiping out 501(c)(4)'s, and \nif you want to go to 501 (c)(6)'s and (c)(5)'s, I am ready to go there, \ntoo. But I did not want to bite off too big a chunk because I did not \nwant to get into it with the chamber of commerce and the AFL-CIO.\n  Mr. DODD. The AFL-CIO is a 501(c)(4).\n  Mr. SIMPSON. No, they are not.\n  Mr. DODD. I am told they are----\n  Mr. SIMPSON. They are a (c)(5); the AFL-CIO is a (c)(5).\n  Mr. DODD. Right; (c)(5).\n  Mr. SIMPSON. So is the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  Mr. DODD. I apologize to my colleague.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. What we are saying is if anyone gets stung here in this \nprocess, they can go become a 501(c)(3) if they are really into big-\ntime charity, doing things that you would like to see charities do. \nThey can be a 501(c)(3). That is a charitable corporation; that is $1 \nmillion limiting activity of lobbying. They can give up lobbying or \nthey can go into a separate split-off. They can split into two, a \nlobbying organization or a grant organization. That is what we are \nsaying.\n  We are seeing abuses of the system. This is not about tax exemption. \nThis is about lobbying. I thought that is what this is about.\n  Why in the world should we allow a group to have unlimited ability to \nspend their members' dues and then use Federal money to offset what \nthey ordinarily would have paid? They \n\n[[Page S10558]]\nwould have had to pay for this somewhere but, no, they get it from the \nFeds. I think that is wrong if you are doing lobbying reform.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I frequently come to the floor on the \nspur of the moment like my friend from Connecticut--and we see eye to \neye--but I think he is wrong on this one. I think the Senator from \nWyoming is right.\n  Frankly, I did not know this was legal. I could not imagine that you \nwould have a tax-exempt corporation--meaning they do not pay any tax on \nall the money they take in--going out and lobbying the Federal \nGovernment, because that is permissive, and then going out and seeking \ngrants from the Federal Government. I could not imagine a situation \nwith more potential for conflict of interest than putting in a \ncorporation that gets all these benefits and can lobby the Federal \nGovernment and then saying, ``On the other hand, you can go get all the \nmoney you can scratch out of these grants''--and do what with it? Spend \nit for the same entity, the same corporation.\n  If I were to have had this before me at the beginning when it was \npassed, I would have voted against it. I think it is an exciting idea \nthat when you are reforming the lobbying laws of the Nation that you \ngive the corporations a clear opportunity. If you want to lobby, you \nchoose another tax-exempt status.\n  If you want to choose this one, then do not go to the Federal \nGovernment against whom you are lobbying to get money. It seems to me \npretty clear that the Senator from Wyoming is on the right track. I \nhope we will vote soon and get rid of this opportunity that we should \nnever have given to these kinds of nonprofit corporations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say that we are down to six \namendments, most of which I think are going to be accepted. There is an \nexcellent chance of finishing this bill very soon. I do not want to \ninterrupt the debate going on. But we can get through here pretty \nquickly if we will have the cooperation of Senators.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know that some Members are waiting to see \nif we are going to have a vote momentarily, or whether we are going to \ndo this on a voice vote or not. I believe that the yeas and nays have \nalready been ordered on the underlying Simpson amendment.\n  So I believe we are ready to go to a vote. Does the Senator want to \ndispose of this on a voice vote?\n  Mr. DODD. I would like a recorded vote. Has there been a request for \na recorded vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered on the \nunderlying amendment. There is a second-degree amendment that the yeas \nand nays have not been ordered on.\n  Mr. DODD. Which is the second-degree amendment?\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me see if I can clarify a request here.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to vote on or in \nrelation to the Craig amendment, as further modified, that no \namendments be in order to the Craig amendment No. 1843, and that \nfollowing the disposition of the Craig amendment, the Senate proceed to \nthe adoption of the Simpson amendment No. 1839, as amended, if amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me inquire further of the Senator from \nMississippi as to what he expects for a schedule tonight. Some of us \nwould like to know, if we have a recorded vote now, when will we have \nthe next recorded vote?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we are down to half a dozen amendments. We \nbelieve we can work out agreements on some of those. Some we believe we \ncan voice vote. We think we are down to maybe a couple more votes \ntonight, and we would like to go ahead and move toward getting a \nconclusion on those amendments.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would observe that much of the day was \nspent in quorum calls and now, as we reach the dinner hour, we seem to \nbe more interested in debate.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me respond to the Senator, if I could. Let us go ahead \nand go to this recorded vote, and during that vote we will see if we \ncan get a further clarification on exactly when the final votes would \noccur. We will work on that and tell the Members after this vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is fine with me. I hope that the majority will \nconsider rolling votes tomorrow morning. I hope he will consider doing \nthis on a routine basis. If we have a couple more votes, rather than \npeople coming back at 9 or 10 p.m. to cast votes, why not stack them \nfor the first thing in the morning?\n  Mr. LOTT. We will have to check with the majority leader on that. The \nimportant thing is that we need to finish lobby reform, so that we can \ngo to gift reform first thing in the morning. Perhaps we can work \nsomething out along the lines of what he is suggesting.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and nays be vitiated on the \nunderlying Simpson amendment No. 1839.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe we are ready to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1842, as further modified.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett] and the \nSenator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar] are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 59, nays 39, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 325 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--59\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Reid\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--39\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Bennett\n     Lugar\n       \n  So the amendment (No. 1842), as further modified, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the underlying amendment, \nas amended.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, may we have order, please?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The motion to reconsider the previous vote has been made.\n  Mr. KERRY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a motion to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1839, As Amended\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, what is the matter currently before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 1839, as amended.\n  Mr. EXON. Further debate has been ordered, then, before we proceed to \nconsider the matter for final approval, is that right? \n\n[[Page S10559]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, it provided for an \nimmediate vote upon the disposition of the second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. There was a unanimous-consent agreement to that effect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The question is on the underlying first-degree amendment, as amended.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? This is the same \namendment as just voted on. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. EXON. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is not a \nsufficient second.\n  Mr. EXON. I know that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not sufficient second.\n  Mr. LOTT. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized for \na parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. LOTT. There was a good deal of discussion when the Senator from \nNebraska was making his motion. Is he asking for a recorded vote on the \nSimpson amendment?\n  Mr. FORD. As amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the Chair's understanding.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thought we had vitiated that in an earlier unanimous-\nconsent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. So that has been disposed of.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. May I make further inquiry of the Chair?\n  If I understand what the situation is at the present time, there was \na unanimous consent agreement earlier, after we had voted on the \nsecond-degree amendment, that the underlying amendment offered by the \nSenator from Wyoming would then be approved on a voice vote? Was that \nthe unanimous-consent agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would be voted on immediately following.\n  Mr. EXON. Immediately following.\n  I have asked for a rollcall vote. I did not receive a sufficient \nsecond? Is that the ruling of the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. EXON. I make one further request for a rollcall vote on the \nSimpson amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays are requested. Is there a \nsufficient second?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I observe the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. FORD. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is for the Chair to \ndetermine.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, again, parliamentary inquiry, I think we \nneed to try to understand exactly where we are and what we are trying \nto accomplish here.\n  I believe, in framing my parliamentary inquiry, the amendment now \nbefore us is identical to the language we just voted on. And, \ntherefore, this would be a second recorded vote on the same issue we \njust voted on now, under the Craig amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is correct.\n  The yeas and nays have been requested.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just one further parliamentary inquiry. We \nwere to the point, if we were able to complete that vote and dispose of \nit, hopefully, to enter a unanimous-consent agreement that would allow \nus to complete action tonight and perhaps have final passage on this \nissue, a final vote in the morning at 9 o'clock.\n  So I was in hopes that we could complete this final vote that we just \nhad and move on to the unanimous consent agreement without additional \nrecorded votes tonight. I just wanted to make that point before we \nproceed further.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for a \nparliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Did I understand \njust now that the order is that since this rollcall vote has been \nrequested by the Senator from Nebraska, we vote on that and that the \nonly pending business left before final will be voted on at 9 o'clock \nin the morning? Is that correct?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I might respond to the Senator from \nArkansas, no. It was our hope that we could then enter into a \nunanimous-consent agreement that would, if we get all the details \nagreed to, say that any further recorded votes would occur in the \nmorning at 9 o'clock on any amendments thereto and final passage if any \namendments are requested for recorded vote.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I just ask the distinguished assistant \nmajority leader if he can tell us how many amendments we are working \non. What is the potential for more votes?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I might respond, there are about three \namendments that are still pending. We think maybe a recorded vote would \nbe necessary on one of those amendments. But we need to work through \nthe unanimous-consent agreement first.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator from Mississippi yield for a \nquestion? Can we identify those amendments?\n  Mr. LOTT. They have been identified. We have discussed those with the \ndistinguished Democratic leader and with the managers of the bill.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would like to know who the author is and what the \nnature of these amendments are before agreeing to closing out the \namendment tree and leaving only final passage to be considered.\n  Mr. LOTT. That would be the hope of the managers of the bill as soon \nas we move to that. In fact, I think we are ready to go to the \nunanimous-consent request here momentarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The yeas and nays have been \nrequested. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Wyoming. On this question, the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that section 6 \nbe stricken from S. 1060, and when the Senate considers S. 1061, \nsection 6 be inserted at the appropriate place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1838, as Modified\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, with the assistance of the distinguished \nSenator from Kentucky, I believe amendment No. 1838 is modified in a \nway that meets the approval of Members. To refresh Members' memories, \nthis amendment deals solely with reporting categories, not the more \ncontroversial areas of residence or the area of blind trust. This \namendment deals solely with reporting categories. The modification \nmakes it clear that it does not apply the new categories to the assets, \nincome or liabilities of dependents or spouses, but only to those of \nthe reporting individuals.\n  Mr. President, I believe the amendment is at a point where both sides \nhave agreed to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1838), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1840 withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, my second amendment is amendment No. 1840. \nIt deals with reporting of residences.\n  Mr. President, I have had the opportunity in the last several hours \nto hear from, I believe, close to a majority of my colleagues. It is \nquite clear from those who have spoken to me that there is not support \nin the Chamber for this amendment.\n  While I continue to believe that assets of this kind that exceed $1 \nmillion should be reported, it is quite clear--or so it appears--that \nwe do not have the votes for this.\n  Therefore, I withdraw amendment No. 1840.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The amendment is withdrawn.\n  So the amendment (No. 1840) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe set aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1844\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Mr. Dole and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for Mr. Dole, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1844.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n\n     AMENDMENT TO THE FOREIGN AGENTS REGISTRATION ACT (P.L. 75-583)\n\n       Strike section 11 of the Foreign Agents Registration Act of \n     1938, as amended, and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n\n     SEC. 11.

Mr. President, it is my understanding that this \namendment has been cleared on both sides.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We have no objection to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1844) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1845\n\n  (Purpose: To amend section 207 of title 18, United States Code, to \n prohibit any person serving as the U.S. Trade Representative and the \n   Deputy U.S. Trade Representative from representing or advising a \n foreign entity at any time after termination of that person's service \n     and to disqualify such a person from serving as a U.S. Trade \n        Representative and the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative)\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Mr. Dole and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for Mr. Dole, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1845.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . BAN ON TRADE REPRESENTATIVE REPRESENTING OR ADVISING \n                   FOREIGN ENTITIES.\n\n       (a) Representing After Service.--Section 207(f)(2) of title \n     18, United States Code, is amended by--\n       (1) inserting ``or Deputy United States Trade \n     Representative'' after ``is the United States Trade \n     Representative''; and\n       (2) striking ``within 3 years'' and inserting ``at any \n     time''.\n       ``(b) Limitation on Appointment as United States Trade \n     Representative and Deputy United States Trade \n     Representative.--Section 141(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 \n\n[[Page S10561]]\n\n     U.S.C. 2171(b)) is amended by adding at the end following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(3) Limitation on appointments.--A person who has \n     directly represented, aided, or advised a foreign entity (as \n     defined by section 207(f)(3) of title 18, United States Code) \n     in any trade negotiation, or trade dispute, with the United \n     States may not be appointed as United States Trade \n     Representative or as a Deputy United States Trade \n     Representative.''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply with respect to an individual appointed as United \n     States Trade Representative or as a Deputy United States \n     Trade Representative on or after the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this is the Dole amendment related to \nthe U.S. Trade Representative.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I understand that this amendment has been \nmodified. It is no longer retroactive; it is prospective only, is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. With that modification, I have no objection. I think it \nmight be wise to state, perhaps, what that amendment does provide, \nbecause it does make a change in terms of the USTR, who can be \nappointed to USTR. I think it would be wise, because it makes a change \nin the revolving door law, that this be stated, albeit briefly.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the first provision says that no one \nshall be appointed to the important post of U.S. Trade Representative, \nor a Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, if that person had in the past \ndirectly represented a foreign government at a trade dispute or \nnegotiation with the United States.\n  The second provision says that nobody who served as U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, or Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, may, after his or \nher employment has ended, represent, aid, or advise any foreign \ngovernment, foreign political party, or foreign business entity with \nthe intent to influence a decision of any officer or employee of any \nexecutive agency.\n  I do not know whether the Senator from Michigan would like me to go \non. I think that basically explains the amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, this amendment has two provisions:\n  The first provision says that no one shall be appointed to the \nimportant posts of U.S. Trade Representative or Deputy U.S. Trade \nRepresentative if that person had, in the past, directly represented a \nforeign government in a trade dispute or negotiation with the United \nStates.\n  The second provision says that no one who has served as U.S. Trade \nRepresentative or Deputy U.S. Trade Representative may, after his or \nher employment has ended, represent, aid, or advise any foreign \ngovernment, foreign political party, or foreign business entity with \nthe intent to influence a decision of any officer or employee of any \nexecutive agency; 18 U.S.C. section 207(f)(2) currently prohibits the \nU.S. Trade Representative from aiding and advising a foreign entity for \na period of 3 years after his service has ended. My amendment \ntransforms this 3-year ban into a lifetime ban and applies the ban to \nthe Deputy Trade Representative as well.\n  Of course, there are many fine men and women\n   who have served America as our trade representatives. My amendment \nshould not be misconstrued as an effort to impugn their integrity in \nany way whatsoever.\n\n  The real problem here is one of appearance--the appearance of a \nrevolving door between Government service and private-sector \nenrichment. This appearance problem becomes all the more acute when \nformer high Government officials work on behalf of foreign interests.\n  That is why my amendment insists that if you have represented the \nUnited States as one of its most senior trade officials in sensitive \ntrade negotiations, you should not now--not 3 years from now, not \never--represent a foreign government or foreign business before the \nGovernment of the United States.\n  Service as a high Government officials is a privilege, not a right. \nThis amendment may discourage some individuals from accepting the \nU.S.T.R. job, but in may view, this is a small price to pay when the \nconfidence of the American people is at stake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 1845) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1841\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I believe my amendment No. 1841 is the \npending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that there is \ndisagreement by Members on this amendment.\n  To refresh the memory of others, this is the amendment that would \nallow for the total assets of a trust to be reported on the disclosure \nform, in the event that the Member is advised under the trust \ninstrument of what the total cash value of those assets are. Right now, \nMembers do report income from their blind trust. They do not, however, \nreport the total cash value of that blind trust, even though our form \nof a qualified blind trust does report that to the Member.\n  So this amendment removes a loophole. It would provide for reporting \nof the total cash value. That clearly does not include the underlying \nassets, but it includes the total cash value of all the assets, only in \nthe case that the trust instrument provides for that to be reported to \nthe individual.\n  Mr. President, there is disagreement on this. I, therefore, ask for \nthe yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have discussed this amendment with \nthe distinguished Senator from Colorado, and I have expressed some \nreservation about it, because what we are doing here is really amending \nthe structure of the blind trust--understanding that it has been in \nexistence here--that permits Members to disassociate the management of \nassets from their activities here and thereby not involving any \nopportunity for conflict. It serves a purpose. It has been on the books \nfor some time now as part of the responsibilities of disclosure of \nSenators.\n  Frankly, I think this is a rather back-door attempt to place this now \nin front of the public without full consideration. I think there ought \nto have been hearings about this to see what the Finance Committee or \nthe Judiciary Committee has to say about the value of this instrument \nas an opportunity to serve, without having to look back over one's \nshoulder, about whether or not they are making a decision that may in \nfact present a conflict.\n  I heard very clearly what the Senator said. All this does is talk \nabout the value. Well, right now, that value may or may not be known \nbut, likely, in an accountant's report, it is to be known for the value \nof doing one's estate planning, financial planning, children, other \nbeneficiaries, in terms of where one would like to see the assets \nperhaps testamentally go. But now what we are saying is, OK, whether \nyou obtain your assets through inheritance, hard work under the \nopportunities afforded in our country, the accumulation of assets now \nbegins to look like it is somehow or other a stigma on one's ability.\n  What we are going to do is continue to denigrate the interest in \nserving by exposing families to public review, by encouraging those who \nseek to gain other people's assets, by either criminal or illegal \nmeans--and that is the purpose of having some protection.\n  I assume that the Senator says that ``OK, what we ought to do is make \nsure that anybody who has acquired assets, no matter how hard they \nworked for it, no matter how ingenious they have been in creating it, \nthey ought to present it willy-nilly out there for public scrutiny.''\n  We now, Mr. President, have categories of assets. I understand that \none of those, if I am correct, and I ask the Chair to be sure that what \nI am saying is accurate, one of those has just been modified so that we \nnow have new levels of reporting assets that we did not have before.\n  Is that true, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair cannot comment on the substance of \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  \n[[Page S10562]]\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BROWN. The Senator is correct, the amendment just accepted adds \ncategories to the existing law, which stops at greater than $1 million. \nThe additional categories apply only to a Member's personal or joint \nassets.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I suggest that the Senator further \nmodify it to say, ``Let's put your checkbook on the table, put your \nbank account out there so the public can see,'' and see what your bill \npaying process has been to make sure that the assets you choose to \nacquire are subject to public scrutiny.\n  This is a subterfuge of some kind. I cannot quite figure it out. \nObviously, it is designed to either embarrass or stigmatize that which \nhas been a legitimate practice here, and that is to say there are \ncategories of assets that indicate in general terms what it is that \nthese assets represent.\n  Now we are getting down to the nitty-gritty and perhaps we will \neventually ask for weekly income or such things. The Senate has \naccepted it, Mr. President. I am sorry to see that we are, as we \ndiscuss lobbying reform, now into this kind of amendment.\n  I wish it had been offered. I might very well support it. I object to \nit as I hear it, because I have not had a chance to see it examined \nfully, to see whether it is an appropriate process, one that we adopted \nsome time ago, and have been following fairly scrupulously.\n  Mr. President, I hope that this amendment will be defeated so it can \nbe deferred and discussed at length in the appropriate committees, as \nopposed to tacking this on to the lobbying reform bill.\n  I also have an amendment, Mr. President, which I believe is listed in \nthe category of amendments to be considered. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the measure before the Senate does not \nchange the underlying statute. Under the statute, a beneficiary can \nreceive certain information. In subparagraph 5:\n\n       Interested parties shall not receive any report on the \n     holding and sources of income of the trust except a report at \n     the end of each calendar quarter with respect to the total \n     cash value of each of the interested parties in trust, or the \n     net income or loss of the trust or any reports necessary to \n     enable interested parties to complete individual tax returns.\n\n  It goes on. My amendment does not change what makes up a blind trust. \nWhat it does do is close a loophole. In the past, Members with a \nqualified blind trust received a report on their income and reported \nthat income.\n  But Members who have a qualified blind trust and receive a report on \nthe total cash value do not have to report the total cash value.\n  My amendment does not change the qualified blind trust, but it does \nchange what we report. It provides for the closing of the loophole. It \ndoes not require the disclosure of the individual assets in the blind \ntrust. Obviously, those are not supposed to be disclosed to the people \ninvolved. It does however, require the disclosure of what is reported \nto the beneficiaries; that is, their total cash value. This has been on \nthe books for some time.\n  Let me deal with another aspect. In my view, my amendment in no way \nis meant to cast a stigma about the abilities of anyone associated with \nthe blind trust. I think people who work hard and save the money have a \nright to be proud of that. It is an achievement. It is not something \nthat casts any stigma on them. This amendment is not offered in that \nlight. It is offered in a belief that disclosure should be consistent \nand there should not be loopholes to shelter very large assets, and \nfull disclosure for those with lesser assets.\n  The fact that you can afford an independent trustee should not be \nused as a measure for exempting you from disclosure. Disclosure ought \nto be applied both to those who cannot afford an independent trustee \nand those who can afford an independent trustee. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1841\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I understand the leaders have reached an \nagreement on the Brown amendment, 1841. I ask unanimous consent to \nwithdraw my request for a record vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  If there be no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1841) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, last week, with the help of the \ndistinguished majority leader Bob Dole, the Senate in record time \npassed an important joint resolution. The measure calls for a statue \nhonoring the leaders of the Women's Suffrage Movement to be removed \nfrom the crypt and put in a place of honor in the Capitol rotunda.\n  The House must now act on this resolution. But when it is approved, \nthis Congress will have succeeded where three others did not.\n  In 1928, 1932, and 1950 resolutions were introduced to move the \nstatue of Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony \nfrom the crypt.\n  These resolutions went nowhere. But with Senator Dole's help, we were \nable to quickly clear a space on the calendar for this resolution to be \npassed.\n  Timing is critical because we want to move the statue before the 75th \nanniversary of the ratification of the 19th amendment to the \nConstitution. That occurs on August 26, and several groups have planned \nceremonies to mark the date when women earned the right to vote--and \nthereby gained full citizenship in our Republic.\n  I believe the elevation of that statue is long overdue and was \npleased that so many of my colleagues gave their support. The rotunda \nis filled with monuments to the achievements of men in American \nhistory. It is only fitting that the accomplishments of these women \nwill also be memorialized in a place of honor. Their efforts changed \nthe history of the United States--and the world by making Democracy \n``saleable'' to every person.\n  Mr. President, last week the 75th anniversary of Woman Suffrage task \nforce held a press conference and discussed our resolution. At that \nmeeting, Joan Meacham and Dr. Caroline Sparks--leaders in the effort to \nmove the statue--eloquently traced the history of the monument and what \nits elevation would mean to American women. I ask that their statements \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statements were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\nRemarks, Joan-Faye Meacham, President of the 75th Anniversary of Woman \n                          Suffrage Task Force\n\n       Press Conference to Announce Senate Passage of Resolution \n     to Move the Suffrage Statue from the Crypt of the Capitol to \n     the Rotunda, Sewall-Belmont House, July 19, 1995.\n       Good Morning, my name is Joan Faye Meacham. I am the \n     President of the 75th Anniversary of Woman Suffrage Task \n     Force. On behalf of the Task Force and the National Woman's \n     Party, I welcome Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska and members of \n     his staff, distinguished members of Congress, members of the \n     Task Force's Honorary Leadership Committee, representative of \n     participating women's organizations, and members of the \n     press.\n       We are happy to be here at the historic Sewall-Belmont \n     House to announce that on July 17, 1995 the U.S. Senate \n     unanimously passed a resolution to move the suffrage statue \n     from the Crypt of the U.S. Capitol to the Rotunda.\n       In 1848, a simple statement was included in the \n     ``Declaration of Sentiments'' presented in Seneca Falls, New \n     York at the Convention that launched the modern women's \n     rights movement.\n       ``Resolved. That it is the duty of the women of this \n     country to secure to themselves their sacred right to the \n     elective franchise.''\n       The three women, Lucreita Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and \n     Susan B. Anthony, that we honor in the Suffrage Monument, \n     devoted their entire adult lives to this duty to achieve the \n     vote that we enjoy today.\n       As you know, August 26th is the 75th Anniversary of the \n     success of their efforts. The 75th Anniversary Task Force is \n     celebrating the achievements of these women and thousands of \n     others who worked and sacrificed for suffrage by announcing \n     four days of activities in our nation's capital from August \n     24th to August 27th 1995. One of our primary goals for this \n     anniversary is to honor our suffrage leaders by moving their \n     monument to a place of prominence in the Rotunda of the U.S. \n     Capitol. The Senate's passage of the resolution to move the \n     statue brings us closer to our long awaited goal.\n       Here to tell you more about the meaning of the statue and \n     the effort to move, is Caroline Sparks, Chair of the 75th \n     Anniversary Women's Rights March who, with Barbara Irvine, \n     the President of the Alice Paul Centennial Foundation, was \n     the founder and Co-Chair of the ``Move the Statues'' \n     Campaign. Dr. Sparks, an activist for the women's rights for \n     25 years, has tirelessly worked to bring the story of the \n     statue to public attention. It is with pride and appreciation \n     that I introduce Dr. Sparks.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  Remarks by Caroline H. Sparks, Ph.D., Chair of the 75th Anniversary \n   Women's Rights Festival and March and Co-Chair of the ``Move the \n                           Statue'' Campaign\n\n       Press conference to Announce Senate Passage of the \n     Resolution to Move the Suffrage Statue to the Capitol \n     Rotunda. July 19, 1995, Sewall-Belmont House.\n       The statue of suffrage leaders, featuring Lucretia Mott, \n     Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony--our ``mothers of \n     woman suffrage''--was presented to Congress by the women of \n     the nation on February 15, 1921, Susan B. Anthony's birthday. \n     Alice Paul of The National Woman's Party, commissioned the \n     statue as a memorial to the work of women to achieve the \n     vote.\n       Adelaide Johnson, the sculptor of the statue, tried to \n     capture in her monument the spirit of the revolution that \n     enfranchised the women of our nation. Her beliefs about the \n     import of the woman movement are expressed in her original \n     inscription for the monument:\n       ``Spiritually the woman movement is the all-enfolding one. \n     It represents the emancipation of womanhood. The release of \n     the feminine principle in humanity, the moral integration of \n     human evolution come to rescue torn and struggling humanity \n     from its savage self.''\n       Johnson's inscription described the three suffrage leaders \n     as ``the three great destiny characters of the world whose \n     spiritual import and historical significance transcend that \n     of all others of any country or any age.'' Her words were \n     whitewashed out with yellow paint in 1921 after the Joint \n     Committee of the Library of Congress balked at the so-called \n     pagan language that glorified the early feminist movement. \n     The statue was moved from the Rotunda to the Crypt shortly \n     after its initial dedication, where it still remains, 75 \n     years later. The statue's name has been lost though it has \n     been known variously as ``The Woman Movement'', \n     ``Revolution'' and the ``Pioneer Suffrage Statue''. Today, \n     known simply as ``The Portrait Monument'', the women's names \n     face the wall and cannot be seen.\n       I first saw the statue while in Washington for a march for \n     women's equality in 1977. Like many women, a friend and I \n     simply stumbled upon it. Although we had been activists for \n     many years, we had never known of its existence. When I \n     worked for the Feminist Institute, the statue was the \n     inspiration for the development of the Feminist Walking Tour \n     of Capitol Hill, in which we gave women an opportunity to see \n     women's history in the nation's capital and to hear stories \n     of women's fight for equality. Women still tell me that they \n     ``stumble'' upon the statue, never having known its story.\n       In 1990, a coalition of women's groups, led by the Feminist \n     Institute, the Alice Paul Foundation, The National Woman's \n     Party and other women's organizations and supporters launched \n     a campaign to move the statue. We felt then, and we still \n     feel, that we need public symbols that depict women who have \n     participated in the creation of our Nation. We are concerned \n     that visitors to the Capitol Rotunda are left with the \n     impression that women had nothing to do with the founding of \n     the Nation. We believe it is important for our citizens, \n     especially our children, and foreign guests to see pioneers \n     of suffrage in the Rotunda with George Washington, Abraham \n     Lincoln and Martin Luther King, as an inspiration and a \n     reminder that women fought for over 70 years to win basic \n     rights. Young women, especially, need to know that women \n     accepted their duty to fight for our rights and be inspired \n     to continue the struggle for equality begun by these \n     foremothers. Everyone needs to know the history of the \n     struggle to achieve suffrage for half our population.\n\n[[Page S10564]]\n\n       Our coalition is not the first to demand more prominent \n     display of the suffrage monument. A year after the statue was \n     removed to the basement storage area, members of the National \n     Woman's Party protested that it was covered with dirt and \n     rubbish. Unable to have the statue cleaned, they brought mops \n     and buckets in and cleaned it themselves. Resolutions to move \n     the statue have been brought before Congress in 1928, 1932 \n     and 1950 but were unsuccessful.\n       We, like these others who tried before us, want the \n     Suffrage leaders in the rotunda as a visible reminder of the \n     strength and ability of women and as an inspiration to women \n     in the future to continue to fight for their rights. We \n     believe that this, the 75th year after its creation, is the \n     year this effort will be successful.\n       The Joint Resolution to Move the Statue has already passed \n     unanimously in the Senate and now goes to the House of \n     Representatives. We ask that our Representatives recognize \n     the importance of women voters by joining the Senate in this \n     resolution and we remind them that in a democracy: ``It's not \n     nice to put your forefathers in the living room and your \n     foremothers in the basement.''\n       With us today is someone who understood immediately the \n     importance of honoring our suffrage leaders. Senator Ted \n     Stevens of Alaska introduced the Joint Resolution to Move the \n     Suffrage monument to the Rotunda. We thank Senator Stevens \n     and ask that he make a few remarks about his involvement in \n     the effort to move the statue.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/24/senate-section/article/S10563-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                                 BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I wanted to take a few moments to share \nwith my Senate colleagues my concerns regarding our current policy in \nBosnia.\n  The situation in Bosnia is a tragedy, there is no question. It is a \ntragedy borne by interventionist policies that have not worked, and \nwill not work if allowed to continue. Most important, unless we reverse \ncurrent policies, we are inviting for increased U.S. involvement, in \nthe form of air support now and ground troops tomorrow. That must not \nhappen.\n  The conflict between the Moslems and Serbs that reside in Bosnia did \nnot begin with the fall of the former Yugoslavian Government. The \nconflict has roots of animosity that are far deeper--roots that stretch \nback for centuries. This is just the latest chapter, the latest \nreincarnation, of a brutal civil war between ethnic factions. What \nmakes this latest chapter of conflict more tragic is the fact that one \nside has been prevented from defending its people by governments and \norganizations that claim to support their interests.\n  Mr. President, I believe we should not send U.S. ground troops to \nBosnia for two basic reasons. First, there is no clear objective, no \nnational security interest that justifies deploying American forces \ninto a regional civil war.\n  American lives are sacred. As an army lieutenant who served in \nVietnam, I strongly oppose sending our young men and women to Bosnia as \na separate force or under U.N. command. It is plain common sense that \nyou do not commit American forces without a clear plan or purpose. To \ndo otherwise would not be fair to our troops. It would not be fair to \ntheir families. At this time, no clear plan or purpose exists that \nwould justify U.S. troop deployment.\n  Second, I oppose sending American troops to Bosnia because I believe \nit would only make matters worse in the region. I am concerned that the \ninsertion of American forces to carry out current policies in Bosnia \nwould only extend the conflict. Again, Mr. President, this is a civil \nwar. Past history suggests that when foreign governments intervene in a \ncivil war, they serves to exacerbate the conflict.\n  We must not forget our own history. We had a civil war of our own--\nthe bloodiest, costliest conflict in our Nation's history. It was a \nlong, brutal affair. Yet, had England or France entered on the side of \nthe Confederacy at that time--which they considered doing--I believe \nour civil war would have gone on far longer--meaning more pain, more \nsuffering, more lives lost on both sides.\n  The same is true in Bosnia. We have seen outside parties, mainly the \nUnited Nations, intervene in Bosnia already. This intervention included \nan arms embargo that has prevented a legitimate government from \ndefending itself. It has prevented the citizens of a legitimate \ngovernment from defending their homes and property. This intervention \nhas done nothing more than allow the conflict to drag on with no end in \nsight. This policy of intervention has failed. And unless we recognize \nthis now, we will only make matters worse for the people in the region \nand for our own people at home.\n  So, again, Mr. President, let me state that our current \ninterventionist policy in Bosnia has failed. It is wrong. And if \nallowed to continue, I fear it will mean U.S. troops in Bosnia. That \nmust not happen. I oppose placing U.S. troops under our own leadership \nor under the authority of the United Nations in Bosnia in the midst of \na Bosnian civil war. There is no commonsense justification for doing \nso. The Government of Bosnia has not asked for U.S. troops. The people \nof Bosnia know that U.S. troops will only make the conflict last longer \nand would claim more lives unnecessarily. They simply want the right to \ndefend themselves. I agree. Let us give them that right, and let us \nkeep our American forces here at home.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/24/senate-section/article/S10564-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE? JUST LOOK AT THE ARITHMETIC\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, it does not take a rocket scientist to be \naware that the U.S. Constitution forbids any President to spend even a \ndime of Federal tax money that has not first been authorized and \nappropriated by Congress--both the House of Representatives and the \nU.S. Senate.\n  So when a politician or an editor or a commentator pops off that \n``Reagan ran up the Federal debt'' or that ``Bush ran it up,'' bear in \nmind that the Founding Fathers, two centuries before the Reagan and \nBush Presidencies, made it very clear that it is the constitutional \nduty of Congress--a duty Congress cannot escape--to control Federal \nspending.\n  Thus, it is the fiscal irresponsibility of Congress that has created \nthe incredible Federal debt which stood at $4,936,735,579,244.31 as of \nthe close of business Friday, July 21. This outrageous debt--which will \nbe passed on to our children and grandchildren--averages out to \n$18,739.93 for every man, woman, and child in America.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/24/senate-section/article/S10564-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/24/senate-section/article/S10564-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/24/senate-section/article/S10564-4", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING THE RECESS\n\n\n                         enrolled bills signed\n\n  A message from the House, received on July 21, 1995, during the \nrecess of the Senate, announced that the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nArmey) signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 1944.

A bill to provide procedures for the contribution of \nvolunteer U.S. military personnel to international peace operations; to \namend title 10, United States Code, to provide for participation of the \nArmed Force in peacekeeping activities, humanitarian activities, and \nrefugee assistance, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n\n         the international peace operations support act of 1995\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, Senator Jeffords and I are introducing \ntoday a bill entitled ``The International Peace Operations Support Act \nof 1995.'' The bill would enhance the U.S. military's ability to \ncontribute to international peace operations, and is similar to \nlegislation we introduced in the last Congress.\n  The Simon-Jeffords bill requires the President to report to Congress \non a plan to earmark within the Armed Forces a contingency force that \ncould be used for peace and humanitarian operations, and could be \ndeployed on 24-hour notice. The force would include up to 3,000 active-\nduty personnel from any of the services, who would volunteer to serve \nin international peace operations. The soldiers would receive extra \ncompensation for their participation, and would get special training \nfor such operations.\n  Additionally, the bill augments the mission statements of the Army, \nNavy, and Air Force by affirming that their responsibilities include \nparticipation in ``international peacekeeping operations, humanitarian \nactivities, and refugee assistance activities, when determined by the \nPresident to be in the national interest.''\n  Senator Jeffords and I designed this legislation to help the U.S. \nmilitary meet some of the emerging threats in the post-cold-war era: \nethnic conflicts and civil wars that cause regional instability, \nhumanitarian disasters, and aggressors that threaten our interests \noverseas. Just as the military was used to confront the threat of the \ncold war, it will be called upon to address the threats of today and \ntomorrow. This has been evident in recent years in Bangladesh, Somalia, \nMacedonia, Rwanda, and Haiti, where the United States military has been \nasked to perform missions beyond the scope of traditional war-fighting, \ngenerally called peace operations.\n  Some reject categorically these kinds of roles for our military. I \nbelieve that is a mistake, and a denial of reality. That point of view \nimplies that our military planners should prepare only for the big ones \nlike World War II on the gulf war. That notion is not realistic, and \nwould not serve our national security interests. Regional conflicts and \ninstability are inevitable, and humanitarian disasters are inescapable. \nPeace operations will be needed, and the U.S. military--the most \ncapable in the world--will be called upon to respond, so long as our \nNation rejects isolationism.\n  Simon-Jeffords bill would help us respond to emergencies and crises \nby consolidating up to 3,000 soldiers with both the will and the \ntraining to undertake peace operations, who could react on short, \nperhaps 24-hour, notice. Let me give an example of why this is \nimportant:\n  In May 1994, when the situation in Rwanda was going from worse to \nhorrific, Senator Jeffords and I called the Canadian general in charge \nof the small U.N. force there. General Daullaire made it clear that the \nquick infusion of 5,000-8,000 troops could stabilize the situation. \nUnfortunately, the United Nations did not have the troops, nor were \nnations willing to provide them, and we\n subsequently witnessed the deaths of hundreds of thousands. Rapid \ndeployment of a contingency force as envisioned in this bill, in \nconjunction with similar forces in other countries, may have been able \nto help General Daullaire prevent some of the tragedy in Rwanda.\n\n  The concept of rapid reaction capability is neither new nor is it \nrevolutionary. The first U.N. Secretary General, Trygve Lie, raised the \nidea in 1948, and there is a growing interest among the international \ncommunity in enhanced military responsiveness. In fact, the United \nStates is far behind our allies on new thinking in these areas. Canada \nis studying proposals to have nations designate contingency forces for \npeace operations, which would be coordinated by a central headquarters \nin some location. Our bill would fit into that plan very well. Denmark \nand the Netherlands are also formulating plans on quick reaction \nforces.\n  The U.S. military realizes that we will have to deal with regional \ncrises, and I give credit to the services for incorporating peace and \nhumanitarian \n\n[[Page S10566]]\noperations into their mission statements, strategy and planning. The \nNational Military Strategy prepared by the Joint Chiefs finds that \npeacetime engagement activities are a primary military task--activities \nsuch as peacekeeping, humanitarian operations and democratic \nassistance. Senator Jeffords and I believe our bill complements these \nefforts already underway.\n  I noted before that the contingency force would be made of \nvolunteers, who would be given added compensation. This is all \nvolunteers, who would be given added compensation. This is an important \ncomponent. We must recall that despite the difficulties with our \noperations in Somalia and Haiti, our soldiers expressed a sense of \npride and accomplishment in their missions to help the people in these \ntroubled lands. I imagine that it would not be difficult to find \nsoldiers who would like to join this force.\n  The burden of world leadership is on the United States--we are the \nrichest, the most influential, and the most militarily capable nation. \nOur soldiers will inevitably be called on to respond to world crises. \nThe Simon-Jeffords bill can improve our response capability by \nproviding for a contingency force of specially trained troops for quick \ndeployment.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n                                S. 1065\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``International Peace \n     Operations Support Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) With the end of the Cold War, the United States is \n     clearly the undisputed world economic and military leader and \n     as such bears major international responsibilities.\n       (2) Threats to the long-term security and well-being of the \n     United States no longer derive primarily from the risk of \n     external military aggression against the United States or its \n     closest treaty allies but in large measure derive from \n     instability from a variety of causes: population movements, \n     ethnic and regional conflicts including genocide against \n     ethnic and religious groups, famine, terrorism, narcotics \n     trafficking, and proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       (3) To address such threats, the United States has \n     increasingly turned to the United Nations and other \n     international peace operations, which at times offer the best \n     and most cost-effective way to prevent, contain, and resolve \n     such problems.\n       (4) In numerous crisis situations, such as the massacres in \n     Rwanda, the United Nations has been unable to respond with \n     peace operations in a swift manner.\n       (5) The Secretary-General of the United Nations has asked \n     member states to identify in advance units which are \n     available for contribution to international peace operations \n     under the auspices of the United Nations in order to create a \n     rapid response capability.\n       (6) United States participation and leadership in the \n     initiative of the Secretary-General is critical to leveraging \n     contributions from other nations and, in that way, limiting \n     the United States share of the burden and helping the United \n     Nations to achieve success.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this Act--\n       (1) the term ``appropriate congressional consultation'' \n     means consultation as described in section 3 of the War \n     Powers Resolution; and\n       (2) the term ``international peace operations'' means any \n     such operation carried out under chapter VI or chapter VII of \n     the United Nations Charter or under the auspices of the \n     Organization of American States.\n\n     SEC. 4. REPORT ON PLAN TO ORGANIZE VOLUNTEER UNITS.\n\n       Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the President shall submit a report to the Congress \n     setting forth--\n       (1) a plan for--\n       (A) organizing into units of the Armed Forces a contingency \n     force of up to 3,000 personnel, comprised of current active-\n     duty military personnel, who volunteer additionally and \n     specifically to serve in international peace operations and \n     who receive added compensation for such service;\n       (B) recruiting personnel to serve in such units; and\n       (C) providing training to such personnel which is \n     appropriate to such operations; and\n       (2) proposed procedures to implement such plan.\n\n     SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Upon approval by the United Nations \n     Security Council of an international peace operation, the \n     President, after appropriate congressional consultation, is \n     authorized to make immediately available for such operations \n     those units of the Armed Forces of the United States which \n     are organized under section 4(1)(A).\n       (b) Termination of Use of United States Armed Forces.--(1) \n     Subject to paragraph (2), the President may terminate United \n     States participation in international peace operations at any \n     time and take whatever actions he deems necessary to protect \n     United States forces.\n       (2) Notwithstanding section 5(b) of the War Powers \n     Resolution, not later than 180 days after a Presidential \n     report is submitted or required to be submitted under section \n     4(a) of the War Powers Resolution in connection with the \n     participation of the Armed Forces of the United States in an \n     international peace operation, the President shall terminate \n     any use of the Armed Forces with respect to which such report \n     was submitted or required to be submitted, unless the \n     Congress has extended by law such 180-day period.\n\n     SEC. 6. AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS.\n\n       Funds available to the Department of Defense are authorized \n     to be available to carry out section 5(a).\n\n     SEC. 7. WAR POWERS RESOLUTION REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       Except as otherwise provided, this Act does not supersede \n     the requirements of the War Powers Resolution.\n\n     SEC. 8. MISSION STATEMENTS FOR ARMED FORCES.\n\n       (a) Army.--Section 3062(a) of title 10, United States Code, \n     is amended--\n       (1) by striking out ``and'' at the end of paragraph (3);\n       (2) by striking out the period at the end of paragraph (4) \n     and inserting in lieu thereof ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(5) participating in international peacekeeping \n     activities, humanitarian activities, and refugee assistance \n     activities when determined by the President to be in the \n     national interests of the United States.''.\n       (b) Navy.--Section 5062(a) of such title is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(a)'';\n       (2) by striking out the second sentence; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(3) The Navy is responsible for the preparation of naval \n     forces necessary for the following activities:\n       ``(A) Effective prosecution of war except as otherwise \n     assigned and, in accordance with integrated joint \n     mobilization plans, for the expansion of the peacetime \n     components of the Navy to meet the needs of war.\n       ``(B) Participation in international peacekeeping \n     activities, humanitarian activities, and refugee assistance \n     activities when determined by the President to be in the \n     national interests of the United States.''.\n       (c) Air Force.--Section 8062(a) of such title is amended--\n       (1) by striking out ``and'' at the end of paragraph (3);\n       (2) by striking out the period at the end of paragraph (4) \n     and inserting in lieu thereof ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(5) participating in international peacekeeping \n     activities, humanitarian activities, and refugee assistance \n     activities when determined by the President to be in the \n     national interests of the United States.''.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I join Senator Simon in \nintroducing the Simon-Jeffords International Peace Operations Support \nAct of 1995.\n  The altogether natural and necessary focus in American politics on \nour domestic problems should not blind us to the monumental \nresponsibilities of the United States as a leader of the world \ncommunity. The very real dangers of the post-cold war world, as well as \nthe equally real opportunities, are ignored only at our peril.\n  When civil strife or naked aggression threaten the stability of \ncountries or whole regions and threaten the lives of whole populations, \nit is clearly in the world community's interest to try to do something. \nThis response could take many forms, and a U.S. contribution might \nappropriately consist of political support, logistics or intelligence \nassistance, or provision of equipment. But there surely will be times \nwhen it will be in the U.S. national interest to respond to acute \npeacekeeping and other humanitarian needs with a contribution of \ntroops.\n  We are severely hamstrung today in our ability to respond to these \ntypes of problems. With the most capable military establishment in the \nworld, we find ourselves often unable to contribute troops to \ninternational peacekeeping efforts because of unclear political \nguidance to our military as to whether peacekeeping is part of its \nmission and a reluctance to train a designated cadre of troops to \nperform the tasks of peacekeeping, refugee assistance, and other \nhumanitarian operations.\n  Our legislation addresses this problem. It sharpens one of our tools \nof foreign and security policy by providing \n\n[[Page S10567]]\nclearer guidelines for U.S. troop contributions to United Nations or \nother international peace activities. It specifically makes this \nactivity a formal mission of the U.S. military in cases where U.S. \nnational interests are served by a peacekeeping deployment. It also \ncalls for the identification of a specific unit or units consisting of \nservice personnel who have volunteered for such service and who would \nbe given specialized training for the unique circumstances of such \nmissions.\n  The preeminent position of the United States in the world, and our \nfar-flung commercial and security interests do not always dictate that \nwe contribute troops to address particular problems, but they do \ndictate that we be prepared to do so if necessary. As in other areas of \ninternational endeavor, U.S. leadership means that our contributions \nleverage contributions by other states that follow our lead. Thus, \ngreater U.S. contributions to U.N. peacekeeping might, as the result of \na multiplier effect, prove to be the most cost-effective method of \nincreasing worldwide peacekeeping capabilities.\n  We are rightly proud of the dedication, skills, and bravery of our \nArmed Forces. They are the world's most effective fighting force, and \ntheir skills and dedication have successfully been applied to \nhumanitarian activities in, for example, Operations Provide Comfort in \nIraq and Restore Democracy in Haiti. Not all international crises will \nresult in U.S. troop deployments. Indeed, our experience in Somalia has \nbrought home quite clearly to us the limits of international action in \nthe face of massive civil strife. But when the international community \ndecides to act, and when we decide that it is appropriate to offer as \nour contribution the finest, most capable men and women in uniform in \nthe world, we must be ready.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BRADLEY (for himself and Mr. Nickles):\n  S. 1066. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to phase \nout the tax subsidies for alcohol fuels involving alcohol produced from \nfeedstocks eligible to receive Federal agricultural subsidies; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                   the clean fuels equity act of 1995\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \naimed at restoring some level of financial equity in the marketplace \nfor clean automotive fuels. My bill will phase out certain targeted tax \nsubsidies given to an industry that has too long received unique and \nfavorable treatment under the Tax Code: The domestic ethanol industry. \nIn this effort, I am very pleased to be joined in this effort by \nSenator Nickles as an original cosponsor of this legislation.\n  The Clean Fuels Equity Act will phase out the ethanol tax subsidy for \nethanol produced from feedstocks that already receive other subsidies \nthrough the Department of Agriculture's price and income support \nprograms. The phaseout would occur over 3 years to allow the existing \nindustry an orderly transition to a less-sheltered marketplace. My \nlegislation would continue to allow the tax credits for special energy \ncrops, waste products, and other biomass that do not benefit from the \nUSDA price supports. These energy crops hold some promise of \nenvironmental and energy benefits. Furthermore, they still represent a \ntechnically immature industry, for which additional Federal support \nmight be justified.\n  As most people know, the bulk of the ethanol produced in the United \nStates is derived from corn, and processed and sold in the Midwest; 20 \nyears ago, there was no fuel ethanol industry. But, born from the \ncrisis concerns of the late 1970's, this business grew from nothing, \nbuilt by an array of special and substantial tax privileges. However, \nunlike many of the questionable policies developed during that period \nof energy crisis--from the Synfuels Corp. to the Fuel Use Act and plans \nfor gas rationing--the ethanol subsidies continue to survive.\n  When the credits were initiated over 15 years ago, they were intended \nto jumpstart an industry that would not otherwise exist. This policy \nhas obviously succeeded. The ethanol industry is no longer a small, \nfledgling industry. It now produces in excess of a billion gallons of \nethanol per year and consumes roughly one-half billion bushels of corn \nyearly. It is an industry that now benefits from special tax credits \nand exemptions worth roughly $700 million per year--a number that is \ngrowing. These tax subsidies are in addition to the millions of dollars \nin benefits the industry receives each year from the USDA price support \nprograms.\n  In light of recent ethanol industry efforts to obtain\n   regulatory expansions of their subsidies, it seems the ethanol \nindustry's attitude can be characterized by the phrase ``never \nenough.'' Why worry what it costs to produce a product when you get a \ntargeted tax credit, soon to be worth nearly $1 billion per year? Why \nworry about competition when you receive millions more through price \nsupports?\n\n  The cost to taxpayers and the cost to consumers are real. These \nsubsidies take money out of Americans' pockets. In the face of billions \nof dollars in cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, and education programs for \nchildren, I question a continued, substantial tax break to a single, \nwell-established industry. By handing out subsidies to ethanol, the \nGovernment is passing along a bill worth hundreds of millions of \ndollars to taxpayers and consumers.\n  Ethanol competes in the marketplace with other chemicals that have no \nspecial tax break. These alternatives must compete based on price and \nperformance. This legislation is not intended to be punitive to \nethanol. Rather, it is an attempt to allow the markets a better chance \nto work for the benefit of all consumers, taxpayers, and the \nenvironment. Furthermore, it is acknowledgment that you cannot have it \nboth ways. If ethanol already benefits from price supports, there is no \nneed for a tax credit to keep an industry afloat. It is that simple.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider this legislation carefully. Last \nyear the Joint Tax Committee estimated that this bill would raise \nalmost $3 billion over a 5-year period; since then, the cost of \nsubsidizing the ethanol industry has only gone up. In these times when \nwe are struggling to reduce the deficit as well as the tax burden on \nthe American middle class it makes sense to reduce unneeded subsidies \nwhenever possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

                       ____\n\n                   The Clean Fuels Equity Act of 1995\n\n       Senator Bradley's legislation would phase out the existing \n     tax credits for ethanol produced from certain feedstocks. The \n     tax will be phased out for ethanol if it is produced from \n     feedstocks, such as corn, that are eligible for various price \n     and income supports under the programs of the U.S. Department \n     of Agriculture. If the ethanol feedstock is a specialized \n     energy crop, not supported by USDA, or a waste product, the \n     tax credit will still be allowed.\n       The phase-out will occur over 3 years. Unless exempt, \n     ethanol would be allowed: the full tax credits for calendar \n     year 1995; 67 percent of the existing credits for 1996; and \n     33 percent of the existing credits for 1997. No special tax \n     subsidies would be allowed for ethanol, unless exempt, after \n     December 31, 1997.\n       The principal Federal incentive for ethanol is a 54-cent \n     exemption from the Federal motor fuel excise tax. Each gallon \n     of gasoline blended with at least 10 percent ethanol is \n     eligible for the exemption. Using a blend, each gallon of \n     ethanol can be blended with nine gallons of gasoline to make \n     ten gallons of a blended fuel. All ten gallons are eligible \n     for the exemption, which equates to a total exemption of 54 \n     cents on each gallon of ethanol.\n       Also, an equivalent 5.4-cent-per-gallon federal blenders' \n     income tax credit or refund is available to fuel distributors \n     that blend ethanol into motor fuels, The tax credit or refund \n     can be taken in lieu of the excise tax exemption described \n     above.\n       Because of these tax subsidies, ethanol can be offered at a \n     dramatically lower price than would be the case otherwise. \n     The U.S. ethanol industry produces approximately 1.2 billion \n     gallons of ethanol for blending into fuel each year. This \n     equates to a total subsidy value in excess of $700 million \n     annually. Last year's effort by EPA to mandate a market set-\n     aside for ethanol would have added at least another $300 \n     million annually to the tax subsidy total.\n       Ethanol is produced today almost exclusively from \n     feedstocks that are eligible for USDA support.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend from New \nJersey, Senator Bradley, in the introduction of legislation to phase-\nout tax subsidies for the ethanol industry. If enacted, our legislation \nwill reduce the Federal budget deficit by nearly $3 billion over the \nnext 5 years.\n  For 15 years the Federal Government has provided substantial tax \nbreaks to subsidize the development and use of ethanol as a clean, \nrenewable fuel. Those subsidies have proven very effective, as the U.S. \nethanol industry will produce over 1 billion gallons of ethanol for \nblending into fuel this year, costing the government over $700 million \nin lost tax revenue.\n  However as with most government programs, even though the need for \nethanol tax subsidies has ended, the subsidies themselves live on. In \nfact, the ethanol industry and their friends in the legislative and \nexecutive branches are continually seeking to expand those subsidies.\n  We believe the time has come to stop subsidizing a healthy industry. \nOther clean fuels offer the same benefits as ethanol, but struggle to \ncompete against ethanol's massive tax advantage.\n  Our legislation will even the playing-field by phasing-out the excise \ntax exemption and income tax credit over 3 years for ethanol produced \nfrom crops which are also eligible for U.S. farm program subsidies. \nThis prevents the double-subsidization of some farm production, while \nallowing continued ethanol tax breaks for alcohol produced from non-\nsubsidized crops or waste products.\n  Mr. President, as we seek to eliminate our budget deficit, it is \nimportant that we examine all forms of Federal spending, including \nspecialized tax expenditures. We should not allow our tax code to \nsubsidize healthy businesses, especially when those subsidies create an \nunfair competitive advantage over others. I am pleased to join Senator \nBradley in this initiative.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. COHEN (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1067. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nan excise tax exemption for transportation on certain ferries; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                     TAX ON TRANSPORTATION BY WATER\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to \nclarify an interpretation of a section in the Internal Revenue Code \nthat imposes a $3 departure tax on ship passengers aboard vessels that \ntravel outside the U.S. The provision was intended to apply to \npassengers on cruise ships and gambling voyages. The language of the \nstatute reaches further, however, and the International Revenue Service \nhas \n\n[[Page S10569]]\nbeen interpreting the law to apply to a broader class of passenger ship \ntraffic, including ferry services that operate between the United \nStates and Canada.\n  Section 4471 of the Internal Revenue Code was added to the Internal \nRevenue Code in the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1989. The provision \noriginated in the Senate Commerce Committee as a means of that \nCommittee fulfilling its reconciliation instructions. The tax writing \ncommittees assumed jurisdiction once it became clear that the provision \nwas more in the nature of a tax than a fee. The fee, as envisioned by \nthe Commerce Committee, was intended to apply to overnight passenger \ncruises that do not travel between two U.S. ports, and to gambling \nboats providing gambling entertainment to passengers outside the \nterritorial waters of the U.S.\n  Unfortunately, the statutory language of the 1989 Act was not drafted \nin accordance with the intent of Congress. As a result, the tax appears \nto apply to commercial ferry operations traveling between the United \nStates and Canada. Two such ferries operate between Maine and Nova \nScotia. The Maine ferries carry commercial and passenger vehicles to \nNova Scotia in the warmer months as a more direct means of \ntransportation between Maine and eastern Canada. As such they are an \nextension of the highway system, carrying commercial traffic and \nvacationers. The lengths of the voyages are approximately 11 hours and \nalmost all passengers traveling on the outbound voyages do not return \non the inbound voyages of the two ferries. Because the trips are of \nsome length, the ferries provide entertainment for the passengers, \nincluding some gaming tables that bring in minimal income.\n  This is not a voyage for the purpose of gambling and the great \nmajority of the passengers, including children, do not gamble. Clearly, \nthese ferries are not the kind of overnight passenger cruises or \ngambling boats intended to be covered by the law. However, the IRS has \nbeen interpreting the statute to apply this tax to ferries.\n  The statute establishes a dual test for determining if the tax \napplies. First, the tax applies to voyages of passenger vessels which \nextend over more than one night. As a factual matter, the Maine ferries \ndo not travel over more than one night\n but the IRS interprets that they do because it takes into account both \nthe outward and inward voyage of the vessel. The IRS considers both \nportions of the trip to be one voyage even though virtually no \npassengers are the same.\n\n  Second, the tax applies to commercial vessels transporting passengers \nengaged in gambling. Although the intent was to apply the tax to \ngambling boats, the wording of the statute applies to all passengers on \nvessels that carry any passengers who engage in gambling, no matter how \nminor that gambling. That interpretation subjects the Maine ferries to \nthe tax because they earn a minimal amount of income from providing \ngambling entertainment to some passengers.\n  The legislation I am introducing clarifies the statute by exempting \nferries which are defined as vessels where no more than half of the \npassengers typically return to the port where the voyage began.\n  This legislation is not intended to give a special break to a certain \nclass of passenger ships. It is instead intended to clarify the statute \nso that it achieves its original intent: To tax passengers on cruise \nships and gambling voyages, not passengers on ferry boats.\n  The imposition of the tax to ferries is particularly unfair. First, \nbecause Congress did not intend to tax such ferries. Second, because \nthe burden of the tax relative to the price of the ticket, is greater \non ferries. Their ticket prices are much lower than tickets for cruise \nships so the tax is considerably more burdensome for ferry operations \nand interferes to a greater extent with their operations.\n  Similar legislation addressing this issue has been approved by the \nFinance Committee in the past but the underlying bills were not enacted \ninto law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the introduced legislation be \nincluded in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1067\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXEMPTION FOR TRANSPORTATION ON CERTAIN FERRIES.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--Subparagraph (B) of section 4472(1) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to exception for \n     certain voyages on passenger vessels) is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(B) Exception for certain voyages.--The term `covered \n     voyage' shall not include--\n       ``(i) a voyage of a passenger vessel of less than 12 hours \n     between 2 ports in the United States, and\n       ``(ii) a voyage of less than 12 hours on a ferry between a \n     port in the United States and a port outside the United \n     States.\n\n     For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term `ferry' \n     means any vessel if normally no more than 50 percent of the \n     passengers on any voyage of such vessel return to the port \n     where such voyage bean on the 1st return of such vessel to \n     such port.''\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to voyages beginning after December 31, 1989; \n     except that--\n       (1) no refund of any tax paid before the date of the \n     enactment of this Act shall be made by reason of such \n     amendment, and\n       (2) any tax collected from the passenger before the date of \n     the enactment of this Act shall be remitted to the United \n     States.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself and Mr. Simon):\n  S. 1068. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to permanently \nprohibit the possession of firearms by persons who have been convicted \nof a violent felony, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/24/senate-section/article/S10565-5", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10569-S10573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     STOP ARMING FELONS (SAFe) ACT\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today Senator Simon and I are \nintroducing legislation, the Stop Arming Felons, or SAFe, Act, to close \ntwo loopholes in current law that allow convicted violent felons to \npossess and traffic in firearms.\n  The legislation would repeal an existing provision that automatically \nrestores the firearms privileges of convicted violent felons and drug \noffenders when States restore certain civil rights. In addition, the \nbill would abolish a procedure by which the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco \nand Firearms can waive Federal restrictions for individuals otherwise \nprohibited from possessing firearms or explosives.\n  As a general matter, Mr. President, Federal law probibits any person \nconvicted of a felony from possessing firearms or explosives. However, \nthere are two gaping loopholes.\n  I call the first the ``State guns for felons loophole.'' Under this \nprovision, if a felon's criminal record has been expunged, or his basic \ncivil rights have been restored under State law--that is, rights like \nthe right to vote, the right to hold public office, and the right to \nsit on a jury--then the conviction is wiped out and all Federal firearm \nprivileges are restored.\n  Many States automatically expunge the records or restore the civil \nrights of even the most dangerous felons. Sometimes this happens \nimmediately after the felon serves his or her sentence. Sometimes, the \nfelon must wait a few years. The restoration of rights or expungement \noften is conferred automatically by statute--not based on any \nindividualized determination that a given criminal has reformed.\n  As a result of this loophole, which was added with little debate in \n1986, even persons convicted of horrible, violent crimes can legally \nobtain firearms.\n  Mr. President, I think most Americans would agree that this guns for \nfelons loophole makes no sense. Given the severity of our crime \nproblem, we should be looking for ways to get tougher, not easier, on \nconvicted felons. How can the government claim to be serious about \ncrime, and then turn around and give convicted violent felons their \nfirearms back?\n  I recognize that, according to some theories, the criminal justice \nsystem is supposed to rehabilitate convicted criminals. But in reality, \nmany of those released from prison soon go back to their violent ways. \nAccording to the Justice Department, of State prisoners released from \nprison in 1983, 62.5 percent were arrested within only 3 years. Knowing \nthat, how many Americans would want convicted violent felons carrying \nfirearms around their neighborhood?\n  This guns for felons loophole also is creating a major obstacle for \nFederal law enforcement.\n  The Justice Department reports that many hardened criminals are \nescaping \n\n[[Page S10570]]\nprosecution under the Armed Career Criminal Act, which prescribes stiff \npenalties for repeat offenders, because the criminals' prior \nconvictions have automatically been nullified by State law. It is a \nvery serious problem. According to testimony before the House Judiciary \nCommittee, for example, the U.S. Attorney in Montana believes that this \nprovision has virtually gutted her ability to minimize violent crime by \nkeeping guns out of the hands of known criminals in Montana.\n  Concern about the guns for felons loophole is not limited to Federal \nlaw enforcement officials. State and local law enforcement officers \nalso feel strongly about this. The Presidents of the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, the National Association of Police Organizations, and the \nInternational Brotherhood of Police Officers have written that the \nloophole is having ``terrible results'' around the country, and \nrearming people with long criminal records.\n  Mr. President, the legislation that Senator Simon and I are offering \ntoday would close this State guns-for-felons loophole. Under the bill, \npersons convicted of violent felonies or serious drug offenses would be \nbanned from possessing firearms, regardless of whether a State restores \nother rights, or expunges their record.\n  In the case of those convicted of other, nonviolent felonies, a \nState's restoration of civil rights, or expungement, would not \neliminate the Federal firearm prohibition unless the State makes an \nindividualized determination that the person does not threaten public \nsafety.\n  As under current law, if a conviction is reversed or set aside based \non a determination that it is invalid, or the person is pardoned \nunconditionally, the Federal firearm prohibition would not apply.\n  Otherwise, though--and this is the essential message of the \nlegislation--convicted violent felons and serious drug offenders would \nbe strictly prohibited from possessing firearms. Not just for a year. \nNot just for a few years. But for the rest of their lives.\n  Let me turn now to the second ``guns for felons loophole.''\n  I think of this as the Federal guns for felons loophole. You could \nalso call it the bombs for felons loophole.\n  Even if a felon's civil rights have not been restored under State \nlaw, nor his records expunged, there is another way that a criminal can \nlegally obtain guns or explosives. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms can simply issue a waiver.\n  Under this second loophole, convicted felons of every stripe can \napply to ATF, which then must perform a broad based field investigation \nand background check. If the Bureau believes that the applicant does \nnot pose a threat to public safety, it can grant a waiver.\n  Between 1981 and 1991, 5600 waivers were granted.\n  Mr. President, this relief procedure has an interesting history. It \nwas first established in 1965 not to permit common criminals to get \naccess to guns, but to help out a particular firearm manufacturer, \ncalled Winchester. Winchester had pleaded guilty to felony counts in a \nkickback scheme. Because of the conviction, Winchester was forbidden to \nship firearms in interstate commerce. The amendment was approved to \nallow Winchester to stay in business.\n  Because it was drafted broadly, however, the waiver provision applied \nnot only to corporations like Winchester, but to common criminals. \nOriginally, waivers were not available to those convicted of firearms \noffenses. But the loophole was further expanded in 1986, when Congress \nallowed even persons convicted of firearms offenses, as well as those \ninvoluntarily committed to a mental institution, to apply for a waiver.\n  Between 1981 and 1991, ATF processed well over 13,000 applications at \ntaxpayer expense. Many of these have required a substantial amount of \nscarce time and resources. ATF investigations can last weeks, including \ninterviews with family, friends, and the police.\n  In the late 1980's, the cost of processing and investigating these \npetitions worked out to about $10,000 for each waiver granted. It is \nhard to imagine a more outrageous waste of taxpayer dollars.\n  Of course, Mr. President, giving firearms to convicted violent felons \nis more than a problem of wasted taxpayer dollars and misallocated ATF \nresources. It also threatens public safety.\n  The Violence Policy Center sampled 100 case files of those who had \nbeen granted relief. The study found that 41 percent had been convicted \nof a crime of violence, or a drug or firearms offense. The crimes of \nviolence included several homicides, sexual assaults, and armed \nrobberies.\n  Under the relief procedure, ATF officials are required to guess \nwhether criminals like these can be entrusted with deadly weapons. \nNeedless to say, it is a difficult task. Even after Bureau \ninvestigators spend long hours investigating a particular criminal, \nthere is no way to know with any certainty whether he or she is still \ndangerous.\n  The law forces officials to make these types of guesses, knowing that \na mistake could have tragic consequences for innocent Americans; \nconsequences that could range from serious bodily injury to death.\n  What happens when convicted felons get their firearms rights back? \nWell, some apparently go back to their violent ways. Those granted \nrelief subsequently have been rearrested for crimes ranging from \nattempted murder to rape, kidnapping, and child molestation.\n  Mr. President, this simply has got to stop.\n  In fact, Senator Simon and I have been successful over the past three \nyears in securing language in the Treasury, Postal Service and General \nGovernment Appropriations Bill that prohibits the use of appropriated \nfunds to implement the ATF relief procedure with respect to firearms. \nHowever, a funding ban is merely a stop-gap measure effective for one \nfiscal year. This bill would eliminate the relief procedure \npermanently. As we see it, Federal taxpayers should never be forced to \npay a single cent to arm a felon.\n  I also would note that the existing funding ban applies only to \nfirearm waivers. ATF still is allowed to provide waivers for convicted \nfelons who want to possess or traffic in explosives. The waivers for \nexplosives are not granted often, and seem to be less of a problem. But \nin light of the Oklahoma City bombing, how many Americans would want \nany of their tax dollars spent so that convicted felons can obtain \nexplosives?\n  Mr. President, there is broad support for closing the guns for felons \nloophole. In 1992, the Constitution Subcommittee of the Judiciary \nCommittee held a hearing on this matter. At that hearing, the Fraternal \nOrder of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, and \nthe International Brotherhood of Police Officers all testified that \nthese loopholes must be closed. In addition, I would note that both the \nNew York Times and the Washington Post have editorialized on this \nmatter.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a moment and say a word to those \nwho generally oppose gun control measures. I know that many Americans \nare very concerned about any effort that could lead to broad \nrestrictions on guns. So I want to emphasize something: this is an \nanticriminal bill. And a pro-taxpayer bill. Law-abiding citizens have \nnothing to fear, and everything to gain from a prohibition on firearm \npossession by violent felons and serious drug offenders.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, firearm violence has reached epidemic \nproportions. We have a responsibility to the victims and prospective \nvictims to take all reasonable steps to keep this violence to a \nminimum. Keeping firearms away from convicted violent felons and \nserious drug offenders is the least these innocent Americans should be \nable to expect.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord at this point, along with some related materials.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                S. 1068\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Whether or not the measure becomes law \n     this year, both houses have now voted for a waiting period \n     before the purchase of a handgun, and the Senate was even \n     willing to prohibit the sale of certain kinds of \n     semiautomatic assault weapons. Another proposal to limit gun \n     possession, first suggested by the Washington-based Violence \n     Policy Center, was offered too late for inclusion in the \n     crime bill but will be introduced by its sponsors, Rep. \n     Edward Feighan (D-Ohio) and Rep. Lawrence Smith (D-Fla.), \n     when Congress returns in January.\n       By statute, the Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \n     Firearms is required to process applications submitted by \n     convicted felons seeking to have their right to own guns \n     restored. In general, such individuals are prohibited form \n     possessing, shipping, transporting or receiving firearms, but \n     a special exception was created to allow the federal \n     government to restore these rights in some circumstances. The \n     loophole was created to save the Winchester Firearms Co.--\n     whose parent company had been convicted in a kickback \n     scheme--from bankruptcy. Unfortunately, the law is broad \n     enough to encompass individuals who are found ``not likely to \n     act in a manner dangerous to public safety,'' and because \n     special appellate rights have been granted to applicants who \n     are turned down, BATF must take every application seriously \n     and be able to justify every ruling.\n       How does a federal agency go about deciding which felons, \n     of the 10,000 who have applied for restoration of gun rights, \n     would constitute a danger to society if allowed to own a \n     firearm? By full field investigations involving interviews \n     with family, friends, neighbors and business associates of \n     the applicant, by reviewing criminal records and parole \n     histories and by relying on the expert judgment of \n     professionals trained to assess an individuals's potential \n     for violence--if, indeed, that can be done. All this takes a \n     great deal of time and costs the taxpayer about $1 million a \n     year.\n       The idea of the government's making a special effort to \n     rearm convicted felons is difficult to fathom. The continued \n     expenditure, in tight budget times, of millions of dollars to \n     implement this program is impossible to justify. Both \n     situations should be remedied by the passage of the Feighan-\n     Smith bill early next year.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From The Washington Post, Jul. 5, 1995]\n\n                     Out of Prison and Armed Again.\n\n       The National Rifle Association showed its muscle last week \n     during a House Appropriations subcommittee markup. As a \n     result, Congress is now on track to restoring one of the most \n     senseless programs ever to be foisted on the executive \n     branch. It involves firearms and convicted felons, and \n     contrary to all reason, members of Congress have now taken \n     the first step toward putting the two together.\n       Federal law rightly bars convicted felons from possessing, \n     shipping, transporting or receiving firearms or ammunition. \n     It's one of the penalties, like losing the right to vote or \n     run for office, imposed on people who commit serious crimes. \n     But in the '60s a loophole was created allowing the secretary \n     of the Treasury to lift this prohibition in cases in which \n     the criminal was ``not likely to act in a manner dangerous to \n     public safety.'' The change was made to save the Winchester \n     Firearms Co., whose parent corporation, Olin Mathieson, had \n     pleaded guilty to felony kickback charges. Without the \n     waiver, the gun company would have gone into bankruptcy. \n     Unfortunately, individuals began applying to have their \n     firearms rights restored, too. And nine years ago, the \n     problem was exacerbated when Congress gave every dissatisfied \n     applicant the right to challenge a denial in court.\n       The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is charged with \n     implementing this program, and it was spending millions each \n     year and assigning 40 agents full-time to do background \n     checks on applicants. In 1992, however, Congress in effect \n     ended the program by prohibiting the use of appropriated \n     funds for that purpose. While the NRA likes to talk about the \n     otherwise law-abiding stockbroker caught in a financial \n     swindle and now cut off from his beloved hobby of deer \n     hunting, the truth is that the rights restoration program \n     regularly enabled violent offenders to rearm. A number were \n     convicted of new gun crimes after their rights were restored.\n       Now the Treasury subcommittee of House Appropriations has \n     voted to resurrect the program. This is nonsense. Even if \n     felons are required to pay the cost of investigations \n     themselves, even if violent criminals and gun offenders are \n     excluded from the benefit, the whole idea of putting weapons \n     in the hands of men and women who are serious offenders is \n     irrational. It's hard enough these days to distinguish an \n     ordinary citizen from a potential killer with a grudge. But \n     people who have already been convicted of a felony are easy \n     to identify. Why spend the government's time and money to \n     restore such a person's right to arm himself to the teeth, \n     when his track record affords legitimate reason to keep him \n     away from weapons? The Appropriations subcommittee is off to \n     a very bad start in this direction, and responsible forces on \n     the Hill should see to it that the effort is deep-sixed.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, today I introduce the Stop Arming Felons \nAct [SAFe], a bill to correct dangerous Federal and State legislative \nloopholes which allow convicted felons to possess firearms.\n  Until Senator Lautenberg and I shut down funding for the Federal \nloophole in 1992, millions of taxpayers' dollars had been spent \nrearming felons. This money was spent because a 1965 gun control \nstatute has required the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms [BATF] \nto process gun ownership applications submitted by convicted felons. \nWhile in general the 1968 Gun Control Act prohibits persons convicted \nof crimes punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year from \npossessing a firearm, this 1965 loophole allowed convicted felons to \napply to BATF and petition for a waiver on the ground that the felon \n``will not be likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety.''\n  Certainly, this wasn't the intention of Congress when it passed the \nexemption in 1965. In fact, it was passed as a favor to the Winchester \nFirearms Co., whose parent organization had been found guilty of a \nkickback scheme. Without the amendment, the company would have gone \nbankrupt. In 1968, however, the language was expanded to allow \nindividuals to apply.\n  According to the Washington Post, some 22,000 such applications for \nexemption by individuals were processed by BATF from 1986-91--at a \ntaxpayer cost of approximately $4 million a year. This means that from \nfiscal years 1985 to 1991, BATF spent well over $20 million to \ninvestigate gun possession applications submitted by felons. Not only \nis the process costly, it's also very laborious. Because the \napplicants' eligibility is dependent upon the laws of the State where \nthey were convicted, BATF agents must be familiar with 50 \n\n[[Page S10572]]\ndifferent statutes. Furthermore, many of the numerous applications for \nrelief require a background check and an extensive investigation of the \nformer felon. These time consuming, often tedious investigations are \nperformed by agents who would otherwise be investigating violent \ncrimes.\n  Senator Lautenberg and I have successfully shut down funding for the \nBATF Program since 1992 through the appropriations process. This year, \nhowever, a House subcommittee voted to lift the funding prohibition on \na partyline vote. Fortunately, Congressman Durbin and his Democratic \ncolleagues successfully\n reinstated the prohibition at the full committee markup. It is time to \nput a permanent end to this program, or we risk getting into annual \nappropriations struggles over whether or not to spend money rearming \nfelons. Indeed, when the House committee first agreed to revise the \naction of the subcommittee, they offered language which stated that \nthere should be no assurance that the funding prohibition would be \nmaintained in fiscal year 1997. Again, Congressman Durbin successfully \noffered an amendment to strike that language.\n\n  When the House subcommittee voted to restore funding this year, \nChairman Lightfoot stated: ``I don't see this as dangerous. Violent \npeople won't apply in the first place.'' Similarly, an NRA spokesman \nclaimed: ``We're talking about individuals who may have run afoul of \nFederal law but paid their debt to society.''\n  These statements are simply untrue. Running ``afoul'' of Federal law \nwould be a huge understatement to describe many of the crimes committed \nby the felons who not only apply for relief, but who are actually \ngranted waivers by the BATF under this program. For example, according \nto a 1992 Violence Policy Center study, out of a random sample of 100 \napplicants who were granted relief by the BATF, 11 originally were \nconvicted of burglary, 17 were convicted of drug-related offenses, 8 \nwere convicted of firearm violations, 5 were convicted of robbery, \nincluding 1 who committed armed robbery with a handgun, and 5 were \nconvicted of sexual assault, including aggravated rape, sodomy, and \nchild molestation. Here are some of the stories behind the numbers:\n  Jerome Sanford Brower was granted relief after pleading guilty to \ncharges of conspiracy to transport explosives. He transported \nexplosives to Libya and instructed Libyans in defusing explosive \ndevices.\n  An applicant was granted relief in 1989 after serving 24 months for \nvoluntary manslaughter after killing his cousin with a 16-gauge \nshotgun.\n  An applicant, granted relief in 1989, pleaded guilty to sexual abuse \nafter assaulting his 14-year-old stepdaughter.\n  An applicant, granted relief in 1989, was convicted of armed robbery \nand served 18 months for robbing a K-Mart with a loaded .38 caliber \nrevolver.\n  In addition to these examples, the numbers of applicants rejected \nalso gives us insight into the types of felons who are applying to \nregain their right to carry a weapon. After conducting extensive \ninvestigations, the BATF may deny the applications of felons who will \n``be likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety.'' Under this \nstandard, the BATF found it necessary to deny 3,498, or approximately \none-third of all applications, between 1981-91. In other words, BATF \ndetermined that almost 3,500 applicants might pose a threat to public \nsafety.\n  Not only do violent felons apply to have their rights restored, but \nmany commit crimes after their applications are approved by the BATF. \nAlmost 5 percent of those felons granted relief in 1986 were rearrested \nby 1990. According to the Violence Policy Center's report, none of \nthese recidivist crimes were white collar, but rather were violent \ncrimes ranging from attempted murder, sexual assault, abduction-\nkidnapping, child molestation, drug trafficking, and illegal firearms \npossession.\n  Amazingly, an application for relief isn't always necessary: several \nStates automatically restore gun privileges to felons upon the \ncompletion of their sentence. In other words, some States restore the \ncivil rights, including their firearms rights, of convicted felons the \nminute they walk out of prison, or within several months of their \nrelease. Felons in these States need not even apply to BATF to get \ntheir firearms rights restored. This State loophole, in the words of a \nJustice Department official, is ``the biggest problem'' facing U.S. \nattorney's today.\n  Perhaps the most disturbing case of this type has been that of Idaho \nfelon Baldemar Gomez. He had been convicted of second-degree murder, \nvoluntary manslaughter and battery on a correctional officer. However, \nbecause Idaho was one of the States that automatically restored \nconvicts' civil rights upon their release from prison, in the words of \nAssistant U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist, ``when Baldemar walked out of \nthe penitentiary, someone could have been standing there and handed him \na shotgun and it would have been entirely legal * * *''. In 1987, Gomez \nwas rearrested during a drug raid and was convicted of violating the \nGun Control Act by knowingly possessing a firearm after having been \npreviously convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a period \nof more than 1 year. However, this conviction was overturned by the \nU.S. Court of Appeals because of Idaho's automatic relief provision.\n  In response to the Gomez case, the Idaho legislature changed its law \nso that felons must wait 5 years after their sentence and then get \nState approval in order to own a firearm. Some States, however, still \nhave laws which restore firearms rights to convicted felons without \nsuch review.\n  Fortunately, we can eliminate these dangerous loopholes by passing \nthe Stop Arming Felons Act [SAFe]. Our act can put a permanent end to \nthe unnecessary expense of the BATF Program and put the agents at BATF \nback to work on the investigation of violent crimes--not convicted \nfelons. Specifically, the bill would prohibit individuals, including \nfelons and fugitives from Justice, from applying to BATF for firearms \ndisability relief.\n  Furthermore, the SAFe Act would address the State loophole by \nprohibiting States from restoring firearm privileges to violent felons. \nNonviolent felons may be granted a waiver, but only after the State has \nmade an individualized determination that the person would not pose a \nthreat to public safety.\n  How would this bill affect Illinois? Illinois law currently allows \nthe State police to grant firearms privileges to nonviolent felons. \nForcible--or violent--felons may not apply for relief. Because our \nproposed bill and the current Illinois firearm privilege restoration \nprocedures are so similar, Illinois would benefit from this bill, \nbecause the residents of Illinois would no longer have to fund the BATF \nrelief procedure through their taxes.\n  I feel confident that most of my colleagues will support this \nmeasure. While many of us have differed in the past over issues such as \ncontrolling assault weapons and passing a handgun waiting period, I \nthink we can all agree that convicted felons should not be applying to \nthe Federal Government for firearms relief at the taxpayers' expense--\nnor should violent felons be getting relief from the States.

The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and \nrevenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the concurrent resolution on the budget (H. Con. Res. \n218), show that current level spending is below the budget resolution \nby $20.9 billion in budget authority and $2.0 billion in outlays. \nCurrent level is $0.5 billion over the revenue floor in 1995 and below \nby $9.5 billion over the 5 years 1995-1999. The current estimate of the \ndeficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is \n$237.4 billion, $3.7 billion below the maximum deficit amount for 1995 \nof $241.0 billion.\n  Since my last report, dated July 11, 1995, Congress has cleared for \nthe President's signature the 1995 emergency supplementals and \nrescissions bill (H.R. 1944).

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   THE PASSING OF DR. SAMUEL L. BANKS\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, on Wednesday, July 19, the \nchildren of Maryland lost a distinguished educator. African-Americans \nin Maryland lost an impassioned, tireless and eloquent leader. All of \nus who thirst for justice and equality lost an enormously distinguished \nchampion. And, I lost a good friend.\n  I refer, Mr. President, to the passing of Balitimore's Dr. Samuel L. \nBanks. My relationship with Dr. Banks was one of long-standing, dating \nback to my earliest days as a grassroots organizer and community \nactivist. Dr. Banks and I debated one another on many occasions. I \nalways felt that we not only debated each other but delighted each \nother.\n  No community ever had a more persuasive, persistent and effective \nadvocate than did Baltimore's African-American community in Dr. Banks. \nHe had a rare and wonderful gift for language and communication. He \nnever failed to awe me with his unique ability to express the most \ncontent-rich views in the most vivid of images.\n  Dr. Banks was a fighter for those left out and left behind. He was a \nmighty warrior for good. In an illustrious career of over 30 years as a \nteacher and Administrator in Baltimore City public schools, he \nimplemented his vision of education as a tool of empowerment.\n  His loss is a deep tragedy for his family and friends. My condolences \ngo out to all his loved ones. But his passing is also a tremendous loss \nfor the children of Maryland. I wish we had a hundred--a thousand--Dr. \nBanks in Baltimore and in communities throughout Maryland and, indeed, \nthe country. We desperately need more people with his dedication and \nvision.\n  So, all of us will miss him greatly. I hope, though, that when he \nentered the gates of Paradise, he was greeted by Martin Luther King, \nJr., Sojourner Truth, Frederick Douglass and Mary McLeod Bethuse. And \nwouldn't we all like to sit there and listen to that heavenly choir.\n  Mr. President, I would like to share with my colleagues an article \nand an editorial tribute from the Sun which sum up much of what made \nDr. Samuel Banks such a remarkable figure, and ask that they be printed \nin the Record.\n  The articles follow:\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, July 20, 1995]\n\n                            Samuel L. Banks\n\n       Regular readers of this newspaper's letters to the editor \n     knew Samuel L. Banks as an inveterate correspondent always \n     ready to take on the powers-that-be with a rhetorical \n     flourish that both enlightened and entertained.\n       Dr. Banks, who died Wednesday at 64, was for 36 years a \n     teacher and administrator in the Baltimore City public \n     schools. But it was through his innumerable letters to the \n     editor, his feisty opinion-page pieces and his sometimes \n     prolix prose that he became known to thousands of Marylanders \n     as a tireless champion of equal opportunity.\n       Most people write letters to the editor to let off steam, \n     express a personal opinion or simply for the thrill of seeing \n     their name in print. The letters columns are a forum for all \n     manner of complaints, grudges and passionate appeals as well \n     as for the occasional gem of lucidity and sweet reason. A few \n     people develop virtual second careers as letters column \n     correspondents, vying with other letter writers and the \n     newspaper's own staff members for pride of placement and \n     frequency of publication.\n       For Dr. Banks, however, a letter to the editor or an \n     opinion page article was a means to \n\n[[Page S10577]]\n\n     an end, not an end in itself. He addressed the issues of the \n     day not out of vanity but because he believed fervently that \n     change would never come unless the status quo was challenged. \n     He made it his business to do so as forcefully as possible. \n     He wanted to wipe out every trace of bigotry and \n     discrimination so that the nation might at last fulfill its \n     historic promise of justice and equal opportunity for all.\n       Applying the dictum of old-time labor leader Sam Gombers--\n     always demand more, more, more--Dr. Banks brought to his \n     advocacy an unquenchable demand for improvement in the lives \n     of his fellow African Americans. This newspaper was his \n     special focus. He would rise in righteous fury against news \n     stories or editorials he considered unfair to this \n     constituency or his several causes. Yet when writers \n     displayed what he regarded as greater sensitivity, he would \n     dispense gentlemanly praise before launching into a lecture \n     of what could be done better. He was one of our most \n     persistent bed bugs, albeit a beneficent bed bug. We suspect \n     that description would please him.\n       Dr. Banks' style often mimicked the stately cadences of a \n     church sermon. But he was fond of spicing up his phrases with \n     unusual and sometimes arcane words that lent his expressions \n     a peculiar dignity and sly humor. He knew readers delighted \n     in his seemingly inexhaustible stock of adjectives, which he \n     piled atop one another.\n       Editors could pare words, phrases or whole paragraphs from \n     his letters and still have more than enough left to fill the \n     allotted space. Dr. Banks' vision of America and its \n     possibilities was as generous as his use of words, and as \n     wise.\n                                                                    ____\n\n Samuel Banks, Champion of Black History, Dies--Educator Was Known for \n                           His Love of Words\n\n                           (By Joan Jacobson)\n\n       Samuel L. Banks, a Baltimore educator who was a connoisseur \n     of the English language and a nationally known champion of \n     African-American history, died suddenly yesterday at his home \n     in Prince George's County. He was 64.\n       Dr. Banks was a teacher and administrator for 36 years, \n     orchestrating one of the nation's first Afro-centric social \n     studies curricula in city schools more than 20 years ago.\n       A history and social studies teacher who taught future \n     mayor Kurt L. Schmoke at City College during the 1960s, Dr. \n     Banks became a school administrator and national leader at \n     writing history and social studies curricula.\n       A prolific writer--particularly for The Sun, The Evening \n     Sun and the Afro-American--Dr. Banks excoriated the U.S. \n     Supreme Court for its rulings against affirmative action and \n     flayed the Republican-dominated Congress for what he believed \n     was a racially biased ``Contract with America.''\n       In his writings, he was fond of using French phrases and \n     quoting abolitionist-writer Frederick Douglass. He often sent \n     readers to a dictionary to look up words. He used the word \n     ``Zeitgeist'' in a July 14 letter to a Sun editor that \n     arrived on the day of Dr. Banks' death.\n       Dr. Banks died yesterday morning after a routine day of \n     work and an evening at home the day before, said his wife of \n     38 years, Elizabeth.\n       As she was waking up, Mrs. Banks said, she heard her \n     husband take two heavy breaths and heard no breathing after \n     that. She said she did not know the cause of death.\n       The news of Dr. Banks' death traveled quickly and with \n     sadness through the Baltimore Education Department's North \n     Avenue headquarters yesterday.\n       ``It was awfully hard to break the news,'' sad May \n     Nicholsonne, associate superintendent for instruction, who \n     informed the staff of the school system's department of \n     compensatory and funded programs, which Dr. Banks directed.\n       ``I asked them to carry on the legacy and think of all the \n     contributions he made,'' she said.\n       Delores Powell, a secretary whose desk sits outside Dr. \n     Banks' office, remembered him as a ``sweet, gentle man'' who \n     took time out from his busy schedule to write recommendation \n     letters to help her daughter get a college scholarship.\n       ``It's a shock to everybody,'' she said. ``I don't know a \n     better word, but Dr. Banks would have a better word.''\n\n\n                             a wise leader\n\n       Dr. Banks was ``a wise leader in the school system and in \n     the city of Baltimore,'' said Martin Gould, assistant \n     superintendent for family and student support services. ``He \n     was a warm and supportive colleague from the first day I came \n     on board here.''\n       On Tuesday, said Dr. Gould, Dr. Banks appeared in good \n     health, physically and mentally as he ``consumed a 150-page \n     document in a matter of hours'' before discussing it in \n     detail.\n       Mayor Schmoke, in a written statement, called Dr. Banks, \n     ``a leader in promoting multicultural education long before \n     it became a fashionable topic for public discussion.\n       ``I was a student of his at City College and through the \n     years I found him to be a tough advocate with a kind heart, a \n     person who will be greatly missed by his community,'' said \n     Mr. Schmoke.\n       Dr. Banks had many other admirers as well.\n       ``The world is a much lesser place without Dr. Banks,'' \n     said Margie Ashe, a homemaker and writer, who became Dr. \n     Banks' friend through the Association for the Study of Afro-\n     American Life and History. ``Dr. Banks was a gentleman. He \n     was one of the most considerate human beings I have ever \n     met.''\n       The Woodlawn resident said she and Dr. Banks also had a \n     mutual love for words.\n       ``One of my major accomplishments was that I found a four-\n     letter word that Dr. Banks didn't know. It was `limn' which \n     means to outline or describe something. I found it in a \n     crossword puzzle. After I finally worked it out, I said, `Did \n     you know this one, Sam?' and he said no. He was famous for \n     knowing all the words in the dictionary and using them.''\n       Thousands of Marylanders who never met Dr. Banks knew him \n     through his articles and letters to the editor of the Sun and \n     The Evening Sun. Joseph R. L. Sterne, Sun editorial page \n     editor, estimated that Dr. Banks wrote more letters to the \n     editor than any other contributor during the last two \n     decades.\n\n\n                              Many topics\n\n       ``He's been one of our most dedicated letter writers. His \n     letters often were couched in formal language that led to \n     some kinds of parody but also rang with a certain kind of \n     dignity,'' said Mr. Sterne.\n       In his letters to the editor, Dr. Banks took on many \n     topics--most dealing with the inequities he perceived toward \n     African-Americans. For instance, in a letter that appeared in \n     Saturday's paper, he critized the Supreme Court decision \n     against minority set-asides, saying the court ``has placed \n     its judicial imprimatur in a resuscitation of separate but \n     unequal treatment for black citizens.''\n       Yesterday, in what turned out to be his last communication \n     with The Sun, Dr. Banks wrote of his ``concern that so many \n     in our society, young and adult, are bombarded constantly \n     with negativism failure, cynicism and alienation. This \n     situation, I believe, weighs very heavily and \n     disproportionately on children and youths given the Zeitgeist \n     or spirit of the times.''\n       In his letter to a Sun editor, Dr. Banks encouraged the \n     newspaper to ``highlight the experiences and successes of \n     young people who are making vital, substantive and \n     inspirational gains in spite of societal turbulence, apathy \n     and ennui.\n       In the early 1980s, Dr. Banks was instrumental in leading a \n     predominantly black boycott of the Baltimore Sun after a \n     series of articles appeared in The Evening Sun that dealt \n     with single-parent families.\n       But harsh criticisms were not limited to the Supreme Court, \n     congress or the local newspaper.\n       In a recent interview, Dr. Banks ridiculed his boss, City \n     School Superintendent Walter G. Amprey, for his unusually \n     close relationship with the head of a private company hired \n     to run several city schools.\n       Dr. Banks' wife said his prolific writing and strong \n     opinions on education were fueled by ``his care and concern \n     for children. He believed in education. It was uppermost in \n     his thoughts. He loved children.''\n       Dr. Banks was educated in the Norfolk, Va., school system, \n     received his undergraduate and master's degrees from Howard \n     University in Washington and his doctorate in education from \n     George Washington University, also in Washington.\n       He was a member of numerous organizations, including the \n     National Council of History Standards and the NAACP.

Banks was as familiar a fixture at the \n     newspaper as any of its regular staff writers. His missives \n     to The Sun were unceasing; it was not unusual for two or \n     three of his letters to be published in the newspaper each \n     month. ``In the past 22 years that I've been on this job, \n     we've had more Sam Banks' letters than any other letter \n     writer by far,'' Joseph R. L. Sterne, The Sun's editorial \n     page editor, said yesterday, ``And yet being Sam Banks, if we \n     discarded a few of his letters, he would be quick to put on \n     pressure to get his letters into the paper.''\n       If Mr. Banks' writing was often verbose and more than a bit \n     preachy, it was also dignified, passionate and occasionally \n     caustic. Below, a selection from his voluminous \n     correspondence with this newspaper:\n       The [Joe] Smith case has reverberations far beyond College \n     Park. The larger issue concerns an almost veritable disregard \n     in predominantly white NCAA-affiliated colleges for black \n     student-athletes. These black youths are simply seen as \n     gladiators, especially in football and basketball, whose \n     athletic talents and abilities bring huge profits to the \n     institutions.--May 17, 1995.\n       Finally, I recall, as an undergraduate member of the \n     debating team at Howard University, how the late Lewis \n     Fenderson often cautioned us: ``When you have the facts, \n     argue the facts. When you don't have the facts, pound the \n     table lustily.''\n       Mr. Slepian's letter gave abundant evidence of the \n     latter.--April 30, 1995.\n       It is a national scandal that, 31 years after the enactment \n     of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, white males still make up 97 \n     percent of senior managers in Fortune 1000 companies.--March \n     29, 1995.\n\n[[Page S10578]]\n\n       The banal and wholly self-serving comments of Mr. Williams \n     regarding his upbringing in South Carolina and the role of \n     race represented a cruel and mindless transmogrification of \n     truth and reality.--Feb. 26, 1995.\n       The painting of graffiti outside the Knesh Israel Synagogue \n     in Annapolis and a black-owned hair salon in Edgewater is a \n     manifestation of a worrisome situation that goes far beyond \n     the October Ku Klux Klan rally in Annapolis led by a group of \n     rag-tag, venomous and obstreperous peddlers of hate, \n     divisiveness and intolerance.\n       As has been true historically in our nation, the central \n     problem remains the refusal of white Americans to accept the \n     clear and present reality of racism.--Jan. 6, 1995.\n       Congressional Republicans' so-called ``Contract with \n     America'' signals an intensification of hostility, racism and \n     indifference to the socio-economic and educational needs of \n     racial minorities and the poor.--Dec. 13, 1994.\n       The saga of Marion Barry is instructive and inspirational. \n     He had fallen, through his visceral and worldly appetites, to \n     the lowest point with his incarceration. Nonetheless, he paid \n     his dues and bounced back. His incarnation provides a \n     marvelous example to those in similar predicaments as to what \n     can be achieved through faith in God, determination and \n     staying power.--Nov. 2, 1994.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/24/senate-section/article/S10576-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            SAMUEL L. BANKS\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am proud to join with the \nBaltimore community and the friends of education throughout Maryland in \nhonoring the memory of Dr. Samuel L. Banks who was a longtime champion \nof civil rights and education in our State.\n  Dr. Banks was an outspoken advocate for expanding educational \nopportunities and was particularly concerned in fostering the potential \nof Afro-American students. He was fervent in his pursuit for \neducational equality as was evidenced in his frequent contributions to \nthe Baltimore Sun, both in letters to the editor and in the commentary \nsection.\n  Most importantly, Dr. Banks was an extraordinarily well-read and \nlearned person who displayed throughout his professional life \nintellectual excellence and personal generosity.\n  I extend my most sincere sympathies to Elizabeth, his wife, Gayle and \nAllison, his daughters, and to all of the family and friends of Samuel \nBanks. Mr. President, I ask that an editorial from the Baltimore Sun \nthat pays homage to Dr. Banks be inserted in the Record as follows:\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, July 21, 1995]\n\n                            Samuel L. Banks\n\n       Regular readers of this newspaper's letters to the editor \n     knew Samuel L. Banks as an inveterate correspondent always \n     ready to take on the powers-that-be with rhetorical flourish \n     that both enlightened and entertained.\n       Dr. Banks, who died Wednesday at 64, was for 36 years a \n     teacher and administrator in the Baltimore City public \n     schools. But it was through his innumerable letters to the \n     editor, his feisty opinion-page pieces and his sometimes \n     prolix prose that he became known to thousands of Marylanders \n     as a tireless champion of equal opportunity.\n       Most people write letters to the editor to let off steam, \n     express a personal opinion or simply for the thrill of seeing \n     their name in print. The letters columns are a forum for all \n     manner of complaints, grudges and passionate appeals as well \n     as for the occasional gem of lucidity and sweet reason. A few \n     people develop virtual second careers as letters column \n     correspondents, vying with other letter writers and the \n     newspaper's own staff members for pride of placement and \n     frequency of publication.\n       For Dr. Banks, however, a letter to the editor or an \n     opinion page article was a means to an end, not an end in \n     itself. He addressed the issues of the day not out of vanity \n     but because he believed fervently that change would never \n     come unless the status quo was challenged. He made it his \n     business to do so as forcefully as possible. He wanted to \n     wipe out every trace of bigotry and discrimination so that \n     the nation might at last fulfill its historic promise of \n     justice and equal opportunity for all.\n       Applying the dictum of old-time labor leader Sam Gompers--\n     always demand more, more, more--Dr. Banks brought to his \n     advocacy an unquenchable demand for improvement in the lives \n     of his fellow African Americans. This newspaper was his \n     special focus. He would rise in righteous fury against news \n     stories or editorials he considered unfair to his \n     constituency or his several causes. Yet when writers \n     displayed what he regarded as greater sensitivity, he would \n     dispense gentlemanly praise before launching into a lecture \n     of what could be done better. He was one of our most \n     persistent bed bugs, albeit a beneficent bed bug. We suspect \n     that description would please him.\n       Dr. Banks' style often mimicked the stately cadences of a \n     church sermon. But he was fond of spicing up his phrases with \n     unusual and sometimes arcane words that lent his expressions \n     a peculiar dignity and sly humor. He knew readers delighted \n     in his seemingly inexhaustible stock of adjectives, which he \n     piled atop one another.\n       Editors could pare words, phrases or whole paragraphs from \n     his letters and still have more than enough left to fill the \n     allotted space. Dr. Banks' vision of America and its \n     possibilities was as generous as his use of words, and as \n     wise.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/24/senate-section/article/S10578-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      KOREAN WAR VETERANS MEMORIAL\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the 5.7 \nmillion service men and women who served our Nation during the Korean \nwar. All too often, these individuals have been America's forgotten \nsoldiers, having fought and died in what has been called the forgotten \nwar.\n  With the dedication of the National Korean War Memorial on July 27, \nhere in Washington, DC, the memory of the supreme effort that so many \nmade will now be honored by future generations. Though we will never be \nable to express in mere words or stone the greatness of the deeds \nperformed by our veterans in that war, the memorial will at least keep \nfresh the memories of our fathers and mothers, husbands and wives, and \nbrothers and sisters who made the greatest of all sacrifices in that \nfar-off land.\n  Today, over 37,000 veterans from the Korean war reside in West \nVirginia. One of those 37,000 is my friend Edmund Reel. I want to tell \nyou his story because his experiences and actions speak far more \neloquently about him and his fellow veterans than I could hope to.\n  Edmund is from Moorefield, WV, where he is a retired command sergeant \nmajor after 28 years of service. He devotes all of his free time to \nmajor veterans' groups, helping his former comrades in arms.\n   Edmund arrived in Korea on August 25, 1950. Serving in Company M of \nthe 8th Regiment of the 1st Cavalry, he saw action from Taegu to the \nYalu. On November 1, he was captured by the Chinese. For the next 34 \nmonths, Edmund was a prisoner of war. Shuffled between North Korean and \nChinese prison camps, he was subject to torture, hard labor, \nstarvation, and constant beatings. Edmund remembers that one time, \nduring a particularly brutal winter day, he was forced to stand on a \nhill for hours with a heavy rock above his head. During a day of hard \nlabor, he fell in a deep hole, fracturing his back. North Korean \nofficers offered him medical care if he would convert to communism and \nbe used as a propaganda tool. Edmund refused. Though his body was \nbroken, his will would never be. Despite his injury, Edmund was forced \nto continue hard labor, cutting logs and building bomb shelters. Many \nof Edmund's buddies never got out of those prison camps. He saw them \ndie, as many as 35 a day, from starvation and sickness.\n  On August 24, 1953, Edmund was released and was soon headed home to \nthe States and West Virginia.\n  His story is just one of many that make up the history of the \nAmerican experience in Korea. He, like so many others, was sent to that \ndistant country, joining with other soldiers from other allied nations \nin fighting a common, merciless aggressor. They knew the justness of \ntheir cause, democracy against totalitarianism.\n  The debt we owe to our Korean war veterans, like the veterans of \nother wars, is immeasurable. The memories of those young soldiers, \nsailors, and airmen who gave, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, that \n``last full measure of devotion,'' remain etched in our minds. Places \nsuch as Heartbreak Ridge, Inchon, and Chipyong-ni will forever be \nhallowed ground where Americans gave their lives for freedom. They \nsacrificed so that a people they did not even know might remain free. \nIn doing so, they ennobled themselves and our Nation. Those living and \ndead of the Korean war will always serve as examples of true \nAmericans.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/24/senate-section/article/S10578-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10578-S10579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JULY 25, 1995\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
