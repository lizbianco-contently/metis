The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to discuss \nthe amendment No. 1285 that I have offered on behalf of Senators Snowe, \nRockefeller, Exon, Kerrey, Craig, and myself. [[Page S8418]] \n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that one-half hour has been \nreserved for debate on this amendment. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I intend to just use a few minutes and \nthen reserve the remainder of that time for any of the Senators who \nwish to speak on the amendment any time between now and 12:15, if that \nis agreeable to the manager.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the amendment would effectively means test the \ncommunity users provision in this bill. The amendment states that no \nfor-profit business, school with an endowment of $50 million or more, \nor library that is not eligible for participation in the State-based \nplan qualifying for library services and Construction Act title III \nfunds will receive preferential rates of treatment.\n  Mr. President, as the part of the bill that came to the floor which \nwas added as an amendment in committee, as it states now, any school, \nlibrary, or hospital would be eligible for preferential rates or \ntreatment.\n  I understand the intent of that amendment. It has been made very \nclear and was again made clear when I proposed an amendment to remove \nthat provision of the bill entirely.\n  However, I am very pleased that Senators Snowe, Rockefeller, Exon, \nKerrey, and others are in support of this amendment especially since \nSenators Snowe and Rockefeller are the prime sponsors of that amendment \nthat was put into the bill in committee.\n  This amendment would ensure that those who most need it, a rural \nhealth clinic or small school in any part of America including West \nVirginia, receive the most help. If this amendment is adopted, every \npublic and nonprofit grade and secondary school in this country will \nreceive preferential rates, every public library will receive \npreferential rates, and every nonprofit community health clinic will \nreceive preferential rates. But this amendment will prevent some of the \nwealthiest in this country from unduly benefiting at the same time.\n  As I mentioned earlier, I offered an amendment that would have \neliminated the Snowe-Rockefeller provisions. I believe it is \nunnecessary for us to federalize this role of the States. I am \ndisappointed that the Senate disagrees. I pointed out that in nearly \nall of the 50 States in America, the States have acted to provide some \nkind of help for schools, libraries, and health care providers in \nvarious ways, each of these States tailoring specific programs to \nspecific needs in those States. And again I question seriously that we \nin the Senate can tailor programs that fit as diverse a nation as we \nhave today.\n  I listened to my colleagues from West Virginia, Nebraska, and Maine \nvery closely. While they commented extensively on the need to ensure \nthat we do not have technology haves and have-nots, surely they would \nagree we should not subsidize those who can well afford \ntelecommunications services. My friend from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey, \nspecifically expressed his cogent argument on the need to help the \npoorest and most in need in our country. I believe this amendment \naddresses the issues raised by my friend, and I am pleased to offer \nthis amendment with the support of the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. President, I agree we must do what we can to prevent that from \noccurring. I believe that the free market will accomplish that goal. I \nalso believe that vouchers will end up someday being the method by \nwhich we best address these problems of people who cannot afford basic \ntelecommunications services. But at this time it is clear that neither \nthe Senate nor the country is prepared for that.\n  I was interested in the opposition to the vouchers amendment that I \nput forward. If there was ever ample testimony to the clout of the \nspecial interests that are involved in this issue, it was the size of \nthe defeat of that amendment--not because I believe it was a perfect \namendment but there is no doubt in my mind that every player in this \nvery complex issue, whether it be AT, the Bell telephone companies, \nthe manufacturers, every other entity involved was opposed to this \nvoucher idea, which has been supported by the Heritage Foundation, the \nCato Institute, every objective observer of this situation that does \nnot have any monetary involvement.\n  However, we received 18 votes, and if there was ever any testimony \nneeded to the influence of the special interests in shaping this \nlegislation, I believe when historians look at 18 votes, which was the \npurest and simplest way to provide the poor and the needy in this \ncountry with the ability to acquire telephone and telecommunications \nservices, that was ample and compelling evidence and why I believe, Mr. \nPresident, that this bill, despite the great efforts of our \ndistinguished chairman, who has done a magnificent job in shepherding \nthis legislation this last nearly 2 weeks through the Senate, still has \na lot of hurdles to overcome because of the inordinate influence of the \nspecial interests on this bill as opposed, very frankly, to the \ninterests of the American public, which is not represented very well in \nthis debate nor in the issues before the Senate.\n  Back to the amendment, Mr. President, the provisions in this bill \nwould enable some of the wealthiest in our country to benefit. Rural \nhospitals will receive benefits. Certainly some rural hospitals need \nhelp.\n But there are rural hospitals operated by large parent companies that \nmake hundreds of millions of dollars. There is no reason to subsidize \nthese corporations.\n\n  Although the managers' amendment adopted allows the FCC to evaluate \nthe subsidy scheme according to means, there is still a necessity to \nmeans test the provision. First, the FCC is going to pass regulations \nthat treat all fairly and do not discriminate or which have a disparate \nimpact. Such regulations benefit rich and poor equally. The amendment \nsolves that problem.\n  Harvard University operates a library. The university also currently \nhas a $6 billion endowment. Should the American people, many who do not \nhave the resources of Harvard University, be forced to subsidize the \nschool library's telecommunications services? I do not think so.\n  Do we want the well-to-do Humana Hospital Corp. which operates some \nrural hospitals to have a Government-sanctioned telephone discount? No, \nbut we do want the small rural clinic to receive help. This amendment \naccomplishes that goal.\n  If the Congress is going to endorse a Federal role in ensuring \ntechnology to be available to all, then let us tailor it so we are \nhelping those who need our help. It is a balanced, fair amendment. I \nhave confidence in its adoption. I am greatly appreciative that \nSenators Snowe, Rockefeller, and Kerrey in particular are in support of \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. I believe that \nSenators Snowe, Rockefeller, and Kerrey have expressed interest in \nspeaking on this amendment. I ask the manager if he will allow them my \ntime to do so when they come to the floor to speak.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support as a cosponsor of Senator \nMcCain's amendment to clarify how universal service discounts to \nschools, libraries, and rural hospitals under section 310 of the \ntelecommunications bill should be targeted.\n  As I noted last week in my remarks, I support targeting of discounts. \nFor example, elementary and secondary schools with large endowments \nsimply do not have the same need as public schools for discounts in \norder to assure affordable access to telecommunications services. In my \nview, the language in the bill gave the FCC, the States, and the Joint \nBoard some flexibility to target discounts. Specifically, the language \nguaranteed schools and libraries an affordable rate, which implicitly \ntakes into account both the price of the service and the ability of an \nentity to pay.\n  I appreciate the time and effort Senator McCain has invested in \nworking with the sponsors of section 310 to build upon the \naffordability concept, to develop a solid, responsible test of when \nschools, libraries, and rural hospitals should receive discounts in \norder [[Page S8419]] to promote the goal of affordable access to \ntelecommunications services.\n  Under the McCain amendment, public elementary and secondary schools \nwould be eligible for discounts, as would private, nonprofit schools \nwithout large endowments. Libraries would be eligible for discounts if \nthey participated in State-based plans under title III of the Library \nServices and Construction Act, which coordinate library development \nwithin the State. Non-profit rural health care providers would also be \neligible for discounts.\n  This amendment meets the twin goals which I am sure are supported by \nmost Members of this Senate. First, it guarantees affordable access to \ntelemedicine and educational telecommunications services for those key \ninstitutions in our society which need assistance in order to take full \nadvantage of the information age. Second, by targeting the discounts, \nthis amendment ensures that the universal service fund is used wisely \nand efficiently.\n  Mr. President, the provision of the bill sponsored by myself, \nSenators Rockefeller, Exon, and Kerrey, is in my view one of the most \nimportant provisions of the bill. We know that competition will bring \nan array of improved services and exciting new services at a lower \ncost. Technology allows the transmission of information across \ntraditional boundaries of time and space, dramatically changing the way \nthat American school children learn, and the way that health care is \nprovided. The Snowe-Rockefeller-Exon-Kerrey provision in the bill \nensures that competition ultimately achieves this goal for all \nAmericans, regardless of where they live. I realize that the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona believes that a deregulated market \nwill take care of everyone, but I simply do not share that belief. \nFurthermore, the stakes are too great to leave affordable access to the \nmarketplace. Again, I appreciate Senator McCain's willingness to work \nwith myself and Senators Rockefeller, Exon, and Kerrey to clarify how \ndiscounts should be targeted, and I urge my colleagues to support the \nMcCain amendment.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I note that we have limited time. I urge \nSenators to come early to make their statements, as we are on a time \nagreement at this point. Any Senator wishing to speak should come \nforth.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I just want to make a few comments while \nwe are waiting for those referred to by the Senator from South Dakota \nto come and be heard.\n  Those of us who are in the freshman class have recently had a number \nof town hall meetings back in our respective States. As a matter of \nfact, I think I lead the group. I have had 77 since January.\n  Last week, I had some, and I want to just reaffirm that, in spite of \nthe fact there are many people who are here in the U.S. Senate who do \nnot spend as much time back in the districts, back talking to real \npeople, that the revolution that was voted on back on November 8, 1994, \nis very real and it is alive at home. Some people are skeptical and do \nnot think things are going on the way they should be going on here.\n  So I just share with you that I sometimes have a difficult time in \nconveying to people that the Senate is actually doing some things here. \nThey hear about the House, they hear about the Contract With America, \nand some of the personalities over there that have dominated the \nnational media. I have to remind people that in the first 3 months of \nthis year in the U.S. Senate, we passed a number of reforms: One being \nthe unfunded mandates reform; one being congressional accountability, \nforcing us to live under the same laws that we pass for other people; \nwe also did a line-item veto; a type of moratorium on endangered \nspecies; we are getting ready to do regulation reform, to get the \nGovernment off the backs of the people who are paying for all the fun \nwe are having up here.\n  The Senate may be slower and more deliberate, but we are performing, \nand a revolution is going on here.\n  But I say, Mr. President, that the people at home are just as adamant \ntoday as they were on November 8, 1994. The people at home are \ndemanding that we do something about and carry out the mandate to \neliminate the deficit. I think that they are a little impatient with \nthe fact that we passed a resolution that would do this in 7 years, by \nthe year 2002. I find it rather interesting the response that we are \nhaving right now as to the President coming out with his revised budget \na couple of days ago.\n  We have talked to people and told them the President had his budget \nbefore this body some 3 weeks ago, and it was the typical large tax-\nand-spend, high-deficit budget that was rejected by this body, the U.S. \nSenate, by a vote of 99-0, and then Republicans passed our budget \nresolution which would eliminate the deficit by the year 2002.\n  I think we were all taken aback and a little surprised when the \nPresident came out with his announcement a couple days ago. In essence, \nwhat he said was, Well, we tried my budget, and that did not work. I'll \njust join the Republicans. Some people thought maybe the train went by, \nbut I do not think so. I think there is room on the caboose for the \nPresident, and he came out and said, ``Instead of that, let's not be \nquite as severe, let's do it over 10 years, not 7 years.''\n  I cannot speak for the people of America, but I can speak for the \npeople of Oklahoma. I am talking about Democrats and Republicans alike. \nPeople in Oklahoma think that even 7 years is too long. When you stop \nand realize what goes with high deficits, that means more Government \ninvolvement in our lives.\n  Today, I will be going over and testifying in the other body on a \nSuperfund bill. That is just one area of overregulation in our lives, \nof abuse, of bureaucracy on the businesses and the industries that are \npaying taxes to support this monster in Washington, and it is going to \nchange.\n  So I would like to give the assurance that there has been a change in \nthe majority party that is controlling both the Senate and the House, \nand the Republicans are now in charge.\n  As we talk to our fellow Republicans and remind them that the mandate \nthat gave the Republicans a majority in the House and a majority in the \nSenate cannot be ignored, because if we ignore it we cannot fulfill the \nprovisions of that mandate--that is, less Government in our lives, a \nbalanced budget we can see in the near future, and the Government more \nin concert with what was foreseen by our Forefathers many years ago--if \nwe do not carry out that mandate, the Republicans will not be in power.\n  Right now, I honestly believe we are on schedule to carry out the \nmandates. I think the whole United States, and I know my State of \nOklahoma, is rejoicing in this.\n  It is not that the people who want more Government involved in our \nlives are bad people--they are not bad people; they are well-meaning \npeople--but they have just forgotten what this country is all about.\n  So we have a new era, and we are providing the leadership in that \nera. I was very pleased to see the President of the United States \njoining us 2 days ago when he came with his revised budget.\n  I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/15/senate-section/article/S8419-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8419-S8420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETI- TION AND DEREGULATION ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. PRESSLER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a matter of \ngreat importance to the Group of Seven summit meeting to be held this \nweek in Canada. I refer to the current aviation dispute between the \nUnited States and Japan. The United States must stand firm in this \ndispute. It is vital to our long-term U.S. international aviation \npolicy. It is critical to the future of our passenger and cargo \ncarriers. The millions of consumers who use air passenger and cargo \nservices in the Pacific rim deserve the best possible service at \ncompetitive prices set by the market.\n  In recent months, many Senators have expressed views on the bilateral \naviation negotiations between the United States and the United Kingdom. \nThat interest was well-placed. In 1994, revenue for United States \ncarriers between the United States and the United Kingdom was \napproximately $2.5 billion. To put the significance of the United \nStates-Japan aviation dispute in perspective, in 1994 the total revenue \nvalue of passenger and freight traffic for United States carriers \nbetween the United States and Japan was approximately $6 billion.\n  First, let me put to rest a misconception. The United States-Japan \naviation dispute is a bona fide, stand alone trade issue. It \nunquestionably is a separate trade issue. Commentators who suggest our \ncurrent aviation disagreement is inextricably linked to our automobile \ndispute with Japan are wrong. Others who cynically suggest it is more \nthan coincidence that the aviation dispute has come to a head at the \nsame time as the automobile dispute obviously do not know the recent \nhistory of the United States-Japan aviation relations.\n  Plain and simple, this dispute arose as a result of actions by the \nGovernment of Japan to protect its less efficient air carriers from \ncompeting against more cost-efficient United States carriers for \nservice beyond Japan to points throughout Asia. The issue is \nstraightforward: Should the United States allow the Government of Japan \nto unilaterally deny United States carriers rights that are guaranteed \nto our carriers by the United States-Japan bilateral aviation \nagreement? As chairman of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nCommittee, I believe the clear and unequivocal answer is ``no.''\n  The dispute relates to our bilateral aviation agreement which has \nbeen in effect for more than 40 years. Over the years, that agreement \nhas been modified and otherwise amended to reflect changes in the \naviation relationship between our two countries. Pursuant to the United \nStates-Japan bilateral agreement, three carriers have the right to fly \nto Japan, take on additional passengers and cargo in Japan, and then \nfly from Japan to cities throughout Asia. the U.S. carriers who are \nguaranteed fifth freedom rights, or so-called beyond rights, are United \nAirlines, Federal Express, and Northwest Airlines.\n  Recently, Federal Express and United Airlines tried to exercise their \nbeyond rights and notified the Government of Japan that they would \nstart new service from Japan to numerous Asian cities. The Government \nof Japan refused to authorize these new routes. The bilateral agreement \nrequires that such requests be expeditiously approved. In violation of \nthe bilateral agreement, the Government of Japan has said it will not \nconsider these route requests until the United States holds talks aimed \nat renegotiating the bilateral agreement.\n  Mr. President, the consequences of the Government of Japan's \nunilateral denial of beyond rights have been significant. For example, \nFederal Express, relying on its rights under the bilateral agreement, \ninvested millions of dollars in a new, Pacific rim cargo hub at Subic \nBay in the Philippines. The Subic Bay hub is scheduled to be fully \noperational in several weeks. The Government of Japan's refusal to \nrespect the terms of the bilateral agreement threatens Federal Express' \nmultimillion-dollar investment. Similarly, United Airlines has already \nessentially lost the chance to provide service between Osaka and Seoul \nduring the busy summer season.\n  There is no doubt that the economic impact of Japan's refusal to \nrecognize Federal Express and United Airlines' beyond rights has \nalready been great for each of these carriers. The burden has also been \nshouldered by consumers who have been denied the benefits of a more \ncompetitive marketplace. As each day passes, the costs become more \nsignificant. Yesterday, Federal Express was forced to postpone for 30 \ndays its proposed July 3, 1995, opening of its Subic Bay cargo hubs.\n  I point out to the Senate, that is a great loss not only for Federal \nExpress but to the United States. It is our rights of moving our \nairplanes around the world, as we allow other countries to move them \ninto our country.\n  How did the United States and Japan get to the brink of an aviation \ntrade war? Let me first dispel three myths.\n  First, the aviation dispute has nothing to do with a bilateral \naviation agreement that is fundamentally unfair to Japan. Nor does it \nreally have anything to do with so-called imbalances in treaty rights \nthat must be remedied. Yet, United States carriers do have an \napproximately 65 percent share of the transpacific between the United \nStates and Japan. However, this is due to market forces. It has nothing \nto do with fundamental imbalances in the bilateral agreement.\n  Since this goes to the heart of the issue, let me reiterate this \npoint. The reason United States carriers have a larger share of the \ntranspacific market than Japan carriers is due to market forces. Just \n10 years ago, under the very same bilateral agreement that the \nGovernment of Japan now criticizes, Japanese carriers had a larger \nmarket share on transpacific routes than United States competitors.\n  Japanese carriers lost transpacific market share and they lost it \nfast. The reason why is simple economics. The root of this dispute also \nis simple economics. Japanese carriers have operating costs nearly \ndouble United States air carriers and they cannot compete with our \ncarriers. For example, a passenger flying from New York to Tokyo on a \nJapanese carrier pays approximately 23 to 33 percent more for that \nservice. Japanese carriers have priced themselves out of market share. \nPassengers have, so to speak, voted with their feet and selected U.S. \ncarriers that have significantly lower air fares.\n  Second, the aviation dispute has nothing to do with unequal beyond \nrights for Japanese carriers to serve beyond markets from the United \nStates. Yes, Japan only has the right to serve on destination beyond \nthe United States while United States carriers currently have the right \nto serve 10 points beyond Japan. This, however, is a statistic without \nany real significance. Higher operating costs would prevent Japanese \ncarriers from competing for traffic beyond the United States even if \nJapanese carriers had a greater right to do so.\n  The beyond markets the Government of Japan truly wants are the Asian \nmarkets. These markets, particularly service from Japan to China, are \ncash cows for Japanese carriers. There is nothing the Japanese want \nless on these routes than a good dose of American competition.\n  U.S. air carriers are not the only victim of this protectionist \neffort to restrict competition in the Asian beyond markets. Consumers, \nincluding Japanese citizens, are big losers. For example, service on \nJapanese carriers between Hong Kong and Tokyo, a beyond route, is \napproximately 24 percent higher than on a United States carrier. Air \nfares on a Japanese carrier between Tokyo and Seoul are approximately \n20 percent higher. [[Page S8421]] \n  Third, the United States has not caused this dispute by refusing to \nrenegotiate the bilateral agreement. Let me refute this myth loud and \nclear: Foreign nations who enter into agreements with the United States \nmust abide by the terms of those agreements. There are no two ways \nabout that.\n  The Government of Japan is trying to force us to the negotiating \ntable by unilaterally denying clear rights provided to United States \ncarriers by the bilateral agreement. Let me add, the Japanese want \nthese negotiations to increase restrictions on United States carriers \nto further protect Japanese carriers. This would be detrimental to \nUnited States carriers and consumers.\n  That is the wrong direction negotiations should go. Aviation talks \nwith the Government of Japan should focus on opening the Japanese \nmarket, not further restricting it.\n  Also, it is the wrong way to get to the table for meaningful \nnegotiations. The best way for the Government of Japan to open the door \nfor negotiations of the United States-Japan bilateral agreement is to \nimmediately honor and abide by the terms of the existing agreement. The \napproach the Government of Japan has taken by unilaterally denying \nrights guaranteed by the agreement is misguided, it violates \ninternational law, and it must not be tolerated.\n  Mr. President, we are at the brink of an aviation trade war with \nJapan for one reason. Operating costs of Japanese carriers are nearly \ndouble those of United States carriers. Japanese carriers cannot \ncompete against our more cost efficient carriers. In a June 1994 \nreport, Japan's Council for Civil Aviation, an advisory body to Japan's \nTransport Minister, warned that Japanese carriers need to become more \ncompetitive or they may not survive in international markets.\n  Japan's Council for Civil Aviation is absolutely correct. The \nsolution is for Japanese carriers to become more competitive. Instead, \nas reflected by this dispute, the Government of Japan has chosen to \nprescribe yet another dose of protectionism.\n  Mr. President, on May 17, 1995, I urged President Clinton to take \nwhatever steps deemed necessary and reasonable to assure that the \nGovernment of Japan abides by the terms of the United States-Japan \nbilateral aviation agreement. I ask that a copy of that letter be \nprinted at the end of my statement in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Today, I again urged the administration to stand firm \nin our aviation dispute with Japan and to take whatever steps it deems \nnecessary and reasonable to protect rights given to our carriers by the \nUnited States-Japan bilateral agreement.\n  Mr. President, at the beginning of these remarks, I mentioned the \nimportance of the aviation rights issue to the Group of Seven Summit \nmeeting to take place this week. I believe the Group of Seven leaders \nare in a position to promote a new system for aviation rights to \nreplace the confusing web of bilateral agreements we now have.\n  That is something we have to do, and in the Commerce Committee one of \nmy goals is to find a way that we can replace this bilateral aviation \nsystem with a new system for aviation rights.\n  We have a confusing web of bilateral agreements. I hope up there in \nHalifax, the Group of 7, especially I hope President Clinton talks to \nthe Japanese about this situation.\n  Top-level leadership can bring about such a reform. I recommend to my \ncolleagues an article I wrote for the June 7 edition of the Seattle \nPost-Intelligencer, ``Rules for World Air Transport Need Overhaul.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2).\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n           Transportation,\n                                     Washington, DC, May 17, 1995.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     The President, The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As Chairman of the Senate Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation, I am writing to urge \n     you to take whatever steps you deem necessary and reasonable \n     to assure the Government of Japan abides by the terms of the \n     United States/Japan bilateral aviation agreement.\n       Since the early 1990s, the Government of Japan has \n     routinely ignored the clear language of the U.S./Japan \n     bilateral aviation agreement and in doing so has denied \n     several U.S. air carriers permission to serve points in Asia \n     from Japan. Recently, the Government of Japan failed to \n     approve Federal Express' request for a route between Osaka \n     and Subic Bay, the location of Federal Express' new cargo hub \n     in the Philippines. Similarly, the Government of Japan \n     rejected United Airlines' request to commence service between \n     Osaka and Seoul. These carriers are guaranteed ``beyond \n     rights'' by the bilateral agreement, each made economic \n     decisions based on these rights, and the Government of Japan \n     should honor its agreement.\n       Mr. President, the United States must require foreign \n     nations to abide by the terms of international aviation \n     agreements with our country. International aviation \n     opportunities are critical to U.S. passenger and cargo \n     carriers, as well as the thousands of individuals they \n     employ, their customers and the communities they serve.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Larry Pressler,\n                                                         Chairman.\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n          [From the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, June 7, 1995]\n\n              Rules for World Air Transport Need Overhaul\n\n                          (By Larry Pressler)\n\n       Since the early 1990s, the Japanese government routinely \n     has violated its bilateral aviation agreement with the United \n     States. Japan currently is holding up approval of new routes \n     involving ``beyond rights'' for Federal Express and United \n     Airlines, even though those carriers explicitly enjoy such \n     rights in the U.S.-Japanese agreement.\n       ``Beyond rights'' means that the Japanese government allows \n     a U.S. carrier to arrive in Japan from the United States, \n     unload and take on cargo or passengers and then fly to a \n     third country. Japan's denial of routes is an explicit \n     violation of the U.S.-Japan bilateral air agreement. \n     Meanwhile, a more fundamental inequity is that only three \n     U.S. carriers enjoy ``beyond rights'' with Japan, while Japan \n     has denied five other American carriers such transit rights.\n       Japan apparently believes that by violating its air \n     agreement with the United States, it can induce the United \n     States to renegotiate the agreement on terms more favorable \n     to Japan. That is unacceptable. I have urged President \n     Clinton to take whatever measures he deems necessary and \n     reasonable to get Japan back into compliance with the \n     agreement.\n       Meanwhile, I urge the U.S. and Japanese governments to use \n     their economic leverage and political skills to advance the \n     longer-range project of global reform of international air-\n     transport agreements.\n       The existing system of bilateral agreements is a bad \n     arrangement. An outmoded patchwork of rules has international \n     air transport stalled in a holding pattern. Instead of a \n     uniform global agreement such as the General Agreement on \n     Tariffs and Trade, there are about 3,500 different nation-to-\n     nation air-transport agreements. That makes for babel of \n     confusion and inefficiency.\n       Many countries have insisted upon agreements heavily \n     protectionist in favor of their own national airlines. Others \n     sharply limit the number of U.S. carriers allowed into their \n     markets, fomenting rivalries between carriers having access \n     vs. those that do not. Still other nations impose \n     discriminatory cargo processing and freight-fowarding delays \n     on the ground. All such arrangements put a drag on economic \n     growth in America and around the world.\n       In Asia, the need for reform is especially important. The \n     world has high hopes for continuation of the ``Asian \n     miracle'' in economic growth. This phenomenon could be badly \n     dimmed, however, without aviation reform. American air \n     carriers' restricted access in Asia impairs our ability to \n     enhance and share in Pacific Rim growth.\n       At Kimpo Airport in Seoul, for instance, U.S. and other \n     non-Korean airlines are banned from operating domestic \n     trucking companies. That increases costs and adds delay to \n     freight delivery. At Tokyo's Narita Airport and Hong Kong's \n     Kai Tak Airport, numerous other so-called ``doing business'' \n     problems hamper foreign carriers.\n       Asia is not the only so-called source of friction for U.S. \n     air carriers. The United Kingdom and France, for example, \n     also have highly protectionist air access policies. Indeed, \n     while world economic growth naturally depends on efficient \n     transportation, transportation remains the most politically \n     restrictive area of commerce.\n       The rules for world air-transport access need a complete \n     overhaul. To accomplish that, we need a sense of mission, a \n     model and top-level leadership.\n       The mission should transcend protecting the status quo. We \n     need to keep our eyes on prizes for the next generation: \n     commercial air routes and markets less developed now but \n     clearly with great potential in years to come. China, India \n     and Southeast Asia are examples; Russia and East Europe are \n     others. Our policies need to keep opportunities open not just \n     for existing companies, but also for the enterprises of \n     tomorrow. [[Page S8422]] \n       In form, a model for air-transport liberalization is the \n     GATT: a multilateral, uniform, global agreement. In \n     substance, the global air agreement should provide ``open \n     skies.'' An example of this open arrangement is the U.S.-\n     Netherlands agreement. It allows Dutch air service full \n     access into any U.S. city, with reciprocal rights for U.S. \n     carriers.\n       Transforming a complicated web in international \n     protectionism can't be done without leadership at the highest \n     level. While I will use the chairmanship of the Senate \n     Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee as a ``bully \n     pulpit'' for reform, it is imperative that the cause have \n     leadership from world heads of state.\n       I urge President Clinton to put world aviation reform on \n     the agenda for the next Group of Seven Summit of the major \n     industrialized nations. With attention at this level, we can \n     get done what needs to be done.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/15/senate-section/article/S8420-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8422-S8423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION AND DEREGULATION ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. PRESSLER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1298\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Last night I called up amendment No. 1298. I would like to proceed \nfor the half-hour allocated under the unanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \nup to 15 minutes, under the previous order.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this amendment aims to maintain \nprotection for the millions of cable consumers around America who, for \nthe last 2 years, faced with cable systems that they enjoy, that they \nneed, that they want to purchase, but faced with only one choice of a \ncable system in all but 50 of the more than 10,000 cable markets in \nAmerica, are about to lose their consumer protection if the bill, as \ndrafted and before the Senate, S. 652, passes.\n  I just think that would be a shame. In a way, an outrage, because of \nthe way in which the cable consumer protections that were enacted in \n1992, and were in effect for less than 2 years, have benefited \nconsumers, and not hurt the cable industry.\n  Think about it, Mr. President. We are talking here about monopolies \nthat exist in more than 10,000 markets in America. Only 50 have \neffective competition according to the FCC, and yet we will remove a \nconsumer protection regulation that exists in the current system that \nhas dropped rates cumulatively 11 percent, that has seen continued good \nhealth in the cable industry.\n  What is the rationale for this? The rationale seems to be in this \noverall reform of telecommunications, surprisingly, this termination of \nthese consumer protection regulations that have just existed for a \ncouple of years and worked so well.\n  Apparently, the argument by the cable industry has been they need to \nhave rates deregulated. They need to take the cap off. They need to be \nfree of any rule of reason, without competition, without regulation, \nbecause they need to go to the capital markets to raise capital so they \ncan be ready to compete with the telephone companies direct broadcast \nsatellites that are coming in.\n  Mr. President, the facts I showed last night show that not only have \nthe cable companies continued to make money, with an operating margin \nindustrywide of 20 percent--the highest of any element of the \ntelecommunications industry--but their capital expenditures have \ncontinued to go up. In 1993, almost $3 billion; in 1994, $3.7 billion. \nPlenty of opportunity under regulation to raise money.\n  Perhaps as significant, take a look at what the market says. This is \na bill that is procompetitive. It is market-oriented. Let me show the \nchart that talks about the cable index stocks.\n  We believe in markets. That is what this bill is all about. The blue \nline is an index of cable industry stocks. Look what happened in 1993 \nafter regulation goes on: It shoots up, comes down, stays high, much \nhigher than the S Standard 500 stock index. This is a measure of the \nmarket. Investors say the regulation that we put on was reasonable. It \ndid not make them feel that these stocks were a bad investment. In \nfact, they continue to raise over the average stocks in the market.\n  I ask here, with this amendment, why are we doing this? On the face \nof it, respectfully, I would say it looks like the cable industry has \nused this overall reform of telecommunications to basically jump on or \njump in to hide in a kind of Trojan horse of telecommunications reform, \nand put inside that horse an opportunity to raise rates.\n  I will say the system created in this bill is complicated. The bottom \nline is simple: Rates to most cable consumers in America are going to \nrise; by one estimate, $5 a month for a service that a lot of people \nconsider to be a necessary, basic source of information, recreation, \nentertainment, even shopping, now, in their lives.\n  If the amendment I propose passes, I am convinced that rates will \nremain stable, the cable industry will continue to be competitive, and \nthe rates will remain regulated only until there is competition. Part \nof what is happening here is the hope being raised of immediate \ncompetition in the cable business.\n  In 1984 when Congress last deregulated cable, and the consumers paid \ndeeply out of their pockets for the ensuing years, until 1992 when we \nput regulation back on, the hope was raised that direct broadcast \nsatellites were going to provide enormous competition for cable \ntelevision.\n  Today, 11 years after 1984 when that argument was made, less than 1 \npercent of cable consumers, multichannel service consumers, get their \ntelevision from direct broadcast satellites.\n  Telephone companies are authorized by the legislation before us to \ncome into the cable business. I hope they do and I hope they do \nrapidly. When they are providing competition, the regulation will go \noff. But I am not so sure any of us can say that is going to happen \nnext year or 3 years from now or 5 years from now or, in some cases, 10 \nyears from now.\n  What this bill, without the amendment I am proposing, will do in that \ninterim, it will simply take off the protection for consumers.\n  Incidentally, it substitutes, in place of that protection, a very \nornate, complicated standard that there is no regulation unless the \ncable system charges substantially higher than the per channel average \nnationally on June 1, 1995. That is very complicated and actually shows \nyou do not need regulation to have regulation. You can have all the \nproblems of regulation through legislation.\n  My alternative here is simple and market oriented. It says a cable \ncompany will be subject to regulation if it charges substantially more \nthan the national average in markets that are competitive. So my \nstandard is not what the average is on June 1, 1995, or, as the bill \nsuggests, what it will be 2 years from now after cable rates are \nraised. Then we are going to have substantially higher charges than the \naverage 2 years later. My basis is what the market says where there is \ncompetition. As competition spreads throughout America, that standard \nwill change and the consumers will benefit.\n  I want to respond to just a few comments that were made against the \namendment last night as I wait for some of my colleagues who want to \nspeak on this to come to the floor. There was some reference to the \nspecial status of smaller cable companies. I want to stress that no \nsmall cable company will be affected under my amendment. We are \nexempting any cable company that has less than 35,000 customers or any \nmultiservice operator--that is, any company that owns more than one \ncable system--that has less than 400,000 customers. I am not interested \nin regulating these small, mom and pop cable operators. They are \nalready economically responsible and I believe accountable to their \ncommunities, and therefore they are exempt from regulation.\n  Last night my friend and colleague from South Dakota suggested that \ncable revenues have remained flat for the first time in 1994. In fact, \nthe cable [[Page S8423]] act resulted in over $800 million in decreases \nin equipment charges and over $400 million in decreases for consumers \nin service charges. The fact that revenues--even taking this view that \nthey remained flat indicates that the cable industry is thriving and is \na highly profitable industry, even under regulation. Again, there is a \n20-percent operating margin, the highest in the telecommunications \nbusiness in 1993, and the stock market indicates continued consumer \nconfidence in the business. All of that under regulation.\n  The distinguished chairman of the committee mentioned that public \ndebt offerings dropped under regulation. Respectfully, I claim the \nopposite. Debt financing for the cable industry climbed from $6.9 \nbillion in 1993 to $10.8 billion in 1994, an almost $4 billion \nincrease, continuing a pattern of steady growth in debt financing since \n1991, uninterrupted by the very reasonable regulation that we put on in \n1992 on a bipartisan basis.\n  As for investments and access to capital, the major cable companies \nare consolidating and buying up other monopolies right and left and \nthey are spending a lot of money doing so. For example, in February \n1995, Time Warner offered $2.7 billion for Cablevision Industries \nsystems. In January 1995, Time Warner offered $2.24 billion for Houston \nIndustries cable systems. In January 1995, Intermedia Partners, TCI, \nand others offered $2.3 billion for Viacom's cable system. And the list \ngoes on.\n  I am not saying this is wrong. I am happy about it. What I am \npointing out here is that the cable industry, under the very reasonable \nconsumer protection regulations that we have had on for the last 2 \nyears, has been a healthy industry with lots of capital to invest. \nThere is no reason to believe that will not continue to be the case \nunder the amendment that I put forth. Let us remember, the great fear \nhere of the cable industry is competition from the telephone \ncompanies--and they are regulated.\n  Often cited are the companies that are selling out these systems, \nthese cable systems. But I want to say those who are selling are doing \nso at a very healthy profit.\n  One other argument that arises again is that competition is just \naround the corner. As I have indicated, I hope so. I hope competition \nis around the corner. I hope we can get the regulation out of here. But \nright now, to receive a direct broadcast satellite system, a consumer \nhas to invest about $700 to buy the equipment and then pay a monthly \ncharge at least as large as the current cable bills. At the moment, \nagain, less than 0.5 percent of subscribers are choosing this DBS \nsatellite. As my friend and colleague from South Dakota points out, at \nthe current rate of subscription, in 5 years there will be 5 million \nsubscribers to DBS. Mr. President, 5 million subscribers is only 8 \npercent of the current subscribers to cable. And 8 percent, in my \nopinion, is not effective competition in any market, certainly not \nunder the bill, not under the law as it stands now.\n  As for the telephone companies, they are only doing experiments in \nsome markets. It will take time before they are active competitors. If \nany competitor surprises us and gets to the market more rapidly, \nhallelujah, that is great news. All the regulation I am advocating will \ngo away once competition hits the market. That is what this amendment \nis about. Let us let competition work for the consumer and for the \nindustry.\n  Mr. President, I understood Senator Leahy was going to come to the \nfloor to speak to the amendment. Not seeing him on the floor, I reserve \nwhatever time I have remaining and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, seeing no one seeking recognition, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1283, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1283.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment of the Senator from Illinois, \nNo. 1283, has already been called up.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I have not had a chance to talk to Senator \nPressler or Senator Hollings. But I would be willing to have a 20-\nminute time agreement, 10 minutes on my side and 10 minutes on the \nother side. I am not sure that anyone is going to speak in opposition. \nI would welcome no one speaking in opposition. But I do believe that at \nleast one Member on the other side wants to vote against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator from Illinois \nthat, under the previous order, time is limited to 30 minutes on first-\ndegree amendments.\n  Mr. SIMON. I am willing to reduce that to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. That is the best music I have heard this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is willing to either use or yield \nback whatever time he does not wish to use.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, let me outline what the situation is right \nnow. We now have under the FCC rule a limit of 20 FM stations and 20 AM \nstations that may be owned by any one entity. The Dole amendment takes \nthe cap off that completely. The most that is owned by any one entity \nright now is Infinity. They own 27 stations. CBS owns 26.\n  Under the bill as it is right now, anyone--the Dan Coats Co.--can \ntheoretically own every radio station in the United States. Obviously, \nI do not think that would happen. But I think diversity in this field \nis extremely important.\n  My amendment raises that cap of 20 and 20 to 50 and 50 so that there \ncould be 100 stations owned by any one entity. That is a 150-percent \nincrease over where we are right now.\n  I think that is reasonable. I just think it is not in the public \ninterest to have a concentration. Economic concentration generally is \nnot good, but particularly in the media I think there are dangers to \nthe future of our country.\n  Bill Ryan of the Washington Post and Newsweek wrote in Broadcast and \nCable of May 27, and said,\n\n       The whole world is trying to emulate the local system of \n     broadcasting that we have in this country, and here we are \n     creating a structure that will abolish it or put it in the \n     hands of a very, very few. I think it is unsound.\n\n  Let me add that my friends in Infinity and CBS both have no objection \nto this amendment--the people who own the largest numbers right now. \nThe National Association of Broadcasters do. Let me just say candidly \nthat I worked with Senator Strom Thurmond and a few others here in \ntrying to negotiate with them some kind of limitation or sensible \npackaging on liquor advertising on radio. They resisted any change. \nHere again, they want to have it all. I have been in this business of \npolitics long enough so that when you have leadership at the National \nAssociation of Broadcasters that is so narrow minded that it wants to \nhave it all, the pendulum is going to swing from one extreme to \nanother. They are making a great mistake.

It \nis the people who are waiters and waitresses downstairs--all of the \npeople, the people who watch the doors.

The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1283, as Modified\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I rise in opposition to the Simon amendment.\n  The Senator is right; we do not thank people enough. I wish to thank \nthe Senator from Illinois for bringing up this issue.\n  I think it important that the American people take a look and see \nexactly what is happening in the broadcast business. Radio ownership \ndecisions should be made by owners and operators and investors and not \nby the Federal Government. That is why we need to eliminate all \nremaining caps on national and local radio ownership.\n  Let us take into consideration some things happening in the broadcast \nindustry. Even if I own two radio stations in the same market, would I \nprogram them the same? Would I want the diversity to capitalize on an \nadvertising market so that I can expand that advertising base? Because \nthat is what pulls the wagon in the broadcast business--advertising \ndollars. Would I program it the same? I seriously doubt it. And there \nare some right now, even though they own an FM station and an AM \nstation and operate it out of the same building, use the same engineer, \nsometimes the same on-the-air personalities, their programming is \ndifferent. That is what is happening in the broadcast business today. \nNow, that is the real world.\n  Nationally, there are more than 11,000 radio stations providing \nservice to every city, town, and rural community in the United States. \nPresently, no one can control more than 40 stations. That is 20 AM \nstations and 20 FM stations. Clearly, the radio market is so incredibly \nvast and diverse that there is no possibility that any one entity could \ngain control of enough stations to be able to exert any market power \nover either advertisers or programmers.\n  At the local level, while the FCC several years ago modified its \nduopoly rules to permit a limited combination of stations in the same \nservice in the same market, there are still stringent limits on the \nability of radio operators to grow in their markets. Further, the FCC \nrules permit only very restricted or no combinations in smaller \nmarkets. These restrictions handcuff broadcasters and prevent them from \nproviding the best possible service to listeners in all of our States. \nAnd, unfortunately, the Simon amendment, whether intended or not, only \naddresses the national limitations and does nothing to alleviate \nexcessive local market controls.\n  Increased multiple ownership opportunities will allow radio operators \nto obtain efficiencies from being able to purchase programming and \nequipment on a group basis and from combining operations such as sales \nand engineering which is going on today.\n  We do not hear any cry in just the local market of anything being \nreally wrong in the broadcast business.\n  Radio stations have to face increasing competition from other radio \nstations and from other advertising and programming sources, such as \ncable television operators. Nowadays many cable operators have begun to \nprovide music and related services that compete locally with radio \nstations, and soon satellite services will have the capabilities of \nproviding 60 channels of digital audio service that will be available \nin communities across the Nation, of which there is no wall to receive \ntheir signal.\n  Also in the near future, radio stations will begin facing the need \nfor new capital investment when the FCC authorizes terrestrial digital \naudio broadcasting. Without an opportunity to grow and to attract \ncapital, our Nation's radio industry will face an increasingly \ndifficult task in responding to these multiplying competitive \npressures.\n  And they are competition. But we also wonder why should we in some \nway or other hamper a local broadcast station from supporting the local \ncommunity. News, weather, sports, all the community services that we \nenjoy in our smaller communities, we have to be able to attract \nadvertising dollars, yet we will be subject to the competition of \ndirect broadcast and also the cable operators. But competition is what \nmakes it good. I am not worried about that. We can compete. Just do not \nlimit our ownership decisions to buy or sell based on a Government-\nimposed cap on what we can own.\n  I received a letter from Benny Bee, President of Bee Broadcasting up \nat Whitefish, MT. Benny writes, and I quote:\n\n       I can't express how important it is that the markets be \n     opened up and the ownership caps be taken off. Broadcasters \n     like myself need to be able to compete. . . .  I urge you to \n     defeat the Simon amendment and help move broadcasters forward \n     as we go into the Twenty First century.\n\n  Larry Roberts, who operates stations in my home State of Montana, has \nwritten me stating:\n\n       [Radio deregulation] would provide us with the freedom to \n     excel and succeed. It will not only allow us to compete more \n     effectively, it will also increase the value of our radio \n     stations.\n\n  And in the 1980's we had an explosion, Mr. President, of licenses \ngranted to stations when really there was no market analysis done that \nthe market could even handle another radio station.\n  There are many more examples that I could leave you with. One final \none from Ray Lockhart of KOGA, an AM and FM station in Ogallala, NE, \nnot my constituents but I know Ray very well. My wife comes from that \npart of the country. And he writes:\n\n       Soon, one DBS operator will be able to deliver 50 to 60 \n     radio channels into every market in the country with none of \n     the rules that I labor under. The Baby Bells will be able to \n     do the same thing at even less cost. Help broadcasters by not \n     protecting us. Cut us loose from ownership . . . regulation \n     so we can take advantage of our abilities to compete.\n\n  And I think that is the argument here, the ability to compete. Do not \nshut the doors of opportunity.\n  So we need to look at the true picture of the challenge that the \nindustry faces. For the longest time we have viewed radio as competing \nonly with itself, as if it exists in a vacuum. And basically I know \nsomething about that because my main competition basically in the \nadvertising business was from the print media. You have to deal with \nthat--and there is competition there--in order to stay economically \nviable.\n  Radio goes head-on with other forms of mass media for the audience \nand for those advertising dollars that fuel its well-being. We need to \nstart acknowledging this important distinction and give radio the tools \nit needs to compete with all other information providers. That is why I \nurge you to vote against the Simon amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the attached letters from \nthe broadcasters that I mentioned be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Bee Broadcasting, Inc.,\n\n                                     Whitefish, MT, June 14, 1995.\n     Senator Conrad Burns,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Burns: It was great visiting with you the \n     other day when you were home in Montana and I hope the \n     conference went well.\n       The reason I am writing is I know that you will be \n     introducing legislation that is going [[Page S8425]] to have \n     a tremendous impact on small market broadcasters like myself. \n     I can't express how important it is that the markets be \n     opened up and the ownership caps be taken off. Broadcasters \n     like myself need to be able to compete with the large cable \n     companies, which offer several channels as well as bulk \n     discounts. Also, the ``Information Super Highway'' is just \n     around the corner, which will allow large market radio \n     stations to come in via satellites, competing with the \n     smaller market operators for audience and advertising \n     dollars. For us to compete at the local level, we need to be \n     able to own and market several different formats. By owning \n     four or five stations and formats, operating costs would drop \n     dramatically, allowing us to pass tremendous savings on to \n     the advertiser. Also, the audience benefits by having \n     multiple choices of formats to listen to. And of course, we \n     the broadcasters benefit by being able to compete with the \n     ``big boys'' in our much smaller markets.\n       Senator, I urge you to defeat the Simon Amendment and help \n     move broadcasters forward as we go into the Twenty First \n     century. If I can be of ANY assistance on this matter, please \n     don't hesitate to call.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                   Benny Bee, Sr.,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      Sunbrook Communications,\n\n                                       Spokane, WA, April 3, 1995.\n       Dear Fellow Broadcasters: We have very little time to act \n     on a matter which will significantly impact our future. As \n     you know, Congress is rewriting the Communications Act to \n     reflect the new realities in which media operate. This bill \n     is expected to be brought to the floor of the Senate so soon, \n     that we have little time to make our feelings known to our \n     Senators. However, it's imperative that we do so.\n       I urge you to support the Lott/Bryan Amendment on Radio \n     Ownership. Here's why.\n       All of us are likely to soon be competing against an \n     additional 30-60 new over-the-air radio stations in each of \n     our markets. They will broadcast in digital stereo direct \n     from a satellite, provided by 1 or 2 owners. If you add these \n     stations to the recent addition of audio channels from your \n     local cable company, plus still more channels from your \n     telephone company which is likely to get into the cable biz, \n     plus the additional channels offered by DirecTV satellite, \n     it's obvious that local radio broadcasters are facing a \n     serious threat.\n       If this weren't bad enough, the terrible news is that we \n     local radio broadcasters . . . we who have worked so hard to \n     provide service to our communities . . . are currently being \n     left out of the deregulation of audio services. The rewrite \n     of the telecommunications bill, as it stands today, would \n     take the handcuffs off of the cable companies, the phone \n     companies, and the national satellite broadcasters, giving \n     each of them the ability to flood our markets with dozens of \n     new channels. But as it stands, the bill leaves the handcuffs \n     on local radio broadcasters!\n       Without the economies of scale provided by multiple-station \n     ownership, we will be left unable to compete. To have just a \n     single channel (or even 4 in the largest markets) would make \n     our survival highly unlikely, in a world where other audio \n     providers are operating without ownership restrictions, and \n     without public service obligations.\n       Therefore, it's imperative that we support the Lott/Bryan \n     Amendment. It would remove all radio ownership rules. It \n     would put us on a level playing field with all of these new \n     competitors. It would provide us with the freedom to excel \n     and succeed. It will not only allow us to compete more \n     effectively, it will also increase the value of our radio \n     stations.\n       No matter how comfortable the past has been, with its \n     artificial barriers to ownership, the times have changed. The \n     issue before us is not whether radio's ownership environment \n     will be changed from the past. It is being changed. The only \n     question is whether it will be changed for the better, by the \n     adoption of the Lott/Bryan Amendment, or whether it will be \n     changed for the worse, by not allowing radio broadcasters the \n     same freedoms of ownership that are being provided to non-\n     traditional radio broadcasters.\n       Please call your Senators now and ask them to support the \n     Lott/Bryan Amendment!\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Larry Roberts,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                     The Cromwell Group, Inc.,\n\n                                    Nashville, TN, March 25, 1995.\n     Re lifting ownership restrictions--Locally, Nationally.\n     To: Small/Medium Market Licensees.\n       Dear Associates: As you know, the NAB Radio Board has \n     supported the idea of eliminating restrictions on the number \n     of radio station licenses that an individual operator/company \n     can hold. If approved, the net effect will be to permit you \n     or others to own/operate all the stations in your market \n     area. Before you say ``no'', read on and consider what is \n     happening:\n       (1) Cable systems operate 30, 40, 100 channels in your town \n     under one owner locally . . . selling local advertising\n       (2) The telephone company may be offering 30, 40, 100 \n     channels to your home as one owner . . . selling local \n     advertising\n       (3) Direct TV (Satellite) now offers 30 channels plus to \n     your home with two owners nationally . . . selling regional \n     advertising.\n       (4) DARS Satellite Radio in a few years will offer 30 plus \n     channels heard in your town with one/two owners nationally . \n     . . selling regional advertising.\n       (5) Internet is fast growing and offers multiple \n     information sources to the home in your community . . . \n     selling who knows what with lots of options.\n       All of the above have/will have a subscription source of \n     revenue plus compete with you and other broadcasters for \n     local advertising.\n       As a small market broadcaster of the old school and with \n     ``localism'' in my blood, I do not like the idea that my \n     station could be owned by the newspaper, my competitor, a \n     national company, Walmart, or others. It goes against my \n     grain.\n       However, the Congress and the FCC are on track to permit \n     telephone and cable companies, Satellite providers, and \n     others to be single owners with multiple channels serving \n     your and our communities. In the future the competition will \n     be fierce. For a small market broadcaster with only one \n     product (ie: one format) competing against other broadcasters \n     AND the new technologies, survival will be a real difficult \n     challenge.\n       Current rules hinder only the local broadcaster. All the \n     others are free to operate. We may think we are protected by \n     having ownership rules, but in the future we will be \n     hamstrung. We won't be able to compete and we won't be able \n     to sell because our value will have declined. Historically \n     regulation has held broadcasters back in the face of new \n     technology. Unless we act now, that could again be the case.\n       Eliminating ownership rules (as distasteful as it sounds to \n     me today) makes it possible to have ``localism'' in the \n     future. You or your buyer will be able to provide \n     ``multiple'' signals in your community and be able to compete \n     with the new technologies. As you think ``NO'' today, please \n     consider that you might wish tomorrow you'd said ``YES'' and \n     supported a chance to get in a position to compete. We can't \n     use old regulation to protect against a horse that's already \n     out of the barn.\n       Large and small market broadcasters (corporate vs small \n     operators) do have different business objectives. But \n     remember, one Baby Bell Operating Company is larger than the \n     entire Radio/TV industry. There are seven Bell Operating \n     Companies, plus all the cable, satellite, and others, so you \n     can see that's coming and what we're up against.\n       I know it may go against your grain to support eliminating \n     ownership limits today, but please do it to insure you have \n     positive options in the future.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bud.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                        Sorenson Broadcasting,\n\n                                  Sioux Falls, SD, March 27, 1995.\n     John David,\n     NAB Radio\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Fellow Broadcasters: Broadcast Ownership Rules, \n     particularly Radio Ownership Rules are ``up for grabs'' in \n     Washington, D.C. As a broadcaster who has built a career on \n     Local-Service-Radio, I feel it's imperative you and I protect \n     our Stations, Communities, and the concept of Local-Service-\n     Radio. . . . Now.\n       What am I asking? (1) You and I must consider strong \n     support of the position voted by our NAB (National \n     Association of Broadcasters) Board of Directors, and (2) You \n     and I need to contact our Congressmen . . . especially \n     Senators on the Commerce Committee.\n       I grew up in a different world than we're now experiencing. \n     It's excitingly scary what is being proposed for the future. \n     However, I am certain. . . . I want to be able . . . as a \n     local radio broadcaster to play in the new technologies . . . \n     whatever they happen to end up being.\n       Experience shows it's hard to ``Out localize'' the local \n     radio station. However, if the Ownership Rules are changed to \n     give the ``trump card'' to other media in the changing and \n     future world of technologies . . . we could find ourselves \n     embarrassed into a ``position of weakness.'' This could also \n     affect the present and future value of the radio stations you \n     and I own and operate.\n       In the communities where we operate . . . Cable systems are \n     now offering 45-75 channels, complete with 10 channels of \n     music (radio)! Telephone companies are throwing serious money \n     at new business opportunities, and if satellite radio comes \n     to my town, as Direct TV already has. . . . I'm not certain \n     yet what those changes mean. But . . . I do realize the \n     importance of my company . . . as the local radio folks . . . \n     being able to compete on a level field.\n       And if ownership of the local newspaper makes sense. . . . \n     I would like not to be forbidden from the chance to own it.\n       I have talked personally with our friends who serve on the \n     NAB's Radio Board of Directors. They have thoughtfully \n     presented a position which deserves our support. I ask simply \n     that you familiarize yourself with that position . . . then \n     begin explaining your position to your Congressman.\n           Enthusiastically,\n                                                    Dean Sorenson,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                              Ogallala Broadcasting Co., Inc.,\n\n                                                     Ogallala, NE.\n       Dear Fellow Broadcasters: I was stunned to hear that some \n     Senators and the NAB were receiving calls from some \n     broadcasters opposing the idea of deregulation for the radio \n     industry. Are you kidding me? In my tiny market my local TCI \n     cable system [[Page S8426]] with 3500 paid subscribers \n     delivers 30 Music Express channels, sells local commercials \n     for $1.25 per 30 second spot and they have plans to deliver \n     more TV signals with more local access all over the country. \n     No ownership limits, no FCC intervention in anything but \n     technical standards. Why shouldn't I as a broadcaster be \n     afforded the same?\n       Soon (by year 2000) one DBS operator will be able to \n     deliver 50 to 60 radio channels into every market in the \n     country with none of the rules I labor under (localism, main \n     studio, public file, lowest unit rate, FCC rules, etc.). The \n     Baby Bell's will be able to do the same thing at even less \n     cost. Our Public Interest Standard is a one way street that \n     keeps us 2nd class and Government controlled. (1st Amendment \n     freedoms do not apply to us, right?) We do have a shot at \n     these freedoms if we're not afraid to take it.\n       Some local operators say, the FCC must protect us from \n     someone buying everything up. Why? They protected us in the \n     80's with 80/90. Wasn't that fun? If I can't compete with the \n     big boys that can and will buy multiple markets (yes, maybe \n     even WalMart) at least a market has been created for my \n     stations that will bring a better price than if we don't have \n     a level playing field with the new technologies and players.\n       I am fortunate enough to have been able to take advantage \n     of the small market duopoly rule and buy the other station in \n     this town of 5,000. It is a very worthwhile venture that \n     everyone should be able to do if they so desire.\n       Tell your Senators to help broadcasters by not protecting \n     us. Cut us loose from ownership and everything but technical \n     regulation so we can take advantage of our abilities to \n     compete. It is the future of our ``over the air'' broadcast \n     industry we're dealing with. Get involved if you're not!\n       Remember, a Government that is big enough to give you the \n     protections you want today is big enough to take them away \n     tomorrow.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I urge that this amendment be defeated. For \nthe first time, only 40 percent of the radio stations operating in the \nUnited States today are really making a profit. So some kind of \nconsolidation is needed to keep them viable. It is like I said. If I \nown two newspapers in the same market, would I format those newspapers \njust exactly alike? Even with first amendment rights, would I slant \nthem the right way? Or whatever. I think what I would do is be diverse \nwith them, to broaden the base of the advertising market in that \nparticular locale. That is also true whenever you start trying to \nattract national dollars on national advertising campaigns. And it is \nhow good your reps are when they start representing your station.\n  So I appreciate the amendment because I think the American people \nhave a right to know just what is happening in the broadcast industry. \nI understand where the Senator is coming from, but he also has to look \nat what is happening in the real world as far as radio broadcasting is \nconcerned.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota [Mr. \nDorgan].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I stand in support of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Illinois.\n  As I listen to some of the debate on this amendment, as well as the \ndebate on the amendment I offered previously which tried to restore the \nrestrictions on television station ownership, it occurred to me that we \nought to really remove some desks in the Senate and provide a \nstretching area. When you go to a baseball game, you see these folks \nstretch out before the game, getting all limber. I do not know of \nanyone who can stretch quite so well as those who stand in this Chamber \nand preach the virtues of competition\n and then decide to advocate concentration of economic ownership by \nlifting the restrictions on ownership of television stations and radio \nstations.\n\n  That is some stretch. But it does not quite reach. It does not \nprevent people from trying, however. You cannot, in my judgment, preach \nthe virtues of competition and take action that will eventually end up \nresulting in a half a dozen or a dozen companies owning most of \nAmerica's television stations. With respect to this amendment, we will \nend up with conglomerates owning the majority of America's radio \nstations.\n  It is as inevitable as we have seen in other industries that \nconcentration means less competition. Concentration is the opposite of \ncompetition. How people can preach competition and come to the floor of \nthe Senate and advance the economic issues that lead to more economic \nconcentration is just beyond me.\n  Even if that were to escape the folks who preach this unusual \ndoctrine, one would think that at least the issue of localism would \nmatter.\n  Let me read a quote, if I might, to my colleagues. Bill Ryan, of Post \nNewsweek, recently stated:\n\n       The whole world is trying to emulate the local system of \n     broadcasting that we have in this country, and here we are \n     creating a structure that will abolish it or put it in the \n     hands of a very, very few.\n\n  I do not know how you express it more succinctly than that. I \nunderstand why these things emerge in this legislation: It is big \nmoney, big companies, big interests. I understand the stakes here. But \nthe stakes, it seems to me, that are most important are the stakes with \nrespect to what is in the public interest in our country. Is it in the \npublic interest to see more and more concentration of ownership in the \nhands of a few in television and radio, or is it not? In my judgment, \nthe answer is clear; it is no.\n  So I just wish we could find a circumstance where those who preach \ncompetition would be willing to practice it. Practicing competition in \nthis area would be to support this modest amendment. The Senator from \nIllinois comes to us with an amendment that provides for a limit of 50 \nAM and 50 FM stations that one person may own. I, in fact, think it \nought to be lower than that. But the Senator from Illinois has proposed \na modest approach, and then finds himself struggling because the very \npreachers of competition are suggesting that somehow the Senator from \nIllinois is proposing something that is wrong.\n  I tell you, there is a total disconnection of logic on the floor of \nthe Senate on this issue. My friend from Montana grins about that. But \nI would bet all the cattle in North Dakota against all the cattle in \nMontana that 10 years from now if the broadcasting ownership \nderegulation provisions in this bill passes, that we will see the \nconsequences that I have suggested. We will see massive concentration \nin television ownership and massive concentration in radio ownership.\n  The Senator from Montana will say, ``Well, that would be OK, because, \nthey wouldn't compete against themselves, they would have different \nformats.'' They would have a couple different stations. One would be \nproducing country western music and the other classical music. They \nwill both be extracting, if they control the marketplace, the maximum \namount of money from the advertisers in that marketplace.\n  The issue here is competition. If you bring this bill to the floor \nwith a dozen flowery opening statements and talk about the virtues of \ncompetition, then there seems to me there is some obligation to \npractice competition with respect to the amendments and the language in \nthis bill. This is exactly the opposite of the tenets of competition. \nThese provisions which eliminate the ownership restrictions, will \ninevitably, lead to greater concentration of ownership.\n  That is the point I make, and that is why I support the amendment of \nthe Senator from Illinois. We had a close vote on the ownership of \ntelevision stations yesterday. I won that vote for about an hour. But \nthat was before dinner. Then after dinner, we had a bunch of folks \nlimping into the Chamber all bandaged up and changing their votes. What \nhappened was apparently before dinner, they believed concentration of \nownership in the television industry was not good. Then they had \nsomething to eat, or ate with someone who convinced them that \nconcentration of ownership was good.\n  It would be interesting for me to hear how they explain that \nconversion over dinner, but I understand that you do not weigh votes, \nyou count them.\n  I hope when we get to the issue of concentration of radio ownership \nthat maybe we can win this one and maybe win for more than an hour. I \nthink it would be in the public interest if we adopt the amendment \noffered today by the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair. [[Page S8427]] \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SIMON. Does the Senator want to speak on this amendment?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nproceed for not to exceed 10 minutes on the Lieberman-Leahy amendment, \namendment No. 1298.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1298\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I think the Lieberman-Leahy amendment is \nnecessary because we have to make sure that if we deregulate cable \nrates, we do not do it on the backs of the consumers. And, right now we \nare. In most areas in this country, consumers are captive to monopoly \ncable service providers. In fact, the only thing that stands between \nthe consumers' wallets and the monopoly cable company is regulation.\n  Under the telecommunications bill, the sure-fire way for a cable \ncompany to avoid regulation is to raise their rates across the country. \nIt is very, very interesting what we are doing. If we sent this up for \na national referendum, the Lieberman-Leahy amendment would be agreed to \noverwhelmingly. If we had a referendum by only some of the well-heeled \nPAC's and lobbyists around here, well then, of course, it goes down. So \nthe question is: Who do we stand with?\n  We all get paid enough money so that $10 or $20 added onto our cable \nrates each month probably does not seem like a lot. But to most people \nliving in Vermont or any other State in this country, that is a big \ndifference. Ask people who get cable television in this country whether \nthey think their cable rates would go up or down if monopoly cable \ncompanies are left to themselves to decide what the rates would be.\n  The American people are pretty smart. They know darn well if we let \nthe cable companies have a monopoly and have no regulation, those rates \nare going to go up. They are never going to come down. The only times \nthey have come down is when Congress stepped in. In fact, when we \npassed the 1992 Cable Act, President Bush vetoed it, and we overrode \nthe veto, because consumers were being gouged by cable company \nmonopolies. Cable rates were rising three times faster than the \ninflation rate. Every American knew it, and finally Congress got the \nmessage and they overrode the Presidential veto.\n  Consumers demanded action to stop the rising cable rates. The law \nworked. In fact, since passage of that law, consumers have saved an \nestimated $3 billion, and they have seen an average 17 percent drop in \ntheir monthly rates. As rates have gone down, more people have signed \nup. Last year alone, over 1.5 million new customers signed up for cable \nservice. One would think the word would get across: If you keep the \nrates reasonable, more people are going to join.\n  The telecommunications bill would lift the lid on cable rates.\n  Under current law, cable rate regulation is dispensed with only when \nthe FCC finds there is ``effective competition'' in a local market.\n  The telecommunications bill, as reported, would change this law by \ndeeming ``effective competition'' to be present wherever a local phone \ncompany offers video programming, regardless of the number of \nsubscribers to, or households reached by, the service.\n  The bill would also lift rate regulation for upper tiers of cable \nservice, unless the cable operator is a ``bad actor'' and charges \nsubstantially more than the national average. Of course, the national \naverage could be set by the two largest cable companies. They almost \nhave an incentive to raise the national average and the rates.\n  In fact, the day after Senator Lieberman and I held a press \nconference to voice our concerns over the cable deregulation parts of \nthe bill, the managers' amendment to this bill was adopted in an effort \nto provide more protection to consumers from the spiraling cable rates \nafter deregulation. But I do not believe it goes far enough.\n  The managers' amendment ties rate regulation to whatever the national \naverage was on June 1 of this year, to be adjusted every 2 years. But \nthat still means if the two or three largest cable companies raise \ntheir rates, the national average will go up, and rates for all \nconsumers would spiral upward.\n  Now, Mr. President, if any one of us went to a town meeting in our \nState and we said: Here is the way we are going to set cable rates. We \nare going to allow two or three huge cable companies to determine what \nthe national average will be for your rates, and we will leave it to \ntheir good judgment. Should they raise rates, well, then everybody's \nrates would go up. If they lower rates, everybody's rates will go down. \nAnd now, ladies and gentlemen in this town meeting, what do you think \nthose big cable companies are going to do? Will they raise your rates, \nor will they say their subscribers are paying enough--``Let us lower \nthe rates, let us give the average household a break?''\n  Well, just asking the question, we would get laughed out of the hall. \nEvery American who gets cable knows the cable companies are not going \nto just lower the rates on their own. I hear this back home. I do not \ncare if a person is Republican, Democrat, independent, whatever, they \nare saying the same thing: Cable rates are too high. They also say that \nunless you have real competition to bring rates down, do not leave the \ncable companies to set the rates, because they are never going to bring \nthem down. They are always going to raise them. Under this bill, the \nmore cable operators raise rates, the more they can avoid regulation of \ntheir rate increases. If cable rate regulation is lifted before you \nhave effective competition, then you can expect the rates to go up at \nleast $5 to $10 a month. We are trusting in the generosity and good \nwill of the cable companies. Good Lord, Mr. President, we are all \nadults; we ought to be smart enough to know better than that.\n  The Lieberman-Leahy amendment would fix the cable rate regulation \nproblems in the bill. Our amendment would use competitive market rates \nas a benchmark for whether rate regulation is needed to protect \nconsumers. Instead of letting a few cable companies control the cable \nrates for all consumers in the Nation, our amendment would ensure that \nrates are fair. Regulators can step in to protect consumers when rates \nare out of line with competitive markets.\n  Small cable companies, particularly in rural areas, of course, have \ndifferent economic pressures on them than operators in high-density \nareas. Our amendment would exempt small cable companies from rate \nregulation. If you are in rural Pennsylvania or rural Vermont, and your \nhouse is maybe a mile or two a part, it obviously would cost you more \nto set up your cable system than if you are wiring high-rise apartments \nin a high-density area.\n  I do not think we have to give cable companies any incentive to raise \nrates. Mr. President, I have a feeling the cable companies will figure \nout how they can raise rates, without us encouraging them to do it. I \ndo not think any one of us wants to go back home and tell our \nconstituents that we passed legislation that actually encourages cable \ncompanies to raise rates, rather than doing something to hold them \ndown.\n  We stepped in once before, over a Presidential veto, to curb \nspiraling cable rates. The Lieberman-Leahy amendment ensures that \nconsumers have the protection they need. Do you not think we ought to \ndo this?\n  Now, if we have a situation where we have two or three cable \ncompanies in one community or one area, I would rely on competition to \nbring the prices down, and it will. But when you only have one cable \ncompany, or if you have a telephone company that has come in and bought \nout the cable company, so that you have a monopoly on top of a \nmonopoly, Mr. President, altruism is not going to bring those rates \ndown. People are not going to see their rates come down just out of \ngood will on the part of the cable company. We are either going to have \neffective competition or regulation. If we have effective competition, \nlet cable companies set their own rates. But if you have a monopoly, \nyou should have regulation that is going to bring the rates down.\n  Again, I will tell you this. Any member of the public that is getting \ncable television would agree that if this was a referendum among the \ntaxpayers of this country who have cable television, they would vote \noverwhelmingly for the Lieberman-Leahy amendment. If you are somebody \nrepresenting one of the cable monopolies, of course, you \n[[Page S8428]] are not going to want it because it is going to say that \nyou do not have a license to print money. That is basically what they \nare going to have--a license to print money--if we do not have some \nregulation on them.\n  Let us at least wait until there is real competition. Some have said \nthat these new satellite dishes will do it. Well, there is only, I \nbelieve, 600,000 or so of those in the country. Less than 1 percent of \nthe people get their service that way. It is about $600, $700 to set it \nup. Let us wait until there is real competition.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I come to speak in \nstrong opposition to this Lieberman-Leahy amendment. Seldom has \nsomething been so misguided, misconceived, and antimarket as what we \nhave attempted to do to cable over the last decade.\n  I can speak with some degree of knowledge and history on this, \nbecause I was chairman of the Commerce Committee when we deregulated \ncable in 1984. When we deregulated them, we asked two things of them. \nOne, give us lots more channels. Two, give us more diverse programming.\n  Mr. President, we got that in spades. There is hardly a person so \nyoung in this Chamber that they cannot remember precable days, when \nwhat you got was ABC, NBC, and CBS, through your local affiliates, \nmaybe a public broadcasting station, and maybe an independent, unless \nyou were in Los Angeles or New York. That was basically it on \ntelevision. You got it with your rabbit ears.\n  Cable came in initially to fill a void where people could not get \nsignals. Instead of growing from urban to rural, they grew from rural \nto urban. They began to realize if they were going to compete, they had \nto do more than just carry the signal of the major networks. And so \nwhen they were deregulated in 1984, they gave us what we asked for. \nToday, we have, unfortunately, limited them with that foolish 1992 act. \nBut you could ``channel surf,'' as we have learned to call it, and be \nfascinated. I find Spanish language stations here in Washington. You \ncan find three or four in Los Angeles, and a number of them in Corpus \nChristi. They program to the market on things that the over-the-air \nnetworks could not do because, by the very nature of the fact that you \nwere over the air, you had to have a wide audience. You could not \nprogram to a narrow audience. Cable can.\n  Cable can make money on programming to a narrow audience. So \nconsumers got services and programs that they wanted, that they could \nnever get before. You cannot probably justify a history channel on NBC \nor ABC or CBS, broadcasting over the air to a broadband audience;\n probably could not on MTV, if you had to cover the entire audience in \nan area. But you can on this narrow broadcast.\n\n  Now this argument about competition, holy mackerel, Mr. President. \nThe argument about a referendum, put this to a referendum, people would \nvote down what they are paying for cable. My hunch is if you put to a \nreferendum what they pay for phone bills, they would put that down. And \nelectric bills.\n  I hesitate to say what they would do if you gave them a referendum on \ncongressional salaries. My hunch is they would vote that down. Is that \nthe standard this representative body will be --whatever a referendum \nmight be, that will be it?\n  If you were to pose the question in a different way to people, do you \nwant to cut your cable prices in half and have your programs cut in \nhalf and have the channels taken off, you might get a different answer. \nBut if the question is, do you want some costs lowered, what answer do \nyou expect to get? I would like to have the price of gasoline lowered. \nI might put that up for a referendum and see what we get.\n  Now look at the competition argument. I heard the Senator from \nVermont talk about 600,000. This is not 600,000 direct broadcast \nsatellite over the year, but 600,000 what we call wireless cable.\n  This is growing. You normally have to have flat terrain, but this \ndoes not come from the satellite. Wireless cable, as we call it, is \nline-of-sight from a transmitter. Because the terrain is relatively \nflat, the line-of-sight is good.\n  Corpus Christi is a good example where the line-of-sight has taken a \nfair portion of the market and the prices are cheaper than normal \ncable, and you can transmit a good program over the air because you \nhave a straight line-of-sight.\n  Obviously, that kind of programming is limited, but it is growing. \nThat is the 600,000 subscriber figure that the Senator from Vermont \ntalks about. They expect to have 600,000 within 2 years grow to 1.5 \nmillion, and 3.4 million by the year 2000.\n  In addition, you already have Bell Atlantic, NYNEX, Pactel, phone \ncompanies, all of them experimenting in small areas with carrying the \nequivalent of cable on their phone wire system.\n  That is going to expand. But then beyond that, direct broadcast \nsatellite. Here is a business, 2,000 new subscribers a day. The company \nthat makes the dishes cannot make them fast enough. Mr. President, \n2,000 additional subscribers a day. We will have over 5 million \nsubscribers to this by the year 2000, and I bet that is an \nunderestimate.\n  Except for the local news, you can get every program from the direct \nbroadcast satellite you can get from cable. If you want the local news, \nyou know that 94 percent of the people in this country can get local \nnews with rabbit ears. Local is local, you do not broadcast very far.\n  All you have to do is turn the switch on your television set from \ncable to over the air and you can get the local news. So the fact that \nthe direct broadcast satellite cannot physically carry it at the moment \nis not an impediment.\n  Mr. President, the market works. While we are talking about \ncommunications, the best example to probably use is the cellular \ntelephones. Again, I speak with some degree of history on this.\n  In 1981, when I was chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, we \npassed a bill restructuring AT They had to have separate boards for \nBell labs, and we worked out an agreement that was satisfactory to a \nlot of parties.\n  The bill went to the House. Before the House acted, the antitrust \nsettlement between AT and the Government was arrived at. The so-\ncalled modified final judgment. Therefore, the bill became moot.\n  AT and everybody else agreed to a different method of restructuring \nthan we passed in the Senate Commerce Committee, and that agreement was \nthat they would spin off all the local Bell companies. They would get \nout of the local business and keep the long distance business.\n  That was not the only agreement in the modified final judgment. There \nwere lots of things that the local Bells could not go into--local \ninformation services, manufacturing. This was a structured settlement. \nStill regulatory, but very structured.\n  The one thing that the settlement left out was cellular telephones, \nbecause there was no future in cellular telephones of any great \nconsequence, and nobody cared about it.\n  An analogy I used the other day was the dividing up of the Middle \nEast by Britain and France after World War I. All of the Middle East \nhad been part of the Turkish sovereign area. Turkey was allied with \nGermany in World War I, and Britain and France in the middle of the war \nsaid, ``When this is over we will take a lot of Turkey's territory in \nthe Middle East and divide it among ourselves.''\n  At the end of the war, Britain took what has become now Israel and \nJordan and Iraq. France took what has become Lebanon and Syria. Nobody \nwanted Arabia. It was not worth anything. Nothing but sand. So it got \nleft out, on its own devices.\n  Today, it occupies a position of more extraordinary influence because \nof its oil reserves than all of the other countries, save Israel, put \ntogether.\n  Cellular telephones are the same analogy. They were left out of the \nmodified final judgment. There were 100,000 of them in existence in \n1982. AT predicted by the year 2000 there might be a million cellular \ntelephones. Today, there are 25 million subscribers. Predictions are in \n10 years that will be 125 million subscribers. I bet that \nunderestimates the number. [[Page S8429]] \n  This has happened because we did not regulate it. We left it to the \nmarketplace. Does anybody think there is no competition in cellular \ntelephone today? All you do is turn on your radio, turn on your \ntelevision, open your newspaper, and you have company upon company \nstumbling over each year to compete for your business. ``Sign up, we \nwill give a free phone.'' And you have to understand that you have to \nmake so many phone calls or pay so much.\n  People are pretty darn smart and managed to figure this out. They \nhave done well figuring out long distance, watching MCI ads, AT ads, \nthe Sprint ads. They have also discovered that there are lots of small \nlong distance companies.\n  I have over 40 long distance phone companies in Oregon that are what \nyou would call niche carriers. They rent their time from AT They are \na bulk buyer, they will buy it. Then they say we have 24 hours of time \nover the week, or 10 hours of time over the day on such and such, and \nthey go out and sell it. They are specialists in certain niches. Some \nsell to the medical profession. Some to the insurance profession. They \nfigured out a way--the companies are not big, some 8 or 10 employees, \nand they are renting everyone else's facilities--to do something very \nnarrowly and good that is better than the big company can do it.\n  We have seen this in telecommunications. The innovators in this field \nare not always IBM and AT They are more often new companies that are \nspinoffs--not spinoffs, been formed by some 35-year-old engineer who \nleft the company, mortgaged his house, sold his hunting dog, and both \nhe and his spouse put up everything that they had to take a chance. And \nthey succeeded.\n  Come back again to cable. There is no need for any regulation of \ncable at any level. They have more competition now than they can \nhandle, and they will have more competition than they can handle. The \nconsumer is going to be the beneficiary.\n  I hope, Mr. President, that the Lieberman-Leahy amendment would be \ndefeated overwhelmingly. If there is any example of where the market is \nworking, and will get even more and more competitive, it is in \ncommunications generally. It is in cable specifically.\n  I think to adopt this amendment to further regulate cable beyond \nwhich we have already regulated in 1992--and we should not--would be a \nterrible mistake.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, if I may respond very briefly to my \nfriend from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut should be advised \nhe has used all the time on his amendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for no more than 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, my friend from Oregon has spoken \nagainst my amendment which would maintain some kind of consumer \nprotection in the pricing of cable, based on the wonderful service and \nthe extraordinary range of programming that cable provides.\n Since I got into this fight when I was attorney general in Connecticut \nin 1984 when cable prices were deregulated and most consumers in \nAmerica were left facing a monopoly with no competition, I have said I \nwas very supportive of cable. I think cable is an extraordinary service \nto the American people. It has been delivered well, and I like the \nexpansion of the program.\n\n  What I do not like is allowing that expansion to occur without giving \nconsumers some protection, because they have only one choice to make, \nand what is significant to me is that the programming has continued to \nexpand even since the regulation, the consumer protection that went on \nin 1992. So there is no reason to believe that, if we sustain some \nprotection for consumers until they face competition, that will stop.\n  The second point is this. There just is not adequate competition at \nthis time to existing cable. If there were, then the FCC would have \npulled off regulation for cable in more than 50 markets where they say \nthere is now effective competition out of more than 10,000 in the \ncountry. The fact is, the direct broadcast satellites which were \nthought to be the next wave of great competition for cable are only \nused by less than 1 percent of the cable consumers in America.\n  Telephone companies may get into this. They probably will. But the \nquestion is, When? Until that time, most cable consumers in America \nwill have no alternative except the local cable company, and if this \nbill passes without the amendment Senator Leahy and I have offered, the \nconsumer will not only not have a choice of another system to offer \nmultichannel services, cable as we know it, but will have no benefit of \nconsumer protection. History tells us where there is no competitive \nmarket, where there is a monopoly supplier and no regulation, the \nconsumer is in real danger of being taken advantage of.\n  So in my humble opinion, respectfully, I think this amendment is all \nthat stands between millions of cable consumers and what I would take \nto be a definite increase in their rates over the coming years until \nthere really is effective competition to hold the rates down.\n  Again, I love cable. My family watches; selectively, of course. But I \ndo not, any more than any other consumer, including a lot of the \nelderly out there, people on fixed incomes, I do not want only one \nchoice and no consumer protection.\n  This system has worked. It saved consumers money. The industry has \ncontinued to thrive. They continue to be able to raise capital. There \nis simply no reason to remove these consumer protections. I will say \nrespectfully again, to me what has happened here is that, in the Trojan \nhorse of this great telecommunications bill, there has been inserted \ninside a repealer of cable consumer protection without cause and at \ngreat cost to American consumers.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment so none of us will \nhave to explain to our consumers back home why rates have risen, as \nthey surely will in the years ahead if this amendment is not agreed to.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I really like this debate. But I would like \nto draw your attention to one thing. He says there is no competition. \nWhat is 2,000 subscribers a day being added to the DBS that provides \nthe same channels, the same service--CNN, ESPN, all of those we enjoy \nnow, and the USA, Lifetime, the History Channel, all of those--off \ndirect broadcast satellite? What is that other than competition? If the \nrates get competitive, whether you are on a fixed income or not a fixed \nincome, it makes no difference. And it is going to make both services \nbetter when they compete equally. There are no restrictions on DBS. \nNobody is setting their rates.\n  If one remembers, since way back in 1990 when we were talking about \nthis, there was a great groundswell that went across the country, what \nabout cable rates? Did you take into consideration--when you used to \nbuy maybe three Salt Lake stations and two Billings stations and a PBS \nstation for $5 or $6 a month and then all at once we pay $21 now for \n45, I think, something like that--our cost per channel? One does not \nhave to take it. Nobody is standing there with a gun to your head \nsaying, You have to sign up for cable. They go by more houses than they \nservice. It is another part of the market. We are trying to sell a \nservice.\n  At the same time we said, Do not reregulate the cables; allow \neffective competition. DBS was part of that; C-band; satellite dishes, \nthey were a part of that. I think also in the same time--and the \nchairman and ranking member remember this--I offered the amendment on a \ntelco bill to allow them in the cable business to provide effective \ncompetition, to add an entity that already has a wire into the house. \nThey would have to change their technology a little bit, and that is \nwhat we are really doing is providing the new technologies that will \ntravel on this great thing called fiber optics, or fiber and coaxial \ninterphased for broadband, two-way, interact telecommunications. That \nis where we are going. That is why we need Mickey Mouse to pave the way \nfor other things that we have in store, and that is distance learning \nand telemedicine and these types of things. [[Page S8430]] \n  So what, is C-band competition? Sure it is. Is telco competition? \nYes, they are. Is DBA competition? Yes, they are. Even the store down \nthe street that sells videos to rent is competition to the same service \nthe cable operators are trying to provide over that wire into the \nhouse.\n  I said this before: The glass highway, the information highway, may \nbe already in place and it has been done by this marvelous growth \nindustry called cable television. The competition is there, and I urge \nthe colleagues to defeat this amendment.\n  Mr. President, the solution to the cable problem is competition, not \ncontinued regulation. In fact, after the 1984 Cable Act, deregulation \nof the cable industry resulted in substantial benefits.\n  The cable industry has made substantial investments in programming, \nplant and equipment, investments that have directly benefited \nconsumers, in particular my constituents in Montana.\n  If all we heed and hear are the problems of cable, then I am afraid \nthat we will have lost an opportunity, a chance to look into the future \nand to shape it; for we do shape the future of this Nation when we \nshape its telecommunications infrastructure. It is an infrastructure \nthat is critical to the whole Nation--from the Lincoln Center in New \nYork City, to Lincoln, NE, to Lincoln County, MT.\n  So in the continuing debate over what to do about the so-called cable \nproblem, there are two alternatives. Solution one is competition. And \nsolution two is regulation. It has been my experience that regulation \ncan actually harm consumers by slowing innovation and stifling new \nservices. On the other hand, nothing is more pro-consumer than \ncompetition, most especially competition where there is a level playing \nfield. And on no playing field can the benefits of competition be seen \nmore clearly than on the field of communications. History teaches us \nthat you cannot regulate technological advancements.\n  Regulation does a very poor job of guaranteeing a market choice for \nconsumers. Most ironically, under a price regulatory regime, prices are \nunlikely to fall when they are effectively propped up by regulation.\n  On the other hand, we have all seen many instances where competitive \nmarket forces spur competitors to innovate in order to reduce costs and \nimprove efficiency. And as costs come down, new technologies and new \nservices can be extended to unserved areas. Those are the types of \ntruly competitive market forces that I want to introduce, and the \npeople of Montana need, to ensure that our State is fully served.\n  Again, I am not merely talking about video entertainment, I am \ntalking about the communications revolution, and I want my constituents \nto benefit from that revolution and not be left behind by it.\n  Moreover, I want our Nation to lead that revolution much as we have \nled the revolutions for democracy around the world. Thus, I do not want \nthe guarantee of participation in the electronic information age for \nthe people of Montana to rest solely on heavy-handed regulation. I want \nMontanans to be able to rely on good old American know-how as \nstimulated by good old American competition.\n  I believe this competition is already arising through such \ntechnologies as DBS, wireless cable, the home satellite dish market, \nand even those technologies yet to be discovered. And I believe that \nwith this legislation we have provided perhaps the best opportunity for \ncompetition in the video market by permitting the telephone companies \nto compete for cable services. And we have done so by promoting telco \nentry with safeguards and restrictions.\n  This legislation, drafted by this Congress, promotes the greatest \npublic good by unleashing competition and technology to meet the \nNation's needs. It will be this competition that will help ensure that \na modern telecommunications infrastructure and innovative services are \navailable to all Americans--and, most importantly, all Montanans--at \nreasonable prices. When telephone companies are able to compete with \ncable companies, as this legislation allows, a competitive cable market \nwould:\n  First, put downward pressure on cable service rates;\n  Second, lead to greater diversity of television programming and \nprogram choices;\n  Third, accelerate the introduction of new services; and\n  Fourth, increase consumer access to high quality service.\n  I have been involved in this debate since I first arrived in the \nSenate. I believe that we are finally on the verge of passing a \nhistoric piece of legislation. I think that the Lieberman amendment is \na significant step backward in our efforts. Competition is the answer, \nnot re-regulation. I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the amendment has expired.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 30 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, very briefly. My friend from Montana \nsays 2,000 additional subscribers to direct broadcast satellites go on \nevery day. That is compared to over 60 million cable customers. We are \ngetting there, but we do not really have effective competition in most \nplaces in America. When we do, the FCC will pull this consumer \nprotection off and then the consumers will be protected by competition.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1283, as Modified\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \namendment by my good friend, Senator Simon. The financial health and \ncompetitive viability of the Nation's radio industry is in our hands. \nWe all agree that the telecommunications legislation we are considering \nis about competition and deregulation and not picking winners and \nlosers. And we also agree that this legislation goes a long way toward \ngiving cable, satellite, and the phone companies the freedoms they need \nto compete. We now need to agree to extend these same freedoms to the \nover 11,000 radio broadcasters in this country.\n  No other audio service provider, be they cable, satellite or telcos, \nhas the multiple ownership restrictions that radio has. The language we \nare offering today eliminates those outdated radio-only rules.\n  It is imperative we in Congress end this discrimination against radio \nsooner by adopting this language, rather than wait for the bureaucracy \nto come around to it later, as this legislation as currently drafted \nwould have it. Immediate action is critical because the FCC is on the \nverge of authorizing digital satellite radio service, whereby 60 new \nradio signals will broadcast in every market in the United States. This \nsatellite service will be mobile and available in automobiles, homes, \nand businesses. Also, cable already provides 30 channels of digital \nradio broadcasting in markets across the United States under a single \noperator. Obviously, an incredible diversity of voices has been \nachieved with even more competition to radio quickly making its way \ndown the information highway. Yet, let us not lose sight of the fact \nthat all of these welcome new voices are also aggressive competitors \nfor radio's listeners and advertisers, and, unlike radio, these \ncompetitors are not burdened with radio's multiple ownership \nrestrictions nor do they have the same public service obligations as \nradio broadcasters.\n  Our Nation's radio broadcasters have a strong tradition of providing \nthe American people with universal and free information services. In a \ntelecommunications environment increasingly dominated by subscription \nservices and pay-per-view, it is essential that we not foreclose the \nfuture of free over-the-air radio by restricting ownership options, for \nradio serving the public interest and competing are not mutually \nexclusive. They are complementary.\n  So it is left up to us to empower radio so it can grow strong well \ninto the next century and continue to serve our communities as it has \ndone so well for the past 70 years.\n  The last point I would like to make is perhaps the most important. \nRelief from ownership rules works. In the early- and mid-1980's the FCC \nissued hundreds of new radio licenses, and the market became \noversaturated with [[Page S8431]] radio stations without sufficient \nadvertising revenues to support the increase. However, in 1992 the FCC \ngranted limited relief in radio ownership restrictions. After many \nyears of financial losses, suddenly radio became an attractive area for \ninvestment and an alarming multiyear increase in stations going off the \nair was arrested. The economies of scale kicked in. Stations gained \nfinancial strength through consolidation, and its overall ability to \nserve its markets and compete for advertising improved.\n  Allow me to quickly cite some statistics. In 1993, a year after the \nnew limits took effect, the dollar volume of FM-only transactions \nalmost tripled-- $743.5 million--while radio station groups sales grew \n44 percent.\n  In 1994, sales prices of single-FM stations rose 12.7 percent from \n1993's $743.5 million to $838 million, and from 1993 to 1994, the total \nvolume of AM radio station sales shot up 84 percent, totaling $132 \nmillion.\n  There is every reason to believe that all of these positive trends \nwill continue to flourish if we remove radio's outmoded multiple \nownership restrictions.\n  Clearly, maintaining local and national radio ownership limits in the \nface of tomorrow's competitive environment is not only unfair but it is \na major step back.\n  Mr. President, let me emphasize that I understand some statements \nhave been made. I understand that CBS does not support the Simon \namendment. Bill Ryan is the NAB Joint Board Chairman. He supports the \nNAB position which is adamantly opposed to the Simon amendment. Mr. \nRyan's comments, which Senator Simon cited, related to TV ownership and \nnot radio ownership.\n  Mr. President, I urge Senators to come to the floor to make their \nstatements on the various pending amendments.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1298\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to speak against the \nLieberman-Leahy amendment. The Lieberman-Leahy amendment will finish \nthis bill once and for all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be advised that all time has \nexpired on the Lieberman-Leahy amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak \nfor up to 5 minutes on the bill and on the Lieberman-Leahy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, the Lieberman-Leahy amendment will reregulate cable.\n  What we are trying to do with this bill is deregulate so that we have \na level playing field, so that more people can come into the \ncompetitive market, and so that the consumers will benefit from the \nlower costs and lower prices. The Lieberman amendment will take away \nthe balance that has been established in this bill. It will put the FCC \nback into the regulatory business. It will cause these cable companies \nto have to come to the FCC to spend their money paying lawyers' fees \ninstead of dropping their prices and going to the bottom line.\n  I am sure that the intent of the amendment is very good. They want to \nmake sure that we have low cost if there is not competition. But what \nwe are trying to do here is promote competition so there will be \nchoices, so that the consumers will have the ability to pick and \nchoose.\n  The Lieberman amendment will put one more hassle to the cable \ncompanies even when it is not necessary.\n  I have watched day after day after day the chairman of the committee, \non which I serve, and the ranking member talking about the need for \nthis bill. It will put $3 billion into our economy in new jobs, and it \nwill be a benefit to consumers. They have done a wonderful job. But \nwhat is very important to remember here is that we must keep a level \nplaying field. And we have tried to balance.\n  Sometimes we have done something that the long distance companies do \nnot like. Sometimes we have done something that the local Bell \ncompanies do not like. Sometimes we have done things that the cable \ncompanies think is onerous. This would be an onerous regulation that \nwould put the FCC back in the mix when we do not need the FCC. We are \ntrying to take the FCC out of every arena that we possibly can. The FCC \nis very much in the bill, I must say, of course. For instance, in \nbroadcast ownership, we want the FCC to look at broadcast ownership to \nmake sure there is not the concentration that would take away the \ndiversity of voices in a market. But it is very important that we keep \nthe balance. We must be able to say at the end of this bill that \nprobably everybody does not like it as a perfect bill but we have \nallowed people to come into the process to compete, and we have tried \nto make the cost the least possible, and we have tried to make the cost \nfair.\n But the underlying element of this bill is that we take the \nregulations out to the greatest extent possible.\n\n  Mr. President, if we are going to even look at the Lieberman-Leahy \namendment, it is going to gut the bill from the standpoint of keeping \nthe level playing field, continuing to encourage competition, and \ngiving the consumers the benefit of all the choices that will be \navailable. If we can pass this bill and keep it fair, the \ntelecommunications industry in this country is going to explode. It is \ngoing to be a wonderful boon to our economy. New jobs will come into \nthe market. Consumers will get more choices. We will have choices that \nwe have not even dreamed of today. We will have choices of technology \nthat will give us the ability to research and grow because we are \ntaking the regulations out of this bill to the greatest extent \npossible.\n  So, Mr. President, I think the chairman of the committee and the \nranking member have done a terrific job. They have cooperated. There \nhas been disagreement on every major part of this bill, but we have not \nworked on this bill for days. We have not work on this bill for weeks. \nWe have not worked on this bill for months. In fact, we have worked on \nthis bill for years. We have talked about telecommunications \nderegulation for years in this country. I am a person who is not even a \nregulator. I do not like any regulations. I would like for Congress not \nto even be in the process. But because technology has exploded and \nbecause we have had a regulatory environment that has caused an unfair \nand unlevel playing field, we have had to correct the wrongs, and we \nare doing that by trying to reach a balance. That is what this bill \ndoes. The Lieberman amendment will take that balance away, and we must \nnot allow that to happen.\n  So I thank the Chair. I thank the chairman of the committee and the \ndistinguished ranking member for their leadership. We must stick with \nthe committee on this amendment. It is very important for the future of \nour jobs, of our economy, and for the consumers of our Nation.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for her \ngreat work and leadership on this telecommunications bill. She has been \na stalwart in drafting this bill and in making it happen. Her \nleadership was crucial and I thank her very, very much.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Shelby). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator yield for a question and comment?\n  I just wish to say that I did not mention this because I was talking \nabout the level playing field of all of the competitors, but the other \nelement here that the chairman and the ranking member have worked so \nhard on is the protection of our cities and our State regulatory \nboards.\n  Our cities have rights-of-way that they must control, and that is \nsomething that we worked very hard to make sure was not encroached on. \nWe would have chaos if someone came in and said, Well, I now have the \nright to dig a hole in the middle of your street, without the city \nmaintaining that control.\n  So I wish to say that that is another element of this bill that is \nprotected, [[Page S8432]] and the cities of America owe a great debt of \ngratitude to the chairman and the ranking member.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1325, as further modified\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, at this time, we are prepared to call up \nan amendment that has been agreed to that we will not have to have a \nvote on, and that is the Warner amendment. I would like to call up \namendment 1325.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is amendment No. 1325, as \nmodified. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Is there a modification?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I have the perfecting amendment. I send an amendment to \nthe desk and I ask for its immediate consideration. It is a perfecting \namendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It should be a substitute, I think. It should be \ndrafted as a substitute for the amendment.\n  The amendment (1325), as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       1. On page 102, after line 25, insert a new subsection as \n     follows:\n       ``(e) Information on Protocols and Technical \n     Requirements.--The Commission shall prescribe regulations to \n     require that each Bell operating company shall maintain and \n     file with the Commission full and complete information with \n     respect to the protocols and technical requirements for \n     connection with and use of its telephone exchange service \n     facilities. Such regulations shall require each such Bell \n     company to report promptly to the Commission any material \n     changes or planned changes to such protocols and \n     requirements, and the schedule for implementation of such \n     changes or planned changes.''.\n       2. Redesignate subsequent subsections accordingly.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection----\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I would just like to say a word or two.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I would like to praise Senator Warner. In his usual \ngracious way, we worked on this amendment for a few days, and we had \nvarious meetings with Senator Warner and some of his constituents who \nare concerned about this manufacturing clause.\n  His original amendment he has agreed to set aside in favor of this \nmodification. My colleague from South Carolina, the ranking member of \nthe committee, has long been an expert in this area, having authored \nthe bill on manufacturing that passed the Senate. He has graciously \nagreed to this modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this deals, of course, with the \ntechnical requirements for connection to the telephone exchange service \nfacilities, which is quite appropriate. It does not allude to the \nresearch and design with respect to manufacturing. That has been \ncleared.\n  I join in the distinguished chairman's praise of Senator Warner and \nhis efforts here to clarify this to make certain that everyone could be \nprepared and on notice as to facilitating the interconnection services. \nSo I join in the amendment as amended, I take it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the amendment as so \nmodified is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 1325), as further modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, is time controlled at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is controlled on each amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise and will only speak for a very few \nminutes, but I would like to indicate my support for the cable \nprovisions of S. 652 as it has been brought to the floor by the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member and the committee, of which I \nam a member.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1298\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I want to voice, therefore, my opposition to the \nLieberman-Leahy amendment. All of us are concerned about cable rates. \nWe made a major effort a number of years ago to try to regulate that \nand guarantee that the consumer is going to have the lowest possible \nprice. In my judgment, the fundamental thrust of this bill which has \nbeen very carefully tailored to work a balance between many varied very \npowerful interests, the fundamental effort of this bill is to create \ncompetition which will reduce rates across the board.\n  I think all of us have learned that when you have regulation, you \ninevitably have a skewing of the market which impacts the capacity of \npeople to take risks, people to raise capital, people to invest and \ndiversify. It is my belief that the upper tier versus the lower tier of \nregulation is sufficiently well tailored in the legislation that we \nsent out of committee that the interests of consumers are protected.\n  In point of fact, it is my belief that the availability of direct \nbroadcast satellite today and the availability of video dial that is \ngoing to come on so rapidly people are going to be dizzy when they \nbegin to see it, that to maintain a regimen of strict upper tier \nregulation on cable would be to disadvantage cable's capacity to be \nable to make the kind of investment necessary that this bill envisions,\n precisely to be able to compete with the regional Bell operating \ncompanies and to begin to create the dynamic synergy that we are \nlooking for in the marketplace.\n\n  So I believe the greatest protection for consumers is, in fact, going \nto come from competition for video services, and I believe that \ncompetition is well structured and maintained in the format that has \nbeen brought to the floor.\n  When consumers have a choice and the marketplace is not artificially \nconstrained, then that marketplace is going to provide for rates that \nare reasonable. I think that anybody who looks at the current \nintentions of the regional Bell operating companies and long distance \noperators and those who are going to be moving into the provision of \nvideo services will understand that if cable all of a sudden went out \nand started raising its rates at any tier, it is going to be \nsignificantly noncompetitive, it will build resentment among consumers, \nand they will quickly move to the new provision of services.\n  I can speak to this on a very personal level because I have recently \nbeen making choices about where to put what kind of service in my own \nresidence. I was amazed at the number of direct broadcast capacities \nversus cable that I could make a choice on right now.\n  Second, Mr. President, consumers do not only care about rates, they \nalso care about the quality of the service and they care about the \nbreadth of programming that is available to them. They want both of \nthose as well, and they want that from cable. If cable all of a sudden \nceases to do that, they are going to have the opportunity to make \nanother set of choices because of the very things that we are proposing \nin this legislation.\n  Finally, this bill incorporates a so-called bad actor provision, so \nthat the FCC can step in immediately if a cable company begins to move \nin a direction which is clearly anticonsumer or out of order with what \nthe rest of the companies in the Nation are doing.\n  So, in my judgment, our objective should not be to strengthen the \nregulation of rates that cable now is allowed to collect for its upper-\ntier service. On the contrary, our objective ought to be to maximize \ncompetition and to get the Government out of the way of allowing these \ncompanies to begin to compete and the price mechanism to be able to \nprovide the maximum amount of consumer benefit.\n  I think anybody who looks at what has happened in the last 5 or 10 \nyears in this field cannot help be amazed at the way in which \ncompetition and private-sector initiative has changed the landscape of \nthe provision of these services, and it will do so at such an \nextraordinary rate over the course of the next few years that Americans \nwill, I think, understand the attributes of what the committee has \nbrought to the floor.\n  So I urge my colleagues to stay with the committee mark and the \nchairman's and ranking member's efforts to try to maximize competition \nand to oppose the Lieberman-Leahy amendment.\n  At this time, I also express my admiration for the long efforts of \nthe distinguished chairman and ranking member, and for the efforts of \nthe ranking [[Page S8433]] member when he was chairman, to really \nstructure this. This has been a long road. I think that the balance, \nwhich is so difficult to maintain in this, has been maintained \nthroughout, and I think we are going to be able to get a solid piece of \nlegislation to the conference committee where further improvements can \nbe made.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts. It has been a long road for all of us on our Committee \non Commerce. We have been working veritably about 4 years to revise and \nbring to modern technology the provisions of the 1934 act. The \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts has been a leader in \nparticipating as his staff has worked around the clock. I appreciate \nhis comments.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I inquire of the floor manager, I would \nlike about 3 minutes to speak in opposition to the Simon amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Go right ahead.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1283, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Simon amendment \nwhich would strike language currently in the bill which removes radio \nownership caps. I must say, I do so with reluctance because I have a \ngreat deal of affection and find myself generally in support of my good \nfriend from Illinois when he takes the floor. In this instance, I \nbelieve his concerns are misplaced.\n  Currently, there are approximately 11,000 radio stations in this \ncountry. Unfortunately, far too many are losing money. The last figures \nthat have been called to my attention would indicate that about half of \nthose stations are actually losing money. If we do not take some action \nto help these stations, an increasing number will continue to fail.\n  One way to help radio stations get out of the red is to permit them \nto use economies of scale that they can achieve from consolidating \ntheir operations. Lifting the ownership cap will permit radio stations \nto achieve these efficiencies.\n  When the FCC raised the cap several years ago, we found that, in \nfact, this is what happened. Without ownership caps, economic forces \nwill determine the appropriate size of stations. This, in my judgment, \nis a decision better left to the marketplace instead of some \nGovernment-mandated number.\n  I believe an ownership cap was put on radio stations many years ago \nbecause of the concern for undue concentration. In this day and age, \nsuch a concern, in my opinion, is unwarranted. With the avalanche of \nentertainment sources available to the public today, there is no need \nto worry that a concentration will cause public harm.\n  Cable systems already provide up to 30 channels of digital audio in a \nsingle market under a single owner. Satellite digital audio will soon \nbe able to deliver 60 channels of digital music in every market across \nthe country. Satellite television, like direct TV, now offer 30-plus \nradio channels to homes. This deluge of new entrants into the radio \nbusiness will ensure that competition exists.\n  Extending the artificial restrictions on radio ownership will give \nthe industry the wherewithal to compete against other mass media \nproviders. It is my view that by ending these artificial restrictions, \nwe encourage more competition and give the public greater choice. I \nurge my colleagues to oppose the Simon amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I urge that Senators come to use time on \nthese amendments. We are down to about an hour before the majority \nleader will start us voting, and we are trying to get agreements on \namendments and we are negotiating. If anybody who wants to make a \nspeech, we will make arrangements to speak in general on the bill or on \nan amendment. I urge Senators to come to the floor to finish this bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I ask unanimous consent that I might speak for a period of \ntime not to exceed 7 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bryan pertaining to the introduction of S. 926 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n                           Amendment No. 1298\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, S. 652, as modified by the Dole-Daschle \nleadership amendment, balances reduced regulations with increased \ncompetition. That is exactly what the goal of the chairman has been all \nalong.\n  I think the legislation recognizes that investment in new technology \nis an essential part of developing an advanced telecommunications \ninfrastructure here in the United States.\n  Therefore, S. 652 provides a more stable and reliable business \nenvironment for both cable and television companies by reducing \nregulations and encouraging competition.\n  Mr. President, S. 652, as reported by the Commerce Committee, \nincludes the following:\n  First, maintained the regulation of basic cable rates until there is \neffective competition.\n  Second, redefined the effective competition standard to include a \ntelephone company offering video services.\n  Third, allowed competition from phone companies.\n  Fourth, deregulated upper tier programming, but kept it subject to a \nbad-actor provision. The bad-actor provision allows the FCC to make \nexpanded tier services subject to regulation if rates are unreasonable \nand substantially exceed the national average of rates for comparable \ncable programming services.\n  These provisions were certainly a step in the right direction: away \nfrom regulations and toward more competition.\n  During consideration of S. 652, the Senate adopted the Dole-Daschle \nleadership amendment by a vote of 77 to 8, which included language \naddressing the concerns of those who believe that, despite the \nsafeguards already contained in S. 652, it might lead to unreasonable \nrate increases by large cable operators.\n  It established a fixed rate, June 1, 1995, for measuring the national \naverage price for cable services and only allows for adjustments to \noccur every 2 years. This provision eliminates the possibility that \nlarge cable operators could collude to artificially inflate rates \nimmediately following enactment of S. 652.\n  The bill, as amended, establishes a national average based on cable \nrates in effect prior to the passage of S. 652 when rate regulation was \nin full force.\n  It excluded rates charged by small cable operators in determining the \nnational average rate for cable services.\n  This provision addresses the concerns that deregulation of small \nsystem rates, which was included as part of the Dole-Daschle amendment \nin S. 652, would inflate the national average against which rates of \nlarge cable companies would be measured.\n  It specified that national average rates are to be calculated on a \nper channel basis.\n  This provision ensures that national average is standardized and \ntakes into account variations in the number of channels offered by \ndifferent companies as part of their expanded program packages.\n  It specified that a market is effectively competitive only when an \nalternative multichannel video provider offers services comparable to \ncable television.\n  This provision ensures cable operators will not be prematurely \nderegulated under the effective competition provision if, for example, \nonly a single [[Page S8434]] channel of video programming is being \ndelivered by a telco video dial tone provider in an operator's market.\n  In addition, the leadership amendment also included critical \nprovisions deregulating small cable operators.\n  In short, Mr. President, the reason I have given this explanation is \nthe Dole-Daschle amendment tightened the bad-actor provision on \nexpanded tier services and further limited the definition of effective \ncompetition.\n  This compromise closed any possible loophole that would allow large \ncable operators to unreasonably raise rates. It gave relief to our \nsmall cable companies and maintained the delicate balance struck in S. \n652 of reduced regulations with increased competition.\n  The reason, again, I think it is important that we understand this, \nMr. President, is that the Lieberman amendment puts us back at square \none in this effort to move toward more competition in the cable \nindustry. While it does include language similar to the leadership \namendment that would deregulate small cable operators, the Lieberman \namendment would undermine the competitive objectives of S. 652.\n  The amendment further restricts the national average standard by \nlimiting it to the ``national average rate for comparable programming \nservices in cable systems subject to effective competition.''\n  Mr. President, this is a backdoor route that leads back to the \nrestrictive rate regulation standard similar to what now exists: \nregulating rates that substantially exceed those of companies subject \nto effective competition. It is precisely this standard that has \ncreated the highly bureaucratic regulatory morass that has stymied \ncable television investment, and therefore service to the consumer.\n  As I stated in my opening remarks on this bill last week, I opposed \nthe Cable Act of 1992, and I voted against passage of that bill.\n  Since the enactment of S. 12--that was the Cable Act--I have received \nnumerous complaints from fellow Idahoans who felt that the changes \nresulting from S. 12 worsened, rather than improved, their cable \nservice and cost.\n  In addition, a number of very small independent cable systems in \nIdaho have been in jeopardy as a result of that near closure and have \nbeen forced to pay astronomical costs associated with implementing the \nact.\n  A rural community hardly benefits if it loses access to cable service \nbecause the local small business that provides service cannot handle \nthe burden of Federal regulations. Quite the opposite is true.\n  Competition, not regulation, will encourage growth and innovation in \nthe cable industry, as well as other areas of telecommunications, while \ngiving the consumer the benefit of competitive prices.\n  Mr. President, I would again suggest to my colleagues the importance \nof not losing sight of the ultimate goal of reforming the 1934 \nCommunications Act, which should be to establish a national policy \nframework that will accelerate private sector deployment of advanced \ntelecommunications and information technologies and services to all \nAmericans by opening all telecommunications markets to competition.\n  In addition, working toward the goal will spur economic growth, \ncreate jobs, increase productivity, and provide better services at a \nlower cost to consumers.\n  The balance of reduced regulations with increased competition \ncontained in the provisions relating to cable in S. 652 will lead to \nthe very important goals I just stated.\n  In addition, Mr. President, I am concerned if we continue to restrict \nthe ability of cable companies to obtain capital necessary to invest in \nnew programming and services, we will also be limiting the ability of \ncable companies as competitors to local phone monopolies.\n  Cable companies will require billions of dollars of investment to \ndevelop their infrastructures in order to be competitive providers.\n  The Federal regulation of cable television has restricted the cable \nindustry's access to capital, made investors concerned about future \ninvestments in the cable industry, and reduced the ability of cable \ncompanies to invest in technology and programming.\n  Mr. President, rate regulation will not maintain low rates and \nquality services in the cable industry. Quite the opposite will occur. \nWe have already seen it. Only competition will provide the kind of \nservices that our consumers want.\n  New entrants in the marketplace such as direct broadcast satellites \nand telco-delivered video programming will provide competitive \npressures to keep cable rates low and fit within the framework of the \nmarket. Cable companies are likely to provide the needed competition to \nkeep the telephone local exchange market operating.\n  In short, Mr. President, deregulation of the cable industry is \nessential for a competitive telecommunications market, and it is \nnecessary as the element of S. 652 and the competitive model envisioned \nin this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Lieberman amendment. It is \nnot a step forward. It is a step backward to the industry. It is \nclearly a step backward to the consuming public.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, could I briefly state that I have \nreceived a series of letters--the first of which I became aware of last \nnight, from Time Warner. The first letter stated something that was not \ntrue, and it was sent to various people.\n\n       As discussed with you and your staff, this agreement is \n     entirely contingent on the removal of the program access \n     provisions . . .\n\n  And so forth. That was not true. So last night, I faxed to Timothy \nBoggs a letter stating in part:\n\n       At no time during our conversation did I indicate that any \n     specific action by Time Warner would result in deletion of \n     the program access provisions. I have had no further \n     conversation with HBO/Time Warner about this matter since \n     that meeting. My staff has not portrayed my position as being \n     anything other than the industry negotiations suggested on \n     May 4. Nothing I said during our short meeting could be \n     construed as suggesting some sort of quid pro quo, which \n     would be wrong, if not illegal. I resent the inference in \n     your letter that I suggested something other than an \n     industry-negotiated solution.\n\n  I have this morning obtained a letter from Time Warner saying ``* * * \nthe facts are exactly as outlined in your letter.'' It goes on to say \nthat ``* * * at no point did we seek or reach understanding with you or \nyour staff regarding any change in the legislation.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have these three letters \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  Time Warner,\n\n                                                    June 13, 1995.\n     Hon. Larry Pressler,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Pressler: As you requested, the attached \n     signature page confirms that Home Box Office has reached an \n     agreement with the National Cable Television Cooperative, \n     Inc. for HBO programming. As discussed with you and your \n     staff, this agreement is entirely contingent on the removal \n     of the program access provisions at Section 204(b) of S. 652, \n     prior to Senate action on the legislation.\n       On behalf of Time Warner and HBO, I am pleased to report \n     that we have reached this agreement and respectfully request \n     that this provision be removed from the bill at the earliest \n     possible opportunity. Without removal of this provision from \n     the bill, the HBO distribution agreement with the NCTC will \n     be void.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this matter. Please feel \n     free to contact me if I can be of any assistance to you or \n     your staff. I can be reached at my office at 202/457-9225 or \n     at home at 202/483-5052.\n           Warm regards,\n     Timothy A. Boggs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n           Transportation,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 1995.\n     Mr. Timothy A. Boggs,\n     Senior Vice President for Public Policy, Time Warner, Inc., \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Boggs: Your faxed letter of June 13 contains \n     misleading statements which do not accurately reflect my \n     position.\n       On May 4, 1995, I met briefly with you, Ron Schmidt and \n     HBO/Time Warner executives, in the presence of my staff, \n     regarding the program access provision of S. 652. During that \n     meeting, HBO/Time Warner urged me to support deletion of the \n     program access provisions of the bill.\n       I stated that the program access provision was of enormous \n     importance to small cable operators, including those in South \n     Dakota. I suggested that if the program providers disliked \n     the provision, they ought to negotiate with the small cable \n     operators to reach an agreement which might address the \n     problems this portion of S. 652 is attempting to solve. \n     Specifically, since Ron Schmidt is from my home state, I \n     suggested that he talk to a [[Page S8435]] small cable \n     operator from South Dakota, Rich Cutler, to see if an \n     industry compromise were possible.\n       At no time during our conversation did I indicate that any \n     specific action by Time Warner would result in deletion of \n     the program access provisions. I have had no further \n     conversations with HBO/Time Warner about this matter since \n     that meeting. My staff has not portrayed my position as being \n     anything other than the industry negotiations suggested on \n     May 4. Nothing I said during our short meeting could be \n     construed as suggesting some sort of quid pro quo, which \n     would be wrong, if not illegal. I resent the inference in \n     your letter that I suggested something other than an \n     industry-negotiated solution.\n       Your letter indicates that failure to delete the program \n     access provisions from the bill would vitiate any negotiated \n     agreement HBO/Time Warner had reached with the small cable \n     operators. While HBO/Time Warner is free to negotiate \n     contracts as they see fit, such tactics, in my opinion, \n     cannot be considered as good faith negotiations. Your letter \n     implies that I tacitly approved such a condition, which is \n     not the case.\n       I expect you to send this letter to the same individuals \n     who received your letter to me. Your letter is misleading, \n     and does not accurately characterize my position as presented \n     in my May 4 meeting with HBO/Time Warner.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Larry Pressler,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                  Time Warner,\n\n                                                    June 15, 1995.\n     Hon. Larry Pressler,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter of today. I \n     write to respond and to join you in setting the record \n     straight.\n       First, I am as distressed as you that any statement I have \n     made could be misconstrued or infer anything other than the \n     facts.\n       Second, the facts are exactly as outlined in your letter.\n       Third, at no point did we seek or reach understanding with \n     you or your staff regarding any change in the legislation. \n     Any understanding Time Warner and HBO have reached on this \n     matter has been entirely with our private business \n     associates.\n       Finally, as stated in my letter of June 13, Time Warner has \n     urged that the Senate remove Section 204(b) from S. 652 \n     because we are confident that industry negotiations, by \n     ourselves and others could result in a change of business \n     practices that would make Section 204(b) no longer necessary. \n     Our good faith negotiations have borne out this confidence. I \n     remain pleased to report that HBO and NCTC have reached a \n     distribution agreement.\n       In closing, let me personally apologize for any \n     misunderstanding my letter has caused. I deeply regret this \n     confusion and remain available to discuss this matter with \n     any interested party. As you request, I will distribute your \n     letter of today to the very few people who received a copy of \n     my letter to you of June 13.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Timothy A. Boggs.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the remarks my friend \nand colleague from South Dakota just made. He has had printed in the \nRecord an outrageous letter, an outrageous letter from Time Warner on \nJune 13, addressed to Senator Pressler, chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee. Any lobbyist who would write a letter like this, especially \nwhen it is not true, should make a public apology. And his powerful \nemployer, Time Warner, should do likewise. I am referring to the letter \nof June 13 that the Senator from South Dakota has just entered into the \nRecord.\n  He has also entered in the Record a letter of June 15, which is \nsupposedly an apology from Timothy Boggs for the letter he earlier \nwrote. However, in the letter of June 15, while admitting that his \nprevious letter was in error, and in a way apologizing for it, I do not \nsee anything in the letter that indicates to me that Time Warner may \nnot have had or thought they had a quid pro quo with some other Members \nof the U.S. Senate.\n  What we are talking about here is money, and that is one of the \nproblems with this whole telecommunications bill, in which I have had \nan integral part to play. I want to say Senator Pressler is an \nhonorable man. He is a good and hard-working Member of the Senate and \nhas a very decent staff. He is a friend and a colleague I respect, and \nI congratulate the Senator on his letter to Time Warner and their \nresponse. I object to the action taken by Time Warner and Viacom--two \nof the big giants today--for putting the U.S. Senate in a difficult if \nnot compromising position.\n  Probably nothing else better demonstrates the power of the lobbyists \naround this place, who overreach and overreach and overreach, and get \nnot only themselves but the reputation of this body in some degree of \ndisrepute. There are good and substantive arguments for and against the \ncable volume discount provision in the committee-passed bill. Time \nWarner and Viacom have told the Senate they will give discounts to the \nsmall cable operators, as we had provided for in the bill, if and only \nif, Mr. President--they have not gotten themselves off the hook as far \nas this Senator is concerned--they will agree to these discounts that \nthey never would have thought of had we not incorporated this in the \nbill, and they simply say that if and only if the Senate removes the \nvolume discount language for the small cable operators will they carry \nout their commitment.\n  They still have a quid pro quo and it is wrong. That is why this \nSenator last night objected to any unanimous consent requests that by \nvoice vote we change the committee's position. I will insist on a \nrollcall vote. There may well be good reasons for the Senate to change \nthat provision that came out of the Commerce Committee. Time Warner has \nobviously put all kinds of pressure on the small cable operators around \nthe United States, which they can do. So now we have a situation, as I \nunderstand it, where the small cable operators, whom we wanted to \nprotect to some degree with regard to insisting on some discounts, now \nhave been pressured by Time Warner to appeal to us to eliminate the \nproviso of the bill.\n  I do not want to see the Senate agree to something like that, because \nI think whether we do it knowingly or unwittingly, we place ourselves \nin a position of being influenced when maybe that is not the case.\n  There comes a time when the U.S. Senate, despite money, despite \npower, despite pressure from competing interest groups, has to stand up \nand do what we think is right. Just because of the action of the \nCommerce Committee to provide some measure of relief for the smaller \ncable operators, who by and large are at the complete indirect control \nby the biggies like Time Warner, the little guys are now appealing that \nthe big guys have said they will go along with what we want to do if we \nwill knock it out of the piece of legislation.\n  This has gone way too far. Time Warner and Viacom have taken the \nsmall cable operators hostage, just like hostages are being taken in \nBosnia today. They have taken these little guys hostage and they say, \n``If you will knock this out of the bill, then somehow we will get \nalong.'' I think this is the time to teach Time Warner and every other \nlobbyist--and there are a lot of good lobbyists around this place--that \nthey overstep their bounds. They clearly overstepped their bounds when \nthey wrote the referenced letter I had just cited and which was placed \nin the Record by my friend and colleague, an honorable man, the Senator \nfrom South Dakota, Senator Pressler.\n  I hope we will recognize that Time Warner is attempting to take \nhostages. I think we should say to Time Warner, grab them right by the \nthroat if we have to, and say: Mister, you may be very big and you may \nhave control like no one else has ever had of our entertainment \nindustry, but you cannot control the U.S. Senate.\n  Therefore, I will insist upon a vote and I will be against any kind \nof a voice vote because I think this is the time to teach some of these \nlarger companies that enough is enough. These large companies are \nsaying to the Senate, ``If you do not remove this provision, we will \nnot give fair prices to the small cable operators.'' They are trying to \ntake the U.S. Senate hostage, also. If we, the U.S. Senate, do what \nTime Warner and Viacom want us to do, this type of contingency is \ndangerously close to a quid pro quo. It is not right and is probably \nillegal. The U.S. Senate should not negotiate with hostage takers.\n  Mr. President, because of this tactic, I insist on a rollcall vote on \ntrying to knock out the volume discount provisions. The Senate can work \nits will but I will stick by the committee's provisions.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. EXON. I will be glad to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President I thank the Senator for his clear and \nforceful statement.\n And I share his views. May I say [[Page S8436]] that I am glad he will \ninsist on a vote. If he does not, I will.\n\n  It seems to me--I will have more to say later--that the good work, \nthe efforts, and the many hours and days and weeks and months that the \ncommittee has devoted to this legislation run the risk now of coming to \nnaught, as far as this Senator is concerned.\n  It appears to me that in our efforts to control bigness, bigness is \nweighing in, and I am not going to be impressed by bigness or by money \nor by heavy lobbying.\n  I think this also goes to show we should not have voted for cloture \nyesterday. I voted against cloture. This is a massive bill. It is an \nimportant bill. I am sure it has a lot of good elements in it. But here \nat the last minute, we are under pressure now. Cloture has been \ninvoked. And some kind of an agreement has been entered into to stack \namendments with 2-minute explanations.\n  I thank the distinguished majority leader for including the ``2-\nminute explanation'' in the agreement. I went to him personally \nyesterday and asked him to do that. If there are going to be stacked \nvotes, at least we should have some explanation.\n  But I think this situation should cure us of stacking votes, great \nnumbers of votes with only a minute or 2 minutes of explanation. This \nis the United States Senate where debate is unlimited, unless we invoke \ncloture or enter into time agreements.\n  From now on, I am not going to be very congenial with respect to \nstacking a large number of votes. But to have a string of stacked votes \non a very complicated bill that I do not understand, and I am not sure \nany other Senators will understand what is in this bill by the time \nthis amendment process is completed, to call up amendments, and debate \nthem for only 30 minutes; very complicated amendments; the kind of \namendments that should be offered in committee, or, if they are going \nto be offered on the floor, there ought to be adequate debate so that \nwe all know what we are doing--is going too far, especially if the vote \non final passage is to occur immediately following the disposition of \nthe enumerated amendments.\n  So I thank the Senator for stating that he will insist on a vote, and \nI want to put leadership on notice that in the future this one Senator \nis going to be a little more reluctant to enter into time agreements on \ncomplex matters like this and stack votes, to be followed by the \nimmediate passage of a bill. There seems to be a mindset here that we \nhave to finish any complex bill in 3 days or 4 days. I am not sure that \nSenators ought to be in such a hurry.\n  I am disturbed by the Time Warner letter. It is disturbing. It may be \nthat this will be one of the straws that breaks the camel's back as far \nas this Senator is concerned in respect of the vote on this bill.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, may I have just one second to thank my \nfriend from West Virginia for his usually thoughtful remarks? I \nappreciate them very, very much. As one who has presided over and has \nput the U.S. Senate on course, I think his words are well taken.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I take 3 minutes of my time on my \namendment.\n  I first want to comment on what Senator Byrd just had to say. I think \nin general we can say there are rare occasions when we take too much \ntime on a bill. There are too many occasions when we take too little \ntime on a bill, as far as legislative process.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1283, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SIMON. I would like to just speak very briefly on an amendment \nthat I have in. The present practice of the FCC is to limit radio \nstation ownership by any one entity to 20 AM and 20 FM stations. The \nmost any one entity now has is 27 total. The bill, without my \namendment, takes the cap off completely. My amendment says let us put a \ncap of 50 AM, 50 FM, far more than we have now by any one entity. It is \na 150-percent increase. But let us not move to the day when we have too \nmuch concentration of the media. I think that is not a healthy thing.\n  One of my colleagues speaking against my amendment says this is what \nis happening in the newspaper business. It is. It is not healthy in the \nnewspaper business. But we do not have any control over that. We do \nhave control through Federal licensing of radio stations and \ntelevision. My amendment goes further than some people would want. I \nsay let us increase that 40 limit now to 100. But let us not let anyone \nwho wants control of the radio stations of this Nation to have \nunlimited ability to get those radio stations.\n  I hope my amendment will be approved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, if no one wishes the floor, I question the \npresence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the hour \nof 12:15 p.m., the Senate proceed to a vote on or in relation to the \nMcCain amendment No. 1285, to be followed by a vote on or in relation \nto the Simon modified amendment No. 1283, to be followed by a vote on \nor in relation to the Lieberman amendment No. 1298, with the remaining \nprovisions of last night's consent agreement remaining in place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1285\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 12:15 p.m. having arrived, there \nare 2 minutes--1 minute per side--for discussion of the amendment and \nthen voting will occur on the amendment offered by the Senator from \nSouth Dakota, [Mr. Pressler] for the Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain].\n  The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for the \nMcCain amendment and to vote the other amendments down. The arguments \nhave been made. So I yield back the remainder of my time. I yield back \nall time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1285 offered by the Senator from South Dakota for the Senator from \nArizona. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from Utah \n[Mr. Hatch] would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. My understanding is \nthat before these next two amendments are voted on, the supporters get \n1 minute, and the opposition gets 1 minute to explain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Two minutes are \nequally divided.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, if I may have the attention of my \ncolleagues, the present FCC rule says one entity can own 20 AM stations \nand 20 FM stations, or a total of 40. Right now, the maximum owned by \nany one entity is 27.\n  This bill takes the cap off completely. My amendment says we will put \na cap of 50 AM, 50 FM, a 150-percent increase, but do not take the cap \noff completely.\n  We should not concentrate media ownership in this country. It is not \na healthy thing for the future of our country. I hope Members will \nresist the motion to table my amendment.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will table this \namendment. We voted on this last week in the leadership package, the \nDole - Daschle - Pressler - Hollings package. We voted something like \n78 to 8. This matter has been settled in this bill. It takes apart the \nleadership package. I urge everyone to table it. It is more regulation \nand I ask we proceed.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on the motion to table \namendment No. 1283 offered by the Senator from Illinois [Mr. Simon]. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM (when her name was called).

Mr. President, I move to table amendment No. 1298, and \nI ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order, there are 2 minutes equally \ndivided between the proponents and the opponents of the amendment.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise to speak against the motion to table. I ask my colleagues to \nlisten for these 60 seconds.\n  I usually do not make predictions on the floor of the Senate. But \nbased on my experience in cable consumer protection for more than a \ndecade, I will predict to my colleagues that, if this bill passes \nunamended, most American cable consumers will see significant rate \nincreases in the next couple of years. These rate increases are not \nnecessary. In 1984, Congress removed regulation from cable consumers. \nIt was a disaster. Rates skyrocketed.\n  In 1992, on a bipartisan basis, we came back and put in reasonable \nconsumer protections, and they have worked brilliantly. Rates are down \n11 percent, and the cable companies are thriving, with the highest \nprofit margins in the telecommunications industry, and with a great \nability to continue to raise capital. There is no reason to remove the \nprotections that cable consumers have in this bill.\n  My amendment simply restores a standard of the marketplace saying \nthat no cable company will be regulated unless it charges more than the \naverage in markets where there is effective competition.\n  This amendment is not perfect, but it is all that stands between our \nconstituents and significant cable rate increases every month for the \nnext several years.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to table this \namendment. This amendment is undoing the leadership package, the Dole-\nDaschle package, which we voted on already. The Dole-Daschle package \nand the committee bill will increase competition and will cause \nconsumer rates on cable to go down as more entrants enter the market.\n  I urge that we table this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from South Dakota to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from Connecticut.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1303\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the next item to be taken up is my \namendment No. 1303, which I have offered along with my good friends, \nthe Senator from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, and the Senator from New York, \nSenator D'Amato.\n  This amendment would clarify the resale provisions of section 255 by \nrequiring the Bell companies to make resale service available at prices \nreflecting the actual cost of providing those services or functions to \nanother carrier.\n  The amendment seeks to carry out and really clarify the delicate \nbalance of the bill. It really is just that, an amendment to clarify \nthe relationship of sections 251 and 255. I do believe, however, that \nwe have developed a situation where there is a misunderstanding about \nthe actual terms of my amendment.\n  I might state that when I offered it, I thought it was an amendment \nthat had support. I offered it along with a series of other amendments. \nAs the Senate realizes, all of those amendments have been accepted by \nagreement. There has been no dissension concerning them.\n  I feel it essential this amendment have further study in order that \nit will maintain the delicate balance that this bill requires. I will \nbe a conferee on this bill, and it is my intention to make certain that \nthis subject is called up in the conference.\n  Any amendment clarifying these two provisions would be within the \nscope of the conference, in my opinion, and it is my intention to ask \nthat this amendment be withdrawn at this time.\n  I want my friend from Hawaii to have a chance to make a comment about \nthis before I do, however, because I want to make sure everyone \nunderstands that we are not abandoning this subject, we are going to \npostpone it to the conference in the hope that we will be able to work \nout an amendment there which will have the same success as the other \namendments we have worked on so long, which have been adopted by \nunanimous consent.\n  I yield to my friend from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleague from Alaska in \nassuring all those who support the measure that it is not our intention \nto let it die at this stage. We will most certainly, as conferees, \ninsist that this matter be discussed and, hopefully, we will be able to \nconvince our colleagues in the House and the Senate to adopt it.\n  So, reluctantly but I believe necessarily, I will concur with the \naction that is about to take place.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to the two \nSenators from Alaska and Hawaii. They are two giants of the Senate and \ngiants in our committee. They will both be conferees. They have \nprovided enormous leadership.\n  We just feel, at this time, that we have carefully crafted an \nagreement, and the checklist, and so forth, might come apart.\n So we have decided to delay this discussion until conference. I want \nto pay tribute to both of them being willing to help move this bill \nforward. I thank them very much.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me concur in the statement made by the manager. This is \na controversial area. I think the managers have indicated they are both \ngoing to be conferees. It will be considered at that time, and it is \nwithin the scope of the conference. There is a disagreement, but this \nmay help solve it. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we may \nwithdraw amendment 1303.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendment (No. 1303) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1292\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is amendment No. 1292, \noffered by the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller].\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. On behalf of the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, Senator Rockefeller, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendment (No. 1292) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1341\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question now is amendment No. \n1341, offered by the Senator from South Dakota, Senator Pressler, for \nthe majority leader.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I hope we can turn now to the Heflin \namendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nDole amendment be set aside so we can bring up the Heflin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1367\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I believe this has been cleared by both \nsides. This deals with amendment 1367, which I previously sent to the \ndesk.\n  This deals primarily with a rule, in urban areas, where there is a \nsmall town that has a limited number within the incorporated area or \nthe urbanized area, and has a high percentage of customers in rural \nareas.\n  It is a unique situation in regard to cable systems that have gone \nout beyond the incorporated limits, and they have sold to customers \nthere. That is a pretty expensive type of thing.\n  When they go out, there is not the density on the lines that you have \nin the city. In rural areas, you might have one customer per mile, and \nin the cities you may have 1,200 customers to a mile, or 1,000 \ncustomers to a mile.\n  This sort of takes care of a situation for rural areas. It affects \nthose where I believe there are no more than 20,000 subscribers, and a \nhigh percentage is in urban areas. I move the adoption of this \namendment.\n  Cable systems with less than 20,000 subscribers are extremely \nconcerned that they will be unable to compete with the telephone \ncompanies once they enter the cable business, a very legitimate \nconcern. Because of the very real possibility that they will be run \nover by their local telephone company if the only option is to compete \nhead-to-head, small cable systems would like to have the option to form \na joint venture with their local telephone company or to be acquired by \ntheir local telephone company.\n  The bill as it is currently written would disallow small cable \nsystems in urbanized areas to form joint ventures or to be acquired by \ntheir local telephone company. Due to the broad definition of an \nurbanized area, many small cable systems serving very rural areas will \nbe ineligible to form a joint venture or to be acquired by their local \ntelephone company because they technically fall within the definition \nof an urbanized area.\n  My amendment would allow cable systems in an urbanized area that \nserve a significant number of subscribers in nonurbanized areas to be \neligible to participate in joint ventures or to be acquired.\n  These small cable operators serving a significant number of rural \nsubscribers but who are swept into the urbanized area definition should \nbe given the option of forming joint ventures or of selling to their \nlocal telephone company. Without these options, S. 652 could well force \nmany of them out of business.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from \nAlabama. I know he is leaving the Senate next year. We will miss him.\n  This is a good amendment. We agree to it. I think it will help \nsmaller cities in rural areas. We are prepared to pass \n[[Page S8439]] the amendment. I move we adopt the amendment. I \ncongratulate my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1367) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think one of the remaining two amendments \nis the amendment of the Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. That is the pending question.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1341\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me state very simply the purpose of this \namendment. I do not know anything about all the Time Warner material. \nIt has nothing to do with this amendment. I heard the Senator from \nNebraska. I thought we would be able to accept this amendment, but I \nunderstand he has a problem with it.\n  As I understand it, not being a member of the committee, the current \nbill is tantamount to Government price-setting in the programming \nmarket. The language in the bill would remove programmers from taking \nadvantage of universally accepted marketing practices such as volume \ndiscounts.\n  It seems to me all I am doing is to strike out this section. It \nstrikes a provision of the bill that would have the effect of \nregulating the prices paid by small cable TV companies for programming. \nAnd the intent of the provision was to crack down on those programmers \nwho were gouging small operators. But, unfortunately, it also impacts \non good programmers who did not engage in the price-gouging effort.\n  Finally, small cable TV companies have now negotiated good contracts. \nI have a letter from the National Cable Television Cooperative, Inc., \nand also a letter from Turner Broadcasting, which suggests that \nDiscovery Communications, Black Entertainment Television, and Turner \nBroadcasting support my motion to strike section 204(b). They set forth \nthe reasons:\n\n       Although described as a ``small cable operator'' amendment, \n     section 204(b) would effectively entitle every cable operator \n     to the price charged to the largest cable operator. . . .\n\n  Which was never the intent. So we were just going to take it out. \nThey have now negotiated good contracts.\n  I also include the letter from Turner Broadcasting and the letter \nfrom the National Cable Television Cooperative. Let me quote a part of \nthat.\n\n       We are pleased to report that the National Cable Television \n     Cooperative has reached agreements with Time Warner's Home \n     Box Office Unit, Showtime Network, Inc.'s Showtime and the \n     Movie Channel Services, and Viacom's MTV Network Services. . \n     . . As a result of this important change in circumstances, we \n     no longer believe that the changes to the program access \n     provisions of the Cable Act proposed in Sec. 204(b) of S. 652 \n     are necessary, and we can accept the removal of those \n     provisions from the bill.\n\n  I know the Senator from Nebraska brought in a lot of material on Time \nWarner. I do not have anything to do with that. I do not know anything \nabout Time Warner. I mentioned their name myself a couple of weeks ago \nin Hollywood. So I do not have a dog in that fight. I do not understand \nwhat it is all about.\n  All I am doing is striking out a section that is no longer necessary, \nand it is supported, as I said, by Discovery Channel, Black \nEntertainment Television, Turner Broadcasting, National Cable \nTelevision Cooperative.\n  I will yield the remainder of my time. There may be time in \nopposition.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the two letters be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         National Cable Television\n\n\n                                            Cooperative, Inc.,\n\n                                        Lenexa, KS, June 15, 1995.\n     Hon. Larry Pressler,\n     U.S. Senate, Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science and \n         Transportation, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Pressler: We are pleased to report that the \n     National Cable Television Cooperative has reached agreements \n     with Time Warner's Home Box Office Unit, Showtime Network, \n     Inc.'s Showtime and the Movie Channel Services, and Viacom's \n     MTV Network Services (MTV, VH1, and Nickelodeon). As a result \n     of this important change in circumstances, we no longer \n     believe that the changes to the program access provisions of \n     the Cable Act proposed in Sec. 204(b) of S. 652 are \n     necessary, and we can accept the removal of those provisions \n     from the bill.\n       As you know, other conflicts remain. Despite repeated \n     attempts by the Cooperative, we have failed to conclude \n     master affiliate agreements with many non-vertically-\n     integrated networks which are exempt from existing law.\n       For example, we were recently notified by Group W of their \n     intent not to renew our long-standing contract for Country \n     Music Television. (Originally negotiated by NCTC with CMT's \n     former owners in 1989, prior to CMT's purchase by Group W/\n     Gaylord). Group W has also steadfastly refused to conclude a \n     contract with us for The Nashville Network. The most \n     difficult of many other examples we could cite would be that \n     of ESPN.\n       Please accept our deepest appreciation for lending your \n     support and good offices to bringing about a resolution of \n     this matter which we believe is mutually beneficial to all \n     parties.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Michael L. Pandzik,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., Washington Corporate \n           Office,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: I am writing on behalf of Discovery \n     Communications, Black Entertainment Television and Turner \n     Broadcasting System, Inc., to support your motion to strike \n     section 204(b) of S. 652, the ``Telecommunications \n     Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995.''\n       Section 204(b) would remove the words ``legitimate economic \n     benefits'' from current law, thereby outlawing the volume \n     discounts charged by certain programmers (those with 5% co-\n     ownership with cable systems) even where the volume discounts \n     are economically justified.\n       Although described as a ``small cable operator'' amendment, \n     section 204(b) would effectively entitle every cable operator \n     to the prices charged to the largest cable operator, working \n     substantial economic harm to the affected networks. Moreover, \n     since section 204(b) applies only to some and not all \n     programmers, it would have a very unfair competitive impact.\n       We deeply appreciate your efforts to correct this problem \n     with the bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Bertram W. Carp,\n                               Vice President, Government Affairs.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thought the time was limited. I \nunderstand the time is not limited on this amendment.\n  I would simply say, with respect to the merits, that programmers give \nbig cable operators the volume discounts and not to the small cable \noperators. So, in trying to provide for that universal service and to \nmake sure that it is extended, particularly to the high-cost and rural \nareas, the provision in the bill is that the small cable operators get \nthe similar discounts.\n  With the Dole amendment, that would be removed. There would be high-\nvolume discounts to the big cities, let us say, and higher costs \nthereby and a diminution of universal service to the rural areas of \nAmerica.\n  So, this side would oppose the amendment on the merit itself. There \nis some question in this Senator's mind, without seeing anything \nfurther, on how this amendment came to the floor. With that in mind, \nlet me yield to my colleagues who have come.\n  I understand the distinguished Senator from Iowa wants to talk as in \nmorning business while we are waiting.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, could I just make a statement on the \nprogram access issue? [[Page S8440]] \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Dole \namendment. Coming from a rural, small-city State, I have long been \nconcerned with program access. In fact, in the 1992 cable bill, my main \nreason for supporting it was not the pricing side so much as the \nprogram access side. It is a controversial thing, but I think the \npricing side of it was a mistake but the program access side was a \nnecessary thing.\n  To understand this amendment, or this issue, remember that program \naccess is not something that everybody has. I remember one of our \nREA's, which transmit TV signals by microwave, wanted to get ESPN on \ntheir channel and they could not even get ESPN to return a phone call \nbecause they were too small. So there was a need for program access. \nAnd this amendment is continuing in that tradition. So this is a \nsubject that all of us have worked on for years.\n  The program access portions, I think, of that act have worked at \nleast to help the smaller cities and to help the rural areas where they \ntransmitted by microwave from one farm to the next where it is too \nexpensive for cable lines to run. Nobody will sell those people \nprogramming because it is not worth it financially. There are myriad \ninterests concerned with this issue. I know the Black Entertainment \nNetwork has endorsed this amendment for the same reason, that they are \nvery much in need of program access.\n  There has been much discussion over the program access provisions \ncontained in S. 652. From the beginning of this process, I wanted to \ndeal with the problem which many small operators have faced in being \ncharged higher rates for programming. S. 652's program access provision \nis important to small cable operators, especially those in South \nDakota. Program providers strongly object to this provision. I \nsuggested to the program providers that they work with the small cable \noperators to seek an industry agreement which could make a legislated \nsolution unnecessary. The president of the National Cable Television \nCooperative, Michael Pandzik, the organization that purchases \nprogramming on behalf of the small cable operators, wrote to me that \nthe cooperative has reached agreement on the small cable rates on \nprograms from the major vertically integrated entertainment companies. \nAs a result, I support the amendment by Senator Dole to strike the \nprogram access language change in S. 652.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the amendment.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Chair advise the Senator from Nebraska what is the \npending matter before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending matter before the Senate is \namendment No. 1341, offered by the Senator from South Dakota for the \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair. This is the amendment I had discussed \nearlier in the day. As I understand it, the Senator from South Dakota \nis recommending and has introduced this amendment for the majority \nleader, notwithstanding the discussions that we had earlier in the day \non this specific matter?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I am sorry, would my friend----\n  Mr. EXON. I simply say I want to understand what is being proposed. \nDo I understand the Senator from South Dakota is offering the amendment \nfor the majority leader?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. The majority leader offered it for himself and spoke \nfor it.\n  Mr. EXON. Now you are calling it up for a vote, is that correct?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Yes, if the Senator from Nebraska wishes.\n  Mr. EXON. No, it is fine to have the vote. I am not going to object \nto that. There is no way I can object to a vote.\n  I would simply say to my friend from South Dakota, is he, as the \nleader of the bill, recommending that the Senate vote for the Dole \namendment?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Yes, I am. I have a long tradition of support for \nprogram access. I voted for the 1992 cable bill mainly because of \nprogram access issues. Yes, I am recommending that.\n  Mr. EXON. I would simply say, I think the Senator from South Dakota \nknows this Senator came to the defense of my friend and colleague from \nSouth Dakota earlier because of what I thought was terrible precedent \nsetting with regard to the letters that had been distributed, apologies \ngiven on this whole matter.\n  Notwithstanding the serious objection that the Senator from South \nDakota, I thought, had with regard to the lobbying activities that took \npart on this, notwithstanding that, am I to understand the Senator from \nSouth Dakota is still going to support the measure?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Yes. I have stated my views in my letter. But the \nunderlying substance of this amendment I support.\n  Mr. EXON. Is the Senator saying that while he objects to the way this \nmatter has been handled, the end result, in his opinion, is that it is \ngood for rural areas with regard to receiving television material?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Yes. I gave an example when the Senator was not here of \nsome of my rural telephone co-ops having difficulty getting ESPN. We \nhad to get the Vice President out there. My reason for supporting the \n1992 Cable Act was program access. The substance of the amendment is \ngood for the country, I believe. It is very much in keeping with that.\n  I wrote a letter back to Time Warner regarding that matter and have \nplaced it in the Congressional Record. They wrote me a letter back. The \nNational Cable Television Cooperative group supports it very strongly. \nI have a letter from them. I cited this earlier.\n\n       We are pleased to report that the National Cable Television \n     Cooperative has reached agreements with Time Warner's Home \n     Box Office Unit, Showtime Network, Inc.'s Showtime and the \n     Movie Channel Services, and Viacom's MTV Network Services \n     (MTV, VH1, and Nickelodeon). As a result of this important \n     change in circumstances, we no longer believe that the \n     changes to the program access provisions of the Cable Act \n     proposed in Sec. 204(b) of S. 652 are necessary, and we can \n     accept the removal of those provisions from the bill.\n       As you know, other conflicts remain. Despite repeated \n     attempts by the Cooperative, we have failed to conclude \n     master affiliate agreements with many non-vertically-\n     integrated networks which are exempt from existing law.\n       For example, we were recently notified by Group W of their \n     intent not to renew our long-standing contract for Country \n     Music Television. (Originally negotiated by NCTC with CMT's \n     former owners in 1989, prior to CMT's purchase by Group W/\n     Gaylord). Group W has also steadfastly refused to conclude a \n     contract with us for The Nashville Network. The most \n     difficult of many other examples we could cite would be that \n     of ESPN.\n\n  So, in any event, I think we are all aware of these problems. I \nsupport the substance of the amendment. I disagree with the way Time \nWarner dealt with that particular letter. I wrote them a strong letter \nback, and they wrote me a letter stating my letter was absolutely \naccurate, and they apologized.\n  Mr. EXON. Just so that I understand this, I would like to have my \ncolleague from South Dakota explain a little bit more. As I understand \nit, Time Warner and all these other good folks that control massive \nsections of our entertainment industry were not treating the small \ncable owners in South Dakota and elsewhere fairly, in the opinion of \nthe Senator from South Dakota and the Senator from Nebraska and the \nSenator from South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the Commerce \nCommittee.\n  Therefore, we wrote into the telecommunications bill that was \nreported out of committee language that would have required Time Warner \nand all these other good folks, who were very much concerned about the \npublic interest and public access, and not interested in making money--\nwe wrote that in there to try to force them to treat the subscribers to \ncable in South Dakota and elsewhere fairly.\n  Is that accurate? Is that an accurate reflection of what I thought we \ndid in committee?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I believe that the legislative process here, as it \nmoves forward, is trying to be fair, and different Senators have \ndifferent points of view. Senator Dole has brought his amendment forth \nand has spoken on it, having made the arguments for it. I think the \nSenator's comments are most welcome.\n  I have a long record of fighting hard for program access. The Black \nEntertainment Network has endorsed this effort by Senator Dole. I think \nit is a very good effort.\n[[Page S8441]]\n\n  Mr. EXON. Is it fair to assume that, in the opinion of the Senator \nfrom South Dakota, Time Warner and all these good folks would not have \nmade this arrangement at this very late hour had it not been for the \nactions that we in the Commerce Committee took to address some things \nthat were going on with regard to the way Time Warner and others \ntreated rural areas? Is it safe to assume, in the opinion of the \nSenator from South Dakota, that this grand compromise at the last \nminute would not have been reached had we not taken the action that we \ndid in the Commerce Committee on the telecommunications bill?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. It is hard to say. But let me say that I have for years \nfought hard for program access for smaller cable people, for our rural \npeople, and there is an understanding with the president of South \nDakota East River Electric. We could not get ESPN even to return our \ncalls. Finally, we called the head personnel up in New York and they \nsent a person out, and ultimately Time Warner may be responding to \nthat.\n  The point is that there is a constant battle, trying to balance \nbetween price and program access. The same thing happened when Hubbard \nput up his satellite, DBS. He had a hard time getting program access.\n  All of us on the Commerce Committee, including the Senator from \nNebraska, I am sure, and others, worked on this. That is a key part. \nProgram access is a key part of this whole business. That is what we \nare working on.\n  Mr. EXON. So the Senator from South Dakota cannot confirm my \nsuspicion that the grand compromise being offered by the Dole amendment \nwould not likely have taken place had we not acted in the committee.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. The Senator from Nebraska will have to reach his \nconclusions. Obviously, he has reached some. If an intraindustry \nsolution can be reached, a legislative mandate is not necessary. The \nNCTC has negotiated for small cable, and those intraindustry \nnegotiations will undoubtedly continue.\n  We can reserve the opportunity to restore this language if the \nprogrammers of small cable cannot reach an accommodation in conference. \nMy friend from Nebraska will no doubt be in that conference. So we \nwelcome him.\n  Mr. EXON. I simply say that I will not take any more time on this. \nThere will be others who may want to speak on it.\n  I happen to think this whole proposition is a pretty sorry mess. It \nseems to me that if we approve the Dole amendment, which Time Warner \nand others would like to have, we would simply be saying, regardless of \nyour improper activities, regardless of the letters that you wrote \nwithin the last few days, which I thought was unfair to the Senator \nfrom South Dakota and others, and certainly unfair to the processes and \nworkings, legitimate processes and workings, of the U.S. Senate, then I \nthink it would be entirely proper to vote for the Dole amendment.\n  On the other hand, if you feel as I do that this is kind of a blot on \nthe U.S. Senate, and that if we vote for the Dole amendment we are just \ngoing to be saying to Time Warner and others to come in with your \nstrong-arm lobbying, come in with your accusations in the form of \nletters about Senator Pressler and others, but we are all going to have \none happy ending here now, because we have gotten together in a grand \ncompromise and, therefore, this is a good for everyone.\n  The fact that Time Warner, in my opinion, has taken hostages through \nthe small cable operators that you in South Dakota and myself in \nNebraska, and my colleague from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey, have tried to \nprotect, it seems to me that we in the Senate, if we adopt this \namendment, are winking and saying: You should not have done that, but \nyou are going to get what you want in the end anyway.\n  I urge rejection of the Dole amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me join in the sentiment of the \nSenator from Nebraska. And to elaborate on my previous remark, I just \nquietly said it disturbed me--the process by which this particular \namendment has reached consideration in the U.S. Senate. I figured, as \nthe expression was used earlier, that I did not have a dog in the fight \nbecause I had been shown a letter to the Honorable Larry Pressler, the \nchairman, dated June 13, which has already been included in the Record.\n  I will let my previous remarks be sufficient except that now I am \nshown another letter that is signed by Timothy Boggs, talking of the \nagreement. That letter, being dated June 13, says:\n\n       As you requested, the attached signature page confirms that \n     Home Box Office has reached an agreement with the National \n     Cable Television Cooperative, Inc. for HBO programming. As \n     discussed with you and your staff, this agreement is entirely \n     contingent on the removal of the program access provisions at \n     Section 204(b) of S. 652, prior to Senate action on the \n     legislation.\n       Without the removal of this provision from the bill, the \n     HBO distribution agreement with NCTC would be void.\n\n  I had nothing to do with it, and nothing was addressed to me. I have \nnow sent the staff to look, because these things surface.\n  I have been given another letter, dated June 13, 1995, signed by Mr. \nMark M. Weinstein, with a copy to Senator Bob Dole and Senator Ernest \nF. Hollings. I ask unanimous consent that the letter in its entirety be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 Viacom, Inc.,\n\n                                      New York, NY, June 13, 1995.\n     Hon. Larry Pressler,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you know, at your request, Showtime \n     Networks Inc., a cable programming division of Viacom, has \n     been negotiating in good faith with the National Cable \n     Television Cooperative (NCTC) to reach an agreement regarding \n     carriage of its cable programming services.\n       We are pleased to report that we have reached an agreement \n     between NCTC and Showtime for carriage of our premium cable \n     services. NCTC also requested, just recently, that MTV \n     Networks (MTVN) begin discussions over the basic cable \n     services. Accordingly, MTVN has been negotiating in good \n     faith with NCTC over carriage of the basic cable services. We \n     are committed to continuing to negotiate and hope to reach an \n     MTVN agreement in the near future.\n       We ask for your support in ensuring the adoption of an \n     amendment deleting the volume discount language in S. 652, as \n     previously agreed. Thank you for your assistance in this \n     matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Mark M. Weinstein,\n                                            Senior Vice President.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will read that to make certain that my comments are \nright to the point. This is to Chairman Pressler.\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you know, at your request, Showtime \n     Networks, a cable programming division of Viacom, has been \n     negotiating in good faith with the National Cable Television \n     Cooperative to reach an agreement regarding carriage of its \n     cable programming services.\n       We are pleased to report that we have reached an agreement \n     between NCTC and Showtime for carriage of our premium cable \n     services. NCTC also requested just recently MTV Networks, \n     MTVN, begin discussions over the basic cable services. \n     Accordingly, MTVN has been negotiating in good faith with \n     NCTC over carriage of the basic cable services. We are \n     committed to continuing to negotiate and hope to reach an \n     MTVN agreement in the near future.\n       We ask for your support in ensuring the adoption of an \n     amendment deleting the volume discount language in S. 652 as \n     previously agreed. Thank you for your assistance in this \n     matter.\n\n  Now, it is incumbent on me, Mr. President, and my dear colleagues of \nthe Senate, I can tell you here and now ``as previously agreed,'' by \nMark M. Weinstein--he signs the letter--I can tell you I do not know \nthe gentleman. I have never seen and have never spoken with him. And I \nhave checked with my staff, and we have not had this letter or anything \nelse, have we?\n  It could be that this has been faxed. We are searching the records \nnow because we have been in the Chamber for a week.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If my good friend will yield for a minute.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. As my friend knows, when I discovered that same \nlanguage in the Time Warner letter, I requested immediately a \ncorrection. I wrote a two-page letter, and they sent me not only a \ncorrection but an apology. I think I can obtain the same thing from \nthese folks very quickly, because that is not true.\n[[Page S8442]]\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I understand so. The distinguished chairman is \nabsolutely correct. And I think his letters have been made a part of \nthe Record showing that he had nothing to do with it. The inference is \nnot by the Senator from South Carolina that the Senator from South \nDakota was in any way engaged in this kind of shenanigan. I can tell \nyou here and now the Senate is going to operate not only with the \ncorrection but with the appearance of correct conduct here.\n  I just did not want this to pass. I would have hoped that this \namendment would have not been pursued on the basis of its merits, and I \nhope it will be defeated on the basis of the process so that everyone \nknows you cannot deal this way and get your amendments passed. I just \nthink this reflects on the Senate. I agree with the Senator from \nNebraska. And since my name is on the Weinstein letter and the first I \nhave seen it is here this morning, I wanted to make that record \nabsolutely clear. I hope we kill the amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will be glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. EXON. I would like to ask the managers of the bill, both my \nfriend from South Carolina and my friend from South Dakota, about \nexactly what we are doing here.\n  As I understood the Senator from South Dakota, the chairman of the \ncommittee, he said that if we accept the Dole amendment, it will fix or \ncure the problem that we have with regard to availability for small \ncable operators to get certain types of program from the likes of those \ngood folks, Time Warner and Viacom. Is that right?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No. If you are asking this Senator a question, I can \ntell you my judgment. If this change on the amendment is adopted, then \nthe rates are bound to go up. The bill provides very properly that \nsmall and rural cable television operators get the volume discount.\n  Now, what they want to say is, no, that is going to be stricken, and \nthey are not going to get these volume discounts. Obviously, the price \nis going up on these small entities, and that is going to destroy the \nuniversal service theme of our particular S. 652.\n  Mr. EXON. I would like to ask a reply to my question from the Senator \nfrom South Dakota.\n  Did I understand the Senator from South Dakota to correctly say that \nif we pass the Dole amendment, it is the understanding of the Senator \nfrom South Dakota that we would fix or repair the essential problem \nthat the Senator from South Dakota has recognized is an important \nplayer in including some protection for small cable operators in the \nmeasure that has passed out of his committee? Is the Senator saying he \nthinks that is repaired or fixed with the Dole amendment?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Let me say that I think we should recognize that \nprivate agreements and private negotiations are underway, have been \nunderway, and that is something that goes on in our country.\n  Let me say that I shall seek corrections on these other letters, just \nas I have received a strong correction from the first one.\n  Let me say that if these private negotiations break down or do not \nwork--we are now in a situation where Black Entertainment Network, the \nsmall companies, and so forth, are endorsing these private \nnegotiations. And certainly I prefer private negotiations to Government \nactivity, and that has been something that has been a cornerstone. But \nI have long been a champion of program access for smaller cable owners, \nfor REA's, and I will continue to be so.\n  Also, it is my general observation--by the way, I did not make any \nrequests here of anybody, and we are sort of arguing on two levels here \nbecause I agree with the Senator from Nebraska that the letter sent me \nwas incorrect. I requested that it be corrected, and it was instantly.\n  Mr. EXON. What I am trying to get at, though, Mr. President, it \nobviously is the Senator's feeling----\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If I may conclude, if my friend will yield.\n  Mr. EXON. I am sorry.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Basically, I would prefer that these problems be \nsettled in private negotiations as opposed to being legislated by this \nSenate all the time. But if they cannot be solved, we have the \nconference coming up. There are additional opportunities. I think at \nthe moment the materials read by Senator Dole and myself here indicate \nvery clearly that there are various small companies ranging from the \nNational Cable Television Cooperative onward that are supporting \nSenator Dole's efforts.\n  That is where we stand presently.\n  Mr. EXON. Could I rephrase my question? I took it from the statements \nthat the Senator from South Dakota just made that he is recommending we \naccept the Dole amendment because he believes, with the private \nnegotiations that are going on, the Dole amendment would satisfy or \nsolve the situation as of now, and that is why he has supported the \nDole amendment.\n Is that a fair interpretation of what the Senator from South Dakota is \nsaying?\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. No, the Senator from South Dakota has his own reasons \nfor supporting the Dole amendment. I am supporting the Dole amendment \nbecause we have private agreements that are working these problems out, \nbecause the small cable companies and many other entities such as Black \nEntertainment Network, have supported that concept, that is, as of this \ntime.\n  If problems arise, if the private parties cannot work it out, then \nthe Government should get involved. This is my opinion.\n  I ask my friend from Nebraska, is he opposed to these things being \nworked out privately?\n  Mr. EXON. No, I am not opposed to something being worked out \nprivately at all, except that I am opposed to the concept that nothing \nprivately is worked out until the last minute when changes are made, \nwhich leads me to my next question.\n  It seems to me that what we are seeing is that Viacom and Time \nWarner, and all those other public-minded folks, are now at the last \nminute offering to have private negotiations with some of the smaller \ncable operators that they were not willing to do previously.\n  Let me phrase the question this way: Why would it not be wise to \nleave the amendment as it came out of committee in place and not adopt \nthe Dole amendment? Am I to understand that unless we adopt the Dole \namendment under the pressure and under the unsavory acts that I think \nhave taken place in the last few days, that unless we can accept the \nDole amendment that negotiations will break down?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I think the Senator from Nebraska is tying things \ntogether here more than I would, in the sense that if one group of \nlobbyists behaves in a certain way, that does not mean that the \nunderlying substance is changed.\n  It is my strong feeling, and I have been on this same subject for \nyears, that program access is a very important thing. Sometimes it is \nnegotiated privately. For example, we have ESPN involved privately, \nwithout a law. I always prefer to do something in the free enterprise \nsystem privately than with a Government law, with a Government \nregulation. That is what we are talking about.\n  I do not know what more to say to the Senator from Nebraska, except \nthat I feel that the Dole amendment is a very positive thing.\n  Mr. EXON. Just let me add, I could not disagree more with my friend \nand colleague from South Dakota. I happen to feel that we have a gun to \nour heads and probably a gun to the heads of the small cable operators, \nwhere all those good folks I mentioned before, Viacom and those other \npublic-minded nonprofit operations, have a gun to the heads of the \nsmall cable operators and, as part of that, they are taking the United \nStates hostage.\n  It seems to me----\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If the----\n  Mr. EXON. I have the floor. It seems to me it would be much better to \nleave the measure as it is in hand and let them continue their \nnegotiations. I point out again that I think anyone who understands the \nprocess knows we would not have had the Dole amendment had we not had \naction taken by the Senator from South Dakota, myself and others that \nforced their hand. It seems to me that we have forced their hand to try \nand give the small cable operators a decent chance. Now they are coming \nto us saying, ``We will give them the decent chance, maybe, if you \ndon't pass the law.'' I think that is [[Page S8443]] putting the cart \nbefore the horse, but I have nothing further to say on the matter at \nthis time.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I have the highest regard for my friend \nfrom Nebraska, and I have said so on this floor many times. He is a \ngiant in this Senate and on our committee.\n  I was watching Harry Truman's life story on TV the other night on \n``Biography.'' He was trying to settle the rail strike, I believe. He \nwas speaking to Congress with proposed legislation when one of his \nSecretaries handed him a note, and he said that the parties have \nprivately begun to negotiate and are going to arrive at a private \nsettlement and he withdrew his legislation, or he lessened his \nlegislation.\n  Many criticized him. They said, ``Well, Harry Truman is a little too \nflexible, he is not standing as he said he would.''\n  I like to read about Harry Truman. I found this a very interesting \nepisode. And I am certainly not comparing myself to Harry Truman. I \nthink he was a man of enormous stature.\n  Analogously in the same case, private agreements are coming into \nplace, and if we get letters from the various groups, small cable and \nBlack Entertainment Television, and so forth, why would we have \nGovernment regulation at that point, just for the sake of having it? A \nlot of times parties negotiate, realizing that down the road if they do \nnot, there is going to be a problem. Certainly, there is that \ninteraction.\n  So, in conclusion, I say I have great regard for my friend from \nNebraska, but I think we are talking about two separate things here. I \nstrongly support the Dole amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \nspeak and vote against the Telecommunications Competition and \nDeregulation Act of 1995. I am deeply disappointed that I am not able \nto speak and vote in favor of it. For the past 10 years, I have been \narguing for a radical overhaul of our telecommunications laws. They \nhave not been changed significantly in the past 60 years, a time of \nunprecedented, breathtaking and, for many of us, I must confess, nearly \nincomprehensible change in the technologies of communication.\n  The short description of what has happened in the past six decades \nsince the 1934 Communications Act was passed is this: The need to \ncontinue monopoly franchises and the line of business restrictions has \nevaporated. The heat which turned the water of our law into steam is \ntechnology. Our laws have been overrun by changes in technology. \nFailure to acknowledge this and to liberate the businesses to compete \nhas been detrimental to the consumer. Thus, the time for rewriting the \npeople's law is long overdue.\n  However, Mr. President, technology does not have a vote, people do, \nand the American people have a love-hate relationship with technology. \nThey love it when it entertains or amuses, but they hate it when \namusement turns violent, pornographic or threatening.\n  They love it when they have the skills needed to survive the \ndownsizing chain saw but hate it when a lifetime of dedication to doing \na job well ends with a pink slip.\n  Not only do the American people have mixed feelings about technology, \nbut the attitude of the people and the attitude of corporations toward \ntechnology is decidedly different.\n  Successful communication corporations must follow technology wherever \nit takes them. Successful communication corporations treat technology \nas if its status were somewhere between King and God. As people, we \nhave learned the hard way that to worship technology is to select a \ngraven image with a double-edge potential of doing grave harm and great \ngood.\n  All of this is said, Mr. President, to put a brake on the wild and \nwoolly expressions of enthusiasm for the glory of these new \ntechnologies. No doubt they can serve us well, no doubt they can expand \nour reach and improve our capacity to produce, to learn and to govern \nourselves. However, there is also no doubt they can lead us astray if \nwe do not think carefully about where we want to go.\n  We, the people, in our minds and our hearts, must drive these new \ntechnological wonders, or, most assuredly, they will drive us.\n  Regrettably, the rewriting of our law we have witnessed has created \nthe perception that this was not paramount in our deliberation. Indeed, \nthe amendment before us now reinforces that perception. The perception \nis that the law was not done for or by the people of the United States \nof America. The perception has been created that it was done by and for \nthe telecommunications corporations of America. Rather than being a \nContract With America, this legislation looks like a contract with \ncorporations.\n  This is one reason Americans feel they have no power over their \nGovernment. Indeed, despite the scope of its impact on their lives, \nAmericans neither asked for this bill, nor do many of them even know we \nengaged in this debate.\n  To be clear, I have nothing against corporations, or the people who \ntemporarily run them. Indeed, most Americans work for a corporation. \nHowever, corporations--particularly public corporations--are not \npeople. Incorporation is a charter granted by the people's laws to an \norganization, usually for the purpose of ensuring perpetual life and \nproviding many of the beneficial powers of an individual, like entering \ninto contracts, buying and selling property, while shielding the \norganizations from many of the detrimental liabilities of being an \nindividual, such as conscience and public responsibility.\n  Public corporations provide first for shareowners and investors. If \nthe analysts say that a CEO did the right thing by laying off 10,000 \nemployees with no severance pay, health care, or retirement, then a CEO \nwould be judged incompetent not to make this move. If plant closings \nand downsizing are judged to be sound business decisions, the market \nwill bid up the value of the stock and the salary of the responsible \nCEO. If selling products that turn America into a society of efficient \nplayers of electronic games and selectors of video programs is good for \nbusiness, then a corporate board would fire any CEO whose conscience \ninterfered with the need to produce revenue.\n  This is not to say the managers of the leading telecommunications \ncompanies--who must be given credit for crafting and enacting this \nlegislation--are heartless. They are not. This is not to say they are \nnot concerned about the future of America or the quality of life in our \ncountry. They are. Nor does it mean that America does not benefit when \ntough-minded business executives make tough-minded business decisions. \nWe do.\n  However, it is to say that we should take care when corporations \nappeal for changes in the law on eleemosynary grounds. When they tell \nus the new law is going to be good for America and American consumers, \nwe should take care to remember who it is that butters their bread: \ntheir share owners. And we should take care and remember who butters \nours: American consumers, citizens, and voters.\n  Over and over in this debate, we heard the phrase, ``We have struck a \ndelicate balance between the various corporate interests,'' used in \ndefense of a specific provision. Over and over when changes were \nproposed which would have given consumers and citizens some protection, \nthis ``balancing of corporate concern'' was raised as a barrier.\n  Regrettably, this has resulted in a law which will not guarantee that \nAmerican households will have robust, competitive choices which would \nhave ensured lower prices and higher quality. Regrettably, this law \ngives the power to those monopolies who already have the power to \ncontrol the market and who will give consumers two choices: Take it or \nleave it.\n  The regret I feel is a child of lost opportunity. We have lost an \nopportunity to seize a three-part promise. The promise I see with the \ntechnologies of communication is to create jobs, improve the \nperformance of America's students, and strengthen democracy by helping \nour citizens become better informed. And while this legislation will \nundoubtedly produce some gains in all three areas, narrow corporate \nconcerns prevented us from doing all that was possible. [[Page S8444]] \n  The regret I feel, as well, is also a consequence of believing that \ntelecommunications is much more than just another business. \nTelecommunications defined is to communicate across a geographical \nspace, across distances. Communication defined is one human being \ntelling a story or delivering information to another. To communicate is \nto define what it means to be a human being.\n  We are not just deregulating another business with this law. We are \nderegulating businesses which have been granted the right to control \nwhat we read, hear, and see. They decide what is news and what stories \nare worth telling. When it comes to defining who we are as people, it \nis not an exaggeration to suggest that these businesses are as powerful \nan influence as parents or religious leaders or teachers.\n  What are the flaws of this bill which cause me to withhold an \naffirmative vote? The most important occurred before we started writing \nthe legislation. The most important flaw was our attitude. We worried \ntoo much about liberating businesses and not enough about liberating \npeople.\n  As a consequence, we made a crucial error when we wrote the law. The \nmost important flaw is that we did not give the Antitrust Division of \nthe U.S. Department of Justice a determinative role in ensuring that \nrobust competition occurs at the local level before allowing the \nmonopoly to enter other lines of businesses. Competitive choice means \nthat households have the power to tell a company they do not like the \nprice or quality of the service. Consumers must be able to buy from \nsomeone else before they have real power over the seller.\n  Substituting a checklist for the Antitrust Division of the Department \nof Justice is not an equal trade. A corporation could easily satisfy \nthe checklist without giving the consumer competitive choice. And \nwithout competitive choice, this law will concentrate power away from \nthe consumer.\n  Last year, under the leadership of Senator Hollings of South \nCarolina, the Senate Commerce Committee reported a bill I could have \nsupported. All but two members of the committee voted for a bill which \ngave the Department of Justice this determinative role. Unfortunately, \nin the distance and time traveled from November 8, 1994, to June 15, \n1995, the law was changed, and I can no longer support it.\n  Why is it so important, Mr. President, to American consumers to have \nthe Department of Justice with a determinative role? The answer can be \nfound by following one of the most frequently used arguments in support \nof this bill: Consumers benefited when AT was forced to compete in \n1982. Well, guess who was responsible for forcing them to compete? Was \nit the Congress? Was it the Federal Communications Commission?\n  Listening to the arguments against the Department of Justice role, or \nlooking at the law itself, you might assume that the answer would be \nthat Congress or the FCC made them compete. If you did, Mr. President, \nyou would be wrong. It was the Antitrust Division of the Department of \nJustice that sued AT It was the Antitrust Division of the Department \nof Justice that forced AT to compete. It was the Antitrust Division \nof the Department of Justice that should be given credit by consumers \nfor the lower prices and higher quality service in long distance.\n  Neither Congress nor the Federal Communications Commission had the \nguts or the power to take on AT So I guess it should not be \nsurprising that under the banner of competition and deregulation, we \npass a law that perpetuates the power of the monopolies.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is not without merit. It will help \nAmerica's schools and America's school children take advantage of the \ntechnologies information age by ensuring affordable infrastructure, \nconnectivity, and rates. It does preserve the goal of universal service \nfor all of America's communities. It does encourage some competition by \nsmaller carriers at the local level through joint marketing, a strong \nsection favoring network interoperability and good interconnection and \nunbundling requirements in section 251.\n  It contains strengthened provisions for rural customers: Comparable \nservices at comparable rates; geographic toll rate averaging; evolving \nnational definition of universal service; support for essential \ntelecommunications providers; waivers and modifications of \ninterconnection requirements for rural telephone companies, and \ninfrastructure sharing.\n  We fought for and succeeded in including in the law some protections \nfor consumers including the prohibition of cable/telco joint ventures \nand buyouts except in rural markets of 50,000 or less,\n allowing State regulators to consider profits of telephone companies \nwhen using rate regulation methods other than rate of return, ensuring \nthat price flexibility should not be used to allow revenues from \nnoncompetitive services to subsidize competitive services, and \nprotecting ratepayers from paying civil penalties, damages, or interest \nfor violations by local exchange carriers.\n\n  With all of these good things, Mr. President, I regret the absence of \na Department of Justice determinative role all the more. With the \nDepartment of Justice ensuring competition, consumers would not have to \ndoubt that they would have a courageous, procompetitive Federal force \non their side. Without it, we must trust that the corporations will do \nthe right thing.\n  Mr. President, this legislation burdens trust too much. Ultimately \nthis bill is about power. The bottom line is that in this case, \ncorporations have it and consumers do not. Accordingly, I must vote \n``no''.\n  Some things have been said in the heat of debate about the Department \nof Justice and the Antitrust Division that just are not true, and I \nwould like to take this opportunity to correct the record.\n  For example, it has been said that the Antitrust Division has 800 or \n900 attorneys. It has been said that it has several hundred lawyers \nacting as regulators. The fact is that the Antitrust Division had 323 \nattorneys total--to carry out all of its responsibilities--at the end \nof fiscal year 1994. This number is about 30 percent lower than the \nnumber of attorneys the Antitrust Division had in 1980 and is about \nequal to the number that it had more than 20 years ago during the Nixon \nadministration, when the economy was much smaller, less global and less \ncomplex and when antitrust enforcement was less challenging.\n  When we talk about growth of bureaucracy, we certainly cannot \nreasonably mean the Antitrust Division. The Antitrust Division has for \nyears been doing what we now ask of all Government agencies--carrying \nout vital missions more effectively, more efficiently and with fewer \nresources. With its relatively limited number of attorneys, the \nAntitrust Division has pursued vigorously criminal enforcement of the \nantitrust laws, a strong merger review program, civil antitrust \nenforcement and all of its other responsibilities.\n  It has been said that DOJ has failed to comply with a court order to \nreview MFJ waiver requests within 30 days. The fact is that Judge \nGreene in 1984 issued instructions regarding how DOJ should handle \nspecified waivers then pending and established a schedule under which \nDOJ had 30 days to handle those specific waivers. Those waivers, \nincidentally, were far less complex and sensitive than the waivers \npending today. DOJ complied with that order and has fully complied with \nall schedules set by Judge Greene.\n  It has been said that DOJ has refused to conduct triennial reviews. \nIn 1989, while the appeal of the first triennial review was still \npending--it would not be finally resolved until 1992--Judge Greene gave \nDOJ complete discretion whether and when to file any subsequent \ntriennial reviews.\n  He noted that the need for triennial reviews was not as great as had \nbeen anticipated when originally conceived. As it turned out, Judge \nGreene observed, there had been ``a process of almost continuous review \ngenerated by an incessant stream of regional company motions and \nrequests dealing with all aspects of the line of business \nrestrictions.''\n United States versus Western Electric Co., slip op. at 1, July 17, \n1989, [emphasis added]. Judge Greene pointed out that he had \n``repeatedly considered broad issues regarding information services, \nmanufacturing, and even long distance.'' Id. He explained that ``as \nsoon as there is a change, real or imaginary, in the in- \n[[Page S8445]] dustry or the markets, motions are filed and all aspects \nof the issue are reviewed in dozens of briefs.'' Id. at n.2. Further \ntriennial reviews thus would have been duplicative of work that was \nalready being done.\n  Judge Greene's observations are still valid. Over the life of the \nMFJ, incredible as it sounds, the Bell companies have filed an average \nof one waiver request every 2 weeks. They have buried the Department of \nJustice in an avalanche of paper--something never expected when the MFJ \nwas entered. Now, some say they are ``shocked, shocked'' that the Bells \ndo not expeditiously receive the approval they claim their requests \nmerit.\n  And in fact, what amounts to a triennial review is underway right \nnow, as DOJ investigates a motion pursued by three Bell companies to \nvacate the entire decree without any of the safeguards in S. 652, even \nin States where local competition is still illegal. This investigation \nwill be completed in the next few months, with a report that will \nprovide a comprehensive review of the need for continuing the line of \nbusiness restrictions.\n  It has been said that the Bell companies' so-called generic request--\nthat is, a consolidated request joined by all the Bell companies--for a \nwireless waiver is still awaiting action. In fact, Judge Greene has \napproved that request.\n  A colleague referred to that wireless waiver as simple. It was not. \nThe initial request was very broad. It attracted a tremendous amount of \ncomment and concern at the outset and each time it changed \nsubstantially. And change it did--it went from a very broad waiver to \none carefully tailored and conditioned to protect competition. The long \ndistance companies and the Bell companies disagreed with DOJ's ultimate \nrecommendation to Judge Greene. That is not unusual. But Judge Greene \nadopted most of the provisions that DOJ recommended. DOJ exercises its \nresponsibility by doing what is best for competition, not what one \nindustry or another prefers.\n  It has been said that DOJ has not acted on a request for a waiver \nthat would allow the Bell companies to offer long distance service in\n connection with information services. In fact, DOJ has recommended to \nJudge Greene that he approve the request, as modified after extensive \nnegotiations between DOJ and the Bell companies.\n\n  The case of the information services waiver illustrates how any \npurported delay in resolving waiver requests relates to the overbreadth \nof the original Bell companies' requests. Much of the time between the \nfiling of the initial waiver and DOJ's recommendation in favor of a \nheavily modified waiver occurred after DOJ rendered a decision based on \nthe original waiver and informed the Bell companies that it would not \nsupport the waiver.\n  The details of the information services case are worth recounting at \nsome length, because they belie some of the charges that have been \nleveled over the past several days.\n  In 1987, DOJ asked Judge Greene to eliminate the restriction on the \nBell companies' provision of information services. DOJ did so over \nintense opposition from the information services industry, because of \nDOJ's conclusion that eliminating the restriction would promote \ncompetition in the information services market. But DOJ's focus was on \ncompetition and consumers. DOJ was not trying to protect vested \nindustry interests or some role as a regulator. DOJ's position was \ninitially rejected by Judge Greene, but after a reversal and remand by \nthe Court of Appeals, the information services restriction was removed \nin 1992.\n  While seeking to lift the information services restriction, DOJ did \nnot support authorizing the Bell companies to bundle interexchange \nservice with their information services. The reason for this is that \nthere is no clear distinction between information services and \nconventional telephone services. The FCC has been struggling for nearly \ntwo decades to define and enforce such a distinction in its Computer I, \nComputer II, and Computer III proceedings, which have tried to \ndistinguish between basic services--including interexchange voice \nservices--which are regulated, and enhanced services--or information \nservices--which are unregulated. This has been one of the most \nprolonged and difficult proceedings in the history of the FCC.\n  Because there is no clear distinction between information services \nand basic services, a decision to allow the Bell companies to bundle \ninterexchange services would substantially eliminate the core MFJ \nprohibition against their provision of interexchange service. The Bell\n companies tried to argue in court that the court's decision to lift \nthe information services restriction meant that they could engage in \nsuch bundling, without any restrictions or safeguards. This \ninterpretation by the Bell companies would have given them much more \nfreedom than S. 652 proposes to do today. But that argument was firmly \nrejected by DOJ, Judge Greene and a unanimous panel of the Court of \nAppeals.\n\n  Judge Silberman of the Court of Appeals concluded that the Bell \ncompanies ``urge a rather strained interpretation of the language of \nthe decree--The Bell companies' interpretation--it seems rather \nobvious, would create an enormous loophole in the core restriction of \nthe decree.'' 907 F.2d 160, at 163\n  Against this background, the Bell companies filed a waiver request in \nJune 1993 that would have allowed them to bundle their information \nservices with interexchange service. In doing so, they again sought to \ncreate what Judge Silberman had described as an enormous loophole in \nthe interexchange restriction. In effect, they would have been able to \noffer interexchange service without the safeguards that are required by \nS. 652.\n  The Bell companies' waiver request naturally provoked strong \nopposition from the interexchange carriers and information services \nproviders. DOJ gave the Bell companies an opportunity to respond to the \narguments against their waiver, and the Bell company responses were \nfiled in February 1994. After reviewing the Bell companies' arguments \nand the many arguments that had been submitted in opposition to the \nrequest, the DOJ told the Bell companies that it would not support the \nwaiver request. The Bell companies were free at that time to challenge \nthe DOJ decision in court. But presumably because they recognized that \nthey had little chance of winning in the face of a clear decision by \nthe Court of Appeals, the Bell companies chose to narrow their original \nwaiver request to seek a more reasonable waiver.\n  The Bell companies submitted a somewhat narrower proposal to DOJ soon \nthereafter. DOJ again rejected the proposal, because it still did not \ndeal with the loophole that the Court of Appeals had identified.\n  The Bell companies finally submitted a third proposal that was \nsubstantially narrower. This time, DOJ indicated that it would support \nthe proposal. This last proposal has now been briefed and is awaiting \ndecision by Judge Greene.\n  The reason for the delay in processing this waiver was that the Bell\n   companies submitted--not once but twice--a waiver request that was \nvery broad. Their proposal would have resulted in an enormous loophole \nin the core restriction of the MFJ. As a practical matter, this \nloophole would have given them much of the relief that S. 652 would \ngive them, but without any of the safeguards that accompany such relief \nin S. 652. It does not make sense to criticize the Department of \nJustice for refusing to give the Bell companies what the authors of S. \n652 certainly do not intend to give them in S. 652.\n\n  DOJ acted to protect competition and consumers. When DOJ supported \nthe removal of the information services restriction in 1987, it did so \nover strong opposition from the information services industry. DOJ's \nsupport for the recent information services waiver has been strongly \nopposed by the interexchange carriers and by information services \nproviders. DOJ isn't protecting industry turf; it's doing what's right \nfor competition.\n  As the information services case demonstrates, the Department always \nhas been willing to take the time to work with the Bell companies to \nfix waiver requests so that the Bell companies can get as much MFJ \nrelief as is consistent with the consent decree's protection of \ncompetition in markets that the Bell companies seek to enter. Of the \nwaivers approved by the Court in 1993-94 that were not mere duplicates \nof waivers filed by another Bell company, fully 60 percent were the \nproduct of negotiations between DOJ and the Bell companies that \nresulted in \n[[Page S8446]] a modification of the original waiver request.\n  To be sure, these complex, negotiated requests generate a lot of \npublic comment and concern. The number of comments per waiver for \nwaivers filed in 1993-1994 is nearly six times the comments per waiver \nin 1984-1992. This is not surprising, as the more recent waivers go to \nthe MFJ's core restrictions. This modification and comment process \nworks to obtain workable waiver proposals while still protecting \ncompetition, as the information services case illustrates.\n  The fundamental point is that DOJ acted to protect competition and \nconsumers. DOJ's support for the revised information services waiver \nhas been strongly opposed by long distance and information services \nproviders. But again, DOJ doesn't protect industry turf--it does what \nis right for competition.\n  Of course, no discussion of purported delay in the waiver process \nwould be complete without noting the Bell companies' filing of\n overlapping and duplicative waiver requests. For example, several Bell \ncompanies filed a request to vacate the MFJ, seeking to completely \neliminate its restrictions without replacing those restrictions with \nany safeguards or requirements, such as those contained in S. 652. Once \nagain, the Bell companies sought relief that the Congress likely would \nnot approve. The Bell companies argued that this motion was critically \nimportant to them, and urged prompt action on it. DOJ agreed that it \nwould make this request its first priority.\n\n  But less than a week after submitting the request to vacate the MFJ \nentirely, one of the companies filed a separate waiver request for so-\ncalled out-of-region relief. But that request is completely subsumed in \nthe motion to vacate. And the other Bell companies that had filed the \nsweeping motion to vacate the MFJ apparently delayed and stalled in \nproducing documents that DOJ required in order to evaluate the merits \nof the motion.\n  The AirTouch story that has been repeated during this debate is also \nnot nearly as simple as has been suggested. Loosely casting aspersions \non the independence and integrity of the Department of Justice in \nrelation to its position on the AirTouch matter is deeply wrong. DOJ \nhas enforced the terms of the MFJ through Republican and Democratic \nadministrations of vastly different ideologies.\n  The Department has explained its position on the AirTouch matter in a \nletter to House Commerce Committee Chairman Bliley. Regardless of what \none thinks of the merits, the bottom line is that the Department has a \nresponsibility under existing law to uphold the terms of the MFJ that \ndiffers from that of Congress, which can write new laws. I will include \nthat letter in the Record.\n  It has been said on the Senate floor that DOJ has repudiated the \nVIII(C) test of the MFJ through the Ameritech plan, which I have \nsupported since Ameritech introduced its Customers First program. The \nAmeritech Plan is completely consistent with the standard established \nby Section VIII(C) of the MFJ, because it builds on the idea that one \npossible basis for satisfying VIII(C) is if the development of local \ncompetition removes the ability of the Bell company to use the local \nmonopoly to hurt competition in long distance. I encourage colleagues \nto read the Department's Ameritech brief, which the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina put in the Record a few weeks ago.\n  The plan does not preclude Ameritech or any other Bell company\n   from seeking VIII(C) relief in spite of the continued existence of \nthe local monopoly. In fact, DOJ has supported numerous waiver requests \nwhere--in spite of the existence of the local monopoly--safeguards or \nother constraints ensured that there was no substantial possibility \nthat the Bell company could use the local monopoly to impede \ncompetition in the market it sought to enter. Most recently--and after \nit outlined the approach of the Ameritech plan--DOJ supported the Bell \ncompanies' request for a waiver to provide long distance service in \nconnection with information services.\n\n  It has been said that DOJ forced the Ameritech plan on Ameritech. In \nfact, the Ameritech plan originated with Ameritech itself. The plan now \nenjoys an unprecedented breadth of support among interested parties. It \nis supported by a Bell company, AT, Sprint, other long distance \ncompetitors, local competitors like MFS, consumer groups, the FCC, \nstate regulators from all the States in Ameritech's territory, the \nRepublican governor of Illinois and numerous other industry \nparticipants. In joint comments filed with the court in support of the \nplan, which I will include in the Record, the regulatory commissions \nfrom Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Wisconsin praised the proposal as a \ndecisive step toward the goal of a competitive telecommunications \nmarket. This remarkable consensus is a lot more than S. 652 has \nattracted, and I commend Ameritech for taking this historic step.\n  DOJ has been criticized in this debate because the draft Ameritech \norder is 40 pages long. Forty pages doesn't seem like too much, when \none considers that the order seeks to do something that has never been \ndone before by anticipating the opening of a complex, monopolized \nmarket to competition and allowing a Bell company to enter a long \ndistance market measured in the billions of dollars. But this criticism \nis especially ironic because it comes in a debate over a bill that \nseeks to do much the same thing as the Ameritech proposal--but that is \nsome 150 pages long and getting longer as we speak. And while this 150-\npage bill has been the subject of much debate--to say the least--the \n40-page Ameritech order enjoys unprecedented support from a broad array \nof interested parties.\n  It has been said that the Ameritech plan will shift power from State \nand Federal regulators to the Department of Justice. In fact, the \nimplementation of the market opening provisions agreed to by Ameritech \nwill be handled by State regulators and industry participants. The \nDOJ's\n role is to assess the end result: the marketplace effects of those \nmarket opening provisions.\n\n  The plan fully preserves the traditional functions of State and \nFederal regulators, as evidenced by the fact that the plan enjoys the \nsupport of all the State regulatory commissions in Ameritech's region \nand of the FCC. Moreover, the plan has the sort of safeguards and \nstandby authority for DOJ that are well suited to an untried and \ngroundbreaking initiative.\n  I have here, Mr. President, a letter to Assistant Attorney General \nBingaman from Craig Glazer, the chairman of the Ohio Public Utilities \nCommission. Writing on behalf of all the State regulatory commissions \nin the Ameritech region, he praises the Department of Justice for its \nefforts in negotiating the Ameritech plan. Mr. Glazer writes, in part, \nthat ``the willingness of the Department of Justice to work with and \nspecifically accommodate a number of State concerns represented an \nexemplary level of cooperation and teamwork between the Department and \nthe State commissions.'' I will include the entire letter in the \nRecord.\n  The point that comes through loud and clear from this letter and from \nthe briefs that State officials have filed with Judge Greene in support \nof the Ameritech plan is that DOJ is not trying to displace regulators \nor become a regulator itself. Governor Edgar of Illinois, for example, \nlauded ``the Proposed Order's reliance on State regulators to \ncomplement the Department's supervisory role of the proposed trial.'' I \nwill conclude Governor Edgar's comments in the Record. DOJ has proposed \na well-crafted plan that maintains the traditional roles of all \ninvolved agencies. The State regulators and the FCC regulate; the \nDepartment of Justice assesses competition.\n  Mr. President, this bill deals with complicated issues, and there is \na lot of room for reasonable people to disagree. But a lot of the \nthings said about the Department of Justice were just plain wrong. I \nappreciate this opportunity to correct the record.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the letters and other \nmaterial printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             [[Page S8447]] Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                           Antitrust Division,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 31, 1995.\n     Re AirTouch Communications, Inc.\n\n     Hon. Thomas J. Bliley,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, House of Representatives, \n         Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bliley: Thank you for your letter of January \n     27, 1995 concerning the status of AirTouch Communications, \n     Inc. (``AirTouch'') under the Modification of Final Judgment \n     (``MFJ'') in United States v. Western Electric, Co., Inc. I \n     appreciate your interest in this matter, and I understand \n     that this issue has significant implications for AirTouch and \n     perhaps other cellular telephone companies.\n       As I will explain, the Department's recent action \n     concerning AirTouch's status under the MFJ does not reflect a \n     decision about the important competition policy issues to \n     which your letter refers. We fully agree with you on the \n     importance of those policy questions, and look forward to \n     working with you to resolve them. As you know, I testified \n     before a subcommiteee of the Committee on Commerce last year \n     in favor of comprehensive telecommunications legislation \n     based on competitive principles.\n       The only competition policy issue with respect to this \n     AirTouch matter is whether we are willing to work with \n     AirTouch on an appropriate waiver of the applicable MFJ \n     provision--and you should know that we offered to do so \n     before announcing our decision on the complaint that prompted \n     our review of this matter. AirTouch did not accept that \n     invitation.\n       I provide additional background below in response to your \n     letter, including the respective roles of the Department and \n     court under the MFJ on questions such as the AirTouch issue; \n     the benefits to competition and consumers from the MFJ: the \n     Department's reasoning and position on the AirTouch matter; \n     and the Department's cooperation with AirTouch to facilitate \n     court action now.\n\n\n                  the department's role under the mfj\n\n       First, let me put our role under the MFJ in context. As you \n     know, the MFJ is a court decree which resolved a hard-fought \n     litigation. Relief from the MFJ can only be given by a court, \n     not by the Department of Justice. While we make our position \n     known to the court, it is the court and not the Department \n     which determines disputes about the coverage of the MFJ.\n       The court also has the power to give relief from provisions \n     of the MFJ which become unnecessary. As you are aware, the \n     Department is supporting an MFJ waiver which would allow \n     cellular service providers affiliated with RBOCs to provide \n     long-distance services, subject to certain safeguards, and \n     this waiver is pending before the Court. The cellular market \n     will be moving from the duopoly model toward more vigorous \n     competition, a trend that will accelerate with completion of \n     the spectrum auction and deployment of PCS. We also hope that \n     landline local exchange competition will become lawful and \n     real. If such developments occur, more relief will certainly \n     be appropriate.\n\n\n                        the benefits of the MFJ\n\n       In discussing how the MFJ is applied, it is useful to bear \n     in mind what I know you understand--the pivotal role of the \n     MFJ in unleashing the competition that has put our country at \n     the forefront of the telecommunications revolution. I am also \n     particularly pleased that the case against the telephone \n     monopoly and supervision of the MFJ has been a priority at \n     Democratic and\n      Republican Departments of Justice alike, and that my \n     antitrust professor, Bill Baxter, who served as Assistant \n     Attorney General for Antitrust during the Reagan \n     Administration, successfully negotiated the historic MFJ.\n       Since the MFJ, multiple fiber optic networks have been \n     constructed by long distance competitors, consumers have \n     reaped steeply lower long distance prices while dramatically \n     increasing their minutes of usage, and according to a January \n     21, 1995 front page story in the New York Times headlined \n     ``No-Holds Barred Battle For Long-Distance Calls,'' at least \n     25 million residential telephone customers exercised a choice \n     in 1994 by switching long distance carriers. The \n     telecommunication equipment and services market have simply \n     exploded.\n       Moreover, it is this growing competition, which can be \n     accelerated through legislation which opens local markets to \n     real competition while continuing to protect consumers and \n     competition from monopolists, that will provide opportunities \n     for deregulation.\n\n\n                   the department's airtouch position\n\n       Our position in the AirTouch matter does not reflect an \n     antitrust or policy judgment about the cellular industry. \n     Instead, it reflects our interpretation of a narrow, but \n     extremely important, question concerning the continuing \n     applicability of antitrust decrees after the sale or \n     reorganization of corporate antitrust defendants. Section III \n     of the MFJ includes a provision, contained in virtually all \n     of the government's antitrust decrees, making its limitations \n     applicable to ``successors'' to the corporate entities \n     originally bound by the decree. Such provisions are included \n     to ensure that a decree's requirements cannot be avoided \n     simply through a reorganization or transfer of ownership of \n     the businesses that are subject to the decree. Without such \n     limitations, of course, it would be relatively easy for an \n     antitrust defendant to avoid its legal obligation to comply \n     with a decree through a transfer of significant assets, \n     restructuring or reorganization, thereby rendering the decree \n     ineffective.\n       The position the Department has taken in response to the \n     complaint submitted to it concerning AirTouch was made in the \n     context of this history. AirTouch was spun off from one of \n     the seven regional holding companies. It continues to \n     operate, among other things, the cellular telephone business \n     previously owned by that regional holding company and is \n     subject to a common consent decree provision applying the \n     decree to ``successors.''\n       In your letter, you refer to the purpose of the ``spin \n     off'' from Pacific Telesis as to avoid MFJ objections. In \n     this regard I want to advise you that neither AirTouch nor \n     Pacific Telesis chose to submit any request for written \n     guidance on this question to the Court or to the Department \n     at the time of the transaction. Moreover, AirTouch's \n     disclosure documents reflect that they understood and told \n     the public that there was a risk that a determination such as \n     we just made might ensue. (See Attachment)\n       After careful consideration of the history of the MFJ and \n     the decisions interpreting its provisions, and after detailed \n     consideration of AirTouch's arguments about the meaning of \n     the relevant MFJ provisions, the Department concluded that \n     AirTouch is a ``successor'' within the meaning of Section III \n     of the MFJ.\n\n\n                     our cooperation with airtouch\n\n       We have worked with AirTouch to assure that it will be able \n     to continue its current business activities while seeking a \n     ruling by the District Court on the question of whether it \n     should be considered a ``successor'' under the MFJ. This is a \n     legal question AirTouch can bring to the court. In the \n     meanwhile, in light of the assurances AirTouch has given us \n     that they will not undertake any new activities that could be \n     viewed as violating the MFJ, we informed AirTouch that we \n     have no intention of seeking enforcement action against them \n     pending a decision by court as to their status under the MFJ.\n       Also, as you know, the MFJ contains provisions that allow \n     parties to seek waivers or modifications if their activities, \n     although technically covered by the decree, do not pose \n     competitive problems. We have stated clearly to AirTouch that \n     our position on the complaint before us rests solely on the \n     meaning of the ``successor'' provision of the MFJ, and that \n     they should not construe our position as reflecting a \n     decision to oppose a waiver of MFJ restrictions which might \n     be sought pursuant to section VIII (C) of the MFJ. Rather, we \n     informed AirTouch that we would work with them to seek an \n     appropriate waiver. Although AirTouch has not sought a waiver \n     at this time, the opportunity to do so will continue to be \n     available to them.\n       I know that you and the Committee understand and appreciate \n     the importance and flexible nature of section VIII (C) where \n     market conditions are changing. That is no doubt one of the \n     reasons that the telecommunications legislation reported last \n     Congress by the Committee on Commerce, which passed the House \n     of Representatives with more than 420 votes, provided that \n     the Department of Justice should apply this test to determine \n     when, among other things, the RBOCs should be permitted to \n     enter the long distance market.\n       I hope that this information is helpful to you in analyzing \n     the Department's position in the AirTouch matter. With \n     respect to the ATT matter that you briefly touch upon, this \n     was addressed primarily under the Clayton Act and not under \n     the MFJ, and requires separate discussion.\n       I would be very happy to discuss these or other \n     telecommunications matters with you at our scheduled meeting \n     or at your convenience.\n           Sincerely,\n     Anne K. Bingaman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\n                Pacific Telesis Ignored U.S. on AirTouch\n\n                           (By Leslie Cauley)\n\n       New York.--Pacific Telesis Group ignored statements by the \n     Justice Department in 1993 suggesting that its cellular \n     spinoff could run afoul of the court decree governing the \n     Baby Bells, a senior department official said.\n       Now the spinoff, AirTouch Communications, is scrambling to \n     win a federal judge's approval lest it be forced to scale \n     back drastically its ambitious plans for future expansion.\n       Rules governing the Bell System breakup prohibit the seven \n     Baby Bells and their service spinoffs from offering long-\n     distance communication services or making phone gear.\n       But Pacific Telesis, based in San Francisco, brushed aside \n     these restrictions when it spun off the unit almost two years \n     ago, said Robert Litan, deputy assistant attorney general for \n     the Justice Department's antitrust division.\n       ``We indicated to them at that time that it was an open \n     question,'' Mr. Litan said, particularly since the unit had \n     retained network facilities it had used as a Bell entity.\n       Air-Touch recently began transmitting long-distance calls \n     on its cellular network, and it is developing phone \n     equipment. On Jan. 11, the Justice Department formally \n     notified AirTouch that it must abide by the terms of the \n     decree just like its former parent.\n       Officials at Pacific Telesis and Air-Touch expressed \n     surprise at the department's [[Page S8448]] stance, noting \n     that Justice Department officials had known for at least two \n     years of AirTouch's intention to enter markets banned to the \n     Bells.\n       ``We could not have been more clear about what we were \n     talking about,'' said Richard Odgers, Pacific Telesis' \n     general counsel. Moreover, he added, three law firms hired by \n     the company came to the same conclusion that the decree \n     didn't apply to AirTouch.\n       Justice Department officials counter that its antitrust \n     division, as a prosecuting arm of the government, doesn't \n     offer casual assessments. Pacific Telesis ``could have made a \n     request for a formal (legal) opinion'' when the spinoff was \n     being contemplated in 1993, Mr. Litan said. ``But they never \n     did that. They went ahead and took their chances.''\n       AirTouch's public documents issued at the time it went \n     public indicate that it knew it might be jumping the gun if \n     it pursued business barred by the decree. The company's \n     November 1993 prospectus, released in anticipation of its \n     initial public offering last spring, noted that there was no \n     assurance ``that DOJ or a third party might not object at \n     some time in the future or that the courts might not agree'' \n     with AirTouch's opinion that it wasn't subject to the decree \n     restrictions.\n       The prospectus added that AirTouch had advised the Justice \n     Department of ``its belief that the [decree] would not apply \n     to the company after the spinoff. . . . [and] DOJ has not \n     stated any intention to object [Pacific] Telesis' position.''\n       Margaret Gill, an AirTouch senior vice president, \n     maintained last week that ``that statement was made because \n     we had carefully noted conversations with appropriate senior \n     officials at the department.''\n       Department opinions aren't binding with the courts, and \n     even when it finds nothing objectionable, the agency can take \n     action later. But it is virtually unheard of for the Justice \n     Department to prosecute a company for engaging in activities \n     that have been subject to a formal review, a process that can \n     take several months or more to complete.\n       AirTouch has big plans. Besides operating one of the \n     nation's largest cellular phone networks, the company already \n     has begun offering highly profitable long-distance services \n     in its territories. AirTouch is also building systems in \n     international markets that will be tied through a \n     sophisticated satellite network.\n       The company has proposed merging with the cellular unit of \n     former sibling US West Inc. Together, AirTouch and US West \n     are bidding with two other Baby Bells--Bell Atlantic Corp. \n     and Nynex Corp.--for new wireless ``personal communications \n     services'' licenses, with plans to build a nationwide PCS \n     network offering anywhere-anytime wireless calling.\n       Efforts by AirTouch to boost growth and profits by also \n     providing the long-distance links to its subscribers could be \n     cut off if the company doesn't win a favorable ruling from \n     the courts. A $7.5 million investment by the company in a \n     satellite venture also seems in jeopardy.\n       AirTouch didn't reveal the department's concerns until last \n     week, when it asked federal Judge Harold Greene for an \n     immediate ruling saying AirTouch isn't subject to the decree. \n     In the meantime, AirTouch has agreed to stop further \n     expansion into prohibited businesses and the department has \n     agreed not to take action against the company until a \n     decision is rendered.\n       AirTouch's predicament underscores the gravity with which \n     the U.S. government still views the restrictions on the \n     regional Bell monopolies. the crackdown on the fledgling Bell \n     spinoff could presage similar moves against the other Bell \n     affiliates that were cut loose but are still considered local \n     service bottlenecks.\n       Many telecommunications attorneys believe AirTouch won't \n     get a favorable ruling from Judge Greene, who has \n     historically taken a hard line in interpreting the decree. \n     But they think it will prevail in the courts.\n       But that could take years, according to some attorneys. \n     However, AirTouch could ask for a waiver from the courts that \n     could ask for a waiver from the courts that would allow it to \n     continue its operations unchanged.\n       Even with its current predicament, AirTouch still has a \n     healthy core business providing cellular services in its \n     territory. The company's fledgling long-distance business is \n     a miniscule part of total operations, and it has a stock \n     market value of about $14 billion. The company, which has had \n     growth rates of greater than 30%, is expected to release \n     fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              The Public Utilities\n\n\n                                           Commission of Ohio,\n\n                                                   April 25, 1995.\n     Ms. Anne Bingaman,\n     Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, \n         Antitrust Division, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ms. Bingaman: I am writing to you in my capacity as \n     Chairman of the Ameritech Regional Regulatory Committee \n     (ARRC). ARRC is an ad hoc group of the five state regulatory \n     commissions in the Ameritech region: Illinois, Indiana, \n     Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin. The ARRC mission is to \n     facilitate the exchange of information among the public \n     utility commissions of the five states regarding \n     telecommunications issues in general and telephone companies \n     operating within the five respective jurisdictions in \n     particular. The ARRC is made up of representatives of the \n     commissions and/or staffs of the Illinois Commerce \n     Commission, Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, the \n     Michigan Public Service Commission, the Ohio Public Utilities \n     Commission and the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin.\n       On behalf of the ARRC, I want to thank you and members of \n     the Department Staff for devoting many hours to meeting with \n     the ARRC to seek input from and accommodate concerns raised \n     by the respective state regulatory commissions and/or their \n     staffs concerning the proposed request to Judge Greene to \n     authorize an interLATA experiment in parts of Michigan and \n     Illinois. Specifically, Mr. Willard Tom and Robert Litan of \n     your Staff traveled to the region and met with the ARRC staff \n     on a number of occasions concerning the proposed experiment. \n     Moreover, the ARRC staff representatives received and were \n     allowed to have input on the various drafts leading up to the \n     proposed modification of the Decree filed with the Court on \n     April 3, 1995. Although there may still be issues which \n     individual state commissions and the ARRC may be raising in \n     comments before Judge Greene, I can say on behalf of all of \n     the ARRC states that the willingness of the Department of \n     Justice to work with and specifically accommodate a number of \n     state concerns represented an exemplary level of cooperation \n     and team work between the Department and the state \n     commissions.\n       Should the modification to the Decree be adopted by Judge \n     Greene, by its own terms it calls for various regulatory and \n     enforcement activities to be undertaken both by the States \n     and the Department of Justice. I am heartened by the \n     cooperative process that has occurred to date and feel that \n     it bodes well for implementing the proposed trial in a manner \n     which is in the public interest.\n       Again, on behalf of the ARRC, I express my sincere thanks \n     for the Department's extra efforts to hear and attempt to \n     accommodate state regulatory issues and concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Craig A. Glazer,\n                                                    ARRC Chairman.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand I have 3 minutes. I yield \nmyself such time as I may need. I ask for 1 minute as in morning \nbusiness out of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President,\n   as we approach Father's Day 1995, I want to share with the Senate \nand the American people a letter I have received from a fellow New \nMexican, Chuck Everett. Mr. Everett originally wrote this letter while \nhe was serving in Korea to his father who was back home in the United \nStates.\n\n  Mr. Everett's father described the letter as ``a masterpiece of \nsimple truths.'' I could not agree more. In Mr. Everett's cover letter \nto me, he says to ``delete the word `Communism' and insert the word \n`terrorism' and we have a thought that is as true today as in 1952.'' \nHis prophetic and patriotic words are as valid now as they were when he \nfirst wrote them. I trust you will find the text of Mr. Everett's 1952 \nletter a hopeful and encouraging sample of a young man's commitment to \nAmerica and its values. These are indeed ``simple truths.'' Times have \nchanged the face of totalitarian and Communist regimes, but new dangers \nare substituted for the old. As Mr. Everett says, we ``are on a \nmission, so that next year and the years that follow, free people all \nover the world can celebrate Dad's Day.'' I respectfully ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of Mr. Everett's letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      October 1952\n       It's a beautiful morning, the kind of a day when a fellow \n     likes to get up early in the morning, gather up his golf \n     clubs and head for an early morning bout with fairways, \n     roughs, greens and caddies.\n       I'd like to sit down to a nice roast beef dinner, with \n     diced carrots, peas, Brussels sprouts, chopped salad, blue-\n     berry pie and a big glass of milk. In the afternoon I'd like \n     to siesta, then pack a picnic lunch of cold cuts, cheese and \n     lemonade, and head for Stone Park. I left out something. Oh, \n     yes, of course, church. I'd like to go to church after golf, \n     where the services would be devoted to Father's Day.\n       That's how I'd like to spend the day. But some of us are on \n     a mission, so that next year and the years that follow, free \n     people all over the world can celebrate Dad's Day. We know we \n     will succeed in our mission here, but will those at home \n     remember our efforts and strive to realize our purpose? The \n     battles we fight here cannot, in themselves, assure us that \n     we will have a free world. It takes the combined efforts of \n     educators, industrialists, politicians and religious leaders \n     to assure a free world. The shackles of communism are not \n     bound about the legs of only [[Page S8449]] those behind the \n     iron curtain. It has shackled the minds of free men \n     everywhere into believing that it is better than free \n     enterprise and democracy.\n       That is where you people must carry the fight to the enemy. \n     Bullets alone will not stop communism. Let us, on this day \n     dedicated to fathers, dedicate our lives to the support of \n     free will, free speech, freedom from fear, freedom of \n     religion, and freedom of thought.\n       We cannot fear communism, but we must make communism fear \n     us. And, believe me, the Reds do. At every move of our enemy, \n     we stop them, we repulse them and we humiliate them. It is \n     but a matter of time before they will quit. They can only \n     suffer defeat. Be it not the will of free men to be dictated \n     to, and thus communism cannot succeed.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/15/senate-section/article/S8448-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8449-S8458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n    TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETI- TION AND DEREGULATION ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in 1934, when the last major piece of \ncommunication regulation was passed, we had radios and telephones, and \noften telephones had many parties on the same line.\n  Now we have telephones, radios, computers, modems, fax machines, \ncable television, direct broadcasting satellite, cellular phones, and \nan array of budding new technological improvements to communication.\n  As a matter of fact, I believe this period in modern history will be \nmarked singly by the advances that humankind is going to make with \nreference to communications. I think it will add appreciably to the \nwealth of nations. It will add significantly to the time people have to \ndo other things because it will dramatically produce efficiencies in \ncommunication that were unheard of. It will bring people together who \nare miles apart.\n  We can dream and envision the kind of things that will happen by just \nlooking at what has happened to cellular phones, to portable phones, \nand think of how communications is going to advance.\n  Mr. President, fellow Senators, it is obvious that we have a law on \nthe books and court decisions governing this industry that shackle it \nand deny the American people, and, yes, the people of the world, the \nreal advantages that will come from telecommunications advances that \nare part of a marketplace that is competitive, where the great ideas of \npeople can quickly find themselves converted from ideas to research, \nfrom research to technologies, and then rapidly into the marketplace to \nserve various needs of business, of individuals, of schools and on and \non.\n  Some New Mexicans have told me, ``We are happy with the phone service \nwe have now. What are we changing in this legislation, and why must we \nchange it?'' Obviously, we are not going to be changing the phone \nservice other than making the options that our people have, giving them \nmore options, making the communication, be it a telephone, a more \nmodern thing, and people will be able to do much more by way of \ncommunicating than before.\n  People should not fear, but rather look at this as a new dawn of \nopportunity and a way to communicate and enhance freedom beyond \nanything we could have comprehended 20 or 30 years ago.\n  It stands to reason that with all of that happening--and part of it \nhas grown up under regulation and part of it not--it is time to change \nthat old law and do something better, take some chances, if you will, \nwith the marketplace. It will not come out perfect.\n  I just heard my good friend from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey, indicate \nhe was concerned. Obviously, I am less concerned than he. I believe \nthis bill will cause much, much more good than the possibility for harm \nthat might come because we may not totally understand the end product.\n  It may be difficult to totally understand the end product of this \nderegulation. Anybody that is that intelligent, knows that much about \nit, it seems to me, is well beyond what we have around here. Maybe \nthere is not anybody in the country that could figure out where all of \nthis will lead.\n  It is obvious to this Senator that if we are looking for \nproductivity, if we are looking to enhancing communication, new \ntechnology, investment, new jobs, new gross domestic product growth, we \nmust deregulate this industry.\n  There is great capacity--both human and natural--and there are large \namounts of assets tied up in this industry. We have to let them loose \nto grow, compete and prosper.\n  I hope on the many issues that we voted on, that we came down on the \nright side. I do not think one should vote against this bill because \none or two of their amendments did not pass.\n  Fundamentally, this is a giant step in the right direction.\n  We have outgrown the Communications Act of 1934. It is time to pass \nthe Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995. This \nlegislation will foster the explosion of technology, bring more choices \nand lower prices to consumers, promote international competitiveness, \nproductivity, and job growth.\n  This legislation will open up local phone service to competition and \nwhen this market is open, allow local phone companies to enter the long \ndistance markets. This will create more competition resulting in lower \nprices and better services for the consumer.\n  Some New Mexicans have told me ``we are happy with the phone service \nwe have now. Why do we need legislation to change it?'' What I want to \ntell my fellow New Mexicans is that this legislation will not disrupt \nthe phone service that they depend upon now.\n  What the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995 \nwill do is provide consumers with more choices and lower prices in long \ndistance phone service and television programming. The legislation also \npreserves the universal service fund which subsidizes telephone service \nto rural areas.\n  Right now, consumers have a choice of what company they want to \nprovide long distance phone service. After this legislation takes \naffect, consumers will be able to choose among companies that will \nprovide them with local and long distance service.\n  This legislation will also give consumers more choices in how to \nreceive television programming. Currently, if a consumer's area is \nserved by cable, a consumer may choose between the cable company and \nsomewhat expensive satellite or DBS service. This legislation will \nallow the phone company to offer television over phone lines, so there \nis a choice between the cable company, the phone company, and DBS.\n  The Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995 will \nremove the regulations that have hindered the development and expansion \nof technology. Regulations, such as the regulated monopolies in local \ntelephone service, required by the Communications Act of 1934, have \nforced U.S. companies wanting to invest in local phone markets to \ninvest overseas.\n  In 1934, it made sense to only have one company laying phone lines \nand providing phone service. But now that many homes have both cable \nand phone lines, and may have a cellular phone, it makes sense to open \nup phone service to competition. When this legislation opens local \nmarkets to competition, companies like MCI, which have plans to invest \nin the United States, but have been forced to make investments \noverseas, will be able to invest, create jobs, and provide better phone \nservice to U.S. consumers.\n  The President's Council of Economic Advisors estimates that as a \nresult of deregulation, by 2003, 1.4 million service sector jobs will \nbe created.\n  Over the next 10 years, a total of 3.4 million jobs will be created, \neconomic growth will increase by approximately .5 percent, and, \naccording to George Gilder, the gross domestic product will increase by \nas much as $2 trillion.\n  This legislation will increase exports of U.S. designed and \nmanufactured telecommunications products.\n  Increased investment in telecommunications products and services will \nbring a better quality of life to rural New Mexico. With fiber optic \ncable connections, doctors in Shiprock, NM, can consult with \nspecialists at the University of New Mexico Medical Center or any \nmedical center across the country.\n  The technology to let students in Hidalgo County, NM, in towns like \nLordsburg and Animas, share a teacher through a video and fiber optic \nlink. What this legislation would do is remove the regulations that \ncurrently prevent investment to get technologies to the local phone \nmarket. [[Page S8450]] \n  Mr. President, I support this legislation because of the benefits to \nrural education and rural health care, better local and long distance \nphone services, and new technology and new jobs for Americans. I \nbelieve this legislation is a good start to accomplish these \nobjectives.\n  I wish to commend the managers of this bill and their staffs for \ntheir tireless work to craft this legislation. I appreciate Chairman \nPressler's willingness to listen to the concerns of each member of this \nbody.\n  Mr. President, we need this legislation to move our citizens and our \neconomy into the next century. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a minute. I remember when I first had \nthe luxury and privilege of being the chairman of the committee and had \nto come to the floor to manage a bill. That was a few years ago when we \nhad the luxury, for 6 years, of being in the majority.\n  I want to say that the majority, the Republicans, should be very \nproud of the new chairman, Senator Larry Pressler, who has managed this \nbill. This is his first chairmanship of a major committee. That is \nrather exciting to him and I am sure to his family.\n  I want to say for the record that for this Senator, who has watched \nthose who come to the floor for the first time managing a bill, that \nthis Senator deserves our congratulations for the good job he has done.\n  This was a tough bill. It will stand in his accomplishment list high \non the ladder, to have managed this great bill which will bring great, \npositive change for our country and for millions of people. My \ncongratulations to him here today. I imagine that with this good \neffort, we can look for many more under his chairmanship.\n  Obviously, it goes without saying that the distinguished ranking \nmember, who I have been on the floor with on the other side when he was \nchair, when I was chairman, that he always does a great job managing \nthe bill, from whichever side, majority or minority. I want to \ncongratulate him for getting this bill through. It is great to have \nsomething totally bipartisan. It will be very bipartisan.\n  When we have major problems to be solved for the country, we cannot \nalways do it that way, but it sure is nice, and the public ought to be \nproud the Democrats and Republicans are working together on this bill.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I want to sincerely thank the Senator \nfrom New Mexico who chairs our Budget Committee so well. I have watched \nhim so often, and words from him mean a great deal. We thank the \nSenator very much for his statement.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I heard the remarks of my distinguished \ncolleague from New Mexico, and I can simply echo them from the \nperspective of membership on the Commerce Committee.\n  Senator Pressler has met this test with flying colors and deserves a \ntremendous amount of credit. But not the least of the items for which \nhe deserves praise is his ability and willingness to work with the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina, Senator Hollings.\n  I have said this privately to the Senator from South Carolina, it is \nobviously difficult to be in charge, to be a chairman of the committee, \nto have strong ideas on a subject as he has had, and then find himself, \nwithout any action on his part, in a different position. His \nwillingness to share his wisdom and his ideas--not just with Senator \nPressler, but with all members on the Commerce Committee--and his \nwillingness to make this such a constructive bipartisan endeavor is a \ntribute to him and, I think, to the Senate.\n  This bill, as I said in my opening remarks, is as important a piece \nof legislation as the Senate has dealt with, which has created no \ninterest in the general public at all outside, of course, of the \nvarious entities that are in the business itself. To reach as good a \nconclusion as we seem to have reached and to have done it in such a \nbipartisan fashion brings great credit, in my view, on the chairman of \nthe committee, but very, very much credit on my good friend from South \nCarolina, whose wisdom and guidance and views on this subject are very \nmuch impressed in the bill itself and are vitally important to our \nsuccess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me thank our distinguished colleague \nfrom Washington for his overgenerous remarks, although undeserved they \nare greatly appreciated. I join the Senator from New Mexico and join in \nthe sentiments of both the Senators from New Mexico and Washington, \nthat our distinguished chairman has done an outstanding job here in \nhandling this bill. It has been totally in a cooperative fashion and in \na very, very considerate fashion of everyone's amendments.\n  When you begin to appreciate that, I think, a 1-cent increase in a 1-\nminute telephone rate nationwide equals $2 billion, then you begin to \nsee why that other room stays filled up. They are not going to leave \nuntil we get through the conference. So we just started that journey of \n1,000 miles with the first step. I hope we can continue with the \nsuccess we have had thus far.\n  I will even elaborate further when we get more time, because other \nSenators want to speak, but Senator Pressler has done an amazingly \noutstanding job.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington. He \nhas been key in moving this bill forward. I see he has moved to another \npart of the room. But his wise counsel has been very much--I know he \nhas managed that enormous product liability bill in our committee. But \non this committee he has just done--this bill would not be here if it \nwere not for the Senator from Washington and I thank him very, very \nmuch.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to add my voice of \ncommendation to the chairman of the committee and the ranking member \nfor the manner in which they have presented this bill and given us an \nopportunity to understand its contents and debate its principal \nprovisions.\n  It had been my full expectation that I would support this \nlegislation. I was well aware of the legislation that had been \nintroduced last year by the then chairman, the Senator from South \nCarolina. I was publicly, positively supportive of that legislation. I, \nfrankly, therefore, state with regret that I will not be able to \nsupport the legislation that is before us in the form this afternoon. \nThe debate we are having now on an amendment relative to a provision of \nthe legislation having to do with the relationship between the \nproviders of cable television product and the purchasers of that \nproduct is, to me, illustrative of a concern, a process that seems to \nhave been too much operative in the development of this legislation and \nin its consideration. That is a process which essentially says that the \nCongress, as the elected representatives of the people, serve the role \nof ratifiers of private agreements developed among the parties who will \nbe affected by this legislation.\n  Reference was made earlier to the model of President Truman and a \nrailroad strike that occurred after World War II. He initially had \nproposed a congressionally mandated solution. Then the parties decided \nthat maybe they could go back to the bargaining table and arrive at a \nresolution. I think that is an appropriate manner for the resolution of \na labor-management dispute. But we are not here talking about a labor-\nmanagement or other commercial controversy. We are talking about one of \nthe most fundamental aspects of a democratic society, and that is \ncontrol of ideas and their dissemination. That is a role in which any \ndemocratic government has a key responsibility. It has been a \nfundamental part of this Nation since the adoption of the first \namendment to the Constitution, which guarantees freedom of press and \nfreedom of speech.\n  So we here are not talking as ratifiers of some private agreement as \nto how ideas would be made available to the American people. We are \nhere as the representatives of the American people, to try to structure \na process of communications law that will best serve the interests and \nthe values of the American people today and, in a highly dynamic era, \ninto the future.\n  I started my consideration of this legislation from a basic economic \npremise of support of the marketplace as the best allocator of \nresources. While Governor of Florida, I actively supported the \nderegulation of a number [[Page S8451]] of our industries. I supported \nthe delicensure of professions where I felt licensure was not serving \nan adequate public purpose. Thus, I started with a presumption of \nsupport of appropriate opening up to the marketplace as the regulator \nfor access, quality and cost of the communications industry.\n  I, regretfully, find two principal defects in the way in which we \nhave implemented that movement towards the marketplace. First, I do not \nbelieve that this legislation adequately creates the free, robust, \ncompetitive marketplace to which we can, with confidence turn in lieu \nof our tradition of regulation as a means of assuring open, quality, \naffordable communications in this Nation. I would just cite two \nexamples of provisions which I think undercut that confidence that we \nwill have a free market that will be the means by which we will achieve \ndesirable public ends.\n  First, as it relates to cable television, we saw from 1984 until 1992 \na period in which the Congress had denied to States and local \ngovernments their traditional role of providing some regulation for \ncable television. What we saw was not only an escalation of cost of \ncable TV, but in many communities an escalation of arrogance, as the \ncable TV companies did not provide what consumers considered to be an \nadequate level of service. In some areas, parts of the city which had \nthe affluent neighborhoods were wired for cable TV, while those areas \nof the city that did not have adequate income base to meet the economic \nneeds of the cable TV system were denied any service at all.\n  Beginning in 1992 there was a process of partial reregulation. We \nhave seen significant benefits by that. We have seen a reduction in the \ncost of cable TV for most American families. At the same time we have \nseen a cable TV industry which is at an all-time high in terms of its \neconomic prosperity. Yet, part of this legislation is going to be to \nroll back the progress that was made just 3 years ago in terms of \nproviding some control, even though that control would fall away when \nit was established that there was in fact a competitive marketplace \nwhere people had options and choices and could use the marketplace as \nthe means of assuring access, quality, and cost control. That provision \nis now out of this legislation. I think with it also has flown a \nsignificant amount of the rationale of allowing the marketplace to \nprovide the alternative to regulation.\n In this case we have neither an open marketplace nor do we have any \nmeaningful regulation.\n\n  I might say that I have had a number of contacts in our office from \nrepresentatives of the cable TV industry, and they are very candid in \ntheir statements. Their statements are that they want to have this \nperiod of no regulation while they still are in a monopolistic \nposition--that is, without effective competition within their market \narea--so that they can build up their cash position to be in a better \nposition to compete with the regional phone companies at such time that \nthe regional phone companies get into the cable TV business. That is a \nstatement that they are not being clandestine or secret about. They are \ntelling us that they are going to use this remaining period of monopoly \nas a means of raising rates in order to be in a strengthened position \nwhen they are in a competitive market. I think we will find it very \ndifficult to explain to our citizens why we tolerated what I think is a \nbasic abuse of the free enterprise system.\n  Second, as an example of where this legislation fails to assure that \nthere will be, in fact, an open, competitive marketplace before we \ntrade in regulation as a means of assuring the public access quality \nand cost control is the issue of the role of the Department of Justice \nas it relates to the entry of regional telephone companies into long \ndistance.\n  In the legislation that was before us last year, the Department of \nJustice continued to have a role in terms of evaluating specific \nproposals to determine if they met basic standards of antitrust before \nthey could go forward. That provision has now been eliminated. So we \nare going to have companies going into the long-distance business by \nmeeting a checklist supervised by an agency that has not had the kind \nof background and tradition of ferreting out anticompetitive schemes as \nhas the Department of Justice.\n  I believe that we are going to see the potential--when a person moves \ninto a new neighborhood and calls the telephone company and asks to \nhave their local service connected, then they are asked what long \ndistance they want, there will be the potential of the local concern to \ntout, or otherwise steer, the local service customers to that same \nfirm's long-distance service. That would be very much in the economic \ninterest of the local service to do.\n  To provide sanctions and protections against exactly that type of \nsituation, we ought to have the Department of Justice playing a role in \nmaking that judgment as to whether there is in fact a free and open \nmarket before we trade in our regulation that has provided consumers \nsome protection.\n  So I think, first, this legislation fails to meet the basic premise \nupon which it is based; that is, that we will have meaningful \ncompetition as a substitute for regulation in the communications area.\n  Second, I believe that we cannot use the analogy that I have heard on \nthe floor over the past few days of commercial products as a direct \nparallel to the service of communications.\n  The reality is that ideas are not like shirts or shoes or hamburgers \nor other products where there clearly have been benefits by having an \nunfettered, free market.\n  Thomas Jefferson once observed that, having to make choice between \nfree government and free speech or freedom of the press, he would take \nfree speech and freedom of the press because, if you did not have those \nfundamentals, you would not have a free government for long. And if you \nlost the free government but you still had people who could have the \nfreedom to speak and the freedom to communicate ideas, you would build \neventually a base for a restoration of free government.\n  This issue is as fundamental as our basic precepts of democracy and \nwhat is required for a functioning democracy.\n  I am very concerned about the effect of the concentration of power \nwithin this legislation, a concentration of power which I do not \nbelieve is necessary in order to accomplish the objectives of a greater \nrole of the marketplace in the allocation of communications technology.\n  Why do we have to lift totally the number of television stations that \nan individual entity can own in order to get the benefits of \ntechnological innovation in telephones or in television or video or \nother services? I believe that this legislation is being used as a \nmeans by which to accomplish other ends, which are to concentrate power \nin an area that is critical to a democratic society. I have little \ndoubt that, if this legislation is passed in its current form, within a \nfew years from this afternoon we will see a handful of firms control \nthe large majority of television stations in the United States. It \nfrankly frightens me to see that kind of power turned over to a few \nhands. I do not see what benefit the consumers are going to receive by \nthat. I believe that will be the inevitable result of this legislation. \nI do not see what purpose in the general thrust of this legislation is \nadvanced by that kind of an open invitation to concentration of power \nand control over the access to ideas in our democratic society.\n  So I believe that this legislation had a worthy goal to bring \nmodernity, a recognition of the changes in technology, to give us a \nchance for a greater access to the benefits of a rapidly changing \ntelecommunications industry but that we have fallen short of those \ngoals by failure to assure that there will be a functioning free market \nbefore we drop the protections of even minimal regulations such as \nthose that are available today for cable TV customers, and we have \nallowed the general goal to be held out under which was buried efforts \nto concentrate economic power which has the potential to damage our \ndemocratic society.\n  So it is, Mr. President, with a sense of disappointment that I \nannounce my inability to support this legislation in its current form. \nI hope that by stating the basis of my opposition, that might \ncontribute to further reforms before this legislation is finally \nadopted, finally resubmitted to us out of a conference committee, so \nthat we will have legislation that can draw the kind of broader support \nfor change, I believe, as fundamental--I would say as \n[[Page S8452]] radical--as this should have before it is adopted.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I rise merely to congratulate my good \nfriend, the Senator from South Dakota, and also my friend from South \nCarolina for their management of this bill. It is a bill that means a \ngreat deal to rural America in particular. We have watched developments \nin the last part of this century with awe. I think the developments \nthat are coming now will startle our imagination. I am talking about \nthe developments in telecommunications and technology.\n  When I came to the Senate, the Army ran our only communications \nsystem. It was a telephone system. We had also the wireless and \ntelegraph capability. We are moving now into the next century. Because, \nI think, of the work the Senate has done in this area, we are moving \ninto the 21st century with everyone in the country, and we are probably \nahead of everyone else in the world. The real necessity now is to \ndevise a system that will carry us on beyond this developing technology \ninto an era of really free competition without regulation in which the \ningenuity and really resourcefulness of the American entrepreneur will \nbring us better and better and better communications.\n  Communications now have reached the point where at least in my State \nthey dominate our educational pattern. They dominate the health care \ndelivery system. They dominate our total communications system in terms \nof business.\n  In a State that is one-fifth the size of the United States, the one \nsingle factor that makes us equal is the equal access to the most \nrecent developments for telecommunications. I think this bill will \nassure that in this interim period now as we shift from the 1934 \nCommunications Act into a period where we will have very, very little \nregulation of communications, which I think should start sometime \nbetween 2005 and 2010 is where I see it in terms of the developments of \ntechnology that have been reported to us thus far. Developments are \nstill on the drawing board in some instances, developments that are \nreally being applied from our space research in other instances.\n  I do believe the work the Senator from South Dakota and the Senator \nfrom South Carolina have done along with their staffs in perfecting \nthis bill so we can take it now to the House and, hopefully, early to \nconference will mean that we are going to have a change, an immediate \nchange in this country. It will be a change for the best as far as \nAlaska is concerned.\n  I close by just remarking that the other day I heard about a young \nfamily that has moved to Alaska from somewhere around the San Francisco \narea. They bought an island, and they have moved themselves and their \nsmall business up to that island. They are going to continue to conduct \ntheir business in the San Francisco area by telecommunications from my \nState. They will have available all of the modern convenience where \nthey are going to be.\n  That is something which could not even be dreamed of when I first \nwent to Alaska, and now we are in a situation where we see people \nmoving into our State from all over the country, if not the world, to \nutilize our wilderness, our beautiful surroundings, and at the same \ntime maintain contact with the rest of the world through \ntelecommunications. This bill, as I said, means more to us than I think \nit does anyone in the Senate.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I shall use such time as I may require under \nthe time allotted to any Senator under the cloture rule. I shall not be \nlong.\n  The purpose of this bill is to establish a framework to introduce \nmore competition into the telecommunications sector and break down the \ncurrent system of large monopolistic fiefdoms which characterize this \nmarket.\n  In addition, there is an attempt to deregulate cable and broadcasting \nsectors in an attempt to strike a compromise between the current \nregulatory environment and the desire for additional competition in \nthose marketplaces. The question is, Does the bill go far enough in \ndoing this? Can we predict how successful it will be? What are the \ndangers that additional influence by big corporations, big entities, \nwill result despite the intentions of the hard-working managers of the \nbill, the distinguished Senator from South Dakota, the chairman, Mr. \nPressler--and I compliment him on his management of this bill and the \nwork that he has done on the bill during the committee process, \nthroughout the hearings and the markup--and the ranking member, whom I \ncompliment, the distinguished Senator from South Carolina [Mr. \nHollings] the former chairman of the committee, straight as an arrow in \nhis physique, straight as an arrow in his integrity and honesty and \nstraightforward manner.\n  Certainly it is intuitive that prices will drop with additional \ncompetition in the telephone marketplaces that might eventually occur, \nbut the impact of bigness on the pending bill, which is attempting to \nreduce bigness, gives me great pause.\n  There is a substantial possibility that three-quarters of West \nVirginia's cable TV viewers will pay higher prices for this service as \na result of the bill. This is because the definition of ``small'' cable \ncompany included in the leadership amendment on this floor would \ninclude about 74 percent of our West Virginia cable viewers. Even if \nthey take the most basic cable service, it is subject to deregulation \nand the price can go through the roof before the ink is dry on the \nconference report.\n  The distinguished Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman] this \nafternoon offered an amendment to correct those cable rate rises. \nUnfortunately, his amendment was not agreed to. I supported that \namendment, which was an important consumer amendment.\n  In addition, Mr. President, on the amendment by the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] to keep the concentration of TV \nownership at the current cap of 25 percent, the amendment failed after \nsome heavy lobbying by interests that are interested in further \nconcentration of broadcasting station ownership.\n  There are some good things in the bill, including in particular the \ninitiative authored by my colleague from West Virginia, Mr. \nRockefeller, that extends the traditional concept of universal service \nwhich is essential for our State and broadens it to include affordable \nrates for such institutions as hospitals, secondary schools, and \nlibraries, bringing the future information highway and the services it \ncan give to every person--down to the basic infrastructure for learning \nand health care--to West Virginia. I congratulate my colleague, Mr. \nRockefeller, on this item, and I enthusiastically endorse it.\n  In addition, the Senators from North Dakota and Nebraska, Senators \nConrad and Exon, have authored valuable amendments to take steps to \nreduce violence and obscenity on TV in this bill, and we sorely need to \ntake that kind of action.\n  Given these worthy provisions, I also take note of the observations \nmade earlier by the distinguished Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey] \nregarding the quality of the message and pictures going over the \nairwaves and the land lines. The issue is the manipulation and control \nof information made available to our citizens. Wide choice and quality \nprogramming must be available. Essential information must be available \nto our people so that independent judgments can be made. Bigness, big \nprogramming, cavalier concern for consumer choice and diversity of \nviewpoint seem to go hand in hand. We need to take care that we do not \nallow our media to hollow out the essence of information and diversity \nof viewpoint which are essential to creating an informed citizenry. \nCertainly, we ought to focus a great deal of attention on the effect \nthat such legislation as we have before us today enhances and informs \ncitizenry and erects barriers to the power of great financial and \ntechnological interests that care only about manipulation, control, and \nthe bottom financial line.\n  This is a very big and complex bill dealing with a range of \nbusinesses and interests that are vast, wealthy, and powerful. We have \nnot had enough time to adequately debate the very important amendments \nin this bill. We should not be invoking cloture. I voted against \ncloture on yesterday. I was one of the few who voted against it. We \n[[Page S8453]] should not be invoking cloture to truncate the doing of \nthe legitimate business with adequate debate on this kind of measure.\n  Cloture is for filibusters. Cloture is not intended to shut off \nlegitimate debate on important business such as this. Senators and \ntheir constituents are shortchanged by this technique, and it is not in \nthe highest traditions of this deliberative body.\n  Mr. President, finally, the episode over the last 2 days regarding \nthe transparent threats by one big conglomerate, Time Warner, to \nthreaten the future of a business arrangement unless the Senate agrees \nto remove a particular provision from the bill is an outrageous \nillustration of the kind of influence peddling and pushing that \nsurrounds this legislation.\n  The senior Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon] has drawn the attention \nof the Senate to the kind of intrusion into the legislative process \nthat is illustrated by the threat that Time Warner has engaged in. One \ncannot help but wonder what leads a big organization like Time Warner \nto think that it can actually affect the legislative process in this \nway.\n  What does this episode say about the perception of the integrity of \nthe Senate that prevails among the big concerns that mold public \nopinion? What leads such concerns to think that they can get away with \nthis kind of blackmail?\n  There is too much money pushing around this legislative product and \nprocess. It is totally inappropriate, and I congratulate the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina on his statement, and I shall \nsupport him in his urging that the amendment not be agreed to.\n  For the reasons stated, I shall also vote against the bill on final \npassage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article by Tom Shales that appeared in the June 13, 1995 edition of \nthe Washington Post, along with a letter from Time Warner, dated June \n13, 1995, to Senator Pressler; and a letter from Senator Pressler to \nMr. Timothy Boggs of Time Warner, dated June 15, 1995.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 13, 1995]\n\n                       Fat Cat Broadcast Bonanza\n\n                            (By Tom Shales)\n\n       It's happening again. Congress is going ever so slightly \n     insane. The telecommunications deregulation bill now being \n     debated in the Senate, with a vote expected today or \n     tomorrow, is a monstrosity. In the guise of encouraging \n     competition, it will help huge new concentration of media \n     power.\n       There's something for everybody in the package, with the \n     notable exception of you and me. Broadcasters, cablecasters, \n     telephone companies and gigantic media conglomerates all get \n     fabulous prizes. Congress is parceling out the future among \n     the communications superpowers, which stand to get more super \n     and more powerful, and certainly more profitable, as a \n     result.\n       Limits on multiple ownership would be eased by the bill, so \n     that any individual owner could control stations serving up \n     to 35 percent of the country (50 percent in the even crazier \n     House version), versus 25 percent now. There would be no \n     limit on the number of radio stations owned. Cable and phone \n     companies could merge in municipalities with populations up \n     to 50,000.\n       Broadcast licenses of local TV stations would be extended \n     from a five-year to a 10-year term and would be even more \n     easily renewed than they are now. It would become nearly \n     impossible for angry civic groups or individuals to challenge \n     the licenses of even the most irresponsible broadcasters.\n       In addition, the rate controls that were imposed on the \n     cable industry in 1992, and have saved consumers $3 billion \n     in the years since, would be abolished, so that your local \n     cable company could hike those rates right back up again.\n       Sen Bob Dole (R-Kan.), majority leader and presidential \n     candidate, is trying to ram the legislation through as \n     quickly as possible. Tomorrow he wants to take up the issue \n     of welfare reform, which is rather ironic considering that \n     his deregulation efforts amount to a bounteous welfare \n     program for the very, very, very rich.\n       Dole made news recently when he took Time Warner Co. to \n     task for releasing violent movies and rap records with \n     incendiary lyrics. His little tirade was a sham and a smoke \n     screen. Measures Dole supports would enable corporate giants \n     such as Time Warner to grow exponentially.\n       ``Here's the hypocrisy,'' says media activist Andrew Jay \n     Schwartzman. ``Bob Dole sits there on `Meet the Press' and \n     says, yes, he got $23,000 from Time Warner in campaign \n     contributions, and that just proves he can't be bought. He \n     criticizes Time Warner's corporate responsibility and acts \n     like he's being tough on them, but it's in a way that won't \n     affect their bottom line at all.\n       ``Meanwhile he is rushing to the floor with a bill that \n     will deregulate cable rates and expedite the entry of cable \n     into local telephone service, and no company is pressing \n     harder for this bill than--guess who--Time Warner.''\n       Schwartzman, executive director of the Media Access \n     Project, says that the legislation does a lot of ``awful \n     things'' but that the worst may be opening the doors to ``a \n     huge consolidation of broadcast ownership, so that four, \n     five, six or seven companies could own virtually all the \n     television stations in the United States.''\n       Gene Kimmelman, co-director of Consumers Union, calls the \n     legislation ``deregulatory gobbedygook'' and says it would \n     remove virtually every obstacle to concentration of ownership \n     in mass media. The deregulation of cable rates with no \n     competition to cable firmly in place is ``just a travesty,'' \n     Kimmelman says, and allowing more joint ventures and mergers \n     among media giants is ``the most illogical policy decision \n     you could make if you want a competitive marketplace.\n       The legislation would also hand over a new chunk of the \n     broadcast spectrum to commercial broadcasters to do with, and \n     profit from, as they please. Digital compression of broadcast \n     signals will soon make more signal space available, space \n     that Schwartzman refers to as ``beachfront property.'' Before \n     it even exists, Congress wants to give it away.\n       Broadcasters could use the additional channels for pay TV \n     or home shopping channels or anything else that might fatten \n     their bank accounts.\n       There's more. Those politicians who are always saying they \n     want to get the government off our backs don't mind letting \n     it into our homes. Senators have been rushing forth with \n     amendments designed to censor content, whether on cable TV or \n     in the cyberspace of the Internet. The provisions would \n     probably be struck down by courts as antithetical to the \n     First Amendment anyway, but legislators know how well it \n     plays back home when they attack ``indecency'' on the House \n     or Senate floor.\n       Late yesterday Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Trent \n     Lott (R-Miss.) called for an amendment requiring cablecasters \n     to ``scramble'' the signals of adults-only channels offering \n     sexually explicit programming. The signals already are \n     scrambled, and you have to request them and pay for them to \n     get them. Not enough. Feinstein and Lott said: they must be \n     scrambled more.\n       The amendment passed 91-0.\n       It's a mad, mad, mad, mad world.\n       An amendment expected to be introduced today would require \n     that the infamous V-chip be installed in all new television \n     sets, and that networks and stations be forced to encode \n     their broadcasts in compliance. The V-chip would allow \n     parents to prevent violent programs from being seen on their \n     TV sets. Of course, they could turn them off, or switch to \n     another channel, but that's so much trouble. Why not have a \n     Big Brother do it for you?\n       The telecommunications legislation is being sponsored in \n     the Senate by Commerce Committee Chairman Larry Pressler (R-\n     S.D.), whose initial proposal was that all limits on multiple \n     ownership be dropped. Even his supporters laughed at that \n     one.\n       Dole is the one who's ramrodding the legislation through, \n     and it's apparently part of an overall Republican plan for \n     American media, and most parts of the plan are bad. They \n     include defunding and essentially destroying public \n     television, one of the few wee alternatives to commercial \n     broadcasting and its junkiness, and even, in the Newt \n     Gingrich wing of the party, abolishing the Federal \n     Communications Commission, put in place decades ago to \n     safeguard the public's ``interest, convenience and \n     necessity.''\n       It's the interest, convenience and necessity of media \n     magnates that appears to be the sole priority now. ``The big \n     loser in all this, of course, is the public,'' wrote media \n     expert Ken Auletta in a recent New Yorker piece about the \n     lavishness of media contributions to politicians. The \n     communications industry is the sixth-largest PAC giver, \n     Auletta noted.\n       Viacom, a huge media conglomerate, had plans to sponsor a \n     big fund-raising breakfast for Pressler this month, Auletta \n     reported, but the plans were dropped once Auletta started \n     making inquiries: ``Asked through a spokeswoman about the \n     propriety of a committee chairman's shopping for money from \n     industries he regulated, Pressler declined to respond.''\n       The perfect future envisioned by the Republicans and some \n     conservative Democrats seems to consist of media ownership in \n     very few hands, but hands that hold tight rein over the \n     political content of reporting and entertainment programming. \n     Gingrich recently appeared before an assemblage of mass media \n     CEOs at a dinner sponsored by the right-wing Heritage \n     Foundation and reportedly got loud approval when he griped \n     about the oh-so-rough treatment he and fellow conservatives \n     allegedly get from the press.\n       Reuven Frank, former president of NBC News, wrote about \n     that meeting, and other troubling developments, in his column \n     for the New Leader. ``It is daily becoming more obvious that \n     the biggest threat to a free press and the circulation of \n     ideas,'' Frank wrote, ``is the steady absorption of \n     newspapers, television networks and other vehicles of \n     information into enormous corporations that know how to turn \n     knowledge into [[Page S8454]] profit--but are not equally \n     committed to inquiry or debate or to the First Amendment.''\n       The further to the right media magnates are, the more \n     kindly Congress is likely to regard them. Most dramatic and, \n     indeed, obnoxious case in point: Rupert Murdoch, the Fox \n     mogul whom Frank calls ``today's most powerful international \n     media baron.'' The Australian-born Murdoch has consistently \n     received gentle, kid-glove, look-the-other-way treatment from \n     Congress and even the regulatory agencies. When the FCC got \n     brave not long ago and tried to sanction Murdoch for \n     allegedly deceiving the commission about where he got the \n     money to buy six TV stations in 1986, loud voices in Congress \n     cried foul.\n       These included Reps. Jack Fields (R-Tex.) and Mike Oxley \n     (R-Ohio), Daily Variety's headline for the story, ``GOP \n     Lawmakers Stand by Murdoch.'' They always ??? Indeed. Oxley \n     was behind a movement to lift entirely the ban on foreign \n     ownership of U.S. television and radio stations. He wanted \n     that to be part of the House bill, but by some miracle, this \n     is one cockamamie scheme that got quashed.\n       Murdoch, of course, is the man who wanted to give Gingrich \n     a $4.5 million advance to write a book called ``To Renew \n     America,'' until a public outcry forced the House speaker to \n     turn it down. He is still writing the book for Murdoch's \n     HarperCollins publishing company. The huge advance was \n     announced last winter, not long after Murdoch had paid a very \n     friendly visit to Gingrich on the Hill to whine about his \n     foreign ownership problems with the FCC.\n       Everyone knows that America is on the edge of vast \n     uncharted territory where telecommunications is concerned. \n     We've all read about the 500-channel universe and the entry \n     of telephone companies into the cable business and some sort \n     of linking up between home computers and home entertainment \n     centers. In the Senate debate on the deregulation bill last \n     week, senators invoked images of the Gold Rush and the \n     Oklahoma land rush in their visions of this future.\n       But this gold rush is apparently open only to those already \n     rolling in gold, and the land is available only to those who \n     are already big landowners--to a small private club whose \n     members are all enormously wealthy and well connected and, by \n     and large, politically conservative. It isn't very \n     encouraging. In fact, it's enough to make you think that the \n     future is already over. Ah, well. It was nice while it \n     lasted.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                  Time Warner,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 1995.\n     Hon. Larry Pressler,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Pressler: As you requested, the attached \n     signature page confirms that Home Box Office has reached an \n     agreement with the National Cable Television Cooperative, \n     Inc. for HBO programming. As discussed with you and your \n     staff, this agreement is entirely contingent on the removal \n     of the program access provisions at Section 204(b) of S. 652, \n     prior to Senate action on the legislation.\n       On behalf of Time Warner and HBO, I am pleased to report \n     that we have reached this agreement and respectfully request \n     that this provision be removed from the bill at the earliest \n     possible opportunity. Without removal of this provision from \n     the bill, the HBO distribution agreement with the NCTC will \n     be void.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this matter. Please feel \n     free to contact me if I can be of any assistance to you or \n     your staff. I can be reached at my office at 202/457-9225 or \n     at home at 202/483-5052.\n           Warm regards,\n     Timothy A. Boggs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n           Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 1995.\n     Mr. Timothy A. Boggs,\n     Senior Vice President for Public Policy, Time Warner, Inc., \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Boggs: Your faxed letter of June 13 contains \n     misleading statements which do not accurately reflect my \n     position.\n       On May 4, 1995, I met briefly with you, Ron Schmidt and \n     HBO/Time Warner executives, in the presence of my staff, \n     regarding the program access provision of S. 652. During that \n     meeting, HBO/Time Warner urged me to support deletion of the \n     program access provisions of the bill.\n       I stated that the program access provision was of enormous \n     importance to small cable operators, including those in South \n     Dakota. I suggested that if the program providers disliked \n     the provision, they ought to negotiate with the small cable \n     operators to reach an agreement which might address the \n     problems this portion of S. 652 is attempting to solve. \n     Specifically, since Ron Schmidt is from my home state, I \n     suggested that he talk to a small cable operator from South \n     Dakota, Rich Cutler, to see if an industry compromise were \n     possible.\n       At no time during our conversation did I indicate that any \n     specific action by Time Warner would result in deletion of \n     the program access provisions. I have had no further \n     conversations with HBO/Time Warner about this matter since \n     that meeting. My staff has not portrayed my position as being \n     anything other than the industry negotiations suggested on \n     May 4. Nothing I said during our short meeting could be \n     construed as suggesting some sort of quid pro quo, which \n     would be wrong, if not illegal. I resent the inference in \n     your letter that I suggested something other than an \n     industry-negotiated solution.\n       Your letter indicates that failure to delete the program \n     access provisions from the bill would vitiate any negotiated \n     agreement HBO/Time Warner had reached with the small cable \n     operators. While HBO/Time Warner is free to negotiate \n     contracts as they see fit, such tactics, in my opinion, \n     cannot be considered as good faith negotiations. Your letter \n     implies that I tacitly approved such a condition, which is \n     not the case.\n       I expect you to send this letter to the same individuals \n     who received your letter to me. Your letter is misleading, \n     and does not accurately characterize my position as presented \n     in my May 4 meeting with HBO/Time Warner.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Larry Pressler,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I presume that within the hour, we will get \nto final passage of this very important legislation. I think it is \nappropriate that we take note of a little bit of the effort that went \ninto it.\n  First, I want to refer again to the title of this bill: \nTelecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995. I think \nthat is really what it is, but it has been a monumental undertaking. \nYou have had the behemoths of the industries on both sides struggling \nmightily to protect their interests--their turf. Everybody has wanted, \nas the saying has been repeated on the floor earlier, ``a fair \nadvantage.'' The goal of the committee has been to try to make sure \nthat it was just fair to everybody.\n  It has been very difficult. A lot of effort has gone into it, but I \nbelieve we have accomplished the goal we have set out to accomplish. \nAnd I believe that we will have an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote when \nwe get to final passage.\n  So I wanted to take this early opportunity, in advance of the vote to \nthank and commend the managers of this bill, Chairman Pressler and the \nranking member, Senator Hollings of South Carolina, the former \nchairman, who have really done outstanding work.\n  I also want to commend the majority and minority leaders, Senator \nDole and Senator Daschle. I have commented to both of them that I \nbelieve this is the best example I have seen this year of our leaders \nworking together and our managers working together for what is in the \nbest interest of the country, not the best interest of one party or the \nother, or one segment of the telecommunications industry or the other, \nbut what is the right thing to do.\n  It has been a long struggle, and it would not have been possible \nwithout the type of bipartisan cooperation and strong leadership that \nwe have seen here. The legislation is truly a remarkable achievement. \nFor 20 years, Congress has been trying, struggling to get comprehensive \ncommunications reform--without success. But we are on the verge of \nseeing that happen.\n  So this is a historic act that will bring, I think, a tremendous \nboost to our economy and our standing communications policy that will \ntake us into the 21st century.\n  I believe that we will see a tremendous growth and expansion in this \narea--new innovation, new ideas, with the utilities being involved, \nalong with the Bells, the long distance companies and cable companies. \nThere are going to be jobs created and the economy will grow and expand \nin this area. As a member of the Commerce Committee, I am proud to have \nbeen a part of this effort.\n  I commend the chairman, in particular, because I do not know of \nanybody else that could have done it at this particular time. He has \nbeen persuasive and doggedly persistent. I wish I had a nickel for \nevery time that he said to the distinguished leader, ``We are ready to \ngo. When can we get on the schedule? Is it alright if we go ahead and \nmove it?''\n  How did the Chairman do it? He opened the process to the full \ncommittee. He involved everybody. He went to all of the committee \nmembers. I remember the first meeting we had in his office. Yes, he \nworked with the Republicans, but he did not stop there. He went to the \nDemocrats and he did not talk through people to the former \n[[Page S8455]] chairman; he went directly to him. When we got our first \ndraft, he hand-delivered it to the Members. The leadership was involved \nevery step of the way. Months of negotiations were held before we had \nthe eventual agreement, and when we finally agreed upon the core, the \nentry test, he stuck with it in the markup and on the floor. Also, the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina stuck with it.\n  So I just have to say Senator Pressler is one who gets the job done. \nHe certainly did it here. The country will be better off because of his \nleadership on this bill and on the committee. I look forward to working \nwith him in many other instances in the future.\n  Senator Hollings' leadership and cooperation deserves great praise. I \nhave had him on the other side of issues, and I did not appreciate it a \nbit. He was tough. But, boy, is it fun when he is with you. It has \nreally been a pleasure to work with him. He is a man of his word. When \nhe tells you he is going to stay put, he does--even when he has \npressure on his side of the aisle not to. This would not have been \npossible without his cooperation, experience, and his perseverance.\n  I also thank some tremendous staff people: Paddy Link, staff director \nfor Senator Pressler, and his counselors, Donald McClellan and Katie \nKing. For Senator Hollings, I thank Kevin Curtain, John Winhausen, who \nhas been around on this issue for some time, and Kevin Joseph. For \nSenator Dole, I appreciate the efforts by David Wilson, and for Senator \nDaschle, Jim Webber. I have never seen many staff people work so well \ntogether. They worked days and nights and weekends when we were back in \nour States, and they struggled along with it. So I think they deserve a \nlot of credit. I thank my own staff assistant, Chip Pickering for his \nwork on this issue. I have called him the ``peacemaker.'' Blessed are \nthe peacemakers, for most of them are dead. Many times I thought he was \ngoing to get himself killed and me, too, because he had me in the \nmiddle of my friends on both sides. So I appreciate the effort he put \nforward.\n  I want to thank some other people, like Larry Johnson, Kelly Algood, \nBernie Ebbers, Bernard Jacobs, and Eddie Fritz. All of these are \nMississippians who have a direct interest and knowledge in this area. \nThey are on the long distance side, they are on the Bell side, they are \non the cable side, they are utility folks and broadcasters.\n  Although it is difficult in legislation of this magnitude to agree on \nall issues, I appreciate their insight, assistance and understanding of \nwhat I was trying to do. They made it possible for me to try to be \nhelpful as we moved the legislation along toward what will be right for \nthe country and fair to the competitors and the consumers.\n  Again, I congratulate the managers. I am proud of them and proud to \nhave been associated with them. This is truly historic. In many ways, \nthis bill is every bit as big and as important as the balanced budget \nresolution we passed. It will have a tremendous impact on the economy, \nand I believe it will greatly help our country's future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, if I may for a minute, I want to thank \nthe Senator from Mississippi, and Chip, his able assistant. I will be \nsaying more later about thanking people. But the bill would not have \nhappened without him. Every time I went to him as my deputy leader, he \nwas there. I do not know how you get enough hours in the day to do all \nthe things we ask you, but you were there, and I thank you very much \nfor your kind comments.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me also join in my thanks to the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi. When we really got into \ntrouble, I went to the Senator from Mississippi. He paved the way all \nthe time in the 2 years previous here working on this bill and, of \ncourse, all this year. I cannot thank him enough. We could not have had \nthis bill without his leadership.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I cannot help but observe the thankfulness \nthat is going on here. I was standing here listening, and I thought to \nmyself, in this Chamber the highest praise is usually reserved for \nthose who are about to vote against you.\n  I stand to give credit to the Senator from South Dakota. I think the \nSenator from South Dakota has demonstrated real skill in moving this \nlegislation. I am, of course, indebted to the leadership of not only \nthe Senator from South Dakota, but the Senator from South Carolina, \nwith whom I have worked carefully for a long, long while.\n  These have been difficult issues, no question about that. We are \ndealing with literally hundreds of billions of dollars in the American \neconomy with interest groups that have very substantial stakes in the \noutcome of this legislation. I understand the passion with which some \npeople stand here and debate to push their positions.\n  I started out very hopeful about this legislation and voted for it \ncoming out of the committee. I think there are elements of this \nlegislation that will be good for this country. I remain concerned, \nhowever, about the issue of concentration of ownership in the \ntelevision and radio broadcasting. I remain concerned about the lack of \nthe role of the Justice Department in being able to adequately enforce \nwhat I consider to be vital antitrust issues. For those reasons, I do \nnot feel I am going to be able to vote for this bill on final passage. \nI say that with some disappointment because I had hoped as we started \nthis process that we would be able to successfully amend it on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  The Senator from South Dakota and the Senator from South Carolina \nwill recall when we had the markup in the Commerce Committee, the issue \nwas to try to move this bill along as quickly as possible. I understood \nthat morning the need in a couple of hours to move this bill out of \ncommittee. But we discussed at some length there about the opportunity \nto offer amendments on the floor of the Senate and to try to correct \nsome of the areas that represented concerns.\n  I voted for it coming out of committee, but I did, in the committee, \nexpress the very concerns that I brought to the floor about \nconcentration of ownership of television and radio stations and my \nconcerns about an adequate role for the Justice Department on the issue \nof RBOC entry into long distance.\n  When I came to the floor, we had an opportunity to fully debate them. \nI compliment the two leaders on the floor. They were very cooperative. \nFor that I am appreciative.\n  I suffered one of these unusual experiences of having won briefly and \nthen lost on an amendment I cared a great deal about: that is my \namendment on television ownership.\n  We now restrict ownership to 12 television stations and we limit the \naudience reach to 25 percent. These limits prevent a concentration of \nmedia ownership in this country. This bill says that there is no \nlimitation on how many stations one can own, as long as you do not \ncover more than 35 percent of the country.\n  I do not support that, and I brought an amendment to the floor that \nwould have retained the existing limits. We debated it and voted.\n  At the end of the vote, my amendment won by a vote of 51-48. It \ntaught me a lesson--this whole set of circumstances--because although I \nwon by a vote of 51-48, an hour and a half later, it turns out some \nfolks had new opinions about this issue after having debated it for \nhours and days, and we had another vote.\n  Then I learned that not all Members are equal in this Chamber. Some \nhave a better grip in wrenching arms than others, and I will be darned \nif I did not lose. You win for an hour, and I guess you lose forever, \nin these circumstances.\n  For that reason, I do not feel I can vote for the bill on final \npassage. I did want to explain briefly that I view the issue of \ntelecommunications reform as critically important to the United States. \nIts development, its opportunity for this country is a very significant \nissue.\n  I admire the work of the two Members who brought this to the floor \nand have spent days on the floor. I wish very much that the couple of \nmajor amendments I had offered would have been adopted, in which case I \nwould have been one to cast a yes vote on final passage. I hope the \nmanagers will understand the reason for my no vote.\n  I expect when the votes are counted, this legislation will advance. I \nstill [[Page S8456]] have some hope that when this bill comes out of \nconference committee the issues I have mentioned will be addressed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nto address the Senate for not to exceed 12 minutes as in morning \nbusiness.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Inhofe pertaining to the introduction of S. 928 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are currently on amendment No. 1341 of the \ntelecommunications bill.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to \nspeak for 5 minutes on the bill but not on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I come to the floor to say that I have \nconcluded, after considerable debate with myself, not to vote for this \nbill on final passage. It was not a decision easily reached. This is an \nimmensely complex bill. Frankly, there are very few Senators in the \nU.S. Senate who really understand the full complexity and ramifications \nof this bill.\n  My decision is not based on whether or not the baby Bells can get \ninto the long distance telephone market. That is a problem for me. But \nit is not nearly the problem of the unlimited power of people owning an \nunlimited number of radio stations and television stations, which I \nconsider to be highly dangerous.\n  I heard the Senator from Florida, Senator Graham, this morning say \nthat Thomas Jefferson once asked which would he choose between a free \ngovernment and a free press? He said he would always take a free press \nbecause you cannot have a free government without a free press.\n  These airwaves of radio and television stations can only be allocated \nby the Government. You cannot allow people willy-nilly to take a \nparticular channel in the airwaves for a radio or television station. \nThat is what the Federal Communications Commission was set up to do, \nallocate those things. And for years the Government gave away billions \nand billions of dollars' worth of television station channels and radio \nstation channels. It has only been in recent years that the Government \nhas decided it was being taken and it ought to start making people bid \nat public auction for those airwaves. Incidentally, it has helped a \ngreat deal in our efforts to balance the budget. We have been getting \nbillions of dollars for radio and television station channels on the \nairwaves.\n  There was a time not too long ago in this country when you were \nprohibited from owning a television station and a newspaper in the same \ncommunity. Now, under this bill, you can own 500 radio stations, 1,000 \nradio stations. You can own as many television stations as you want, as \nlong as you do not control more than 35 percent of the market as \ndetermined by the Federal Communications Commission. Can you imagine \nsome people--I will leave it to your imagination, and I will leave it \nto your imagination as to who it may be--can you imagine some of the \npeople in this country who are very big in telecommunications owning \n1,000 radio stations; 100 television stations? Let us face it, the \nnewspapers are not nearly as powerful as the television stations. It is \na concentration of communications power that I think is dangerous to \nthe country.\n  So I believe that some ideological bent or belief, not an empirical \nbelief but an ideological belief, a philosophical belief that the free \nmarket will solve this problem--turn them all loose to buy and sell \nthese stations however they will--it has not even worked in a lot of \nthe rest of our society. That is the reason we have an antitrust \ndivision down at the Justice Department. It was the very reason Teddy \nRoosevelt saw that the people were suffering from the gigantic trusts \nof his day. So from that evolved the Sherman Act, the Robinson-Patman \nAct and all the other acts that protect people from what can become a \ntyranny.\n  I think it was Madison who said--and I sometimes wonder what James \nMadison would think today--but it was James Madison who said the \nCongress, the Congress is what stands between the people and what would \notherwise surely become a tyrannical leader, tyrannical government.\n  Mr. President, for all of those reasons history tells me we are about \nto make a colossal mistake that will be very difficult to undo when we \ndiscover it someplace down the road.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thought, with the permission of the \nSenator from South Carolina, I might speak for 6 minutes or so before \nthe final vote.\n  Mr. President, this debate we have had on this bill has opened all \neyes to the dazzling possibilities provided by our new, emerging \ninformation technologies. I will quote from some of the speech that I \ngave several days ago during this debate.\n\n       I can imagine workers in rural Minnesota telecommuting to \n     and from work as far away as New York or Washington without \n     ever having to leave their homes or families.\n      Or schoolchildren in a distressed Minneapolis school \n     district reading the latest publications at the Library of \n     Congress via thin glowing fiber cables--\n  Mr. President, this really excites me as a teacher.\n\n       or rural health care providers on the iron range consulting \n     with the top medical researchers at the Mayo Clinic in \n     Rochester to better treat their patients.\n\n  Mr. President, all of this is before us. I felt like this bill \npresented to each Senator a daunting--an exciting but also daunting--\nresponsibility. The concern that I have has to do with whether or not \nwe can make sure that there will be true competition, and that this \ntechnology and information will truly be available to everyone in the \nNation, not just the most privileged or the most wealthy.\n  What has disappointed me the most--and the Senator from South \nCarolina has to be one of the colleagues I most respect here in the \nSenate even when we disagree--is that over and over again where there \nhave been amendments to I think assure competition and to also protect \nconsumers--I am not just concerned about the alphabet soup \ncorporations. I am also concerned about the people that live in \nFerguson Falls or live in Virginia, Minnesota, or live in Minneapolis \nor St. Paul or Northfield. I was hoping that at least we could build in \nmore protection for consumers and more guarantees that there would in \nfact be the competition that we all talk about.\n  While I fully appreciate the potential of this legislation, I am \nreally worried about where we are heading because I think there is \ngoing to be entirely too much concentration of power.\n  I would just simply build on the remarks of my colleague from \nArkansas. The media is the only private enterprise in the United States \nof America that has first amendment protection. The reason for that, \nthough we did not have the same kind of communication technologies we \nhave today back in the days of Thomas Jefferson, was that the Founders \nof our Nation understood the importance of the media and the importance \nof information. And the importance of it was to contribute to an \ninformed electorate. We are talking about something very precious here.\n  I see a piece of legislation that will lead to way too much \nconcentration of power, way too much concentration of power in a very, \nvery important and decisive area of public life in the United States of \nAmerica. That has to do with radio and television, and information, and \nwho controls the flow of information.\n  So, Mr. President, I was hoping that some of the amendments that were \nintroduced on the floor of the Senate that I think really would have \nprovided the consumer protection, that would have provided regular \npeople--I do not mean in a pejorative sense, but I mean in a positive \nway--with some protection and which would have assured some competition \nas opposed to more and more concentration of power, more and more very, \nvery vital and important areas being taken over by just a few \nconglomerates. It did not happen.\n  I think we are making a mistake if we pass this piece of legislation. \nI will therefore, vote against it. [[Page S8457]] \n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I will be very, very brief. I want to take 2 \nor 3 minutes if I could to congratulate the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Pressler, and the ranking member, Senator Hollings, who have \nstruggled long and through many difficult situations--and that I have \nbeen with them on--on many occasions. This is a bill that is \ncriticized, that as a bill is easy to vote against because voting \nagainst the bill, if there is ever any problem, you can always say, \n``Well, I voted against the legislation.''\n  I happen to feel that this bill is very important, and I rise in \nsupport of the legislation that has been deliberated on, been written \nand rewritten so many, many times. I would have to say that at least \neveryone has had their chance at an input on this piece of legislation, \nthrough what we worked on last year, reported out but never got passed, \nand then taken up by Senator Pressler when he became chairman of the \ncommittee; worked very hard and very closely with Senator Hollings.\n  Certainly the bill before us, the telecommunications reform bill, is \na good bill, although not a perfect one. A bill as complicated and as \ndetailed as this one could be, I simply point out that it has many good \nfeatures. It includes strong education provisions, including the Snowe-\nRockefeller-Exon-Kerrey educational library, and rural health care \ndiscount provision.\n  It includes important market protections, including the farm team \nprovisions of last year, all of which were incorporated here in the \nbill this year. It includes the Grassley-Exon infrastructure sharing \nprovision. It includes the Communications Decency Act that we debated \nand passed yesterday. It includes a revolutionary, and I think very \npositive, TV ratings system. It includes a strongly needed and fair \nuniversal service language. And it abandons the one-fits-all regulation \nthat has been a problem for a long time.\n  The cable provisions in this bill are still a disappointment to this \nSenator but were improved somewhat from the committee bill.\n  Final passage will take America's telecommunications industry off \nhold.\n  Mr. President, it is time to move on and pass this legislation.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I thank our friend from Nebraska for his \nnumerous efforts on this bill as time has gone forward. He and his \nstaff have been a key part of working on it. I thank him very much for \nhis spirit of cooperation.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend from South Dakota.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have been listening to the speeches \non the floor from the different committee members of the Commerce \nCommittee, and it sounds like a funeral from time to time on the floor \nof the Senate. There are so many accolades and potential eulogies. But, \nin fact, I have to say that the accolades are really warranted, and it \nis because this bill has been so tough and so hard fought. And it has \nlasted for so long.\n  What we have seen on the floor is the tip of the iceberg. The work \nhas been going on in committee nonstop for so many months that it is \ncorrect for the committee members who are so aware of all that has been \ndone to be able to say job well done.\n  It is a job well done not because anyone feels victorious. It is a \njob well done because nobody feels victorious. It is a job well done \nbecause it has been a tough battle. It is because people that we \nrespect so much, the entrepreneurs in the cable industry, the \nentrepreneurs in the long-distance industry, the local providers, the \nBell companies that have been in business a long time but have made \nhuge capital investments based on a regulatory scheme that now is going \nto be taken away--everyone in this business I respect because they are \nproviding jobs. They are doing what we must do to continue to provide \njobs in our country.\n  But what we are trying to do here is open the door even more. We are \ntrying to provide more job opportunities. We are trying to provide more \nopportunities for the entrepreneurs in this country to go out and \nimprove the technology and become a competitor throughout the \ntelecommunications field.\n  So it has been a tough thing to balance the needs of all of these \npeople who are out there on the front line spending their money for \ncapital to go out and try to build a business that will make a \ndifference for the consumers of America, that will add to the quality \nprogramming, add to the quality of telecommunications and telephone \nsystems and video programming, and to also provide lower prices for \nthose consumers.\n  So the fact that there are no victories here is a victory in itself. \nI think that if we look at the overall, we are only one step, but there \nis a finish line that we have not yet crossed. After we vote this bill \nout of the Senate--and I believe we will in a very short time--we are \ngoing to go to the House. The House is going to pass a bill, and there \nwill be differences, and those are going to have to be worked out in \nconference. And once again, all of the entrepreneurs and all of the \npeople who have built businesses on a regulatory scheme are going to \ncome in and say, ``We have been treated in an unfair way.'' And we are \ngoing to have to once again do a balance between the House and Senate \nversions of this bill. But we must do it because technology has leapt \nover the regulatory environment that we have in our telecommunications \nindustry, and we have a lawsuit that has caused deregulation by a \njudge, and in fact it is just not the right way to have deregulation. \nIt does not cover enough of the area to be fair to all people \nconcerned. The only way that we can be fair is to have everyone at the \nsame table and everyone give and everyone take a little bit.\n  So while I do not agree with everything in this bill and while \nprobably no one who is voting on it agrees with everything in it, I \nwish to commend the chairman, the ranking member and the members of the \ncommittee who have put their small differences aside to do something \nthat would move forward this very important step that I think will be \nable to bring as much as $3 billion, maybe more, into our economy with \nnew jobs and new opportunities and new technologies that we can then \nexport all over the world. It is an exciting bill. It is an exciting \ntime. It is an exciting opportunity for this Senate to take that one \nstep forward. Let us do what we can now and be ready to continue this \nfight until it is finished.\n  Mr. President, I commend those who have worked on it, and I thank you \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I again want to praise Senator Hutchison \nand her staffer, Amy Henderson, for the many hours of work they have \ndone. I am going to recognize the staff. I do not know if I mentioned \nthis before, but our staffs met night after night and on weekends, in \naddition to Senators participating. But the bill would not have \nhappened without the Senator from Texas, and I thank her very, very \nmuch.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me also join in my gratitude for \nSenator Hutchison's leadership. We all on the committee worked very \nclosely.\n  A moment ago my distinguished colleague from Arkansas gave me the \ntheme that comes to mind. He concluded his observation that he was \nprepared to vote against the bill; that it would be a colossal mistake \nto pass this bill.\n  Let me say in a word it would be a colossal mistake not to pass this \nbill. I came to the Senate almost 29 years ago, and they were talking \nthen. And I immediately got on the Communications Subcommittee, and I \ncan see Senator John Pastore, the chairman, talking about revising the \n1934 Communications Act. I worked very closely with Senator Goldwater \nwhen he was the chairman, and I have been the chairman of the \nsubcommittee and the full committee, and we worked time and time again \nand we were prepared, as everyone now knows--the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Dakota, now our chairman, was working with us--in the last \nclosing moments to pass the bill last year.\n  It would be a colossal mistake not to pass this bill. This bill is an \nexcellent bill. It did not do all things, but the [[Page S8458]] truth \nof the matter is the experience has been, with the breakup of AT, \nthat what we have now is 500 competitors in the long distance market. \nAnd with this bill by breaking up the regional Bell operating \ncompanies--this is how you legislatively, not by court order, but \nlegislatively break up the monopolies of the local exchange--we are \ngoing to bring in hundreds and thousands of competitors. We are doing \nthis in the most deliberate, measured fashion possible in that we \nappreciate that we in America have the best communications system in \nthe entire world.\n  We are not repairing the communications system in that light. What we \nare trying to do is remove the obstruction in the middle of the \ninformation superhighway, namely, the Government. With all the plethora \nof rules, hearings, injunctions and precedents, we are finding now that \nthe judicial branch is totally overwhelmed; it could not possibly deal \nwith the explosion of this technology. No one individual could.\n  On the other hand, we are going to get communications policy back \ninto the policymaking body of our Government, namely, the Congress and \nits administrator, the Federal Communications Commission.\n  We have an outstanding bill. Senator Pressler has done an outstanding \njob. I am ready, as I understand, to prepare to vote on the Dole \namendment, the Breaux amendment, which will be agreed to, and then \nfinal passage.\n  As I stand here, I have been moved, as all Senators do, from the \nsubject of the week--almost like Sealtest Ice Cream; we have the flavor \nof the week--we move to the other particular issue at hand. But staff \non the other side of the aisle has been duly recognized, and I would \nagain recognize Kevin Curtin and John Windhausen and Kevin Joseph, as \nwell as Jim Drewry, Sylvia Cikins and Pierre Golpira, on our staff. \nThey have worked not just during the 5 days of the week but weekends \nand evenings, around the clock, on and on again to keep us on a \ndeliberate, measured, fair course of entering into competition and \nmaintaining at the same time the wonderful universal service that we \nhave.\n  There is a tremendous balancing act that is involved here, and no one \nshould run a touchdown in the wrong direction with the idea that, yes, \nwe could have gotten in more competition or more protection for the \nconsumers. We have gotten in the basic competition and the basic \nprotections that were necessary and even more.\n  So with that said, I hope we can move to the vote on the Dole \namendment, Mr. President.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, when we receive notification from the \nleadership on both sides--I am certainly eager--we will vote. We are \nawaiting word.\n  I welcome all Senators who have statements.\n  I, too, wish to thank my friend, Senator Hollings, for his great \nleadership. He has been working on this bill for years and years, and \nhe got a similar earlier version through the Commerce Committee last \nyear, where he has done a terrific job. He has been great to work with. \nWithout his efforts, we would not have gotten this bill out of the \ncommittee or to this point. He has helped bring broad bipartisan \nsupport and has shown great courage and independence. He has done a \nterrific job.\n  Extraordinary effort has been expended on the measure's birth and \nultimate passage. I have already talked about the process the staff \nwent through in drafting this bill. This was not drafted outside of the \nCapitol as some have said. It was drafted in long nights and weekends \nby bipartisan staff working together at the direction of the Senators.\n  I wish to thank my committee chief of staff, Paddy Link, who has \nworked tirelessly on this bill. She is a first class professional \nwithout whom this telecommunications bill would not have passed. \nCommunications counsels Katie King, who has done a terrific job in \nworking diplomatically with the staffs of many Senators with an \ninterest in the legislation, and Donald McClellan, who has worked days, \nnights, and weekends for months on this bill. Together, their efforts \nhave helped shape this historic legislation. Special thanks must also \ngo to staff assistants Sam Patmore, James Linen, and Antilla Trotter.\n  Senator Hollings' staff has been enormously helpful in this effort. \nCommerce Committee Democratic chief counsel and staff director Kevin \nCurtin has been of invaluable assistance in this bipartisan effort, \nwith his legislative drafting skills and knowledge of procedure.\n Counsels John Windhausen and Kevin Joseph brought their great \nexpertise to the task; and staff assistant, Yvonne Portee. The good \nworking relationship our committee staff has developed is the major \nreason we have been successful in developing a bill.\n\n  Lloyd Ator of the Commerce Committee bipartisan staff deserves thanks \nfrom both sides of the aisle for his legislative drafting skills.\n  Additionally, my heartfelt thanks are extended to the following staff \nmembers who have devoted substantial hours working with the committee \nin the process of getting this measure to the floor and passed. This is \nmore or less the team that worked on the legislation. I used to go up \nand occasionally bring them some pizza. I do not know if people in the \noutside world realize how hard this staff on Capitol Hill works, \nespecially when there is a major bill coming up.\n  I want to thank: David Wilson from Majority Leader Dole's office for \nhis assistance in getting the bill to the floor and for working with my \nstaff; Elizabeth Greene, for her invaluable assistance while the bill \nwas on the floor; Jim Weber, from the Democratic Leader Daschle's \noffice for his assistance; Chip Pickering with Senator Lott; and, Earl \nComstock with Senator Stevens. I must add that night after night, Chip \nPickering helped lead a bipartisan team. Chip will someday be one of \nour Nation's finest leaders. Earl Comstock is one of the brightest, \nhard- working people I have ever encountered.\n  I also thank: Hance Haney with Senator Packwood; Mark Buse with \nSenator McCain; Mark Baker with Senator Burns; Gene Bumpus with Senator \nGorton; Amy Henderson with Senator Hutchison; Angela Campbell with \nSenator Snowe; Mike King with Senator Ashcroft; Margaret Cummisky with \nSenator Inouye; Martha Moloney with Senator Ford; Chris McLean with \nSenator Exon; Cheryl Bruner with Senator Rockefeller; Scott Bunton and \nCarole Grunberg with Senator Kerry of Massachusetts; Mark Ashby with \nSenator Breaux; Andy Vermilye with Senator Bryan; Greg Rohde with \nSenator Dorgan; and Carol Ann Bischoff with Senator Kerrey of Nebraska.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/15/senate-section/article/S8449-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8458-S8460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DOD UNMATCHED DISBURSEMENTS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, many times in the last several months, I \nhave addressed my colleagues in this Chamber on the subject of the bad \naccounting system in the Defense Department and particularly the \nsubject of unmatched disbursements, a subject that involves the \nprinciple that if you are going to spend the taxpayers' money, you \nought to be able to show exactly what that money went for.\n  The Defense Department has accumulated several billions of dollars \nover the last several years in money that has been spent. It is very \ndifficult for them or anybody else to show exactly what that money has \nbought: A service or commodity.\n  So the unmatched disbursement problem at the Pentagon has been a \nproblem that has been simmering on the back burner for several years. \nNow, all of a sudden, it is on the front burner, and the pot is boiling \nover.\n  The Department of Defense is getting hammered with bad publicity \nabout this problem. Most of the heat is directed at the Defense \nDepartment's chief financial officer, Mr. John Hamre. He is fighting \nback, countering with damage control, sending letters and papers to \nallies on the Hill. He is trying to debunk all the criticism being \ndirected his way.\n  As I have said many times, I think that Mr. Hamre is trying to do a \ngood job. I think his heart is in the right place, but career \nbureaucrats under him are feeding him bad information.\n  In a nutshell, Mr. President, this is the problem: The Department of \nDefense does not match disbursements with obligations before making \npayments. Unless the matches are made, [[Page S8459]] then we do not \nknow how the money is being spent. Of course, this leaves the \nDepartment of Defense accounts vulnerable to theft and abuse.\n  DOD accounts are vulnerable to the tune of at least $28 billion. \nThose are not my numbers, those are the Department of Defense numbers. \nMr. Hamre is desperately trying to diffuse all the criticism. Mr. Hamre \nsays that my arguments that I have been stating on the floor over the \nlast several months are baloney. He says the Department has, in his \nwords, ``certified receipts for every penny spent.''\n  Mr. President, he said that in his latest rebuttal, and his rebuttal \nappears on page A15 of the June 10, 1995, Washington Post. I ask \nunanimous consent to print that article in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 10, 1995]\n\n                    Pentagon Spending: by the Books\n\n                           (By John J. Hamre)\n\n       Colman McCarthy's May 23 column ``The Pentagon's \n     Accountability Problem'' so badly distorts my statements on \n     Department of Defense financial management that the record \n     must be corrected.\n       McCarthy implies that I am a naive dupe absolving \n     government workers and defense contractors of any financial \n     responsibility. He further suggests that our reform efforts \n     are merely verbal smokescreens to mask business as usual. \n     Nothing could be farther from the truth.\n       It is clear McCarthy did not attend the May 16 \n     congressional hearing on which he bases his column. Had he \n     been there he would have learned that not a penny of taxpayer \n     dollars has been ``lost,'' as his article implies--since the \n     crux of the matter is not ``phantom payments'' but outmoded \n     accounting procedures.\n       For every disbursement he characterizes as lost, we have a \n     validated receipt with an independent confirmation that the \n     government received the goods and services. He also would \n     have learned that in the past 18 months we researched and \n     correctly accounted for $20 billion in problem disbursements \n     inherited from a decade of defense spending. He would have \n     learned that during the same time period we also froze more \n     than 20,000 payments to more than 1,500 contractors until we \n     could correct underlying accounting problems.\n       He would have learned that we are reversing a 25-year-old \n     ``pay first, account later'' policy. Beginning this summer, \n     we will match disbursements to accounting records--not just \n     against valid, certified invoices as we do now--before \n     payments are made. And he would have learned that we created \n     a special financial fraud detection organization.\n       Unfortunately none of this was reported by McCarthy, and I \n     am unaware of any effort on his part to attempt to gather the \n     facts.\n       The public has every right to know the extent of the \n     Pentagon's accounting problems, as well as the efforts in \n     place to remedy them. Your readers deserve far better than \n     McCarthy provided.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to state, where he says that \n``the crux of the matter is not phantom payments but outmoded \naccounting procedures,'' I will agree with him on the outmoded \naccounting procedures, but I will not believe that that is an excuse \nfor getting off the hook. It is designed to put us at ease, Mr. \nPresident. I think it is a neat distraction. Outmoded accounting \nprocedures are seemingly harmless, are they not? They pose no threat, \nseemingly, to the security and the control of money. But that is a long \nway from the truth.\n  To assure us that no money has been lost, Mr. Hamre makes one bold \nassertion, and he makes it from this article. It says:\n\n       For every disbursement he characterizes as lost, we have a \n     validated receipt with an independent confirmation that the \n     Government received goods and services.\n\n  I think I know what Mr. Hamre is trying to say. He is trying to say \nfor every Defense Department payment, he has a receipt to prove that \nthe goods and services were actually received. This was brought up in \nsome recent testimony of Mr. Hamre on the Hill. He used form DD250 as \nan example of ``validated receipts''--his words. Those are his words, \n``validated receipts for goods handled.''\n  The DOD form DD250 is called the Materials Inspection and Receiving \nReport. I have a copy of that here.\n  This particular one that I have in my hand is for the purchase of a \nhigh-powered amplifier for the Air Force Milstar satellite.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print this in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                Material Inspection and Receiving Report\n\n       Proc.

For starters, it gives us the contract \nnumber: F19628-89-C-0131.\n  It tells us that the Milstar amplifier was shipped on December 8, \n1992.\n  It tells us the contractor was Raytheon, Burlington, MA\n  It tells us the amplifier's destination was McClellan Air Force Base, \nCA.\n  It gives us the national stock number: 5895-01-325-8555MZ.\n  It gives us the amplifier's serial number: 1005.\n  It tells us that the unit price for the amplifier is $363,735.\n  Remember that figure, because I am going to tell you how this item \nwas sold for $20 in just a minute.\n  Finally, it tells us the name of the Government official who accepted \nthe amplifier and certified that it met contract specs. The certifying \nofficial's name shown is D. Albrizio.\n  Well, Mr. Hamre wants us to believe that DD250, the form I inserted \ninto the Record, is proof that the Government got what it paid for.\n  Now, the Air Force got the Milstar amplifier, right? No, they did not \nget it. We paid for an amplifier all right. Yes, we did. But we did not \nget it--at least not right away.\n  A citizen in North Carolina--Mr. Roger Spillman--got this $363,000 \namplifier instead. While there is a long trail of signed certified \nreceipts proving--and I use that advisedly--that DOD received it, the \namplifier never showed up at the warehouse where it belonged.\n  First, it turned up as something identified as unknown overage cargo \nat the San Francisco terminal of the Watkins Motor Lines. Watkins had a \nDOD contract to deliver it to the McClellan Air Force Base. It was held \nthere in San Francisco for 30 days. When no one showed up to claim it, \nit was shipped to Watkins salvage warehouse in Lakeland, FL. The \nMilstar amplifier was stored in the salvage warehouse for about 9 \nmonths.\n  Now, at that point, it was declared excess cargo and shipped to DRS, \nInc., in Advance, NC, for auction. The public auction was held on \nOctober 25, 1993. The bidding started at $20. Within 45 seconds, Mr. \nRoger Spillman was the proud new owner of the Milstar amplifier, and it \ncost him exactly $75. Remember, for the original product we paid \n$363,000-plus.\n  The Air Force did not know the amplifier was missing until the owner, \nMr. Spillman, called to request the instructions manual because he \nwanted to use it. That was almost a year after DOD officials had shown \nus this validated receipt of the amplifier.\n  Mr. President, what lesson does the case of the missing Milstar \namplifier teach us? It is this: Despite Mr. [[Page S8460]] Hamre's \nassurances to the contrary, the form that I have been reading from \ntoday--the DD250--provides no guarantee that DOD gets what it pays for. \nAll the form does is tell DOD what is supposed to be on the loading \ndock or stocked in some warehouse. It does not mean that it is really \nthere.\n  The DD250 is not an internal control device.\n  The DD250 will not tell us whether the item received was indeed \nordered.\n  The DD250 will not tell you whether the price paid was the price \nagreed to in the contract.\n  The DD250 will not tell you whether your accounts contain enough \nmoney to cover the payment.\n  The DD250 will not warn you if you are about to make an underpayment, \noverpayment, or erroneous payment.\n  To protect and control public money, then, the Defense Department \nmust match disbursements with obligations before payments are made. \nThat is the way it must be done.\n  These DD250 forms are no substitute for nitty-gritty accounting work.\n  If Mr. Hamre wants to do effective damage control and silence his \ncritics, then he needs to go back to the drawing board. He needs to \nfind a device that addresses the source of the criticism. These forms--\nthe DD250's--miss the mark, and miss it completely. The DD250's do not \nprotect and control the people's money.\n  Mr. Hamre is the DOD comptroller, and he ought to know all these \nthings.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield back any time I may have.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/15/senate-section/article/S8458-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8460-S8480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION AND DEREGULATION ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n                 AMENDMENT NO. 1283, TELEVISION CONTENT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to address the issue of television \nviolence, which we debated earlier this week in the context of this \ntelecommunications bill. I opposed the Lieberman-Conrad amendment on \nthis subject, but I strongly supported the Simon-Dole sense of the \nSenate amendment. I want to take this occasion to briefly sketch out my \nthinking on this subject.\n  I completely agree with my colleagues about the terrible effects of \ntelevision violence on our children. The average American child \nwitnesses 8,000 murders and 100,000 other acts of violence on \ntelevision by the time he or she finishes elementary school. That is \nsimply unacceptable. The American Medical Association, the National \nCommission on Children and other interested groups and individuals have \nspoken persuasively about the effect of this incessant violence on our \nchildren.\n  I believe that something must be done about this terrible problem, \nbut I also believe that it should be up to parents and the industry \nitself to accomplish that end. This is an area where I do not believe \nCongress should be mandating a solution. Especially in the context of \nthis deregulatory bill, we should not be creating federal commissions \nto promulgate highly prescriptive new rules in areas we should stay out \nof.\n  I was also concerned about some of the vague language in the Conrad-\nLieberman amendment. It refers, for instance, to ``the level of \nviolence or objectionable content.'' We might--might--be able to come \nto agreement on a definition of ``violence,'' but I do not see how we \ncould reach a consensus on the meaning of ``objectionable content.'' \nEveryone would have a different view.\n  As consumers and parents, we must all do a better job of turning the \ndial when programming to which we object comes across our television \nset. If that were to happen in large numbers, the market would dictate \na dramatic improvement in television programming.\n  I supported the Simon-Dole sense of the Senate amendment, which calls \non the industry to police itself but does not establish an \nunprecedented set of onerous government rules. I think this represented \na more sensible approach to this problem.\n                           Amendment No. 1325\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Warner's \namendment requiring Bell operating companies to fully disclose their \nprotocols and technical requirements for connection with their \nfacilities. This is a complex, technical issue, but it is a critical \nsafeguard as the Bell companies move into manufacturing.\n  Section 222 of the bill before us applies the same competitive check \nlist to Bell entry into manufacturing as it does to entry into long \ndistance services. I have been concerned, however, by the fact that the \nlegislation carves out a major exception for manufacturing research and \ndesign activities. This exception would allow Bell companies to \ncommence these activities almost immediately.\n  Research and design is one of the most expensive phases of the \nmanufacturing process, and it often holds the key to the end success of \nthe product. But under S. 652's provisions, Bell companies would be \nable to engage in such activities before they face competition. This \ncould open the door to cross-subsidization, unfair use of privileged \ninformation about RBOC network interfaces and other monopoly abuses \nthat could decrease competition in the already competitive \ntelecommunications manufacturing industry.\n  I have argued that the simplest solution to this problem was to \ndelete the bill's exception for research and design activities. But \nthis solution proved unacceptable to the bill's managers, so instead I \nsupported Senator Warner's efforts to add important safeguards.\n  Senator Warner's amendment would ensure that the public network \nremain open and accessible to independent manufacturers. By requiring \ndisclosure of technical specifications and planned changes in those \nspecifications, the amendment would prevent Bell companies' \nmanufacturing subsidiaries from gaining exclusive or early access to \nthe kind of information that is the lifeblood of telecommunications \nmanufacturing.\n  Independent manufacturers do not fear competition from Bell \ncompanies, so long as that competition is fair. Senator Warner's \namendment makes a great deal of progress in the effort to ensure \nfairness, and I hope we can build on this progress to make further \nimprovements as this bill moves to conference.\n  I thank Senator Warner for his leadership on this important issue, \nand I also thank Senators Hollings and Pressler for agreeing to accept \nthis modest amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today we have had an historic \nopportunity to vote on a sweeping revision of the 1934 Communications \nAct, an act which is now, over 60 years after its original passage, \nwoefully out of date. We tried last Congress to revisit this \nlegislation but we were unable to bring the matter to the floor. I am \nglad that we have had a chance to consider this legislation on the \nfloor this year. I hoped to be able to vote for it. We owe it to the \npeople of this country to modernize the laws which govern \ntelecommunications services and to do so in a way that promotes \ncompetition among the companies attempting to provide those services, \nand thus provide American families with more and better services at \nlower prices.\n  This legislation serves the first purpose--that of modernizing the \nlaw to reflect the many changes in technology since 1934.\n  However, there is a real question as to whether the end result will \nbe more competition. On the contrary, I believe that the result of this \nbill may be more concentration of power in the market. I do not believe \nAmerican families will benefit from this concentration.\n  I would like to believe what I have heard on the floor over the last \nweek: that true competition will ensue from this bill, and the result \nof that competition will be a new world of innovative products at \naffordable prices. Nevertheless, I fear that the flaws in this bill \nwill likely defeat those hopes. Accordingly, while I would like to be \nable to vote for this bill, I cannot.\n  I am a longtime student of technology and of telecommunications. I \nknow what benefits they can bring. I have promoted State and Federal \nsupport for technology in the classroom and I have sponsored \nlegislation to provide that support. I am proud to have \n[[Page S8461]] been an early and eager supporter of the Snowe-\nRockefeller-Exon-Kerry language in this bill which will, for the first \ntime, make access to telecommunications services by schools, libraries, \nand rural health care providers affordable. I am especially proud that \nthe Senate approved this aspect of the bill.\n  But there are a series of amendments to this bill which I had hoped \nwould pass and which would have made this bill what I had hoped it \ncould be and what I think the American consumer deserves.\n  First, and foremost, I was disappointed that the efforts of my \ncolleagues from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan and Senator Thurmond of \nSouth Carolina, to bring the Department of Justice into the process, \nwere defeated. I fear that this bill--without the amendment to give the \nDepartment of Justice a more active role--may lead to abuses and more \nconcentration in the long distance market. There are serious issues \ncompetition issues raised by the entry of the Bells into long distance, \nyet we have given the Nation's expert competition agency, the \nDepartment of Justice, a toothless role. The Department of Justice has \nlong and deep experience with this market and with these competitors. \nIt is the best positioned entity to evaluate the many issues which are \ngoing to arise as new entrants seek access to the local exchange \nnetworks controlled by these companies. In my view, only the Department \nof Justice can assure that what is billed as competition does not \nbecome concentration to the detriment of the American consumer.\n  I also have concerns about the potential for concentration in the \ncable market which this bill presents and the potential for greatly \nincreased cable rates for consumers in rural areas where competition is \nunlikely to exist in any meaningful way. The marketplace will very \nlikely bring lower prices and greater choice to consumers in urban and \naffluent areas. But in many parts of the country, and in much of my \nState of New Mexico, the marketplace will do little. We have seen in \nairline deregulation how rural consumers are treated. I hope that that \ndoes not happen in the cable marketplace as well. If it does, and we \nshall see in the next few years, Congress should revisit this issue to \nprovide the protections which I would have liked to see this bill \ntoday.\n  Other amendments, such as the ones offered by the Senator from \nNebraska, [Mr. Kerrey], to put a consumer representative on the \nuniversal service board and to restrict cross subsidization by public \nutility of services, were defeated. Other amendments designed to keep \nsome reasonable limits on broadcast ownership were also defeated.\n  Taken as a whole, this bill, while up-to-date, seems to be to \nanticonsumer and anticompetitive. I foresee an increasing concentration \nin the telecommunications industry with increasing prices for consumers \nwith little increase in choice or innovation for those living in rural \nAmerica. I hope that I am wrong. I hope that this bill can be improved \nin the conference. If it is, I will be happy to vote for it when it \nreturns to the floor. In its present form, however, I must vote no.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote for S. 652, the \nTelecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995, because a \nmyriad of technological innovations over the past few years have made \nthe current regulatory system obsolete.\n  New rules are needed to acknowledge and encourage competitive \ninnovative technological developments which will enliven the \nmarketplace and offer the consumer greater choice and new technologies. \nHowever, these regulatory changes should be done in a way that \nmaintains adequate protections of the public interest.\n  There are several issues that concern me regarding S. 652.\n  My first concern is with the lack of a Department of Justice role in \ndetermining when the Baby Bells should be allowed into the long \ndistance market. I believe a specific Department of Justice role is \nneeded to ensure that existing monopoly powers are not used to take \nadvantage of the new markets being entered.\n  It's reasonable that such broad and unprecedented telecommunications \nderegulation should include reasonable oversight of potentially \nanticompetitive behavior in an industry where a few giants could \ncontrol large segments of the various markets.\n  Without a specific Department of Justice role, there is a greater \nrisk that the monopolistic and concentrated businesses will increase \nand we will not achieve the competition that this bill promises. If \nthis happens, American consumers will be the losers.\n  I supported the Thurmond-Dorgan compromise amendment which would have \nprovided the Attorney General a simultaneous role with the FCC in \napproving a request by a Bell company to provide long distance service \nproviding that action would not substantially lessen competition, or \ntend to create a monopoly. Unfortunately, that amendment was not \nadopted.\n  I hope, therefore, that the House will move to adopt a Department of \nJustice role so that this issue can be revisited in conference.\n  My second concern regards the cable rate deregulation provisions of \nthe bill. In 1992 Congress passed a comprehensive cable act in response \nto a strong public outcry about skyrocketing cable rates. This bill \nundoes much of the good that bill accomplished in slowing down cable \nrate increases and in many cases reducing cable rates for Americans. \nThis bill deregulates all but the basic tier of cable television and in \nso doing runs the very real risk of resulting in increased cable rates \nfor Americans which is contrary to what Congress attempted to do just 3 \nyears ago in the 1992 Cable Act.\n  I am also concerned that the bill allows for the preemption of local \nrules and regulations relating to the management of local rights-of-\nway. I supported the Feinstein amendment to remove the provision in S. \n652 which would preempt local control of the public rights-of-way. \nUnfortunately, that amendment was defeated. A weaker alternative was \naccepted which modified but did not eliminate language in the bill \nallowing for the preemption of local regulations. The Feinstein \namendment would have eliminated the preemption capability of the FCC \naltogether.\n  I believe it is important that we in Congress pay proper recognition \nto the rights of local government and I am disappointed this bill does \nnot adequate do that.\n  The telecommunications bill before the Senate today will have a huge \nimpact on our economy and on the lives of every single American. I \nbelieve the telecommunications reform is both necessary and important. \nBut equally important in that process are the necessary checks and \nbalances to protect consumers and discourage monopolies. While I will \nvote for this bill because I recognize that telecommunications reform \nis long overdue and must move forward, I am not convinced this bill \ncontains adequate checks and balances. I hope the House will be able to \nadd those back into the bill and I reserve judgment on whether I will \nsupport a final conference report.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nTelecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995.\n  Over the last week I have heard many of my colleagues address this \nlegislation. One statement is common to their remarks. This legislation \nwill touch, indeed will impact, a significant portion of our economy. \nIt will be felt in one way or another in each of our lives.\n  Of the many advances in our society of the past century, \ntelecommunications is among the most pervasive. Our movement into this \ninformation age has yielded tremendous changes in our lives. The \nability to communicate around the globe instantaneously has helped us \nbecome part of a global marketplace. It is an advance from which there \ncan be no retreat.\n  I believe that we all benefit when competition is enhanced. Retaining \na competitive edge has been quite difficult as we have forced \ntechnology of today to fit the restrictions of yesterday's regulations. \nThe potential for continued improvement in these industries is \ntremendous. This bill should usher in new products, better prices, and \nmore choices in the services which consumers demand in Montana and \nacross the country.\n  Mr. President, the development in the personal computer, and even the \n[[Page S8462]] hand-held calculator before it, is a tangible example of \nwhat I expect in telecommunications. In the past 30 years, these \ntechnologies have become commonplace. In fact I can't imagine life \nwithout them.\n  The development of telecommunications technology has been no less \ndramatic. And with this legislation, we advance the ball. While this \nbill fails to satisfy my entire wish list, I believe it leaves us \nbetter than before. But we still have work to do and as legislation \nmoves through the House and into conference, I am confident we can \nimprove this bill.\n  In recent days we have voted on changes designed to improve the \nmeasure. The amendment offered by Senator Conrad will encourage \ntelevision manufacturers to include computer technology allowing \nparents to prevent objectional material from entering their home. I \nsupported that measure and I believe it is important in this bill.\n  An amendment offered by Senator Exon protects against harassment, \nobscenity, and indecency to minors via telecommunications devices. \nTogether, these two amendments will go a long way toward protecting our \nyouth from harmful material. There has been some public comment on this \ntopic recently and I believe these amendments are what Montanans want \nin this kind of legislation.\n  Finally, I want to go on the record in stating my belief that passage \nof this measure does not finish our work in this area. Granted, this \nlegislation has been a long time coming. But we now have a serious \nresponsibility to conduct congressional oversight over this \nlegislation. As we work to construct the information superhighway, we \nmust make certain that the system works.\n  I don't want a system which is a restrictive entry highway. And I \ndon't want a toll road where nobody can afford the fare. And I want to \nmake certain that in Montana, my constituents have access to the \nbenefits of this technology. I will be watching to see that this effort \nsucceeds and I stand ready to step in if intervention is needed.\n  But Mr. President, this bill has strong support. I have heard from \nbroadcasters, small business owners, and those in the \ntelecommunications industry in Montana. And all these groups want this \nlegislation to pass. I share their desire to help the best \ntelecommunications system in the world leap forward into the next \ncentury and I will cast my vote in favor of this measure.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to state my reasons for opposing \nthe Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995.\n  Yesterday the Senate adopted amendment No. 1362 by a vote of 84-16. \nThe amendment purports to prohibit computer transmission of obscenity \nand indecency. I voted ``no'' out of concern that we were taking this \naction improvidently and without adequate consideration for its \nsignificant constitutional and practical implications.\n  In 1973, the Supreme Court in Miller versus California, and in \nseveral subsequent decisions, held that the Constitution does not \nprotect obscenity, which the Court defined as material that appeals to \n``prurient interests'' or is ``patently offensive.'' The government \naccordingly has the authority to regulate obscenity, and properly so. \nBut we must do so with care.\n  The amendment attempts to apply existing laws against obscene and \nharassing telephone calls to computer transmissions. Regrettably, the \nlanguage of the amendment is too broad, raising serious questions of \nconstitutionally under the first amendment. For example, the amendment \ncould reasonably be interpreted to prohibit an individual from sending \nan annoying e-mail message. The penalty for such a transgression: a \nfine of up to $100,000 or up to 2 years in prison--or both. And, as was \nnoted by Senator Leahy and others during the debate yesterday, the \namendment likely makes unlawful on computers materials that are \nperfectly lawful in books or letters. I suspect the courts will take a \ndim view of this provision when it is challenged, which it surely will \nbe.\n  Similarly problematic is the failure of the amendment to recognize \nthe difference between telephones and the unique characteristics of \ncomputers. In order to view the kinds of lewd and lascivious material \ncomplained of by the proponents of the amendment, an individual must \ntake numerous affirmative steps to gain access to it via the on-line \nservices where it can be found. I grant that this is not terribly \ndifficult for one who is computer literate, but the fact remains that \nin order to look at this material on the computer, you have to actively \nseek it out. It does not just pop up on the screen when you turn it on. \nOne who looks for and then views such material on his or her computer \nis in a very different position than a victim of obscene telephone \ncalls. Yet the amendment fails to recognize this distinction.\n  I am also troubled by the Senate's action on another amendment to \nthis bill. This afternoon, by a vote of 67-31, the Senate tabled the \nLieberman amendment to retain cable television rate regulation. Senator \nLieberman knows the subject of cable rate regulation as well as anyone, \nhaving fought cable rate increases in Connecticut in the 1980's when he \nwas State attorney general. He predicts that, without the reasonable \nrate restrictions in his amendment, cable TV rates will surely rise as \na result of this bill. I am afraid he is right. Cable rates rose \nsharply after Congress lifted rate regulations in 1984, and they are \nlikely to do again if we pass this legislation. This is why I supported \nthe Lieberman amendment, and why I believe it was a mistake for the \nSenate to defeat it.\n  For this and for the other reasons I have given, I will vote against \nthe Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995.\n              the dole amendment on cable volume discounts\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we are faced here with a very unfortunate \nsituation. Senator Dole has offered an amendment to address a \nsignificant public policy matter raised by S. 652 as reported by the \nCommerce Committee, and that amendment has become entangled in a \ndispute that goes to the way the Senate deals with those who do \nbusiness in areas affected by legislation upon which the Senate acts.\n  I must say that I am distressed by the appearances of what has \noccurred regarding the interactions of two cable programming providers \nwith the chairman of the Commerce Committee. While I have not been \ninvolved at all in--or even knowledgeable about--these interactions, \nand believe according to what I have been told that there may be more \ninadvertence and clumsiness in evidence here than anything else, it is \nunfortunate for all involved that some evidently see this as a case \nwhere inappropriate pressure has been brought to bear in such an \ninteraction.\n  Regardless, and without in any way acting as judge and jury and \nattributing blame, I will say unequivocally that I do not believe that \nthe proper way for elected officials and business executives to \ninteract is for elected officials to threaten businesspeople with \ninjurious legislation if they do not comport their business activities \nwith the policy desires of those elected officials, nor for \nbusinesspeople to threaten elected officials with business actions \ndeemed undesirable by the officials if those officials fail to take \nlegislative actions favored by the businesspeople. Further, the way I \nhave always understood the concept of honor, a deal's a deal, and \nstarting with the assumption that honorable elected officials should \nmake only deals that are in the public's interest, both those officials \nand businesspeople who enter into agreements ought to honor those \nagreements.\n  Having said these things, when the day is over here, what really \ncounts in my judgment is the public policy that the Senate makes, and \nthe effect it has on our Nation and its people. I think it is important \nthat we keep our eye on the ball here, and by that I mean I think we \nshould cast our votes on this amendment based on the public policy \nimpact of the policies those votes will determine. It is on that basis, \nrather than with reference to the regrettable dispute that has emerged \nconcerning what has preceded the offering of and voting on this \namendment, that I cast my vote on the amendment.\n  Many of the decisions with which this body must grapple are not \nsimple, where two courses, one black and the other white, present \nthemselves and all [[Page S8463]] we have to do is choose the easily \ndiscernible right course. Many decisions we make have multiple and \nvarying implications, and we are forced into the position of playing \nSolomon to mediate disputed interests and needs.\n  Such is the case here, Mr. President. On the one hand none of us to \nmy knowledge wants to act in a way that will deprive persons in rural \nareas or other areas served by small cable systems of programming that \nthose who live in areas served by large cable systems can enjoy. On the \nother hand, we should approach extremely seriously any decision that \ncould result in the government imposing controls on the free \nmarketplace, especially a decision that leads to price controls. There \nhave been situations in our history that have warranted such actions, \nbut they are the exception, not the rule.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that the circumstances of the cable \nindustry warrant imposing what amount to price controls on those who \nprovide programming. Yes, I do believe that those programming companies \nshould deal responsibly with all cable operators who wish to purchase \ntheir products. But no, I do not believe that in this industry the \nGovernment should prohibit practices of volume discounting or other \nmethods of pricing that are employed in virtually every industry in our \nNation, whether it be selling shoes or cabbages or long distance phone \nservice.\n  So, Mr. President, before I had heard anything about the dispute \nconcerning the agreement that did or did not exist between Time-Warner \nand Viacom and the chairman of the Commerce Committee, I had concluded \nthat I should vote for the Dole amendment. Now that the dispute has \nsurfaced, I continue to believe that the correct public policy is \nreflected in the Dole amendment, and I will vote for that amendment for \nthat reason.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senate votes today on a very important \npiece of legislation, the Telecommunications Competition and \nDeregulation Act of 1995. There is no question in my mind that \ntelecommunications reform legislation is needed. The communications \nlaws in this country are without a doubt antiquated and the Congress \nmust take action and pass telecommunications legislation.\n  I am sad to say, however, that I cannot support the legislation the \nSenate is voting on today. This bill, in my judgment, could be more \naccurately described as the ``telecommunications concentration act'' \nrather than the ``telecommunications competition act.'' Unfortunately, \nthis legislation, in its present form, is going to lead to greater \nconcentration in the telecommunications and media industries--which is \nantithetical to competition.\n  Robust competition is the driving force of our free market economy. \nCompetition offers consumers lower prices and wide ranging services. \nTrue marketplace competition also eliminates the need for regulation. \nIf our goals are to ensure that consumers receive advanced \ntelecommunications and media services at competitive prices and to free \nthe industry from government regulation, competition is our means to \nthat end. But it must be true and fair competition.\n  This is where this legislation misses the mark. There are two key \nareas of this legislation that lead me to the conclusion that existing \ncompetition in telecommunications is in jeopardy: First, the conditions \nunder which regional Bell operating companies [RBOC's] may offer long \ndistance services; and second, the liberalization of broadcast \nownership rules.\n  This legislation, mistakenly in my judgment, deregulates both the \ntelevision and radio broadcast industries at the risk of promoting \ngreater concentration at the expense of competition. The bill raises \nthe national audience cap from 25 to 35 percent and eliminates the 12 \nstation limit on TV broadcast ownership. It also eliminates ownership \nrules on radio ownership. Liberalization of these limits runs \nabsolutely contrary to the goal of promoting competition. I am \nconvinced that if these changes are enacted, the media industry in this \ncountry will be controlled by a handful of conglomerates in future. The \nlong-held principles of localism and diversity will suffer.\n  I offered an amendment, unsuccessfully, to strike the provisions \nliberalizing the ownership limits in the bill. Under my amendment, the \nFCC would have been instructed to review and modify its broadcast \nownership rules to ``ensure that broadcasters are able to compete \nfairly with other media providers'' while ensuring that diversity and \nlocalism are protected. The amendment would have maintained the current \nlimits while directing the FCC to review and modify the ownership rules \non a case-by-case basis.\n  At the heart of this issue is the relationship between the networks \nand the local affiliate stations. Raising the national ownership limits \nwould represent a drastic shift in power from the local affiliate \nstations to the national networks. The provisions in the bill; \nincluding the Dole amendment, threaten local media control--both in \nterms of programming and in terms of news content--in favor of national \ncontrol. The change will remove the ability of local stations to make \nlocal programming and news decisions--such as preempting network \nprogramming in favor of local news, public interest, and local sports \nprogramming.\n  The change would also mean that station managers will not be able to \nstop network programs he or she believes is inappropriate for the local \nmarket. When the networks buy up the affiliates, the networks will be \nable to dictate the terms of the affiliate/network relationship. The \nnetworks will leverage their power over affiliate preemption of network \nprogramming, conduct of news divisions, and the moral tone of network \nentertainment. The change proposed in broadcast ownership rules under \nS. 652 will turn locally owned stations into extensions of large \nmultimedia companies and will result in the nationalization of \ntelevision programming and the demise of localism and local program \ndecisions.\n  The bill's changes to broadcast ownership rules will lead to greater \nconcentration of the media--a concentration towards the national \nnetworks. The fact is that the present limits help preserve \ncompetition. Fox television would not be the fourth network today if it \nwere not for the existing limits on ownership. The current limits are \nwhat made it possible for Fox Broadcasting to develop so quickly \nbecause there were affiliates available in media markets that were not \nowned by the established networks with whom Fox had to compete with to \nbuild a market for itself.\n  Proponents of removing the ownership limits have a single purpose--to \nreduce the number of people participating in broadcasting ownership. \nThe current limits permit small companies to own stations in large \nmarkets. Because the existing limits ensure that concentration is \nlimited and entrepreneurial efforts in broadcasting are possible. \nElimination of ownership limits will make it more difficult for \nminority participation in broadcast ownership--something the FCC has \nbeen trying to promote for years is more minority ownership. This bill \nwould send a blow to that effort.\n  Will the local television landscape be better off if the local \ntelevision stations are controlled by the national networks in New York \nand Hollywood instead of by stations in Bismarck or Wichita?\n Will there be less violence on TV if there is more national control? I \ndo not think so. In fact, I expect that these problems will get worse.\n\n  This bill will rob local stations of the opportunity to say no to \nnetwork programming that local station managers think is inappropriate \nfor their local communities--where they themselves live. If the \nnational networks are permitted to own a substantial portion of the \nlocal stations in the country, then all programming decisions will be \nmade in Hollywood and New York, without regard for the concerns of \nlocal communities. Make no mistake about it. The bill's provisions \nrepresent nothing short of a power grab on the part of the national \nnetworks under the guise of deregulation. The proposed changes to the \nownership rules would concentrate power in the hands of the networks \nand would be anticompetitive.\n  Another unsuccessful amendment I offered with the senior Senator from \nSouth Carolina relates to what is perhaps the most contentious battle \nin the development of this legislation: the conditions under which the \nRBOC's [[Page S8464]] would be permitted to offer long distance \nservices. One of the major reasons why I cannot support this bill is \nbecause it does not provide for an adequate role for the Department of \nJustice to ensure that competition in the long distance market is \nprotected when an RBOC that controls the local loop is permitted to \nenter what is already a competitive market.\n  Under the bill in its present form, an RBOC need only apply to the \nFCC to enter long distance services. The FCC would utilize a public \ninterest standard and determine that the RBOC has completed the \ncompetitive checklist. The bill provides only for a consulting role by \nthe Justice Department.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that the debate over this legislation \nhas been turned upside down. The fact is that the fundamental policy \ngoal confronting the Congress as we develop telecommunications reform \nlegislation is how do we employ competition in markets which are \ncurrently controlled by regulated monopolies, such as the local \nexchange. The fact is that the long distance market is a truly \ncompetitive market. We risk damaging that competitive market if the \nRBOC's are permitted to enter the long distance market prematurely. Our \ngoal should be to promote the same level of competition in the local \nexchange that currently exists in long distance. Unfortunately, this \nbill is weak on incentives that would promote local competition and it \nalso threatens to damage the competitive long distance market.\n  It was the Justice Department that investigated and sued to breakup \nthe Bell system monopoly--which resulted in making the long distance \nand manufacturing markets competitive. If the local exchange networks \nare going to be vertically reintegrated with long distance service, \nthere is a danger that entry by RBOC's could impede competition and \nunravel the progress made over the past decade in promoting competition \nsince the breakup of the Bell system. DOJ has a unique role to assess \nwhether the conditions for meaningful competition are present.\n  The experience of airline deregulation shows that the protection and \npromotion of competition is not accorded enough\n weight when DOJ has only an advisory role. In the case of airlines, \nmergers that were approved by the Department of Transportation over the \nobjection of DOJ, the result was monopolization of certain hubs and \nhigher ticket prices for consumers.\n\n  A DOJ role would avoid expensive AT antitrust suits in the \nfuture by making sure that competition is safeguarded in the first \ninstance. RBOC enter that occurs without assurances that it will not \nimpede completion will invites complex litigation, which will consume \nresources better spent on competing. Having DOJ apply a marketplace \ntest as a condition to entry will help avoid wasted litigation.\n  Since the breakup of the Bell system, long distance rates have \ndropped 66 percent and the long distance competitors have constructed \nfour nationwide fiber optic networks--the backbone of the information \nsuperhighway.\n  It cannot be assumed that a series of specified steps will result \nautomatically and inevitably in the development of local exchange \ncompetition. Potential barriers to competition are sometimes subtle and \novercoming these barriers is a very complex task. Congress cannot hope \nto successfully specify in advance a set of conditions that will \nprovide answers to all issues before meaningful competition is a \nreality. The only way to ensure true competition is to look at actual \nmarketplace facts and DOJ must provide this role.\n  A series of specified steps--for example, the competitive check list \nin Section 255--is not by itself sufficient to bring real competition \nto local markets. The RBOC's must have a positive incentive to \ncooperate with the development of competition.\n  Monopolists have proven themselves adept at erecting new barriers \nfaster than old ones can be identified and dismantled. Complete \nelimination of barriers to competition will occur only if the \nmonopolists have positive incentives to cooperate with the introduction \nof meaningful competition. The RBOC's will have such incentives when \nthe check list is supplemented by a process that ensures application of \nreal competitive analysis to actual marketplace facts.\n  I still hope that these areas can be perfected in the conference \ncommittee. Unless these two areas are addressed, this legislation will \ndo more to harm competition than to promote it. That would not be in \nthe public interest and I hope that the Congress will not make that \nmistake.\n  Although there are serious problems with this legislation, I do \nbelieve that some provisions in this bill I strongly support. This bill \ncontains some very important provisions that would preserve universal \nservice and ensure that rural areas will have access to advanced \ntelecommunications services. I have worked long and hard with many of \nmy colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee to ensure that universal \nservice will be preserved as competition is introduced into local \nexchange service. The provisions in the Senate bill with respect to \nuniversal service are vitally important to rural areas and it is my \nhope that if these provisions will be retained in the conference \ncommittee.\n  In conclusion Mr. President, I would ultimately like to vote for this \nlegislation. Unfortunately, I cannot in its present form. As I said \nearlier, this legislation will not adequately promote competition. \nRather, it will have the opposite affect: concentration. I urge the \nmanagers of the bill and all those Senators who have spoken with such \npassion about promoting competition to work to improve this measure so \nthat we can truly call it the Telecommunications Competition and \nDeregulation Act.\n               restricting cable-telco in-region buy-outs\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to note an important amendment that \nhas been made to the telecommunications bill.\n  As introduced, the telecommunications bill modified our outdated law \nthat bans cable companies and telephone companies from offering the \nservice of the other. With digital and other new technologies being \ndeveloped, the demarcations between the businesses of telephone and \ncable service is blurring.\n  It is about time for Congress to update the law to catch up with the \nnew convergence in video, computer, and telephone technologies.\n  But by repealing the telco-cable cross-ownership ban altogether, the \ntelecommunications bill, as reported, failed to impose any limits on \nthe ability of telephone companies to buy out cable companies--their \nmost likely competitor--in the telephone companies' local service \nareas. Allowing such mergers would destroy the best hope for developing \ncompetition in both local telephone service and cable television \nmarkets.\n  Without the protection of an antibuyout provision, consumers would be \ndeprived of the lower cable and telephone prices that would result from \ntwo-wire competition.\n  Because of these concerns, the distinguished chairman of the \nAntitrust Subcommittee, Senator Thurmond, and I sent a letter to our \ncolleagues a few weeks ago detailing the reasons why standard antitrust \nscrutiny would not be enough to preserve the potential competition \nbetween telephone and cable companies.\n  The leadership package of amendments adopted last Friday took \nseriously the concerns that we expressed, and provided some antibuyout \nrestrictions to prevent telephone companies from merely substituting \none video service monopoly for another.\n  The amendment restricting in-region buyouts improves this bill and \npromises to benefit consumers by promoting greater competition in the \ndelivery of video services, increasing the diversity of video \nprogramming, and advancing the national communications infrastructure.\n  In particular, the amendment eliminates ambiguity and makes clear \nthat the antitrust enforcement authorities will maintain their \nauthority to challenge anticompetitive buyouts under the antitrust \nlaws.\n  Even when the FCC has decided that from its perspective that the \ntelco/cable buyout is acceptable, or when the buyout comes within the \nrural exception, standard antitrust scrutiny may still be applied.\n   [[Page S8465]] The amendment maintains the specialization and \nexpertise of the antitrust authorities--the Justice Department and the \nFederal Trade Commission, as well as State antitrust authorities--in \ndetermining whether a buyout would violate the antitrust laws and harm \nconsumers.\n  This amendment is necessary to help promote the competition we want \nto develop between cable and phone companies, with the hope that prices \nfor both services will be lowered for consumers, while their options \nand choices increase.\n\n\n                              choice chip\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am very pleased my amendment was accepted by such a \nwide margin on the Senate floor. The choice chip could be a very \nimportant tool for parents to help protect their children from the \nviolence that is all-too available on television. I am hopeful that the \nSenate-House conferees will see the value in this approach and retain \nmy amendment. However, I deeply regret that I will have to vote against \nS. 652, even though it contains an amendment I sponsored.\n  I have deep concerns about the approach this bill takes, in the name \nof competition, by removing protections that currently safeguard \nagainst media concentration. Diversity of opinions and voices is at the \nvery heart of our democracy. I believe this bill creates the potential \nto stifle many of those voices in our media by greatly consolidating \nbroadcast ownership in this country.\n  My colleague, Senator Dorgan, offered an amendment earlier this week \nthat would have prevented a single television owner from concentrating \nownership above the current, reasonable limit of 25 percent of the \nnational audience. This bill raises that limit, and initially the \nSenate agreed that was a dangerous precedent. Then politics took over \nand the Dorgan amendment was defeated.\n  Today, an amendment by Senator Simon which would have restricted \nradio station ownership to a very reasonable limit of 50 AM and 50 FM \nstations was tabled. The bill, as it stands, eliminates virtually all \nownership restrictions. That simply does not safeguard the diversity of \nvoices that democracy requires.\n  I am also concerned that cable television rates for consumers will \nrise under this bill. An amendment by Senator Lieberman to keep rates \nin check before real competition is in place was also tabled today. I \nbelieve it is a mistake to pass a bill that includes the word \n``competition'' in the title but does not safeguard consumers in the \nabsence of competition.\n  Finally, I have concerns about rebuilding the telephone monopoly that \nthe Department of Justice and the Federal courts rightly ended. Now, \nthe Department of Justice, the very agency which protects Americans \nfrom antitrust practices, will not have a role beyond consultation in \npreventing a potential monopoly from being reestablished. I supported \nwhat I believed was a very reasonable amendment from Senator Dorgan and \nThurmond to apply a time-honored antitrust standard to any application \nto enter long distance. That amendment was defeated.\n  I hope that the final report from the Senate-House conference is a \nbill that truly promotes competition, while also safeguarding the \ninterests of the consumers before competition arrives. I do not believe \nthis bill meets that goal, and I regret that I cannot support it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1421\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I seek to clarify a part of the Leahy-\nBreaux amendment (No. 1421) on intraLATA toll dialing parity that was \nadopted yesterday. As the amendment states, the joint marketing \nprovision in subparagraph (iii) of the amendment applies only in those \nStates that have implemented intraLATA toll dialing parity during the \nrelevant period and to telecommunications carriers in those States \noffering intraLATA services using ``1+'' dialing parity. The \nprohibition on joint marketing however, was not intended to apply to \ntelecommunications carriers offering intraLATA services that do not \nmake use of ``1+'' dialing parity. That is my understanding of the \nBreaux-Leahy amendment. Is this consistent with your understanding?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Yes.\n                           amendment no. 1367\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise to make a comment relative to the \namendment I successfully offered earlier today to the provision of the \nbill addressing cable-telephone company mergers and alliances. I \nunderstand that some concern has been expressed that the effect of the \namendment may be broader than intended. I do not intent that this \namendment have broad effect or undo the carefully crafted buyout \nlimitations agreed to previously. I look forward to working with the \nmanagers and conferees as we move forward to make any language changes \nnecessary to ensure that the amendment has only the narrow effects \nintended.\n\n\n                     fees in lieu of franchise fees\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. In part, section 203 of the bill adds a new subsection \nto the 1934 Communications Act that would permit the collection of fees \nfrom providers of video programming in lieu of franchise fees. It is my \nunderstanding that this requirement does not permit local or State \ngovernments to impose such fees on direct-to-home satellite services. \nIs this correct?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes, the intent of the subsection to which you refer, \nwhich authorizes fees in lieu of franchise fees, does not apply to the \ndirect-to-home satellite industry. However, nothing in section 203 is \nintended to affect whether direct-to-home satellite services are \notherwise subject to other taxes or fees under current law.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 652, the \nTelecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act. This bill is far \nfrom perfect, but on balance I believe it will be a plus for American \nconsumers and the American economy.\n  We now find ourselves in a highly competitive, global economy, and \ntelecommunications is an increasingly important part of it. In order to \nkeep up in this booming sector, it is imperative that the United States \nreplace a regulatory structure crafted in the 1930s with one suitable \nfor the 21st century. This bill represents an important step in that \ndirection.\n  The communications industry is a $1 trillion segment of our economy, \nand it is among the fastest growing sectors. This boom is not widely \nunderstood, but it has tremendous implications for consumers and \nbusiness.\n  This trend is being driven by a variety of factors, foremost among \nthem technology. Old copper phone wires can only carry a handful of \nconversations at once. But one fiber optic cable can carry 32,000 \nconversations at once. New services can be sent to the home or office \nover fiber optic cable at virtually zero marginal costs to the \nproducer.\n  An incredible array of companies has a stake in the emerging \ncommunications marketplace--both obvious and surprising players. \nConsumers can only benefit from the stepped up competition if we break \ndown the walls that now separate cable companies, local phone \ncompanies, long distance firms, electric utilities, satellite firms, \nradio and television broadcasters, cellular companies, computer \ncompanies, and Hollywood studios.\n  With passage of this bill, we hope that companies in all these areas \nwill eventually invade each others' territory, providing consumers with \na multiplicity of new choices and creating jobs along the way. Some \nreports estimate that true competition in all sectors of the \ntelecommunications industry could create 3.6 million jobs by 2003.\n  We cannot even imagine much of what will eventually be available to \nconsumers in this area. Among the possibilities are movies on demand, \ninteractive home shopping, home banking, interactive entertainment and \nthe ability to take classes and talk with the teacher from home.\n  The break-up of the old AT monopoly in 1984 is the best case study \nin the benefits of competition in communications. We all remember the \ntime when there was no choice in long distance--no price competition, \nno incentive to improve quality, no innovative new services in long \ndistance.\n  But since the break-up of AT, 30 million Americans switch long \ndistance carriers a year, and long distance rates have fallen 60 \npercent. Five hundred companies now offer long distance service.\n  There is now a wide consensus about the need to further unleash these \ntechnological and market forces for the [[Page S8466]] benefit of \nconsumers. It is imperative that we update Federal communications \npolicy to allow this to happen. We are still operating under the \nCommunications Act of 1934. That should speak for itself.\n  And since 1984, much of the communications industry has been \nregulated by one man--Judge Harold Greene, who oversaw the AT break-\nup and who continues to oversee the consent decree that governs the \nbehavior of the Bell operating companies. He has done an admirable job, \nbut it is time for Congress to reenter the game.\n  That is what this bill represents. As I mentioned before, I supported \na number of important amendments that did not pass. I believe the \nJustice Department should have a formal role in deciding whether Bell \nCompanies should be allowed to offer long distance. The Antitrust \nDivision at Justice has the expertise to assess a market and to prevent \nmonopoly abuse.\n  I also supported my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, in \nhis effort to strengthen the cable rate regulations in this bill. The \nleadership package of amendments we passed last week included some \nadditional protections for cable consumers. They represent a \nconsiderable improvement over the cable provisions in the bill as \nreported out of committee. Like Senator Lieberman, however, I wish we \ncould have gone further.\n  I hope that the remaining problems with this bill can be corrected as \nthe House considers its version and the two chambers meet in \nconference. Furthermore, if problems develop on cable rates or other \nmatters down the road, Congress can revisit the issue and make \nimprovements at that time.\n  I commend Senators Pressler and Hollings on all of their hard work on \nthis bill, which I think will provide a shot in the arm for our \neconomy.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the United States and, indeed, the world \nhave embarked upon a new technological revolution. Like previous \nrevolutions sparked by technological innovation, this one has the \npotential to change dramatically our daily lives. It will certainly \ntransform the way we as humans communicate with each other.\n  What we are witnessing is the development of a fully interactive \nnationwide communications network. It has the potential to bring our \nNation and our world enormous good; without appropriate ground rules to \nassure fair competition, however, this revolution could create giant \nmonopolies. The communications policy framework we create in this \nlegislation will determine whether many voices and views flourish, or \nfew voices dominate our society.\n  The impact of this new age communications revolution on the way we \nsend and receive information, and the way we will view ourselves and \nthe world, is profound. Even more staggering is its potential impact on \nour economy. We could be seeing the largest market opportunity in \nhistory. Some forecasters, including the WEFA Group in Burlington, MA, \npredict a January 1996 opening of the telecommunications market to full \ncompetition would create 3.4 million new jobs, increase GDP by $298 \nbillion, save consumers nearly $550 billion in lower communications \nrates and increase the average household's annual disposable income by \n$850 over the next 10 years. As the Communications Workers of America \nhave underscored, delaying free and fair competition means fewer new \nhigh-wage, high-skill jobs.\n  New technologies and industries seem to be emerging and merging \nalmost daily. They range from such sectors as entertainment and \neducation to broadcasting, advertising, home shopping and publishing. \nOne key player in this revolution is the Internet--the global computer \ncooperative with a current subscriber base of approximately 20 million \nand a 10 to 15 percent monthly growth rate. One billion people are \nexpected to have access to the net by the end of the decade. While some \nmay consider the net to be the revolution, it is only one of many \nplayers in the new communications network game.\n  We see examples of this new era almost daily, such as someone driving \na car while talking on a cellphone. The pace of change is so rapid that \nwords like ``cellphone'' and ``Internet'' and ``telemessaging'' are not \nin my office computer's spellcheck system. In the weeks and months \nahead, more and more Americans will gain access to video dialtone, \nchoosing their television programs through their telephone service. \nLikewise, cable franchises will enter the local telephone service \nmarket. Residents of Springfield, MA, will be able to watch their State \nlegislators in Boston debate an education bill and instantaneously \ncommunicate with their legislators about how to vote on an amendment. \nWe will hear more talk about the players in this new game: content \nproviders, transporters, and technology enablers.\n  As we consider this brave new age of communications, it is clear the \ncurrent law, the 1934 Communications Act, is a wholly adequate \nfoundation upon which to build a communications system for the 21st \ncentury. Moreover, although the courts on occasion properly have \nintervened to halt monopoly abuse--most notably a little over a decade \nago in the telephone industry--we should no longer leave the \nfundamentals of telecommunications policy to the courts.\n  S. 652, the telecommunications bill reported by the Commerce \nCommittee on March 23, 1995, by a vote of 17-2 and which I am confident \nwill be passed momentarily by the Senate, is not perfect. In some \nrespects, I would have preferred S. 1822, the bill crafted so ably by \nSenator Hollings and reported by the committee last year. However, the \nlegislation before the Senate now is preferable to the status quo. It \nwill establish fair and balanced ground rules\n for competition in the communications sector as we enter the next \ncentury. It will foster competition, assuring a needed balance among \nexisting competitors and new entrants in this rapidly evolving field.\n\n  This legislation provides us with a national policy framework to \npromote the private sector's deployment of new and advanced \ntelecommunications and information technologies and services to all \nAmericans by opening all telecommunications markets to competition. \nFree and fair competition and maintaining universal service are the \ntwin pillars of this new framework.\n  The bill assures that no competitor, no business and no technology \nmay use its existing market strength to gain a head start on the \ncompetition. The legislation requires that a company or group of \ncompanies satisfy certain competitive tests before being able to offer \na new service or enter a new market. Entry into new services and new \nareas is contingent upon a demonstration that competition exists in the \nmarket in which the business currently competes. But once competition \nhas been achieved, most Federal and State regulation is replaced by \nconsumer demand to regulate the market.\n  These fundamental features of S. 652 are designed to create a level \nplaying field where every player will be able to compete on the basis \nof price, quality, and service, rather than on the basis of monopoly \ncontrol of the market.\n  The bill also maintains universal service as a cornerstone of our \nNation's communications system. With many new entrants in the \ncommunications market, S. 652 assures every player pays his fair share \nto continue universal service throughout our Nation. As the committee \nreport states:\n\n       The requirement to contribute to universal service is based \n     on the long history of the public interest, convenience and \n     necessity that is inherent in the privilege granted by the \n     government to use public rights of way or spectrum to provide \n     telecommunications services.\n\n  The present system, where certain parts of the country indirectly \nsubsidize low-cost service in other areas, will be phased-out.\n  I am also pleased the legislation includes two amendments which I \nsponsored in committee and one I sponsored on the floor. The two \namendments adopted in committee seek to restore a level playing field \nin two areas: broadcast rates for public, educational and governmental \nentities--known as PEG access groups; and competition in the pay phone \nmarkets. I am disappointed that efforts to refine the payphone \namendment were unsuccessful, but I hope that further progress can be \nmade on the subject in conference.\n  As I noted earlier in my statement, there are several provisions in \nthe bill that continue to trouble me. On the floor, I offered and the \nSenate passed an amendment to ensure low income and rural areas are not \nbypassed as \n[[Page S8467]] communications companies implement new technologies and \nservices.\n  As the bill moves to conference, I will continue to do what I can to \nmake further improvements and defend against efforts to weaken its \nprovisions protecting consumer interests and assuring free and fair \ncompetition.\n  Through this legislation and this debate, we have a unique \nopportunity to craft a telecommunications policy framework for the next \ncentury. Today, Mr. President, each of us is in a sense a pioneer \nheading out on the new information highway. Each of us is not only a \nwitness to, but a participant in, one of the most amazing technological \nrevolutions in history. We, as legislators, bear a special \nresponsibility to assure that competition in this new era is fair and \nthat every American in this and future generations may enjoy the fruits \nof this competition. This is truly one of the greatest challenges we \nface as we enter the 21st century.\n              radio spectrum for law enforcement purposes\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I share the concerns that have been \nexpressed by others regarding the availability of radio spectrum for \nlaw enforcement purposes. I have been contacted by law enforcement \norganizations across the country, including those in my State of Utah, \nexpressing these concerns.\n  A critical element in the effort to battle crime and to respond to \nemergencies of all types is the existence of reliable and secure radio \ncommunications facilities, which in turn depends on adequate spectrum \navailability. Yet, current allocations may well be inadequate to meet \npresent needs. Many metropolitan police departments are unable to add \nnew channels to alleviate congestion.\n  Moreover, spectrum space is also needed to bring new technologies \nonline. Just last week, we passed a counterterrorism bill, which \nincluded important provisions to increase information sharing between \nlaw enforcement. Yet these provisions will be for naught if spectrum \nspace is not available for the deployment of these technologies.\n  I appreciate the commitment expressed by the managers of this bill to \naddress this issue. I know that the Senator from South Dakota, the \nDistinguished Chairman of the Commerce Committee, shares my concerns. \nAs a former member of the Judiciary Committee, he understands the needs \nof law enforcement. I understand that he is committed to attempting to \nresolve these concerns as this legislation moves forward. I look \nforward to working with him and the Senator from South Carolina on this \nvital issue as the legislation moves through conference.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am very concerned that Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement have adequate spectrum availability, and would like to work \nwith the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the managers of this \nbill to ensure that this vital issue is addressed in the conference on \nthis legislation.\n  The reason this is so important is twofold. First, in this era where \nFederal, State, and local law enforcement often work together we need \nto maintain spectrum space so that these, and other public service \nagencies, can communicate with ease and with the most advanced \ntechnology available. If we develop better technology to allow the \npolice to talk to each other without the bad guys listening in, we must \nhave the spectrum available to use this technology.\n  Second, we must work to ensure sufficient spectrum space for the \nmyriad technological advances being made in the area of secured \ncommunications. I have heard several of the law enforcement leaders in \nmy home State of Delaware raise these key points. So, I believe this is \na practical problem that we face in Delaware and around the Nation.\n  We do a disservice to law enforcement and to the American people if \nwe do not provide these public servants with the many benefits of our \nrapidly advancing telecommunications industry. I look forward to \nworking with my friend from Utah on this important effort.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my friend and colleague from Delaware for his \nsupport on this issue. As the former chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, his strong support of law enforcement is wellknown, and I \nlook forward to working with him in this.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I want to acknowledge and thank my colleagues for their \nefforts on this issue. In particular, Senator Hatch and the managers of \nthis important legislation, Senator Pressler and Senator Hollings not \nonly for their support of this effort, but also their support of law \nenforcement.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I do share my colleagues' concerns, and appreciate the \ninterest of the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee \nin this issue. I look forward to working with them on it.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I, too, understand these concerns and look forward to \naddressing them.\n                              CABLE ISSUES\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I would like to engage my colleague from \nSouth Carolina in a colloquy on several cable issues. First, it is my \nunderstanding that neither section 204(a) of the bill nor the relevant \nprovisions in the Dole-Daschle-Hollings amendment is intended to \nprevent the FCC and cable operators from entering into ``social \ncontracts'' or other similar arrangements to settle rate complaints, \nunder which the operator agrees to offer a low priced basic tier to \noffset an increase in the rate for cable programming services.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator from South Dakota is correct.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I thank the Senator. Second, it is my understanding \nthat the reference to comparable video programming, added by the Dole-\nDaschle-Hollings amendment to new section 623(l)(1)(D) of the \nCommunications Act, has the same meaning as it does elsewhere in \nsection 632(l)(1) of the Communications Act and the FCC's regulations \ndefining comparable.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator's understanding is correct.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Finally, I call the Senator's attention to the \nmanagers' amendment to S. 652. As amended by the managers' amendment, \nnew section 613(b)(2)(B) of the Communications Act clarifies that a \nBell operating company providing cable service as a cable operator \nutilizing its own telephone exchange facilities is not required to \nestablish a video platform. However, a Bell operating company that \nprovides cable service as a cable operator, whether through its own \ntelephone exchange facilities or otherwise, would be subject to the PEG \nand commercial leased access requirements of the Communications Act--\nsections 611 and 612--applicable to all cable operators.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator accurately states the intent of the bill as \namended by the managers' amendment.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I thank the Senator from South Carolina.\n                            Pole Attachment\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have reviewed the provisions of S. \n652, as reported, that seek to amend section 224 of the Pole Attachment \nAct of 1978. As a result of that review, I am deeply concerned that \nthese provisions would have a significantly adverse impact on electric \nutility ratepayers throughout the Nation. I am particularly concerned \nthat these provisions would require electric ratepayers to shoulder the \nburden of subsidizing not only cable operators but also telephone \ncompanies and telecommunications providers. The amount of money \nforegone by the bill as reported is not trivial. It amounts to tens of \nmillions of dollars annually, if not hundreds of millions of dollars. \nPut simply, it is not fair to ask consumers of electricity to subsidize \ncable operators and telephone companies. In this connection, it is \nimportant to point out that this subsidy does not even necessarily go \nthe customers of these companies.\n  From a consumer protection standpoint, I believe the legislation \nshould be amended to ensure that all entities that attach to poles are \nrequired to pay a fair and proportionate rate that provides for \nrecovery of the cost of installing and maintaining the entire pole, \nincluding the common space. I ask the chairman of the Committee, \nSenator Pressler, and the ranking minority member, Senator Hollings, \nwhether they have any concerns on this matter and what their plans are \nto remedy the situation.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I agree with the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski], \nthat this is a real concern that needs to be addressed. I believe that \nmany of these concerns are being addressed in the Manager's amendment, \nbut to the \n[[Page S8468]] extent that they are not fully addressed I will work \nwith you to address them.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I concur in the comments of the Senator from Alaska \n[Mr. Murkowski] and the comments of the Chairman of the Committee, Mr. \nPressler.\n                      submitted amendment no. 1320\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I filed an amendment No. 1320, that \naddresses the part of the bill which amends existing law regarding pole \nattachments. Under the bill, all utilities are required to open up \ntheir poles, ducts, conduits or rights-of-way to other \ntelecommunications carriers on a cost basis. Of course, there are \nexceptions to this. I filed an amendment which would have removed that \nobligation for nondominant telecommunications carriers. In other words, \nno nondominant telecommunications carrier would have to provide access \non a cost basis. Instead, they would offer access on a free-market \nbasis.\n  The reason this amendment was filed is straightforward. I can \nunderstand requiring the incumbent monopoly to provide access on a cost \nbasis, since the captured rate payers funded the construction. But, I \ncannot understand requiring other, competitive providers to provide \naccess on a cost basis--particularly if their business is largely in \nproviding access to those very same conduits on a market basis.\n  There are competitive telecommunications businesses that have laid \nlines and built a long distance service through hard work and purely \nprivate capital. There are telecommunications businesses that have \nfocused on laying conduit or lines for purposes of leasing or selling \nthat capacity. The obvious problem would arise if these businesses that \nfocus on selling capacity lose any chance of profit because they must \nprovide access on a cost basis. I do not think the bill should apply to \nthem, but I am not sure that it does not.\n  I am sure that the intent of this section was not to burden \ncompetitive carriers that are in the business of providing capacity. I \nask the managers if they agree with me that this was not the intent of \nthe section?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. That is right.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I agree with the Senator.\n  Mr. BROWN. The amendment I filed would have exempted nondominant \ncarriers from application. At this time, we will not offer the \namendment.\n  The difficulty in this area is that it is unclear whether the bill \nactually causes an inequitable result and thus whether anything needs \nto be done. We will take a second look at drafting a solution to this \npotential problem between passage in the Senate and the conference with \nthe House.\n  At this time, I ask the managers of the bill if they will support our \neffort to solve this potential problem in conference?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I agree with the Senator from Colorado that there may \nbe a unwanted inequitable result from this section, and I will work to \nsolve this potential problem in conference.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I, too, believe there may be a potential problem and \nwill work to solve this problem in conference with the House.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the managers for their help on this important \nissue and commend them for their work on the bill. I yield the floor.\n                           single lata states\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. This amendment refers to ``single-LATA states.'' I \nunderstand this to cover only states where the LATA and the state are \nthe same--where the state constitutes the entire LATA.\n  Mr. ROTH. That is my understanding as well. The amendment would not \nexempt those states, like Delaware, that are part of a LATA that \nincludes part of another state.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I agree with that interpretation of the amendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this debate on S. 652 has clearly \ndemonstrated the potential of emerging telecommunications technologies. \nIt is truly exciting to contemplate what this legislation could mean \nfor American society.\n  A particularly intriguing new development in the telecommunications \nfield is the creation of Personal Communications Services (PCS). These \ndevices will revolutionize the way Americans talk, work and play.\n  While this new technology opens new vistas for personal \ncommunications services, its emergence also highlights the potential \ndownside of entering untested areas. Specifically, concerns have been \nraised about the potential side-effects of some new PCS technology on \nother devices such as hearing aids.\n  Recently, the government completed an auction that netted $7 billion \nfor the right to provide advanced digital portable telephone service. \nIt is my understanding that some of the companies that obtained these \nPCS licenses have considered utilizing a technology known as GSM--\nGlobal System for Mobile Communications. I am informed that people who \nwear hearing aids cannot operate GSM PCS devices, and some even report \nphysical discomfort and pain if they are near other people using GSM \ntechnology.\n  It should not be our intent to cause problems for the hearing \nimpaired in promoting the Personal Communications Services market. It \nis my view that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) should \ncarefully consider the impact new technologies have on existing ones, \nespecially as they relate to public safety and potential signal \ninterference problems. An FCC review is in keeping with the intent of \nS. 652, which includes criteria for accessibility and usability by \npeople with disabilities for all providers and manufacturers of \ntelecommunications services and equipment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be glad to yield to the honorable ranking member \nof the Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Senator for yielding and support his \nsuggestion that the FCC investigate technologies that may cause \nproblems for significant segments of our population before they are \nintroduced into the United States market. Such review is prudent for \nconsumers, and it will help all companies by answering questions of \nsafety interference before money is spent deploying this technology \nhere in the United States.\n  Four million Americans wear hearing aids, and the Senator from South \nDakota has raised an important issue. GSM has been introduced in other \ncountries, and problems have been reported. It is reasonable that these \nproblems be investigated before the growth of this technology \neffectively shuts out a large sector of our population.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator for his remarks, and would also like \nto commend his role in bringing telecommunications reform to the floor. \nHis leadership and patience throughout this three-year exercise that \nhas spanned two Congresses is well known and widely appreciated.\n  Mr. President, the public record indicates that if companies are \nallowed to introduce GSM in its present form, serious consequences \ncould face individuals wearing hearing aids. I would urge the FCC to \ninvestigate the safety, interference and economic issues raised by this \ntechnology. I also would urge the appropriate congressional committees \nto consider scheduling hearings on this issue.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, S. 652 contains what appears to be two \nchecklists--the first is in section 251(b)--and it deals with such \nissues as interconnection, access, unbundling, resale, number \nportability and local dialing parity. Section 255, which deals with the \nremoval of the long distance restriction imposed upon the Bell \noperating companies by the modification of final judgment, has the \nsecond checklist in section 255(b)(2). Section 251(b) deals with the \nvery same issues as section 255(b)(2) does, but its requirements are \nstated in a broader and less specific manner. Is a Bell operating \ncompany required to have ``fully implemented'' both the section 251 and \nthe section 255 checklist before the Communications Commission can \nauthorize a Bell operating company to provide interLATA service \npursuant to section 251(c)?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. No.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. When Section 255 makes reference to section 251, is \nthat reference intended to incorporate the minimum standards of section \n251?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. No.\n  Mr. CRAIG. What is the intended relationship between the section \n251(b) ``minimum standards'' and the section 255(b)(2) ``competitive \nchecklist'' given that both the ``minimum standards'' and the \n``competitive checklist'' address many of the same issues?\n[[Page S8469]]\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. The competitive checklist is found in section 255(b)(2) \nand is intended to be a current reflection of those things that a \ntelecommunications carrier would need from a Bell operating company in \norder to provide a service such as telephone exchange service or \nexchange access service in competition with the Bell operating company. \nThis competitive checklist could best be described as a snapshot of \nwhat is required for these competitive services now and in the \nreasonably foreseeable future. In other words, these provisions open up \nthe local loop from a technological standpoint as section 254 opens the \nlocal loop from a legal barrier to entry standpoint. Section 251's \n``minimum standards'' permit regulatory flexibility and are not limited \nto a ``snapshot'' of today's technology or requirements.\n\n\n                      nondiscriminatory treatment\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, may I direct a question to my distinguished \ncolleague from South Dakota regarding a minor technical matter in the \nCommittee amendment?\n  Specifically, I believe a clarification is in order regarding the \nSenate's intent in changing the heading on page 101 at lines 15 and 16 \nto read ``(2) Non-Discrimination Standards . . ..'' It is my \nunderstanding that this amendment is necessary to express clearly the \nSenate's intent that the nondiscrimination provisions in this paragraph \nshall apply to transactions of Bell operating companies with all \nparties, not just other local exchange carriers as incorrectly \nsuggested in the Committee Report.\n  Such nondiscriminatory treatment in procurement, standards-setting, \nand equipment certification is particularly important to the \ntelecommunications equipment supplier community. Independent suppliers \nmust have the same opportunity to sell to the Bell operating companies \nas any of their affiliates. This is good for the consumer, good for the \nsuppliers, and good for the telephone companies.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. The understanding of my colleague from North Carolina \nis correct.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank my good friend from South Dakota for making this \nclarification in the bill.\n                           amendment no. 1256\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I understand there is some concern among \nthose in the transportation industry over an amendment agreed to \nearlier regarding the use of auctions for the allocation of radio \nspectrum frequencies. Specifically, the amendment would extend the \nFCC's authority to use auctions for the allocation of radio spectrum \nfrequencies for commercial use. That amendment, which I supported, also \nincludes a provision to exclude so-called ``public safety radio \nservices'' from competitive bidding requirements.\n  I see the sponsor of the amendment on the floor. Will the Senior \nSenator from Alaska enter a very short colloquy to help me put to rest \nthe concerns over this amendment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Certainly.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. For purposes of public safety radio services, there are \nmany circumstances when the transportation industry must rely on radio \ntelecommunications to address safety concerns. For example, the \nrailroad industry uses radio spectrum for voice and data communications \nthat are essential to public safety. Freight and passenger railroads \nrely upon radio communications to transmit authority for train \nmovements, to broadcast emergency warnings, and to seek emergency \nresponse in the event of accidents. Indeed, radio communications can \noften be critical to addressing the safety concerns of many modes of \ntransportation. Does the Senator from Alaska agree with my views?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes. The transportation industry's reliance on radio \ncommunications can be critical to public safety. The amendment is not \nintended to impose economic burdens on the transportation industry or \nother industries when meeting public safety obligations.\n  For example, public safety radio services also include private, \ninternal non-commercial use radio services used to provide reliable and \nsecure communications in the management and operation of utility and \npipeline services, like the Trans-Alaska pipeline and other oil, gas, \nmining, and resource development activities in my state under federal, \nstate, and local statutes, regulations and standards relating to public \nhealth, safety or security.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I thank the Senator. Now, I will yield to the Senior \nSenator from Oregon, who I understand would also like to comment on \nthis important subject.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I thank the Chairman. I wanted to stress that the \navailability of radio frequencies is critical to technological \nadvancements which enhance transportation safety. For example, the \nDepartment of Transportation is currently working with the Union \nPacific Railroad and the Burlington Northern Railroad on an important \ntest program to demonstrate the benefits of a new technology using \nradio spectrum called Positive Train Control. In fact, a 1994 Federal \nRailroad Administration report to Congress specifically emphasized the \nimportance of radio technology in the development of positive train \ncontrol.\n  This is just one example of how the radio spectrum can be important \nto the development of new transportation safety technologies. Since the \navailability of radio frequencies will be critical to these efforts in \nthe future, I strongly agree with my colleagues the term ``public \nsafety radio services'' includes safety-related communications of \nrailroads and other modes of transportation.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I concur with the Senator and thank him for his \ncomments.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am concerned that the language in S. \n652 is unclear concerning the requirements that the regional Bell \noperating companies [RBOC's] must fulfill before they are permitted to \nprovide interLATA, or long distance service. The entry provisions of \nsection 255(b)(1) require that the RBOC must reach an interconnection \nagreement and must fully implement the checklist under section \n255(b)(2). The language is unclear, however, whether the RBOC actually \nmust simply reach an agreement to provide interconnection or whether it \nmust also actually provide such interconnection to a carrier. I would \nsimply clarify that, as one of the principal authors of this \nlegislation, it is my understanding that the legislation requires the \nRBOC not only to reach an agreement but it must also actually provide \nsuch interconnection to a carrier fulfilling the checklist under \nsection 255.\n  I understand that the legislation does not require that the RBOC's \ncomply with both the minimum standards under section 251(b) and the \nsection 255 checklist before being authorized to provide interLATA \nservice. I would clarify one additional point, however, concerning the \ncharges of providing interconnection under section 255. While there is \nno explicit reference to the charges that the RBOC's may assess for \ninterconnection under section 255, it is my interpretation of the \nlanguage in section 255 that the RBOC's must provide interconnection \nunder section 255 at charges that are consistent with section \n251(d)(6). Indeed, while the reference to section 251 in section \n255(b)(1) is not intended to refer to the minimum standards under \nsection 251, it is intended to include reference to subsection (d)(6) \nin section 251 concerning the charges for each unbundled element under \nsection 255. I appreciate the opportunity to share this interpretation \nwith colleagues.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the \nTelecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995. Mr. \nPresident, I had hoped that, following the adoption of several \nproconsumer amendments on the floor, that I would be able to support \nthis legislation.\n  I favor increased competition and deregulation of telecommunications \nmarkets because true competition benefits consumers by providing them \nwith more choices, lower prices, and improved service. However, Mr. \nPresident, S. 652, as it was reported by the Commerce Committee, did \nnot contain adequate assurances that the deregulation of \ntelecommunications markets will result in true competition. And \nunfortunately, Mr. President, virtually all of the amendments offered \non the floor to ensure that this bill would benefit users of \ntelecommunications services were rejected by the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I am disappointed about that turn of events because I \nthink there was ample opportunity to [[Page S8470]] make this bill a \ngood bill for consumers, local communities, State governments, and \nprivate businesses alike. I regret that the Senate took what should \nhave been an opportunity to better serve consumers, and turned it into \nan obstacle to greater true competition in telecommunications.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from North Dakota, Senator \nDorgan, and the Senator from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond, was \namong the most critical amendments offered to improve this bill. That \namendment would have included in the legislation a strong \ndecisionmaking role for the Antitrust Division of the Department of \nJustice in the approval of the regional Bell operating companies \n[RBOC's] entry into long distance telecommunications markets. It was an \nattempt to rectify the inadequate long distance entry provisions \ncontained in the bill.\n  Mr. President, while the bill did attempt to provide protections for \nconsumers, such as the competitive checklist and the public interest \ntest, there was still a distinct need for review by the Antitrust \nDivision of the Department of Justice. The competitive checklist in S. \n652 only ensures that certain technical and legal barriers to \ncompetition in the areas served by the Bell monopoly have been \neliminated prior to the RBOC entry. This checklist does not require \nthat competition actually exist in local markets dominated by the \nRBOC's before they are able to use their substantial market power to \nenter long distance markets.\n  The power of the local monopoly is without equal in \ntelecommunications markets. The advantages provided to them over\n those with lesser market power, fewer resources, and limited \nopportunities to control entry by their competitors are without bounds. \nWe must keep in mind that competition in both local and long distance \nmarkets cannot exist when one player has substantially greater market \npower than his/her rivals.\n\n  S. 652 also prohibits the Federal Communications Commission, the \nagency required to enforce the competitive checklist, from expanding on \nthe criteria contained in the checklist. If Congress has overlooked \ncrucial criteria with respect to barriers to entry, FCC would be unable \nto consider it. At the same time the bill limits FCC's role, it \nprovides absolutely no role for the Department of Justice which is the \nagency responsible for the competition that exists today in long \ndistance markets. Senators Dorgan and Thurmond worked hard to rectify \nthat inadequacy by offering an amendment giving the Department the \nauthority to approve individual RBOC applications to enter long \ndistance markets. Mr. President, that crucial amendment failed.\n  The absence of a sound antitrust review of RBOC applications to offer \nlong distance service means there is little assurance that the benefits \nconsumers have realized in a competitive long distance markets will not \nevaporate if this bill becomes law.\n  And Mr. President, if the absence of a DOJ role did not provide \nadequate reason to oppose this bill, the rejection of a substantial \nnumber of basic proconsumer amendments only added to my opposition.\n  Mr. President, this bill repealed much of the cable rate regulation \nestablished in the 1992 Cable Act, a law enacted in response to \nconsumer outcries about skyrocketing cable rates. The Senator from \nConnecticut [Mr. Lieberman] offered an amendment which would have \nmerely provided an accurate yardstick to measure whether a cable \ncompany's cable rates were out of line and should be subject to \nregulation. That amendment was tabled.\n  An amendment offered by the Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] \nwould have provided some assurance that channels currently included as \npart of a consumers' basic tier cable service, which remain under \nGovernment regulation, would not be moved into more costly upper tier \npackages, which will be deregulated under this bill. S. 652, in its \ncurrent form actually provides an incentive to move channels offered as \npart of a basic package into the unregulated upper tier packages for \nwhich cable companies can now charge higher rates. Senator Boxer's \namendment was tabled.\n  The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey] offered several very good \namendments on this bill. One very simple amendment would have merely \nrequired that a consumer representative sit on Federal-State Joint \nBoard on Universal Service, the board which will study existing \nuniversal service support mechanisms and make recommendations about how \nto preserve and advance universal telecommunications service. It seems \nentirely appropriate that rural consumers be guaranteed representation \non this board. Senator Kerrey's amendment was tabled.\n  The package of leadership amendments that was approved earlier this \nweek by the Senate eliminated virtually all restrictions on the number \nof radio stations one entity might own raised a number of concerns \nabout undue market concentration in broadcasting. While I voted for \nthat package of amendments because it contained a prohibition on cable/\ntelephone company cross ownership, I remained concerned about the radio \nownership provisions in the package. The Senator from Illinois [Mr. \nSimon] attempted to increase the number of stations one entity might \nown by 150 percent from current law rather than lifting the \nrestrictions entirely. His effort was designed to ensure that this bill \ndid not actually result in less competition in radio broadcasting. His \namendment was rejected.\n  Mr. President, the list of defeated proconsumer amendments goes on. I \nwas astonished by the rejection of some of these amendments which were \nintended to benefit consumers and protect them from potentially \nanticompetitive practices of some within the telecommunications \nindustry. I have wondered if my colleagues have forgotten that the \nreason we are attempting to encourage grater competition through \nderegulation is to benefit consumers, not the competitors themselves. \nThis bill might be very good for telecommunications business interests, \nbut it is not good for consumers.\n  In addition, Mr. President, I am very disturbed by the passage of an \namendment yesterday, offered by the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon] \nwhich I believe contains an unconstitutional provision. I spoke at \ngreat length yesterday about my specific concerns with that amendment.\n  Mr. President, it is with disappointment that I must oppose S. 652. \nHowever, the outcome of the floor action on this bill, leaves me very \nlittle choice.\n\n\n       legislative history language on ownership cap/attribution\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, In raising the ownership cap to 35 \npercent of the Nation's TV households immediately, with a biennial \nregulatory reform review, it is our intent to permit broadcast \ncompanies to achieve greater operational efficiencies through expanded \ngroup ownership of television stations. There is a danger, however, \nthat future changes to the FCC's attribution rules--for example, \nprospectively or retroactively restricting the availability of the \nsingle majority shareholder exemption or attributing nonvoting stock--\ncould cause some ownership interests not now covered by the cap to fall \nwithin the scope of this regulation. Such a result could seriously \nundermine the goal that we are seeking to advance through adoption of \nthis legislation. Accordingly, the committee expects the FCC to avoid \nthe adoption of more onerous or restrictive attribution policies that \nwould reduce the national station ownership potential of individual \ncompanies below the level that would be permitted under a 35-percent \ncap utilizing the attribution rules that are currently in effect.\n                   promoting the use of telecommuting\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak more \nfully about my amendment on telecommuting, which passed the Senate \nyesterday by voice vote. My amendment directs the Secretary of \nTransportation to research successful telecommuting programs and to \ninform the general public as to the types of telecommuting programs \nthat are succeeding and the benefits and costs of such programs. This \namendment is appropriate in the context of the pending bill, which \naccelerate the deployment of advanced telecommunications and \ninformation technologies.\n  As my colleagues are aware, telecommuting is the practice of allowing \npeople to work either at home or in nearby centers located closer to \ntheir home during their normal working [[Page S8471]] hours, \nsubstituting telecommunications services, either partially or fully, \nfor transportation to the traditional workplace. I believe that it is \nin the national interest to encourage the use of telecommuting because \nit can enable flexible family-friendly employment, reduce air \npollution, and conserve energy. Further, as a Senator from a State \nwhich has major urban areas like Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, I \nrecognize there is a real need to improve the qualify of life in and \naround America's cities.\n  According to a July, 1994, Office of Technology Assessment report, \nbetween 2 to 8 million American workers already telecommute at least \npart time. A 1994 survey by the conference board found, however, that \nin 155 businesses nationwide, only 1 percent of employees telecommute, \nalthough 72 percent of the businesses had such an option.\n  According to the Office of Technology Assessment, the most \nsignificant barriers to telecommuting are business and worker \nacceptance and costs. This legislation responds to the need to broaden \npublic awareness of the benefits and costs of telecommuting, and to \nidentify and highlight successful programs that can be duplicated.\n  I believe telecommuting is profamily. I have seen several news \narticles which featured working mothers and other parents who endorse \ntelecommuting as benefiting child care and flexibility generally. One \nGeneral Services Administration employee who now telecommutes was \ninterviewed for a June 11, 1995, Washington Post article remarked, ``I \njust wish they had this much sooner, when my kids were little.''\n  Telecommuting should also appeal to computer-literate younger \nAmericans, such as those described as Generation X, for whom a balance \nbetween work and lifestyle is very important. This new generation of \nAmerican workers is the most adept at utilizing computers and should \nwelcome the opportunity to spend less time commuting and more time \npursuing other interests.\n  It is also important to note that some physically impaired \nindividuals are able to obtain jobs thanks to their ability to \ntelecommute. An April 23, 1995, Boston Globe article detailed a pilot \nproject in Massachusetts, where physically impaired individuals such as \nthe legally blind and quadriplegics do transcription work for doctors \nand hospitals. One women who suffered\n crippling injuries in an automobile accident noted that she never \nthought she'd work again, but that this new telecommuting program ``is \nlike a gift sent from heaven.''\n\n  Telecommuting should be of interest because of its potential \nimplications for transportation, particularly the mitigation of traffic \ncongestion. The Energy Department issued a report in June, 1994, in \nwhich it stated that telecommuting and its benefits will be \nconcentrated in the largest, most congested urban areas, with 90 \npercent of the benefits accruing to the 75 largest American cities. \nThus, the greatest benefits will occur where they are most needed. \nReflecting the direct effects of telecommuting on transportation, the \nDepartment of Transportation has reported that in 1992, telecommuting \nsaved 2 million Americans an estimated 3.7 billion vehicle miles, 178 \nmillion gallons of gasoline, and 77 hours of commuting time each. The \nDepartment also estimated that telecommuting would lead to reductions \nof hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides on the order of 100,000 tons in the \nyear 2002 and 1 million tons of carbon monoxide. Rural areas should \nalso benefit from a broader use of telecommuting because more \nemployment opportunities would be available through the information \nsuperhighway.\n  My amendment is simple and straightforward. It directs the Secretary \nof Transportation to identify successful telecommuting programs used by \nGovernment agencies and companies and publicize information about such \nprograms in order to broaden public awareness of the benefits of \ntelecommuting. The Secretary would carry out this directive in \nconsultation with the Secretary of Labor and the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, so that work force and environmental \nconcerns will be taken into account. The Secretary of Transportation \nwould also be required to report to Congress on his findings, \nconclusions, and recommendations with respect to telecommuting within 1 \nyear of enactment. Using such information, Congress may consider \nwhether additional legislation to promote telecommuting is warranted or \ndesirable.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the texts of the Washington Post and \nBoston Globe articles I have mentioned be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n               [From the Washington Post, June 11, 1995]\n\n                Federal Workers Test Drive Telecommuting\n\n                           (By Todd Shields)\n\n       In a federal office in Waldorf, Julie Jones occupies \n     workstation 13. Chrissie Edelen sits right beside her, in \n     mirror-image No. 14.\n       Their cubicles are bereft of humanizing touches, bare of \n     the snapshots or photocopied cartoons that might proclaim \n     that a person is in the bureaucrat's seat.\n       They'll go all day without walking down the hall to a \n     meeting.\n       They'll not be visited by a boss, and no colleague will \n     drop in for a chat.\n       Office grumps? Strange ascetics?\n       Certainly not. They are happy telecommuters, using their \n     cubicles in Southern Maryland once a week, on the blessed day \n     when they don't devote two or three hours to the simple act \n     of getting to and from work. And that, they certainly love.\n       ``The morale is excellent,'' said Edelen, a graphic artist. \n     ``I feel more relaxed. You're not fighting traffic. . . . You \n     just feel better.''\n       Edelen and Jones, a paralegal, are early beneficiaries of a \n     pilot program that may spare tens of thousands of federal \n     workers enervating commutes while boosting productivity and \n     cutting air pollution.\n       The women are among 56 workers who spend one or two days a \n     week at the InTeleWorkNet Center, a 14-station office suite \n     replete with computers, faxes, printers and other equipment. \n     The center, set up with money from the General Services \n     Administration, is one of five on the fringes of the \n     Washington area, where federal commuters face particularly \n     grueling trips.\n       Proponents see the centers as forerunners of scores of \n     similar stations that would dot the area, in essence bringing \n     many workplaces within a short drive or even a bicycle ride \n     of workers' homes. The GSA, which is using the Washington \n     area as its prototype, expects to expand the program \n     nationwide, fostering ``telework'' centers for 60,000 federal \n     employees by 1998.\n       The federal pilot, funded by a $6 million appropriation \n     through late 1996, is one of several initiatives to bring \n     telecommuting--working at a distance from the usual office--\n     to government workers in the Washington area.\n       Fairfax, Arlington and Montgomery county governments all \n     have begun small pilot programs for their staffs to work from \n     home. The Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, a \n     regional planning agency, envisions four work centers in \n     Virginia an done in the District for private and public \n     workers. And this year, Maryland is to launch a three-year \n     pilot program for state employees, who would work at home.\n       The programs are initial steps toward a transformation \n     already well begun in the private sector. Estimates of the \n     number of telecommuters in the United States begin at 5 \n     million, yet the federal government, with its 2.8 million \n     employees, has only 3,000 workers enrolled in telecommuting \n     programs. By comparison, one regional telephone company \n     alone, Bell Atlantic Corp., has 2,000 telecommuting \n     employees. Public or private, the programs' impetus is the \n     same. Planners and executives look around and see the same \n     things workers by the legion experience--bad air, traffic \n     jams and stress-filled schedules that commonly have workers \n     leaving home before dawn and placing their children in the \n     care of others in eerily empty suburbs.\n       ``You wonder: My God? Isn't there a better way to do \n     this?'' said Warren Master, head of the GSA pilot project.\n       Master speaks with the zeal of the converted, sketching \n     aloud plans for work centers that play host to both \n     government and private employees and that attract the broader \n     public with copying shops, Internet access and services such \n     as Veterans Affairs counselors or Internal Revenue Service \n     advisers.\n       For the time being, though, the benefits go primarily to \n     people such as Jones, the paralegal. A resident of Clinton, \n     in southern Prince George's County, she usually commutes more \n     than an hour to Defense Mapping Agency offices in Merrifield \n     or Bethesda. On Wednesdays, she travels a few miles south \n     against traffic to reach the Waldorf center in 15 minutes or \n     less.\n       The hours saved leave more time with her husband and 22-\n     month-old son. But Jones was surprised to find an added plus: \n     She can accomplish far more at the Waldorf center, where she \n     has all the equipment she\n      needs without the countless distractions of big-office life, \n     she said.\n       ``It makes things easier,'' Jones said. ``It's just the \n     same as if I'm working at my desk in Merrifield or Bethesda, \n     except I don't have as many interruptions.'' [[Page S8472]] \n       Jones and Edelen, who works for the Federal Highway \n     Administration, said they save large, complex tasks for their \n     telecommuting days. Being able to work without interruption \n     is a relief. ``It's off my brain,'' Jones said, ``and I'm on \n     to something else.''\n       The Waldorf workers have experienced what telecommuting \n     consultants and advocates long have contended: that \n     teleworkers are more productive. Studies document increases \n     of 15 percent to 25 percent, said Master, of the GSA.\n       But telecommuting still can be a tough sell, said Jennifer \n     Thomas, program director at the GSA's telecommuting center in \n     Fredericksburg, VA., which opened its second branch last \n     month.\n       ``Some kind of grumpy middle manager will say, `How do I \n     know this person's not goofing off?''' Thomas said. Her \n     center advises the managers to judge by results. So far, she \n     said, the center has received only positive feedback from \n     workers and their managers.\n       Despite the good reviews and the affected workers' \n     adulation--virtually all Waldorf teleworkers surveyed by the \n     University of Baltimore's Schaefer Center for Public Policy \n     thought the arrangement improved morale and their quality of \n     life--the centers' future is by no means assured.\n       ``Once the funding runs out on these pilots, they, of \n     course, have to be self-sufficient,'' Master said. When \n     subsidies drop away, the charge to agencies that rent the \n     computer workstations will increase. Master said agencies \n     still could save money if they reduce the number of desks in \n     central offices, to take account of telecommuters.\n       One person who hopes the centers will succeed is Ruth Ann \n     Campbell, a GSA budget analyst who for 28 years has endured \n     commutes of as far as 42 miles from her home in La Plata. Now \n     she revels in the opportunity to drive just 10 miles north of \n     the Waldorf center.\n       ``My family and friends think I'm much nicer,'' she said \n     during a break in the work center's small video-conferencing \n     room. ``I'm not only happier on Wednesdays, I'm happier \n     because I'm looking forward to next Wednesday. . . .\n       ``I just wish they had this much sooner, when my kids were \n     little.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Apr. 23, 1995]\n\n             Quadriplegics Get Help in Work-at-Home Program\n\n                           (By Andrew Blake)\n\n       When Mary M. Palermo suffered crippling back injuries after \n     an automobile accident in Revere in the summer of 1992, she \n     thought she would never be able to work again--certainly not \n     as a waitress or in an office.\n       In some respects she was right. She says she can't commute \n     to work because of back pain. But under a program just \n     gearing up at Melrose-Wakefield Hospital, Palermo will \n     ``tele-commute'' as she and several others work for doctors \n     at the hospital via computer, without leaving their homes.\n       ``For me this is like a gift sent from heaven,'' said \n     Palermo, 42, of Revere.\n       ``I started getting assignments for transcriptions on April \n     4 and the best part is I can work at home at my own pace,'' \n     she added.\n       One doctor at the hospital has been using the new service \n     since February. Several more physicians employed by the \n     hospital or affiliated with it are expected to start using \n     the service within a week or two.\n       Doctors dictate their patient medical notes, progress notes \n     or surgical notes into a Dictaphone. The notes are then heard \n     by a transcriptionist at his or her home, typed into a home \n     computer and sent back to the hospital or doctor.\n       The program, which allows physically impaired people \n     including the blind, to do transcription work for doctors and \n     hospitals, originated at Boston University's Helping Hands \n     project, best known for its work in training monkeys to help \n     quadriplegics. It is funded in large part by a $50,000 grant \n     from the State Department of Employment and Training.\n       M.J. Willard, executive director of Helping Hands, \n     affiliated with Boston University's Medical School, described \n     this pilot project ``as diversification of the original \n     program.''\n       The idea came about, she said, after talks with the \n     Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission, the Massachusetts \n     Commission for the Blind and Gov. Weld's Telecommuting \n     Initiative. A variation on the program is working in \n     California, she said.\n       ``Over the summer, working with people referred by state \n     agencies and scored for compatibility with home transcription \n     work, a dozen trainees learned medical terminology, learned \n     how to use computers and communication modems and software \n     programs for writing and communication by computer.\n       ``Not surprisingly, we discovered the very reasons that we \n     set up the program were causing problems for the students--\n     commuting,'' she explained.\n       The classes at BU were scaled back to once a week and then \n     the students could learn by communicating with their \n     computers. While BU provided the class space and \n     administrative help, Willard said IBM donated computers and \n     modems, the Dictaphone company donated some Dictaphones and \n     deeply discounted others, Willard explained. And the state \n     paid the salary for the instructor.\n       ``We had contacted 82 hospitals and transcription companies \n     to gauge their interest. Thirteen expressed interest but \n     Melrose-Wakefield Hospital expressed deep commitment in \n     making this happen, so we went with them,'' said Willard.\n       At the hospital, Jackie Valente, director of medical \n     management, said the Helping Hands project could not have \n     come at a better time. An increasing number of physicians \n     need faster and more efficient transcription services.\n       ``We see this expanding to 50 or so physicians with about \n     one transcriptionist for every three doctors,'' said Valente.\n       Right now, she added, Dr. Khaleet Beeb is working with a \n     transcriptionist to establish formats and to work out kinks \n     in the system. For the moment, the transcriptionist first \n     sends the transcribed reports to a proofreader working at \n     home in Quincy, who checks for correct medical terminology \n     and then sends it to Beeb at the hospital.\n       Three more transcriptionists she said, including Palermo, \n     are about to start possibly as early as this week. One is in \n     Dorchester and the other lives in Watertown.\n       One of the physicians about to use the program is Dr. \n     Joseph L. Pennacchio, a Revere native who is president of the \n     medical staff at Melrose-Wakefield Hospital.\n       ``This sounds like a good program. I can definitely see \n     advantages. With this service we can better document our \n     notes, communicate faster for the benefit of patients and get \n     more detailed information to us more efficiently,'' said \n     Pennacchio.\n       The system currently used by doctors to have their notes \n     transcribed relies heavily on commercial transcription \n     services and free-lance transcriptionists who stop by the \n     hospital or doctor's office to pick up tapes. The person then \n     listens to the tapes, transcribes the information on a \n     typewriter and then carries the material back to the \n     hospital. That can take days or weeks, according to Valente.\n       Under the telecommuting system she expects the turnaround \n     time to be greatly reduced.\n       ``People can work at their homes at midnight or 3 a.m. if \n     they feel like it or they can tend to their children and \n     start work any time they like. The more they work, the more \n     they earn,'' she added.\n       The homebound computer transcriptionists will be paid 7 \n     cents a line. They can work as much as or little as they \n     like, and much will depend on how extensive a doctor's notes \n     are on any given assignment, she explained.\n       Palermo, originally from Watertown, N.Y., and with a degree \n     in English, came to the North Weekly region about 19 years \n     ago on assignment from the Social Security Administration to \n     the Lynn office.\n       Later she worked as a waitress at Durgin Park in Boston, \n     ``where I was entertaining people for 12 hours a day. So I \n     decided to be a stand-up comic, where I only had to be funny \n     for 5 minutes.''\n       ``When the accident happened I was in the process of \n     thinking about a work change. I never imagined I'd be working \n     at home with a computer,'' she said.\n   restriction on in-region mergers of telephone and cable companies\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to commend the leadership and the \nmanagers of the telecommunications bill, S. 652, for the amendment \nwhich was made to ensure that potential competition between telephone \ncompanies and cable companies will be maintained for the benefit of \nconsumers. Until this amendment was made, I had serious concerns about \nS. 652 removing the current prohibition on mergers between local \ntelephone exchange carriers and cable companies in their service \nregions, subject only to standard antitrust scrutiny. I was prepared to \noffer an amendment to the original language in the bill because it \nlessened the likelihood of vigorous competition developing between \ntelephone and cable companies, with each offering the services of the \nother.\n  As the chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Antitrust, Business \nRights, and Competition Subcommittee, I am particularly pleased that \nthe amendment adopted to restrict telephone-cable mergers contains a \nsavings clause which makes absolutely clear that the antitrust laws are \nmaintained and will be applied by the antitrust enforcement agencies. \nThus, even if the FCC grants a waiver as permitted in the amendment or \na merger comes within the rural exception, the Department of Justice \nand the Federal Trade Commission still have the authority and the \nobligation under the law to consider whether any telephone-cable \nmerger, acquisition, or joint venture violates the antitrust laws.\n  Mr. President, antitrust analysis by the antitrust authorities is \ncritical to promote competition between the two wires--cable and \ntelephone--that already run to the home, and avoid a single monopoly \nprovider of both cable and telephone services, which would result in \nhigher cable and telephone prices for consumers.\n  I am pleased that an agreement was reached in this area and that this \namendment is now part of the bill.\n\n[[Page S8473]]\n\n                         rural health providers\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to talk \nabout how the Snowe-Rockefeller provision in the bill before us today \nwill assure rural residents that when it comes to their health care \nthey will have the same advantages as urban residents.\n  A shortage of family doctors, pediatricians, nurse practitioners, and \nother primary care providers has been a chronic problem in rural areas. \nAccess to a medical specialist has been practically nonexistent unless \na rural citizen was willing and able to travel, sometimes a very long \ndistance, to be treated.\n  Telemedicine is a telecommunications technology that can address both \nthese problems, and at the same time, save money for both patients and \nhealth care facilities. Patients save because they can be treated in \ntheir own hometown rather than being referred to an out-of-town \nspecialist. This saves them transportation and overnight accommodation \ncosts.\n  Patient cost-sharing payments will also be less if a patient can be \ntreated locally rather than transported to a referral or specialty \ncenter. The costs of a local, rural hospital are generally lower than a \nteaching or specialty hospital. In those cases when a patient must be \ntransferred for specialty care, the availability of telemedicine \nconsultations can speed up when a patient can be transferred safely \nback home.\n  Mr. President, a major difficulty in recruiting doctors and other \nhealth care providers to rural areas is the professional isolation, the \nheavy workload, and little or no back-up medical support. Telemedicine \ncan provide lifesaving back-up support for medical emergencies which \neases the minds of patients and their families and the doctor taking \ncare of the patient. Telecommunication hookups can reduce the sense of \nprofessional isolation and provide for continuing education \nopportunities. And, over the long run telemedicine can increase \ntraining opportunities for health care professionals at rural sites, \nincreasing the chances a doctor or nurse will return to practice in a \nrural community.\n  Mr. President, in West Virginia and all across the country, rural \nhospitals are finding it increasingly difficult to retain patients in \nthe community because specialty physicians have a hard time diagnosing \na patient's condition over the phone based only on a verbal description \nof the problem by the rural physician. Now with telemedicine, many of \nthose rural hospitals can safely and effectively care for\n their patients instead of referring them elsewhere.\n\n  For example in West Virginia, a medical student and a primary care \ndoctor consulted with the chief of neurology at West Virginia \nUniversity about an elderly Medicare patient. The chief neurologist was \nable to diagnose the patient's medical condition through telemedicine \ntechnology. This saved the patient a 138-mile trip over mountainous \nterrain to West Virginia University Hospital. The patient instead was \nable to be treated at the rural hospital and ended up saving the \nMedicare Program $2,500.\n  And, of course, when minutes, even seconds, count, having the instant \navailability of emergency consultations can literally mean the \ndifference between life and death. Just last week in West Virginia, an \nemergency medical resident staffing a rural hospital emergency room had \nto treat a patient with a broken neck. The medical resident had never \ntreated a broken neck before, but because the rural hospital had \ntelemedicine capabilities, Dr. John Prescott, the chief of emergency \nmedicine at West Virginia University was able to immediately consult \nwith the doctor on the appropriate treatment protocol. The patient was \nstabilized and later transferred to a referral hospital.\n  Our amendment will help bring down a significant financial barrier to \nthe development of telecommunications technology in rural areas: the \ncosts of transmission. While the basic start-up costs for acquiring \ntelemedicine technologies are coming down, transmission costs remain \nunaffordable. A small, rural hospital in West Virginia reported that \nthe estimated charge for a T1 line to allow them to hook up with a \nlarger hospital for administrative and quality assurance support was an \nunaffordable $4,300 a month.\n  The West Virginia University which started a pilot telemedicine \nproject 5 years ago, recently solicited bids for carrier services; \nthree companies bid for the service. The winning bid's monthly charges \nranged from $475 a month to $2,200 a month. The highest monthly charge \nof $2,200 was for a telecommunications hookup with a small rural health \ncenter in Greenbrier County, WV with the closest teaching hospital in \nthe area.\n  The cost of transmission must be lowered if telemedicine is to become \neconomically feasible for many rural communities. Right now the West \nVirginia telemedicine project is funded by Federal grant dollars. This \nis true for hundreds of telemedicine projects all across the country. \nCongress with enthusiastic bipartisan support has encouraged the \ndevelopment of telemedicine technologies all across the country. The \nGovernment has provided seed money for telemedicine, but unless we make \nsure that telecommunication transmission costs are affordable over the \nlong run, many rural health care\n providers won't be able to continue with these very important \nprojects.\n\n  Tommy Mullins, a hospital administrator for a small rural hospital in \nWest Virginia, recently told my staff that ``the $2,000 per month \nservice charge for the T1 is more than I spend for educational programs \nfor my entire staff of 150 employees. If we did not have the grant \nmoney to pay for the monthly charge we could not maintain the hookup.''\n  Mr. President, our amendment is carefully targeted to health care \nfacilities that are providing health care services in rural areas. We \nhave also specifically included academic health centers, teaching \nhospitals, and medical schools in our amendment. These institutions \nhave been essential partners with rural health providers in planning \nand creating rural health telemedicine networks and have been leaders \nin initiating rural health networks. Rural health care providers are \ngenerally so overloaded with patient care demands that it is difficult \nfor them to spend the time planning and coming up with the resources to \nimplement a telemedicine program.\n  In addition, academic health centers bring health professions \ntraining programs and continuing education programs to the rural health \nnetwork which reduce professional isolation for the rural health care \nproviders. Finally, it promotes an increased understanding and \nsensitivity on the part of the academic health center to many aspects \nof rural health care.\n  Mr. President, I am extremely pleased and relieved that the amendment \nI sponsored with the Senator from Maine, Senator Snowe, was not \nstricken from the telecommunications bill. I believe that our provision \nwill have a tremendous positive effect on rural health care. We are \nalready seeing amazing results in terms of quality of care and in \nimproving access to primary and specialty care in rural areas as a \nresult of telemedicine. This amendment will make sure that the \nimportant progress we have made in rural health care will continue and \nexpand.\n limiting access by children to inappropriate materials on the internet\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, as you know, the Internet is a remarkable \ndevelopment that has transformed the way people communicate. On the \nInternet, you can converse on-line with family, friends, and associates \nacross the globe, search untold numbers of data bases on every \nimaginable subject, and share ideas with millions with the push of a \nbutton. The Internet is an enormous highway with few rules. Its \nsimplicity is part of its appeal. But its lack of rules is also a \nsource of considerable concern, because of the widespread availability \nof materials on the Internet that are entirely inappropriate for \nchildren.\n  Certainly one option is to impose stricter legal penalties for \nputting offensive materials on the net, and the provisions in the bill \naccomplish this. I am concerned about these provisions, however, \nbecause they challenge first amendment rights and undermine one of the \nfreest, most spontaneous communications media ever devised.\n  Another approach is to pursue a technological solution. Parents can \nblock [[Page S8474]] cable TV channels they deem inappropriate for \nchildren. We need similar controls for the Internet and other \nelectronic communications media.\n  Some Internet providers are offering schools a service that denies \naccess to unsuitable Internet sites. One software vendor is now \noffering a service which identifies and, if a parent desires, filters \nout inappropriate materials on the Internet. These are encouraging \nsteps, and I hope industry will continue to develop and market such \nservices. These services must be purchased, however, and will not come \ncheap for all Internet users. Hence a more ubiquitous fix is needed.\n  Another option, addressed in this amendment, is to include a ``tag'' \nor ``marker'' in the filename of Internet text or graphics of a mature \nnature. For example, if an Internet user is preparing to post a file \nthat is of a mature nature, he or she can include a tag such as \n``adult'' or ``mature'' in the file name. Similarly, he or she can put \nthis tag in an address--essentially this would mark all files under \nthat address as inappropriate for children. It is then a simple matter \nfor programmers who develop the software that connects users to the \nInternet to include an optional parental block to filter out all such \nfiles. Teachers could use the filter as well.\n  This amendment simply encourages the Internet community to self-\nregulate its behavior by adding tags to files that are inappropriate \nfor children. It does not mandate such tags, Mr. President. The \namendment encourages vendors of software that links users to the \nInternet to include a parental block to filter out the tagged files. \nFinally, it requires the Department of Commerce to promote the program \nand GAO to study whether the voluntary tags are effective after one \nyear. This amendment does not conflict in any way with the indecency \nprovisions in the bill.\n  I should note that one industry initiative, announced Monday, \ninvolves putting a ``stamp of approval'' on materials judged \nappropriate for children, where parents can then choose to let their \nchildren see only those approved materials. Since the vast majority of \nmaterial on the Internet is entirely appropriate for children, it is \nunclear how this idea can be implemented practically. It is nonetheless \na useful initiative and complements the approach of this amendment.\n  This amendment offers only a partial fix, but in concert with \nappropriate legal penalties and other technical approaches, it will \nhelp address a very serious problem.\n                                bellcore\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the \ninterested parties to the Bellcore issue raised during the debate on \nthe manager's amendment have come to an agreement on a statement of \ngoals that outline a mutually agreeable solution to the issue. The \nparties intend to negotiate legislative language to be included in the \nfinal bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the statement of goals be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Statement of Goals for Amendment on Standards-Making and Certification\n\n       In addition to the provisions in S. 652 regarding Bellcore \n     manufacturing, the parties agree to negotiate an amendment \n     for adoption in the final act that will:\n       Ensure that entities engaged in industry-wide \n     telecommunications equipment standards-making use open and \n     non-discriminatory procedures.\n       Ensure that any entity that is an affiliate of more than \n     one Bell operating company will engage in open, fair, and \n     non-discriminatory establishment of generic network \n     requirements intended to be a significant reference point for \n     more than one Bell operating company in their product \n     specifications, standards-making, and product certification \n     for hardware, software, and related products when such \n     company undertakes an activity for more than one company.\n       Ensure that Bellcore, if no longer an affiliate of any Bell \n     operating company, will not be considered a Bell operating \n     company, or a successor or assign of a Bell operating \n     company.\n       Ensure that the Bell operating companies have choices in \n     awarding contracts for the purpose of establishing product \n     and service standards and requirements.\n       Ensure that vendors selling telecommunications equipment to \n     Bell operating companies have opportunities to have their \n     equipment certified under circumstances that are open, fair, \n     and non-discriminatory.\n       Ensure that proprietary information submitted in the \n     standards-making and certification processes is not released \n     for any purpose other than that authorized by the owner of \n     such information.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It is my desire that the parties conclude these \nnegotiations in a timely manner. I will support the product of the \nnegotiations and urge that the Senate accept that product in the final \nversion of this bill. Finally, I would like to thank the Senator from \nNorth Carolina for helping to bring the parties back to the negotiating \ntable.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I concur with the Senator's statement. It is in \neveryone's best interest to seek a negotiated settlement. I thank the \nSenator for his work in getting the parties to agree to the statement \nof goals. It is an important first step. I understand that the \nstatement of goals is acceptable to all Senators that have expressed an \ninterest in this issue, including Senators Helms, Bradley, Dorgan, \nExon, and Kerry. I also understand that the statement of goals is \nacceptable to the managers of the bill, and that the managers are \namendable to including the negotiated legislative language in the final \nbill.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I shall stop speaking the minute either \nthe Majority Leader or Minority Leader walk in the door. I wanted to \ntake this time to make my concluding remarks.\n  I think this bill will result in lower telephone rates, lower cable \nrates, and more services to the American people. I think this is a very \nexciting era, and this bill an historic opportunity. I hope the House \nacts quickly, and I hope we have a conference as soon as is \npracticable. I hope a Conference Report can be adopted by both the \nHouse and the Senate, and I hope the President will sign the bill.\n  The intention of this bill is to get everybody else into everybody \nelse's business. It is to promote competition and to deregulate. It has \nbeen a struggle because almost everybody in the industry says they are \nfor deregulation. Yes, they say they are for deregulation, but they \nusually mean deregulation of the other guy.\n  This is a balanced, bipartisan bill. I think it is truly the first \nmajor bipartisan bill we have moved through the Senate this year. We \nhave had our differences, but I believe that this bill will cause an \nexplosion of new jobs. I believe that it will cause a new era, similar \nto what has occurred in the computer industry.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1299, As Modified\n\n                           Amendment No. 1422\n\n                           Amendment No. 1423\n\n                           Amendment No. 1313\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nremaining Breaux amendment be modified with the modification I send to \nthe desk, that the modified amendment be agreed to and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that it be in order for me to \nsend to the desk two technical amendments and a modification of \namendment No. 1313, that they be considered and agreed to, en bloc, and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendments (Nos. 1299, as modified; 1422; 1423; 1313) were \nagreed to, as follows:\n                           Amendment No. 1299\n\n       On page 123, line 10, add the following new sentence: \n     ``This section shall take effect for each vessel upon a \n     determination by the United States Coast Guard that such \n     vessel has the equipment required to implement the Global \n     Maritime Distress and Safety System installed and operating \n     in good working condition.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1422\n\n       In section 623 of the Communications Act of 1934 (as added \n     by section 204 of the bill on page 70), strike ``and does \n     not, directly or through an affiliate, own or control a daily \n     newspaper or a tier 1 local exchange carrier.'' and insert \n     ``and is not affiliated with any entity or entities whose \n     gross annual revenues in the aggregate exceed \n     $250,000,000.''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1423\n\n       In section 262 of the Communications Act of 1934, as added \n     by section 308 of the bill--\n       (1) strike subsection (e) and insert the following:\n       ``(e) Guidelines.--Within 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1995, the \n     Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board \n     [[Page S8475]] shall develop guidelines for accessibility of \n     telecommunications equipment and customer premises equipment \n     in conjunction with the Commission on the National \n     Telecommunications and Information Administration and the \n     National Institute of Standards and Technology. The Board \n     shall review and update the guidelines periodically.\n       (2) strike subsection (g) and insert the following:\n       ``(g) Regulations.--The Commission shall, not later than 24 \n     months after the date of enactment of the Telecommunications \n     Act of 1995, prescribe regulations to implement this section. \n     The regulations shall be consistent with the guidelines \n     developed by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers \n     Compliance Board in accordance with subsection (e).\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1313\n\n       On page 116, between lines 2 and 3 insert the following:\n       (D) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Commission, \n     for interstate services, and the States, for intrastate \n     services, from considering the profitability of \n     telecommunications carriers when using alternative forms of \n     regulation other than rate of return regulation (including \n     price regulation and incentive regulation) to ensure that \n     regulated rates are just and reasonable.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think the distinguished Democratic leader \nwould like to speak at this time. As I understand, after he speaks, I \nwill have just a few minutes to speak on my amendment. Then we vote on \nthe Dole amendment and then final passage.\n  I hope during the two votes I can determine what we will do the \nbalance of the day and the balance of the week, so my colleagues will \nhave some information before 6 o'clock. We are attempting to take up \ntwo bills and we are meeting objections from different sides for \ndifferent reasons on each. We may be able to work that out during the \nvote.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, citizens in my State of South Dakota \noften ask me, what does this legislation mean to the State of South \nDakota? What does it mean to people living in small cities?\n  I say a great deal.\n  First it will mean that a small city will be able to be on the same \nbasis as a big city in terms of getting information. We have CitiBank's \ncredit card operation located in Sioux Falls. We have the Spiegel \nCatalog telephone mail order facility in Rapid City.\n  Recently, a team from Georgetown University came to Sioux Falls to \nstart a joint research project on telemedicine. Georgetown is planning \nto work with a Sioux Falls hospital to establish this telemedicine \nproject.\n  Recently, I was talking to some of the major universities in this \ncountry about partnering with small South Dakota colleges. Modern \ntelecommunications will make such partnerships not only possible, but \nproductive.\n  I have recently approached one of the largest companies in the United \nStates about doing a project jointly with small companies, using modern \ntelecommunications.\n  The city of Aberdeen, SD, has a new upgrade digital switch. They are \nnow able to use this capability for telemedicine, to have an \ninteraction with some of the big hospitals as operations are being \nperformed. As a result of the upgrade, a major motel chain, Super 8, \nwas able to locate its nationwide reservation system in the city.\n  Someone living in a small city or a small town has the same \ninformation available as someone in a great city. You do not have to be \nin downtown New York, downtown Minneapolis, or in downtown Los Angeles \nto get information, use it and respond to it.\n  The executive director of the Northeast Council of Governments in my \nState has sent me a well-prepared report on what new telecommunications \nwill mean in that region of smaller cities in rural areas. She reports \nthat upgrading telecommunications technology has already attracted \nnational companies to Aberdeen, where they have created hundreds of new \njobs in the last year.\n  Other communities are clamoring for upgrades to their communications \ntechnology. They know this will help improve the quality of life in \ntheir communities.\n  Faye Kann's report also describes the potential for telemedicine and \nlong-distance learning with an improved telecommunications \ninfrastructure in northeast South Dakota.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this report printed in the Record.\n         Telecommunication Technology in Northeast South Dakota\n\n                             (By Faye Kann)\n\n       Competition in the telecommunications arena could benefit \n     rural areas such as northeast South Dakota. The SD Public \n     Utilities Commission worked very hard to help Aberdeen and \n     the region upgrade the telecommunications capabilities in \n     order to effectively compete for business retention and \n     creation. With the availability of competition, the upgrade \n     of technology equipment could have occurred earlier.\n       In 1994-5, approximately 400 jobs have been newly created \n     or retained in Aberdeen due to the upgrade of \n     telecommunications technology and the ability for rapid data \n     transmission. Four separate national and local entities saw \n     the opportunity to utilize upgraded telecommunications \n     equipment but needed the assistance of the state PUC in order \n     to obtain the equipment upgrades. Companies such as Super 8 \n     reservation systems, Howard Johnson's Reservation system, \n     Aman Collection Company, and Student Loan Finance Corporation \n     are among companies that added employees due to the \n     technology upgrades. Without the telecommunications upgrade, \n     one of these companies would have located in another state \n     instead of South Dakota.\n       Those upgrades include the installation of SwitchNet 56, \n     ISDN lines, and Signal 7 technology. That more up-to-date \n     technology has enabled those companies to locate and maintain \n     their companies in Aberdeen and keep jobs in northeast South \n     Dakota. The increased payrolls and job opportunities have \n     added to the number of jobs available to a broad spectrum of \n     age groups employed in telecommunication agencies. The \n     general nature of telecommunications jobs allow for flexible \n     work schedules to accommodate workers from all age groups to \n     interact both professionally and to maintain their excellent \n     quality of life in South Dakota.\n       Other communities in northeast South Dakota such as \n     Britton, Eureka, and Gettysburg are actively seeking job \n     growth due to upgrades in telecommunications equipment \n     throughout the region. Manufacturers in Britton such as \n     Horton Industries and Sheldahl, Inc. with approximately 400 \n     employees are currently using telecommunications equipment to \n     communicate with their suppliers, markets, potential \n     contracts and corporate headquarters. Use of the \n     telecommunications equipment allows for quick, effective two-\n     way interaction in the design stage before production.\n       Another component of the telecommunications industry \n     focuses on long distance learning. The statewide Rural \n     Development Telecommunications Network (RDTN) allows higher \n     education to offer classes for students across the state. \n     Schools in communities such as Groton, Frederick, and Webster \n     in northeast South Dakota utilize cost efficiencies and class \n     offerings that are available with telecommunications through \n     the North Central Area Interconnect (NCAI) system. Continuing \n     education for communities and school district staff allow for \n     future development and curriculum enhancement.\n       Northern State University is moving ahead with expanding \n     the connections on campus. The campus infrastructure would \n     allow all video/audio conferences, meetings and instructional \n     programs to be shown in the individual classrooms. Many \n     classrooms, one existing microcomputer lab, and a new multi-\n     media based Instructional Classroom will be connected to the \n     LAN network. This classroom will be equipped with appropriate \n     printers, scanners, and display equipment as well as a fully \n     interactive video-conferencing component.\n       In addition, telemedicine is being used in the experimental \n     stage in the region. The impact of the next phase of the \n     regional telecommunications upgrade will place the high \n     resolution telecommunications equipment in outlying clinic \n     for patient diagnosis and effective utilization of \n     physician's assistants and nurse practitioners. Those types \n     of clinics are in communities where doctors are unwilling or \n     unable to locate. The aging population as shown in the \n     demographics of South Dakota rate health care as one of the \n     top concerns.\n       Another community which is a good example of the need for \n     state-of-the-art technology for a point of presence and fiber \n     optics is Huron. Several major employers have considered \n     Huron for economic development expansion but because of the \n     lack of access and equipment, jobs and economic opportunity \n     were denied in the northeast region of South Dakota. When \n     checking with telecommunications companies who provide the \n     necessary equipment, the cost to benefit ratio is not \n     attractive in the rural areas and therefore equipment has not \n     been installed and access is denied.\n       Education, government, and business are supporting the \n     creation of CityNet in Aberdeen. The local cable company is \n     upgrading its system with the installation of a large fiber-\n     optic cable network. In addition to the cable company's \n     normal services, this fiber- [[Page S8476]] optic \n     infrastructure will be used to connect various entities (K-12 \n     education, higher education, all levels of governments, \n     health care, and individual homes and businesses). The uses \n     for the network are virtually limitless and offer a means for \n     connections not only within the community but to the world as \n     this network connects with other networks.\n       Competition coupled with universal service is a must for \n     rural states to have access for all citizens. If major \n     telecommunications networks such as Internet access are \n     denied in the rural areas, state-of-the-art technology will \n     be deployed only in the mass markets with dense population \n     where the providers are able to obtain cost-benefit ratios \n     which are attractive to the provider. It is imperative that \n     Congress understand this issue. Aberdeen hosts an annual \n     telecommunications conference and was the first demonstration \n     nationwide with an interactive two-way audio/video link over \n     the public switched network with the US Senate Recording \n     Studio in 1994. We invite interested parties to northeast \n     South Dakota to view our projects and partake in \n     demonstrations of the effect of utilization of the \n     technology.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I have received a letter from Laska \nSchoenfelder, public utilities commissioner of the State of South \nDakota. Commissioner Schoenfelder has many years experience working to \nsupport South Dakota consumers and to help provide them better \ntelecommunications services. She enthusiastically endorses S. 652.\n  Commissioner Schoenfelder writes, ``This bill will allow Americans \ngreater access to communication services at an affordable price which \ncan only be achieved through a competitive market. The bill also \npreserves universal service, which is vital to rural states.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         South Dakota Public Utilities Commission, State Capitol \n           Building,\n                                         Pierre, SD, June 9, 1995.\n     Memo to: Senator Larry Pressler.\n     From: Laska Schoenfelder, SD Public Utilities Commissioner.\n     Re SD 652.\n       Residential and business consumers of communication \n     services will be the real winners if Senator Pressler's bill, \n     the Communication Act of 1995 (SB 652), passes.\n       While South Dakota has promoted telecommunications \n     competition at the state level this bill will be a boon for \n     economic development in all states. This bill takes a step \n     forward in recognizing the essential role of the State in \n     promoting fair competition.\n       This bill will allow Americans greater access to \n     communication services at an affordable price which can only \n     be achieved through a competitive market. The bill also \n     preserves Universal Service which is vital to rural states.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, competition and deregulation will bring \ngreat benefits to South Dakota and other States with small cities.\n  For example, the bill is designed to rapidly accelerate private \nsector development of advanced telecommunications and information \ntechnologies and services to all Americans by opening all \ntelecommunications markets to competition.\n  A recent series of television commercials have shown people sending \nfaxes from the beach, having meetings via computer with people in a \nforeign country, using their computer to search for theater tickets and \na host of other services that soon will be available. My bill would \nmake those services available even sooner by removing restrictive \nregulations.\n  A person living in Brandon could work at a job in Minneapolis or \nChicago, students in Lemmon would be able to take classes from teachers \nin Omaha, and doctors in Freeman could consult with specialists at the \nMayo Clinic. Telecommunications can bring new economic growth, \neducation, health care and other opportunities to South Dakota.\n  Competition in the information and communications industries means \nmore choices for people in South Dakota. It will also mean lower costs \nand a greater array of services and technologies. For instance, \ncompeting for\n customers will compel companies to offer more advanced services like \ncaller ID or local connections to on-line services such as Prodigy and \nAmerica On-Line.\n\n  It hasn't been that long since Ma Bell was everyone's source for \nlocal phone service, long distance service and phone equipment. Now \nthere are over 400 long distance companies and people can buy phone \nequipment at any department or discount store. Under my bill, \neventually people would be able to choose from more than one local \nphone service or cable television operator.\n  This new competition also should lead to economic development \nopportunities in South Dakota. People will be able to locate businesses \nin towns like Groton and Humboldt and serve customers in Hong Kong or \nNew York City. We are entering an exciting, historic era. I want to \nspur growth and bring new opportunities to South Dakota and everywhere \nin America.\n  Mr. President, we are reaching the close of this debate and a vote on \nfinal passage of S. 652. I am confident we are about to approve \ntelecommunications reform by a wide margin.\n  This reform is not a partisan issue. This is the first major \nbipartisan legislation of the 104th Congress. I want to thank my \ncomanager, the Senator from South Carolina, for his leadership. Today's \nvote will bring to fruition a project he has been working on for many, \nmany years. I want to thank the majority leader and the minority leader \nfor their indispensable efforts for passage of this bill.\n  The bill we are about to pass will break up monopolies. It will tear \ndown competitive barriers. It will open up communications networks.\n  Mr. President, every American household and every business large and \nsmall, uses the services we are about to make more competitive. The \nbill we are about to pass will give the American people unprecedented \nfreedom to choose.\n  After this bill is signed and implemented, Americans will be free to \nchoose from competing local phone companies. This is unprecedented. It \nwill lower prices. It is pro-consumer.\n  S. 652 will give Americans freedom to choose among more long-distance \ncompanies. This will cut prices. This is pro-consumer.\n  This bill will usher in a new era of robust competition in cable TV. \nIt will, in effect, break up all the cable TV monopolies. This will \ngive consumers more freedom to choose. It will cut prices. It will \nexpand services. This, too, is pro-consumer.\n  S. 652 will let electric utility firms get into the phone or cable \nbusiness if they wish. It will give broadcasters new flexibility to use \nnew digital technology to offer multichannel programming with the same \nallocated spectrum that formerly could carry only one channel. This, \nMr. President, dramatically gives consumers more freedom to choose.,\n  No earlier legislation concerning cable prices--neither the \nderegulation of 1984 nor the reregulation of 1992--included these \npowerful procompetitive reforms.\n  This reform bill is historic. It is strongly bipartisan. It deserves \nthe President's support.\n  Some who still oppose our reform bill are trying to get the \nPresident's ear. They say this bill will lead to more concentration in \nthe communications business. I say that is a myth.\n  Concentration is what we have had under the old, 1930s-era system of \ngovernment-created monopolies. Breaking up the monopolies and lifting \nburdensome regulation will give room for more entrepreneurs to compete.\n  Just consider other segments of the information industry, segments \nwhich did not strain under\n regulation and the monopoly model:\n\n  Fax machines aren't regulated or organized into a government-\nsanctioned monopoly. Just look at how prices have dropped, quality has \nimproved, and sales have soared.\n  So it is, too, with cellular phones and pagers.\n  The computer market now gives consumers 200 times more value, in \nterms of lower price and greater power, than it offered just a decade \nago.\n  Freedom for consumers and entrepreneurs did not lead to concentration \nin the computer business. No, quite the contrary. There have been \nwinners and losers, large and small. Hundreds of start-up firms have \nflourished, including Gateway 2000 in my State of South Dakota. \nMeanwhile the biggest computer firm of all has seen a huge loss in \nmarket share and has been forced into significant restructuring. Free \nmarket capitalism breeds a kind of creative destruction of big \nbusinesses. This is good for continuing innovation and renewal in \nbusiness. It is clearly pro-consumer. [[Page S8477]] \n  Mark my word, in the years after this bill comes into force, it will \nhave helped bring about the rise of exciting new firms which do not \nexist today. It will have helped usher in industry segments which have \nno lobbyists in the reception room today--industry segments which do \nnot even exist at this time.\n  This bill will accelerate the digital revolution. Through \ndigitization, the very same data can travel through space from \nsatellites, over the atmospheric spectrum, through coaxial cable, \nfiber-optic threads or copper wire. The same digitized data can be \nstored on computer disks or drives, displayed on computer screens, or \nplayed on audio or video disk players. The trends of technology are \nerasing old distinctions between cable TV, telephone service, \nbroadcasting, audio and video recording, and interactive personal \ncomputers.\n  But in many instances, the only thing standing in the way of \nconsumers and businesses enjoying cheaper and more flexible \ntelecommuncations services is our outdated law. This reform bill will \nallow the cable, telephone, computer, broadcasting, and other \ntelecommunications industries more easily to converge and transform \nthemselves.\n  The information industry already constitutes one-seventh of the U.S. \neconomy. Worldwide, the information marketplace is projected to exceed \n$3 trillion by the close of the decade.\n  Digital convergence, more communicating power, and wide-open \ncompetition is what consumers want. It is what American businesses need \nto stay competitive with the rest of the world. It will come soon if \nthe President signs this reform legislation.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota for \nyielding and congratulate him for the outstanding job he has done, as \nwell as the Senator from South Carolina, for their teamwork, efforts, \nand partnership that produced a historic bill.\n  No question about it, this is one of the most important pieces of \nlegislation we may have passed so far this year. Others may have \ndifferent views. But it is near the top of the list.\n  The Senator from South Dakota, Senator Daschle, the Democratic \nleader, is in a meeting, so I will make my little statement on my \namendment, and then we will vote on that. After that vote, he will make \na very brief statement and then we will vote on final passage. Is that \nsatisfactory?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1341\n\n  Mr. DOLE. The vote will occur in a minute on the so-called Dole \namendment.\n  It was explained earlier, but I want to make myself perfectly clear, \nthis amendment is about allowing private interests--not big \nGovernment--to work out their own problems.\n  I thought that is why we were considering this bill in the first \nplace. The telecommunications industry is currently one of the most \nregulated industries in the United States. Unfortunately, the \nprovisions in question regulate prices.\n  The point is that business should be allowed to negotiate. As I have \npointed out, the provision I have proposed to delete would prohibit \nsuch negotiation, and amounts to rate regulation. It is that simple--no \nmore, no less.\n  The language is there. We had negotiations and worked on their \ndifferences. I do not know about all the discussion of the Senator from \nNebraska. I am not involved with all that.\n  The provision I proposed was supposed to stop some players from \ntaking advantage of small operators. There is no question it would do \nthat, but it would also hurt those in fair deals. It solves the \nproblems and creates a new one.\n  The bill's provision also does not treat all programmers evenly, and \nonly applies to those affiliated with cable TV companies, meaning \nnonaffiliated programmers not under these pricing restrictions. That \nmeans they would have an unfair competitive advantage.\n  Not only does the bill regulate the price of programming, but it is \nanticompetitive. That is not what this bill is about. I printed in the \nRecord earlier letters from Turner Broadcasting, representing the \nDiscovery Channel, the Black Entertainment Network, and also--I do not \nhave the letter with me now--all the small cable companies, the \nNational Cable Television Cooperative, and they are all in support of \nthe bill.\n  I have heard the comments of the Senator from Nebraska. He is \nentitled to his own interests, but I assure him, my interest in this \namendment is consistent with the intent of this bill--getting \nGovernment off the backs of business and benefiting consumers.\n  I hope the amendment I am offering will pass. I think it will have \nbipartisan support.\n  I yield back my time and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Following the vote, the Senator from South Dakota, Senator \nDaschle, will be recognized, and then we will have final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the Dole amendment?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I would use this opportunity to commend \nboth the ranking member of the committee, the Senator from South \nCarolina, and the chairman of the committee, for the good work they \nhave done.\n  This has not been an easy process, I say to all of our colleagues. We \nhave worked on this for not just a couple of days on the floor, but we \nhave been working on this legislation for several years.\n  In the last Congress, all Members of the committee spent 2 years on \nthis communications bill, and then again the better part of this year, \nworking on trying to bring this product to the floor.\n  There has been a great deal of compromise. There has been a great \ndeal of trying to balance the very competing interests in order to get \na 1995 communications bill.\n  I think it is important that all of our colleagues realize that this \ncountry has been run by the 1934 Communications Act. That is hard to \nbelieve that we have been operating under an act that is 60 years old. \nDoes anybody think that the communications technology of 1995 is \nanywhere similar to the communications technology of 1934? The answer \nis, of course, no.\n  The reason everybody has been in court is because Congress was unable \nto get an agreement that wrote a modern 20th century bill to govern all \nthe decisions about who does what.\n  This legislation makes some fundamental points. That is that we are \ngoing to create more competition. Competition is good for society. It \nis good for consumers. It is good for the development of new \ntechnology. This legislation is a fragile compromise. Almost everyone \nin the industry would like to have more. Some would like to have \nguarantees with regard to what they can do and what they cannot do.\n  We were trying to really create a bill that was fair to all of our \nAmerican industries and fair to the American consumer. I think that \nwhile this bill is certainly not perfect--nothing we ever do is--\ncertainly, it represents a major milestone in the communications \nlegislation that has been brought before the Congress over all of these \nlast 60 years since the first passage of the 1934 Communications Act.\n  I congratulate all the members of the Commerce Committee for their \ninput, their suggestions. We have had a lot of cooperation on the \nfloor. A lot of very difficult things have been worked out. I think \nthat is good.\n  With regard to the Dole amendment, I happen to agree with it. I think \nthe amendment by Senator Dole really will encourage more competition \nand will encourage small cable companies to be able to form \ncooperatives like they are doing in order to be able to get discounts \nbecause they purchase cable services in volume just like the larger \ncable companies will be able to get volume discounts because they buy \nlarge amounts of products from the various producers. I think the Dole \namendment really does try to promote additional competition. I think in \nthat sense--it does allow cooperatives to be formed--there is nothing \nwrong with that.\n  There was a lot made about who does this benefit and what-have-you, I \nthink it benefits the consumer. I think the Dole amendment is a good \nconsumer amendment. It encourages small cooperatives and cable \ncompanies to be able to deliver services at a better rate. There is \nnothing wrong with that. It allows large sellers of cable services to \n[[Page S8478]] get volume discounts. The ultimate benefit of all of \nthis is the American consumer.\n  I think the ultimate benefit of the entire package we have before the \nCongress is the American consumer and those who bring about the \ntechnology for the 21st century. If there is one thing the United \nStates of America excels in--there are so many things, but one thing is \nthe entertainment industry, the telecommunications industry. We can be \nproud of that. Other countries would love to have what we have in this \ncountry. This bill ultimately will make all of that a lot better and we \nwill all benefit from that product.\n  So I support an affirmative vote on the Dole amendment and certainly \nsupport the passage of the telecommunications act that is now pending.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I thank the Senator from Louisiana. He has been at the \nforefront every step of the way in this bill and we could not have done \nit without his bipartisan effort.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, telecommunications reform legislation was \na focus of the last Congress. Unfortunately, election-year politics \nprevented then-Chairman Hollings from bringing the bill to the floor \nfor a vote.\n  This year, with changes and modifications that are inevitable given \nthe political change in the make-up of the Congress, a new \ntelecommunications was brought to the Senate floor.\n  This is complex and potentially far-reaching legislation. It will \naffect an economic sector that constitutes 20 percent of our economy \nand whose services reach virtually every American.\n  I want to commend the ranking member of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, Senator Hollings, whose patience and efforts have done a \ngreat deal to bring this measure to its present state. Senator \nHollings' work in the last Congress, and in this, has been focused on \ndeveloping a bill that will enhance true competition in the \ntelecommunications field without shortchanging American consumers.\n  From the beginning, our nation has understood the significance of \ncommunications and transportation. It is not an accident that the words \nof the Constitution require the Congress ``To establish Post Offices \nand post Roads.'' The Founders could not have known that one day the \nroads would be fiber networks and the post offices would be e-mail. Yet \nthat is where we have arrived.\n  When Congress first confronted the need to legislate for an entirely \nnew technology, it produced the Communications Act of 1934. The \nregulated monopoly that was legislated into existence by that law was \nthe best outcome then possible. And the old Bell system gave Americans \nthe cheapest, most efficient universal telephone service in the world.\n  In fact, consumer resistance to the breakup of the Bell phone system \nwas widespread in the early 1980's. Americans feared that the courts \nwere breaking up something that worked well and might replace it with \nsomething that didn't.\n  We know today that those fears were unfounded. Competition in phone \nservice has been a boon to American consumers. Long-distance rates are \nthe lowest in the world. Equipment is cheaper and better-made. \nCompetition has spurred innovation and improved customer service.\n  At the same time, it's important to remember and learn from our \nexperience. The concept of universal service was at the heart of the \nold 1934 Communications Act. It is a New Deal era concept that is as \nvalid today as it has proven to be over the decades.\n  When the reach of a technology is limited by cost, innovation and \nprogress remain slow. But as soon as a technology is within reach of a \nbroader sector of the population, an explosion of invention, \ndevelopment and innovation takes place. We have seen that happen in \ncomputers, in personal communications services, in wireless cable \ntransmissions and countless other\n applications. Twenty years ago, calculators were sophisticated and \nrelatively costly devices. Today they're offered as advertising \npromotions.\n\n  While legislation focuses on competition and deregulation, the bill \nbefore us also contains essential rural safeguards. It would create a \nFederal-State joint board to oversee the continuing issue of rural \nservice and to monitor and help evolve a definition of Universal \nService that makes sense for the present day and for the kinds of \nservices that will be coming on-line. It does not demand unrealistic \ncompetition in towns of 50 households.\n  Our own history teaches us that it is good economics for the private \nsector as well as the public sector to make universal service a reality \nfor all Americans, no matter how small their community. I believe this \nis still the case, and I believe it is particularly important to \npreserve the viability of rural communities in this respect.\n  The legislation before us recognizes the need to redefine universal \nservice in terms of developing technology and products. The joint \nFederal-State board created by the bill is essential to making certain \nthis function is fulfilled.\n  The bill before us also recognizes the important role that must be \nplayed by State Public Utilities Commissions. PUCs are the best \nentities to judge whether a given market within their State can or \ncannot support competition. That's not a judgment we should make from \nWashington.\n  Nor is it something we can or should leave to the unbridled, \nunsupervised judgment of the private sector. Those who have taken the \nrisks and made the investments to extend cable or phone service to \nsmaller rural communities should not now be placed at risk of being \noverwhelmed by larger, better-financed companies.\n  As Congressman Ed Markey has said, that's not competition, it's \n``communications cannibalism.'' State PUC's will be able to judge where \ncommunities can sustain competition and [[Page S8479]] where they \ncannot. We should preserve the viability of the Universal Service Fund, \nfor that reason as well.\n  The purpose of the bill before us is to create the competitive, free \nmarket environment that will most efficiently bring the Information \nSuperhighway into existence for all Americans. I don't believe anyone \ndisagrees with that key to achieving that goal is competition. The \nSenate's task is to ensure that the competitive elements in the bill do \nthe job.\n  The best outcome is one that brings on line the new products and \nservices that Americans want at a cost they're willing and able to pay. \nNot only will consumers benefit, but the process of creating new \nservices and products will be a substantial engine of job creation.\n  The present economic recovery has been a period of exceptionally \nstrong job creation. Under the Clinton administration, 6 million new \njobs have been created, more in he first 2\\1/4\\ years of this \nadministration than in the preceding 8 years of the Reagan-Bush \nadministration.\n  Democrats believe the key to longlasting economic growth and \nexpansion is the creation of more jobs and higher income for working \nfamilies. When Americans are working and earning good wages, our \neconomy prospers and we can invest for the future well being of our \nchildren. The passage of the bill before us will help continue this \npattern of job creation as our information-based economy creates \nsignificant employment opportunities. That will mean more families can \nsend their kids to college, buy a home, and save for their own future. \nThat is the best economic program and the best social program any \nnation can have.\n  This technology also means new opportunities for innovative economic \ndevelopment. I am in the process of working with a tribal college now \non ways to market native American and agricultural products through the \nInternet. The technology that is helping do this is breaking down the \ngeographic and technical barriers that have retarded our movement to a \nmore information-based economy.\n  There is little doubt that our urban areas can and will sustain an \nenormous expansion of telecommunications services in the years ahead. \nWe must make certain that our rural areas are not left behind as \nservices expand and new products come on line. In the long run, \nuniversal service at high standards nationwide is in the best interests \nof the entire country.\n  In addition, we must not neglect the role of the public sector in the \nnew telecommunications world. Schools, public libraries, state \nuniversities, all should have the ability to share in and disperse the \nbenefits of the telecommunications revolution.\n  Senators Rockefeller and Snowe offered an amendment in committee to \nmake certain that the public sector's ability to connect with the \nInternet and other information services is enhanced. That's important, \nnot only to prevent stratification into information-rich and \ninformation-poor populations and regions, but to assure that all our \nchildren have the tools with which to enter the 21st century work \nforce.\n  While the bill before us is far from perfect, it has been \nsignificantly improved over the course of the past 6 days. Senator \nHollings and I introduced an amendment that strengthens the bad actor \ntest in the cable provisions.\n  It also places reasonable limitations on the ability of cable and \ntelephone companies to eliminate each other as potential competitors \nthrough buyouts and mergers, except in rural areas where competition \nmay not be viable.\n  Finally, our amendment, which was adopted, allows small telephone \ncompanies to jointly market local exchange service with long distance \nservice providers that carry less than 5 percent of our nation's long \ndistance business. This will allow consumers to realize the benefits of \ncompetition in the local telephone exchange, while preserving the \ncompetitive balance between the Bell companies and major long distance \ncarriers.\n  I believe the provisions in our amendment strike a better balance \nbetween consumer protections and market deregulation. These safeguards \nare designed to protect consumers by expanding services and keeping \nthem affordable.\n  This bill is a reasonable and balanced one, and it deserves the \nSenate's support.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, gentlemen start your engines, because we are \nabout to pass telecommunications reform that will be the roadmap to our \nNation's future.\n  When we started floor consideration of S. 652 more than 1 week ago, I \nnoted that this was just the beginning. A beginning of a new era of \nleadership for the telecommunications industry and for America. While \nsome see America's power dwindling, I see it growing. I see our \nrenaissance, and its called the information age. America's years of \nleadership in telecommunications, whether it was inventing the \ntelegraph or the microchip, gives us the right to lay claim to this \nfuture. We have earned it. We must now reach out and take it.\n\n\n                recognizing senator pressler's hard work\n\n  And one person who deserves a good deal of credit for making this new \nera a reality is Senator Pressler. As all Members know, \ntelecommunications reform is a tough, complex, and often contentious \nissue. Congress has struggled with it for more than a decade, with no \nsuccess. And along comes Senator Pressler. He tackled this issue and \nhas moved it through the Senate in record time. His tenacity proves \nthat the Senate is capable of delivering on the toughest issues.\n  Not only did he have to fight competing interests, but also the White \nHouse. Senator Pressler has won, the Senate has won, and America has \nwon.\n  The bill also could not have been possible without Senator Hollings. \nBoth Senators Pressler and Hollings have done an outstanding job at \nbringing the competing interests together, or as close together as \npossible.\n\n\n                     the real jobs stimulus package\n\n  No doubt about it, telecommunications reform is the real jobs \nstimulus package. Except this one relies on the private sector to \ncreate those jobs. And it will.\n  Thousands of jobs will be necessary to build new communications \nnetworks. And that's just the beginning. Studies indicate that millions \nof more jobs will be created because information will become more \naccessible, jobs that will make America more efficient, more \nproductive, and ultimately more powerful.\n  While some may argue that it is not the perfect bill, its message is \nright--competition, not government, is the best regulator. Competition, \nnot regulation, has the best record for creating new jobs, spurring new \ninnovation, and creating new wealth. It's that simple.\n  Competition and deregulation are also the only ways to accommodate \nthe explosion of new technology.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, removing the telecommunications industry's shackles is \nnot about politics as usual. It is not about Republicans versus \nDemocrats. It is about providing all Americans, rich or poor, urban or \nrural, a better future. I believe that a procompetition, deregulatory \ntelecommunications bill can help make that future a reality.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that S. 652, as \namended, be printed in the Record immediately following the final vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on the passage of S. 652, \nas amended. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have Senator \nHollings added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question occurs on passage of S. 652, as amended.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, just let me indicate to my colleagues, as I \nsaid earlier before many were here, we hope to determine the balance of \nthe schedule this evening and tomorrow before 6 [[Page S8480]] o'clock \nthis evening, and so we will try to let everybody know by then what the \nschedule will be. Hopefully, it will not be too heavy. It depends on \nhow this bill comes out.\n  I will let Senators know in a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass? The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I thank everybody involved. I thank the \nmajority leader and minority leader. I have already thanked the staff. \nI am feeling like this Chamber was almost a funeral parlor this \nafternoon, we had so many good words said about everybody.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me indicate, as I did earlier, that this \nis a tremendous vote--81 to 18. It is a very significant piece of \nlegislation that has passed this Chamber, largely through the efforts \nof the distinguished Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Pressler].\n  It is not a perfect bill. I understand that almost everybody finds \nsomething wrong with it, which probably means it is not that bad; it is \nprobably a very good bill. I think it is a very important piece of \nlegislation. I thank all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for \ntheir cooperation.\n  I do not think we took too much time. On a bill of this magnitude, it \ntakes a little longer on the Senate side, and it probably should, as \nthe Senator from Illinois [Mr. Simon] said earlier today.\n  I thank the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, for his cooperation \nthroughout the debate.\n  Mr. President, I have had a discussion with the Senator from South \nDakota, [Mr. Daschle], the Democratic leader, and I outlined to him \nwhat I would like to do. First, I will ask unanimous consent that we go \nto S. 440--I will not ask it now--and I understand there will be an \nobjection. Then I will move to the consideration of S. 440, and I \nunderstand the Senator from Massachusetts, [Mr. Kennedy], and others \nwill at that point discuss the motion to proceed.\n  If that would be the case, there would be no votes tonight and no \nvotes tomorrow. Then we would try to work out something to accommodate \nour colleagues on Monday.\n  So I do not want to make the request until the Senator from South \nDakota indicates it is all right to do so.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the majority leader will yield. Let me just speak \nvery briefly, because I know there are other Members that need to \nconduct business. I share the sentiment expressed by the distinguished \nmajority leader about the bill just passed. It may not be everything we \nall want, but it represents a real achievement.\n  I commend the distinguished Senator from South Dakota and certainly \nthe ranking member, the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, for \nall of the effort he has put forth in the last seven days to accomplish \nwhat we have now. A number of people had a lot to do with bringing us \nto this point. It represents a balance between providing new \nopportunities and communications to provide the flexibility and the \nfreedom to go out and do what we must to build the information \nsuperhighway. But it also represents a desire on the part of many to \nprotect consumers as we conduct that construction.\n  So I hope very much that we can move this legislation through the \nremaining parts of the legislative process here and accommodate all \nSenators as we attempt to pass this very significant piece of \nlegislation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/15/senate-section/article/S8460-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, a few weeks ago, we in the Labor \nCommittee held a single hearing on Senator Kassebaum's legislation to \nrepeal outright Davis-Bacon, which has been in law for over 60 years.\n  Last year, we worked long and hard on an alternative Davis-Bacon \nreform bill on which there had been bipartisan support. That was a \nresponsible effort to deal with this issue and update the law.\n  Today, with little warning, the highway bill is being brought to the \nfloor, which contains a provision to repeal Federal prevailing wage-\nrate requirements for highway construction, known as the Davis-Bacon \nlaw.\n  This is part of the larger assault on working families, in this case, \nfamilies of highway construction workers who make between $20,000 to \n$30,000 a year.\n  This is central to the Republican agenda, and it is all in the name \nof deficit reduction--all while we protect the large military \ncontractors, big corporations with huge tax breaks, oil companies, and \nothers who have long been subsidized by the Federal Government.\n  Today, without any additional hearings or time for reflection or \ncareful consideration of reform alternatives--and my colleague from \nMassachusetts will be speaking on this in just a moment--we are faced \nwith a bill that would overturn 60 years of labor law related to \nFederal highway construction in a single moment.\n  Why is that? Could it have anything to do with the fact that the \nlarge trade association of mostly noncontract, nonunion contractors is \nin town this week? And this measure is suddenly brought to the floor \nnow, simply to fly the flag for anti-Davis-Bacon forces who would try \nto turn the clock altogether on prevailing fair-wage standards.\n  I do not know, Mr. President, but I am surprised by how suddenly the \nSenate's schedule was changed to bring this up. I thought we were going \nto turn to regulatory reform or Bosnia or welfare reform. Apparently \nthe majority leader has other priorities.\n  Mr. President, as a Senator from Minnesota, I am opposed to this \nattempt to slash wages of working families, families who dig our \nroadbeds, pour our tar, flag us to a stop at construction sites or do \nany other number of hard and sweaty jobs at construction sites and \nhighway sites across this country.\n  That is not a priority that I am willing to go along with. I will \nfight any effort to cut the wages of working families as hard as I can.\n  I imagine over the next several days, we will have a considerable \namount of discussion on this issue. We should be clear. This repeal \neffort is part of a larger systematic assault on the wages and living \nstandards of working families.\n  Mr. President, it is a mistake. We have cuts in Medicare, cuts in \nMedicaid, cuts in job training, cuts in school lunches, education, and \nnow cuts in the wages of working families.\n  Just name it, the majority has proposed it and are trying to program \nit through the Congress at a breakneck speed. We intend to slow it \ndown. We intend to oppose it. This highway bill on its own merits ought \nto be debated and is an important piece of legislation. To try to put \nthis amendment into the highway bill and essentially overturn over 60 \nyears of people's history I think it is a huge mistake. Of course, that \nis what this debate will be about.\n  Mr. President, let me just say a few words specifically on Davis-\nBacon itself and prevailing wage rates that it requires on certain \nFederal projects.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator allow me to, in the way of a question, \nmake a brief comment about why we did this?\n  I was the Senator that brought up the amendment in the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works. I did so in my capacity as chairman of \nthe subcommittee with the responsibility for this piece of legislation.\n  I say to my good friend, Mr. President, it was in no sense chicanery \nor subversion. It was done quite openly. This is an issue, Davis-Bacon, \non which many who have had the privilege of serving the institution for \nmany years have had a very clear difference of opinion. That difference \nof opinion is shared widely across this Nation. We will develop that in \nthe course of the debate.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted to have the opportunity to debate with \nmy good friend from Minnesota, my good friend from Massachusetts, and \nothers who will engage in this very important debate. We should not \nstart out with a characterization that there is any attempt on this \nside to do so by way of anything other than an absolute clear and full \ndiscussion of this issue in full view of everybody. Then it is my hope \nan up or down vote can be had here in the U.S. Senate on this issue. \nEach Senator can express for himself or herself their views on this.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague for allowing me to speak.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Virginia, \nand I thank him for his remarks, that I just want to be clear I am \nspeaking for myself, that I am very interested in this highway bill.\n  It is an important piece of legislation. We have been working for \nseveral years on reform of Davis-Bacon, not repeal. A lot of work has \ngone into that. But all of a sudden to have this become a part of this \npiece of legislation, I say to my colleague, I think is a profound \nmistake.\n  Speaking just for myself, I would point out that only today did I \nhear that this was going to be the bill before the U.S. Senate. Before, \nI thought we were going to go to regulatory reform, then I heard we \nwere going to go to welfare reform, then I heard we might be debating \nBosnia.\n  I know my colleague from Virginia is interested in full debate. That \nis what we will have and certainly we will make sure that it is not \npersonal or acrimonious. I want to be clear as to why we have objected \nto the motion to proceed and why we intend to have a very thorough \ndiscussion about Davis-Bacon and about this effort not only to repeal \nDavis-Bacon, but I think it goes beyond that. I think it is an effort \nto roll back 60 years of hard-earned history that have a lot to do with \npeople being able to have a decent wage, 60 years that have a lot to do \nwith people being able to have jobs that pay them a middle-class wage.\n  I think the stakes are very high. For that reason, with my colleague \nfrom Massachusetts, we intend to have a full discussion on that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I welcome that full discussion. But \nsomehow in the Senator's remarks, the remarks just given, I got the \nimpression, why on the highway bill? Mr. President, why is it? My \nprojections are $1.3 billion is directly associated with Davis-Bacon \nover the next 5 years of projected highway construction. Those are \nscarce dollars in today's economy. Those are dollars that could be \ntranslated into actual roads and road improvements were it not for this \npiece of legislation. And it is time. My distinguished colleague \nmentioned reform, he has been working on it for several years. Perhaps \nthe time has finally arrived for him to bring out those reforms. They \nare long overdue.\n  I simply think the statute has served its purpose. When I see $1.3 \nbillion taken from the highway budgets of our 50 States over the next 5 \nyears, this Senator says the time has come to eliminate it.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague for this opportunity to have a \nfew opening remarks.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think in a moment I would yield to my \ncolleague from Massachusetts, who will take the lead in this debate. I \nwill be very proud to be a part of it.\n  Again, let me say in this Congress I think we have had a single \nhearing on legislation to repeal outright the Davis-Bacon. We will \nsurely have a quarrel about the figures and amount of money lost. And \nwe certainly will have a full discussion about the meaning of \nprevailing wages and what that means to this country, what that means \nto this society, what that means to communities across the country. \nThat I think will be the important part of this debate.\n  There is no reason to argue any longer about the timing of it, but I \nwant to make it crystal clear that we [[Page S8482]] intend to focus on \nthis effort in this bill. And this bill is an important piece of \nlegislation. But this particular provision to repeal Davis-Bacon is, of \ncourse, where we intend to focus our attention.\n  I will yield to my colleague from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, no, I am not prepared to yield the \nfloor yet.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, why do I not go forward with some \nremarks. But if my colleague has a question, I do not want to interrupt \nthe flow of that.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I do not have a question. I was prepared to make a \nstatement.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. On Davis-Bacon?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. We will be here quite a while. Everybody will have a \nchance to say what they want. If the Senator has something to say, go \nahead. I will have my say later when he is through.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, why do I not defer to the manager, and \nI will speak later on, because I have extensive remarks on Davis-Bacon. \nSo I will defer to the manager of the bill and then be back in this \ndebate later on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am sorry we cannot proceed on this bill \nbecause this is an important bill. What it does, it opens the way to \nsome funds, additional funds in the neighborhood of some $5 billion \nthat we are going to have to--if we want, we are going to have to pass \nthis legislation before October. So now is the time to get with it.\n  I heard--I would like the Senator from Minnesota's attention if I \nmight. I heard him say how erroneous it was for us to be dealing with \nlegislation that has been on the books, I think he said, for 60 years? \nIs that the time limit, how long Davis-Bacon has been on?\n  I have seen the Senator on the floor discuss striker replacement that \nhas been on about the same length of time. He had no hesitancy about \ndealing with that legislation that has been on the books for a \nconsiderable time.\n  So dealing with legislation that has been on the books for some time, \nlabor legislation, is not unique in this place. It is not unique for \nthe Senator from Minnesota, either.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Sure.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. As I understand the debate about what was S. 55, which \nwas a ban on permanent replacement of striking workers, I would say to \nmy colleague, it was not an amendment on another piece of legislation. \nThat was a separate bill that went through extensive hearings, that was \nscheduled for debate, that came up at the time scheduled, and then led \nto full debate.\n  So I do think it is a rather different proposition.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, no one who has been in this Chamber very \nlong will find repeal of the Davis-Bacon is something new. We have \ndebated it. There have been hearings. There have been hearings in the \ncommittee of the Senator from Kansas, and the Senator from \nMassachusetts has been through those hearings many times. There is \nnothing unique.\n  This is not a creeping up by night with this provision.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. This is something that has been around. I do not know how \nmany times we voted on it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes, I will be glad to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague. As always he is very gracious.\n  My point was not that we have not debated the Davis-Bacon before. We \ncertainly have. My point simply was that this bill was just scheduled \nto come to the floor--we thought there were going to be any number of \nother pieces of legislation. It has come to the floor. Unfortunately, \nas a part of this piece of legislation, there is the provision for \nrepeal of Davis-Bacon. That is why we objected to the motion to \nproceed. That is why we will have extensive debate. That is my only \npoint.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would stress that the provision of \nDavis-Bacon that we have in this National Highway Systems law solely \ndeals with highway construction. It does not deal across the board. It \nseems to me there is no more appropriate place for it than in this \nNational Highway System legislation.\n  Let me just say a few words, if I might. First, Congress must approve \nthe National Highway System bill, as I mentioned, by September 1 of \nthis year. If we do not, the States will not receive--I said $5 \nbillion, it is $6.5 billion of their Federal aid highway money. This \namount includes $2.9 billion for interstate maintenance and $2.6 \nbillion for the National Highway System.\n  Mr. President, a few words about the National Highway System. Why are \nwe in this? The National Highway System was established by the so-\ncalled ISTEA, Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. \nThat was a major highway bill that we passed in 1991.\n  The National Highway System can make a significant contribution to \nour transportation system. The 159,000 miles of designated National \nHighway System routes are the roads the States and the localities have \nchosen as some of their most important roads. These are the roads that \nprovide mobility for our citizens and promote economic development.\n  The National Highway System, which includes the Interstate System--we \nare all familiar with the Interstate System--represents 4 percent of \nthe highways of the United States of America, a very small part. But \nthese are the important roads. These roads carry 40 percent of the \nNation's highway travel. These are the roads that connect our \nintermodal and strategic facilities such as our ports and airports and \ntrain stations and military bases.\n  How was the whole thing developed? What is the National Highway \nSystem? It was developed by the Department of Transportation through \nthe Federal Highway Administration in cooperation with the States. This \nwas not something drawn up in Washington by a bunch of Federal \nbureaucrats. This was done in cooperation with the States. The Federal \nHighway Administration and the States designated the system based on \nthe criteria of efficiency, connectivity, and equity among the States. \nThe mileage distribution among the States and between urban and rural \nareas was another important element.\n  The process to designate the National Highway System has worked quite \nwell. There is a high degree of consensus among Federal, State and \nlocal officials that the map submitted by the Secretary of \nTransportation in December of 1993 represents the best effort at \nidentifying the National System.\n  What has happened is that the Federal Highway Administration has \nworked with, as I say, the State and local officials, to make changes \nin this map of 1993 to reflect new information and decisions made at \nthe State and local level. This process will continue. This thing is \nnot carved in stone. People come to us and say: We want to be added. \nThere is a system for adding routes within the various States.\n  This legislation includes a provision which will permit this process \nto continue, even after this bill has been enacted into law. So State \nand local officials with the Secretary of Transportation's approval \nwill have the ability to make changes in this, as long--there is a \nmaximum limit of mileage. That maximum limit is 165,000 miles.\n  So what I am stressing here is that this is a dynamic, changing \nsystem, and it is important that the ability to make these changes is \nretained.\n  Because we have this process that involves the local officials, the \nState officials, and the Federal Government officials--namely, the \nhighway administrator--I think Congress has to be very restrained in \nmaking systems; in other words, changes. Somebody will pop up here on \nthe floor and say, ``I want such and such added, I so move.'' Well, \nmaybe that is valid. But we do not know. The managers of this bill, and \nthe others involved here on the floor, do not know whether that \nparticular road meets the criteria. So we have set forth in the \nlegislation a method of making changes. We think it is a fair \n[[Page S8483]] method. We want to resist the temptation to add a whole \nseries of other routes. Once we depart from the criteria, we say, \n``Well, Senator X has presented a very moving story about this highway \nhe wants added.'' But once we start down the path of not adhering to \nthe criteria or to the system set forth in the legislation, we are \nopening our way up to a lot of problems.\n  This bill which was reported out by the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee preserves the important principles of the 1991 surface \ntransportation law. That was a monumental piece of legislation that we \npassed. It makes changes to provide greater flexibility to the States \nto resist administrative burdens.\n  As I mentioned, there are a series of requirements that the States \nare relieved from, the principal one being the Davis-Bacon Act which \nbrings us here this evening. The bill also provides additional \nflexibility for design standards for the national highway routes which \nare not applicable to the Interstate System.\n  This legislation which is S. 440--we will hear that term quite often \nthis evening; that is the number of this bill--provides the States with \nadditional financing options to address the needs of the transportation \nsystems. It allows the States to credit private sector donations 100 \npercent to the States' cost share.\n  This legislation addresses something that those of us here in this \nSenate are pretty familiar with, and that is the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. \nThe replacement of that bridge is essential. Its remaining lifespan is \nestimated to be only 10 years. The bridge was designed 40 years ago to \ncarry 75,000 vehicles a day. How many vehicles does it carry, 75,000? \nNo. Today the bridge carries 167,000, more than twice what it was \ndesigned for as maximum load.\n  Title II of this legislation authorizes the States of Virginia, \nMaryland, and the District of Columbia to enter into an interstate \nagreement or a compact to establish the National Capital Interstate \nTransportation Authority. I must say sometimes we get long titles here. \nBut that is what this is, the National Capital Interstate \nTransportation Authority.\n  The ownership of this bridge is transferred to the authority. The \nauthority has the ability to use various financing provisions, \nincluding tolls, to replace the bridge. The bill provides $97 million \nof Federal funds for completion of the environmental impact statement, \nfor interim repairs to the bridge, and for the preliminary design and \nengineering of a replacement bridge.\n  There is one action the committee took which is a great \ndisappointment to me personally; and, that is, there is a change made \nin the speed limits. I believe the Federal speed limit maximum of 65 \nmiles per hour in rural areas on the interstate has been remarkably \nsuccessful in reducing fatalities. It has resulted in major savings to \nthe taxpayers of our country. The health care costs of speed-related \ncrashes is currently estimated to be $2 billion a year; the health-\nrelated costs of the carnage that comes from excess speeding is \ncurrently estimated to be $2 billion a year. The total economic cost to \nsociety--not just the health care costs but the property damage, lost \nwork--is estimated to be $24 billion a year.\n  According to the Department of Transportation, the decision that this \nCongress made several years ago to allow a maximum of 65 miles an hour \njust on rural interstates, increased from 55--which was the limit \nbefore--jumping from 55 to 65, and has estimated to have cost this \ncountry 500 additional deaths.\n  In my view, it is inevitable that, if the Federal speed limit is \nrepealed, which this bill does--not with my vote, but, nonetheless, the \ncommittee chose to do so--States will raise the speed limit, and the \ncost to everyone, including the Federal Government, would go up \ndramatically. In other words, what we have said is there are not going \nto be any Federal limits, no Federal speed limits on these highways. \nLet the States put on what they want. I suppose the States will say 65 \nis not enough. Let us try 70. And the competitor will say, ``Well, why \nhave any speed limit?'' And I think that is unfortunate.\n  I am aware that there are likely to be amendments which will be \noffered to repeal or weaken other safety laws, particularly the safety \nbelt and motorcycle helmet law requirement. What are those? When we did \nthe ISTEA legislation in 1991, we provided that a State would have a \ncertain amount of time to enact a mandatory seat belt bill and a \nmandatory motorcycle helmet bill. If the States failed to do that, then \na certain amount of that State's highway money would have to go into \nsafety features, including safety education. As a result of that, some \n26 States have passed mandatory motorcycle helmet legislation, and the \nstrong seat belt legislation. What has been the result? California \npassed it. The Governor signed it. And as a result, the number of \nmotorcycle deaths on the California highways has been reduced by 35 \npercent. Maryland did likewise. As a result of the passage of the \nmotorcycle law, with the mandatory helmet, the number of motorcycle \ndeaths in Maryland decreased by 25 percent.\n  You might say, ``Well, this is a State problem. What is the Federal \nGovernment doing in mandating motorcycles helmets?'' The answer is the \nfollowing: The Federal Government is in it because we pay the health \nbills. The Federal Government has to pay the Medicaid costs of those \nwho are in comas in hospitals because they had no helmet and got into a \nvery serious motorcycle accident. I have seen that myself in my own \nState. We have one individual regrettably in our State hospital who has \nbeen there in a coma for 20 years severely injured by a head injury on \na motorcycle without a helmet. The helmet would have prevented such an \ninjury. That individual's medical costs have cost the State of Rhode \nIsland and the Federal Government through Medicaid to date $3 million.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that this Senate would resist any efforts \nto reduce the mandatory motorcycle helmet and seat belt laws.\n  Mr. President, I finally want to commend the chairman of the \nTransportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. This bill came from a subcommittee, and that \nsubcommittee was chaired by Senator Warner. He has done a splendid job \non this legislation. When it came up to the full committee, there were \nno changes, and it passed out of the full committee by a vote of 15 to \n1, with Democrats and Republicans voting for this legislation.\n  So I have had the privilege of working with Senator Warner on this, \nand with the ranking member of the full committee, Senator Baucus, and \nwith all members of this committee in this legislation. So I am very \npleased that the Senator from Virginia has agreed to manage this bill \nbefore this full Senate.\n  I mention Senator Baucus being the ranking member of the full \ncommittee. But Senator Baucus is also the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee likewise. I greatly appreciate the cooperation and \nassistance that he has given us in this legislation.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope we can get to this bill. It is important. I \nknow the business about Davis-Bacon is contentious. I would like to see \nus have a vote on it, and see what happens. But most of all, I would \nhope at least we could move to the consideration of the legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to just take a moment of the \nSenate's time to perhaps bring it up to speed in terms of where we are \non the overall issue of consideration of the Davis-Bacon Act because it \nis not unrelated to the concerns a number of us are expressing this \nevening and tomorrow and the early part of next week in terms of \nproceeding to the highway bill. And that is on March 29 of this year, \nthe Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, chaired by Senator \nKassebaum, after having hearings and after having committee discussion, \nmade a judgment about the Davis-Bacon proposal, which I did not \nsupport, but nonetheless reported that measure out, and it is now on \nthe calendar. So that would be legislation that would be applicable to \nall Federal jurisdiction. And we would have an opportunity when that \nwould be called off the calendar by the majority leader, which is his \nright and his privilege at any particular time, to get into a debate \nand discussion on that particular [[Page S8484]] measure. I think it is \nimportant that we do get into a discussion on that particular measure, \nand I will elaborate on the reasons for that because there has been a \ngreat deal that has happened in terms of various recommendations, \nadjustments, changes, amendments, which would I think be constructive \nand positive and which I think the Members would welcome and which I \nthink would improve the legislation.\n  However, we are not afforded that opportunity. We are faced now with \na repeal effectively on the highway legislation, and there can be those \nwho suggest, well, this really is not repealing it. The fact of the \nmatter is that up to 40 percent of all Davis-Bacon construction is \nrelated to this piece of legislation. So in effect although it is not a \nrepeal of Davis-Bacon, it is its death knell. And those of us who are \nwilling and obviously want to debate the whole issue of Davis-Bacon and \nits implications thought that the most appropriate way of doing it is \nthe way the Senate generally considers measures, and that is to deal \nwith them on the basis of the legislation itself which would have \ngeneral application rather than dealing with it piece by piece, on one \npiece of legislation after another.\n  This measure, in terms of the Highway Act, is commendable, and I \nintend to support the underlying legislation. I see no reason why that \nlegislation could not have been completed, even with discussions, \ntonight or tomorrow. There may be other Members of this body who wanted \nto address particular provisions in that legislation, but it is the \ndecision and judgment of the committee to insert the provisions \nrepealing the Davis-Bacon Act in here, which should be addressed as we \nnormally address these measures on the piece of legislation which has \nbeen reported out of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, and which \nis on the calendar, and I would have welcomed the opportunity to debate \nit this evening, tomorrow, or any other time.\n  But, no, it is said, well, we are going to circumvent the procedures \nand the process of the Senate, and we are going to repeal it; we are \nnot going to wait for the Senate to debate that measure independently \nbut we are going to tag that on to the highway legislation, and so we \nare forced into this circumstance. We are not the ones who are delaying \nthe consideration of the highway legislation. It is those who want to \ncircumvent the Senate procedures who are forcing this kind of delay. \nAnd so we are quite prepared to make some of our case this evening and \ntomorrow and the days ahead and welcome that opportunity to do so and \nto correct some of the comments that have even been made earlier this \nevening.\n  I think that is the best way to address the legislation reported out \nof that committee. And I would say that as recently as today there have \nbeen coalitions that have been working on a series of recommendations \nand changes that are being considered by a number of our colleagues in \nthe Senate on both sides of the aisle. I have not had the chance to \nreview those. It is coincidental that those measures are being \ncirculated today because those that are most involved in those \nnegotiations, to my knowledge, had no awareness that this measure was \ngoing to be considered tonight. I think most of us in the Senate \nunderstood that we would be debating probably welfare legislation. And \nas I understood, at least from our side of the aisle, they thought that \nthat would take us through this weekend and perhaps the regulatory \nreform would take up the early part of next week. And then in the past \nhours, as is the right of the majority leader, it was decided to move \nto this legislation.\n  And so that is why we are in this situation. Those of us who want to \nspeak on Davis-Bacon would urge the Senate to move toward the highway \nlegislation. If this measure were not part of it, we would say all \nright, we are prepared to see a full debate and a timely debate on this \nissue and a resolution of the Davis-Bacon issue in a timely way on the \nmeasure that was reported out of our committee. That would let the \nSenate consider a number of the different changes and suggestions and \namendments that might come at that time. But we are not given really \nthat opportunity to do so.\n  So we wanted to address this issue and speak to some of the \nmisunderstandings which have been expressed even earlier this evening \non this issue.\n  I believe the vote on the bill and the provision to waive the \napplication of Davis-Bacon to Federal highway construction is a \ncritical test of whether the Senate will abandon its historic \nprotection of local labor standards. In March, the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources voted along party lines to repeal Davis-Bacon \naltogether. I opposed that legislation. I know other Members of the \nSenate opposed it, too.\n  Repealing the Davis-Bacon protections would take this country back to \nthe days when cutthroat competition on wages drove down living \nstandards for construction workers and reduced their families to \npoverty. I cannot believe that a majority of the Senate wants to return \nto the harsh employment practices of a half a century ago. The \nRepublican argument for repealing Davis-Bacon is that the Government \nwill save money by paying construction workers less than it does today. \nThe problem is that the argument is not true.\n  Now, listen to this, Mr. President. In fact, the Government will not \nsave anything by driving down the wages of construction workers on \nhighway projects. According to a recent study, the 13 States with the \nhighest construction wages build their highways at lower cost than the \n13 States with the lowest wages.\n  Let me just repeat that. And we will get back into the studies. We \nwill have time. But I want to make an opening comment about the issues \nbefore us. The 13 States with the highest construction wages build \ntheir highways at lower cost than the 13 States with the lowest wages.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Will the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts be good \nenough to tell me, one, whose study is that?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will speak just briefly.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The Senator can speak all he wants; he will have plenty \nof time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I intend to put those in the Record. I intend to outline \nthis, Mr. President, and then I will spend some time going through the \nvarious studies with the Senator.\n  The average construction wage on a federally assisted highway project \nin Wisconsin was $15.55 an hour, more than twice the rate on projects \nin Mississippi, where the workers average $6.69 an hour.\n  The cost per mile of construction was much lower in Wisconsin, \n$78,083 versus $95,329 in Mississippi. Cutting wages does not mean \ncutting costs.\n  That is taking into consideration the variants in terrain and other \nkinds of construction. That is using a singular standard, and we will \ncome back to review those studies in detail later this evening if that \nis the desire.\n  Even if it were true that we could save money by driving down the \nwages of construction workers, it would be wrong to do it. This mean-\nspirited attack on construction workers and their families is \nunwarranted and unfair.\n  Mr. President, I have here a chart of what the workers are receiving. \nFor example, this is in heavy construction, for iron workers. It shows \nthe hourly wage and what their annual wage is on heavy construction.\n  Let us talk about what the income of these workers is in America. The \naverage income is $26,000 a year. That is a lot of money perhaps for a \nlot of people--and it certainly is--but it is $26,000 a year. We are \nhaving, effectively, an assault on these workers that are averaging \n$26,000. With all the problems that we have in this country, we want to \nundermine the ability of the average construction worker to make \n$26,000 a year.\n  We just passed, less than an hour ago, legislation that is going to \nmean hundreds of billions of dollars to various financial interest \ngroups in this country, and I supported it. But make no mistake about \nit, that is going to put hundreds of millions and billions of dollars \nin the pockets of Americans. Here we are talking about what goes into \nthe pockets and pocketbooks of construction workers.\n  The average is $26,000 a year. If you are an iron worker in \nNashville, TN, you make an $8.41 hourly wage, $12,000 a year under \nDavis-Bacon--$12,000 a year.\n  If you are up in Burlington, VT, it is $9.70 an hour, $14,000 a year. \nIf you come up to our part of the country in [[Page S8485]] Providence, \nRI, it is $20 an hour, $31,000 a year. Up in Massachusetts, it reaches \nas high as $33,000 a year.\n  This is for every construction worker under the Davis-Bacon Act, and \nI am going to come back as to how you reach Davis-Bacon figures.\n  The same is true on residential construction; wages are not high. In \nfact, in residential construction wages are generally much less. For \ncarpenters in Nashville, TN, $6 an hour, $9,000 a year. This is \nextraordinary. It is a real ripoff of the taxpayer to be paying someone \nwho is going to make $9,000 on Federal construction.\n  I find it troublesome that there is so much excitement about trying \nto alter or change Davis-Bacon, to somehow suggest that these men and \nwomen are making too much with these annual earnings of $9,000 in \nresidential construction for carpenters in Nashville, or $11,000 in \nOhio, or $15,000 in Connecticut, or even $21,000 in Michigan, or \n$28,000 for carpenters in Illinois, that this is somehow an injustice, \nthat somehow these men and women are ripping off the system because \nthey are making that.\n  It just does not hold water, Mr. President. These are hard-working \nmen and women. Their annual hours are only 1,500 hours. Some work a \nlittle bit more, 1,700 hours, depending on the weather and the economy, \nbut it has been difficult in the construction industry over the period \nof recent years.\n  Apparently some Republican Senators believe those construction \nworkers are so overpaid that their wages should be cut. In fact, \nconstruction workers are not overpaid. Despite their considerable \nskills, the danger and physical hardship of their work, and the years \nof apprenticeship many have served to attain journeyman, their average \nannual income is about $28,000 a year.\n  The second most dangerous industry is construction. The second most \ndangerous industry--construction. We are saying, ``Oh, no, they are \ndoing too well in America,'' in spite of all the studies that show that \nthe working families of this country over the period of the last 12 \nyears have fallen further and further behind in terms of the economy. \nThey are working longer and making less in real income. That has been \nhappening for 15 years, and if you go ahead with the repeal of Davis-\nBacon, you are going to accelerate that.\n  It seems to me that we ought to be speaking for working families. We \nare not asking for them to get some special boondoggle when they are \nmaking $15,000, $16,000, $20,000, or $25,000 a year. That does not seem \nto me like some boondoggle. There are a lot of boondoggles around here, \nbut this is not one of them.\n  Republicans like to accuse the Democrats of class warfare when we \noppose their tax cuts for the rich, but this is an uglier class warfare \nconducted by Republicans to keep blue-collar workers down, to keep them \nout of the middle class. This bill and the repeal of the Davis-Bacon \nAct for highway construction are part of a larger assault Republicans \nare mounting on all fronts against America's working families.\n  What is happening to these families? They are having a hard time \nmaking ends meet. They are falling further and further behind in terms \nof real income and working harder.\n  What is happening to their kids? If their kids want to go to college \nand they are eligible for the Stafford loans, under the Republican \nproposal, they are going to pay $3,500 more for those Stafford loans.\n  If the kids need summer jobs, they will be lucky to get one. Mr. \nPresident, 1,400 jobs were cut in my city of Boston because of the \ncutback in the Summer Jobs Program.\n  In terms of support in the school reform programs, even the \nprojection in the Head Start Program, the Republicans are cutting back \non the support for the children of these working families.\n  We are having an assault on the income of working families, and with \nthe Republican program for cuts in the Medicare Program, you are \ncutting back on the parents of the working families. You cannot get \naround that, Mr. President; you cannot get around that.\n  What happens when they get savings under Medicare? They use it for \ntax cuts, $350 billion in tax cuts for the wealthy individuals in this \ncountry, reaffirmed in the last 48 hours over in the House of \nRepresentatives by the Republicans.\n  We should not just treat these one by one, I would not think. \nCertainly the families do not figure it that way. They just do not look \nat it as a problem in one particular bill. They are looking at what the \nimpact is totally on them, and that is what is happening.\n  This goes right to the heart of the dollars and cents that they are \nable to make working in construction.\n  Mr. President, in talking about what is happening and the impact on \nthe working families, we will have in just a few days the regulatory \nreform bill which, effectively, emasculates the OSHA program with a \nsupermandate that provides an entirely different cost-benefit ratio \nthan is used by OSHA at the present time and will put at serious risk \nthe various proposals that have been put out by OSHA to protect the \nAmerican worker, not just in the construction industry, but in all \nindustries. We will have that out here.\n  They repeal the Delaney clause, which is going to mean that no longer \nare you going to be required to keep carcinogens out of the food stream \nin the United States of America. That came out of the Judiciary \nCommittee. We will be debating that over here.\n  For years, we talked about changing the Delaney clause to a more \nresponsible risk-benefit ratio, a particularly sensitive issue for \nchildren who have an entirely different kind of risk-benefit ratio than \nadults. We tried to work that out in our committee. Oh, no, the votes \nwere there to repeal the Delaney clause, and the Republicans have done \nthat as well. So it will have an impact on the food stream in this \ncountry and greater risks will be out there, Mr. President.\n  So, what happens with this Davis-Bacon proposal? The highway bill has \nbecome the latest battleground in that attack. It contains a provision \nto repeal Davis-Bacon. It proposes to take $1.1 billion out of the \npockets of construction workers over the next 5 years. That is how much \nthe committee's Republicans claim they can save by cutting wages on \nFederal construction projects.\n  It is a typical Republican policy: Wage cuts for the workers, tax \ncuts for the rich. In fact, as the Federal highway construction data \nindicate, it is highly unlikely that any of these so-called savings \nwill actually be achieved by the taxpayer. If anything, lower wages \nmean higher construction costs, not lower costs.\n  The notion that reducing the wages of construction workers on Federal \nconstruction projects will result in substantial cost savings for the \nFederal Government has been examined and categorically rejected by the \nleading construction industry economist in the country, Dr. John \nDunlop, a former Secretary of Labor under President Ford and a \nprofessor of economics at Harvard for many years. According to Dr. \nDunlop, who is a Republican,\n\n       There is simply no sound basis for gratuitously assuming \n     that lower wage rates in the construction industry generally \n     mean lower costs to the public.\n       There is simply no sound basis for gratuitously assuming \n     that lower wage rates in the construction industry generally \n     mean lower costs to the public.\n\n  The reason is obvious. You get what you pay for. Lower paid workers \nare likely to be less skilled workers and, therefore, less productive \nworkers. If wages are lower, but it takes the workers longer to \ncomplete the work, there are no cost savings. If their work is inferior \nin quality, it means higher long-term maintenance and repair costs. So \nthere are no cost savings. And that has not been figured into these \ncost savings. There are no provisions for the diminution in terms of \nthe experience of workers on the job or for inferior kinds of work or \nfor longer-term maintenance. That is not figured into these figures \nthat are bantered around so easily on the floor this evening.\n  This kind of attack on construction workers and their families is \nunjustified. There is nothing unfair about paying the prevailing wage \non construction projects. Again and again over the years, we have heard \nthe argument that Davis-Bacon is inflationary and that it mandates \nartificially high union wages. On the committee, Republicans made this \nargument in their report on the bill on page 11. They say, \n[[Page S8486]] ``The existing law protects union laborers at the \nexpense of unskilled workers.'' That simply is not true.\n  Only 29 percent of the prevailing wage schedules issued by the Labor \nDepartment in 1994 reflected union wage rates. Forty-eight percent of \nthe wage schedules reflected nonunion rates, and the rest were mixed. \nListen to this. Only 29 percent of the prevailing wage schedules issued \nby the Labor Department in 1994 reflected union wage rates. Forty-eight \npercent of the wage schedules reflected nonunion rates. And the rest \nwere mixed.\n  The Davis-Bacon law does not require contractors to pay union wage \nrates. The Washington Post recently got this wrong and had to print a \ncorrection. So let there be no mistake. The Davis-Bacon Act does not \nrequire the payment of union wages or the employment of union workers--\ntwo misconceptions that are bantered around here on the floor and were \nin our committee. It requires the payment of prevailing wages, the \ngoing rate in the community. You are basically saying that in any of \nthese communities, if they are paying $6 an hour, they get $6 an hour \nif they are going to build a Federal project. If you are going to build \nthe highways or build residential construction, or if you are going to \nbuild heavy construction, it is a higher rate--whatever is the \nprevailing wage in the local community. Whether it be union or \nnonunion, that is the wage rate. So that the Federal Government will \nnot be driving the wages down or artificially inflating them. That is \nbasically the reason for the law.\n  The goal of the act is not to artificially inflate wages. The goal is \nto keep Federal projects from being used to drive down local wages and \nlocal labor standards. That goal is as valid today as it was in 1931, \n64 years ago, when the law was first enacted.\n  The construction labor market is not a national labor market. There \nare thousands of local markets, and the wage rate for laborers, for \nexample, varies from one part of the country to another, from the \nminimum of $4.25 an hour to more than $20 an hour. Carpenter wages vary \nfrom less than $6 an hour to more than $25 an hour. The Davis-Bacon Act \nrespects these differences. Those who want to repeal the act ignore \nthose differences. They would let Federal contractors drive wages down \nas low as they can. Repealing Davis-Bacon or its application to highway \nconstruction is an invitation to exploitation, and it ought to be \nrejected.\n  Mr. President, the evidence of the harmful effects of a repeal on \nminorities, as well, is clear. This would have an adverse impact in \nterms of the employment opportunities for women, as well as minorities. \nThere is a very important study--but I see others who want to speak, so \nI will get into that later this evening or tomorrow.\n  A Davis-Bacon repeal is wrong. The legitimate concerns about the \nact's threshold and unnecessary paperwork can be taken care of through \na sensible reform amendment, like the one Senator Simon offered in our \nLabor and Human Resources Committee when we considered the issue. The \nDavis-Bacon Act does need to be updated, but the core principle of the \nlaw is as valid today as when it was signed 64 years ago. The Federal \nGovernment should not try to save money by cutting the wages of its \ncitizens. The Davis-Bacon Act has not been substantially revised in 64 \nyears, since it was enacted. Reforms are needed. The threshold for \ncoverage needs to be adjusted to reflect inflation. The paperwork \nrequirements for contractors are overly burdensome and need to be cut \nback.\n  Clear and more sensible lines should be drawn on what work is \ncovered. Workers who are not receiving the wages they deserve need to \nhave a more effective way to resolve complaints. That is why I am for \nreform of the Davis-Bacon Act. I have been on record in favor of reform \nfor many years.\n  But there is a world of difference between reform and repeal. A \ncoalition of nearly 20,000 contractors, all opposed to an outright \nrepeal, are lobbying for reform, not repeal. We stand ready to work \nwith colleagues on both sides of the aisle on any reasonable proposal \nfor reform. We are strongly opposed to the anti-worker scheme that \nwould dismantle basic construction workers' protections in all parts of \nthe Nation. Repeal of Davis-Bacon is an anti-work ideology run amok and \nshould be rejected out of hand by the Senate.\n  I would be glad to either yield to the Senator from Rhode Island \nabout those reports or to make some general concluding remarks.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I think what we are going to do this \nevening is this. The Senator from Illinois has something he wants to \ndiscuss as in morning business, which will take about 15 minutes. And \nthen it would be my intention--and the leader said we can--to adjourn \nfor the evening. Then we would be here tomorrow morning at whatever \ntime we come in. Then there will be a chance for everybody to discuss \nthis further. I have some questions I would like to ask the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, but obviously he will be here tomorrow. This is \nwhat we call a filibuster on the motion to proceed. Rather than wearing \neverybody out, it would be my suggestion that we adjourn following the \ncomments by the Senator from Illinois, as in morning business.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, Mr. President, I see my friend from Illinois \nwanting to talk. I will welcome the opportunity to continue this dialog \ntomorrow. I will make a final comment on this.\n  I do want to just underline a point, because I think it is a point \nworth reiterating--that is, that there is a proposal on the Senate \ncalendar that deals with this generically. Those of us who are speaking \nabout this measure wanted the opportunity to at least debate that \nmeasure independently and have a chance to amend it and have the focus \nand attention of the Senate on it. It has been the desire of the \nRepublicans in the committee to put this measure on a matter that is \nout of your jurisdiction, quite frankly. Your committee does not have \njurisdiction on the Davis-Bacon Act,\n nonetheless, the Senator made the judgment decision to take that step.\n\n  Now, that is something that can be done, but it is not in the \njurisdiction of your committee. It is in the jurisdiction of Senator \nKassebaum's committee. They have taken action, but the Senator has \ncircumvented the procedure and we are faced with this particular issue. \nWe intend to speak to that.\n  I do think that the point needs to be reiterated, that there is a \ntotal array of different Republican activities that are symbolized by \nthis assault on working families that are making $27,000 a year.\n  It is an assault on Davis-Bacon today. We had that assault on \neducation just 3 weeks ago. We had that assault on Medicare. We still \nhave not had the closing of the billionaires' loophole. It is \ninteresting. We are all debating this issue out here and we still have \nnot found time to debate and close the billionaires' loophole. I do \nthink it is important for the American people to have some \nunderstanding of how we are spending our time and how we are spending \nour energy and what we are doing as a matter of priorities.\n  We will have a full day, and I always welcome the chance to have this \ndiscussion with my friend and colleague. I see the Senator from \nIllinois here.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I wonder if the Senator from Massachusetts mentioned \nreforms, and I am curious as to what the suggested reforms are.\n  To suggest we have come out of the blue without any consideration in \nthe respective committee that deals with Davis-Bacon, in our committee, \nwe have trespassed into areas we do not belong in. Davis-Bacon we have \nhad out here on the floor as the Senator from Massachusetts knows, \nmany, many times. And this provision that came from our committee \nsolely applies for the areas that we deal with. I am not willing to \nconcede that it is not within our jurisdiction.\n  However, I am curious as to what the suggestions are, and I do not \nneed them in great detail, but roughly, what is the Senator talking \nabout? The Davis-Bacon now applies to any contract over $2,000. In \nother words, it applies to everything.\n  What is the general trend, if I might ask the Senator from \nMassachusetts, of these reforms?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see my colleague who offered the reform proposal which \nI supported in the committee. I wonder if the Senator from Illinois \nwould like to take a few moments and go through the different \nprovisions with regard to [[Page S8487]] raising the thresholds and \nwith regard to other features such as the paperwork provisions--the \nrange of different areas which have been raised as matters of concern.\n  The Senator from Illinois has a very comprehensive program. I see the \nSenator on the floor now. I will let him comment on that. I look \nforward to adding to it tomorrow.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I would like to deal with this tomorrow. I \nwould say to the Senator from Rhode Island that what we do is raise the \nceiling. We also deal with the problems that contractors say they have \nwith Davis-Bacon. I think it is a practical bill that answers the \nfundamental problems.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. What does the ceiling go to?\n  Mr. SIMON. The ceiling would go, as I recall, to $100,000. I will \nhave the full information on this tomorrow.\n  We offered this in committee. We checked this out with a number of \ncontractors. We think the proposal that we have makes a great deal of \nsense. I will have a chance to discuss that tomorrow.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I say to the Senator it is $100,000 for new \nconstruction; $25,000 for alteration, repair, renovation, \nrehabilitation.\n  The second part deals with contract splitting. There is a whole \nprovision in here affecting the reporting requirements, to allow \ninspection of payrolls by interested parties.\n  This was an important issue to determine which workers are actually \nbeing covered.\n  We will have an opportunity to discuss the compliance provision, the \ndefinition of various employees.\n  Mr. SIMON. If my colleague will yield, we also reduced the reporting \nby contractors very significantly. I think that the average contractor \nwould be pleased.\n  Now, a contractor wants to depress wages, they probably will not be \npleased.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I am not prepared to concede that every contractor that \ndoes not like Davis-Bacon is out to depress wages. We will have time to \ndiscuss that further.\n  I am not sure what has been done. It has been raised to $100,000. If \nthe Senator will show me the building or any job that is less than \n$100,000 that the Federal Government goes out and contracts for, I will \nbe surprised.\n  Never mind. We will have all day tomorrow to discuss that. I would \nsay that one of the things I would appreciate the Senator addressing, \nin my experience, in my State, I have discovered that Davis-Bacon is an \nanti-small business law.\n  In other words, the small businessman cannot qualify to do Davis-\nBacon jobs. They do not have the record built up, or the recordkeeping \nmachinery, the capabilities. It is a bad move for small businesses.\n  Mr. SIMON. If the Senator will support the Simon-Kennedy amendment, \nthe Senator will find that it helps small business people.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would be happy if that were so.\n  Why do we not proceed as in morning business?\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed \nas in morning business for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, it would then be my thought that we would \nwind up here and adjourn for the evening.\n   Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Simon pertaining to the introduction of S. 933 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/15/senate-section/article/S8480-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Res. 135) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n                              S. Res. 135\n\n       Whereas, the plaintiffs in Schneider v. Schaaf, Civ. No. \n     95-C-1056 and Schneider v. Messer, Civ. No. 93-C-124, civil \n     actions pending in state court in North Dakota have sought \n     the deposition testimony of Ross Keys, a former Senate \n     employee who worked for Senator Kent Conrad and documents \n     from Senator Conrad's office;\n       Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United \n     States and Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no \n     evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate \n     can, by administrative or judicial process, be taken from \n     such control or possession but by permission of the Senate;\n       Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or \n     in the possession of the Senate is needed for the promotion \n     of justice, the Senate will take such action as will promote \n     the ends of justice consistent with the privileges of the \n     Senate;\n       Whereas, pursuant to section 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the \n     Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288B(A) \n     and 288C(A)(2), the Senate may direct its counsel to \n     represent employees of the Senate with respect to requests \n     for testimony made to them in their official capacities: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That Ross Keys is authorized to produce records \n     and provide testimony in the cases of Schneider v. Schaaf and \n     Schneider v. Messer, except concerning matters for which a \n     privilege should be asserted.\n       Sec. 2.

THE VOTERS HAVE SAID YES\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on that memorable evening in 1972 when I \nlearned that I had been elected to the Senate in 1972, one of the \ncommitments I made to myself was that I would never fail to see a young \nperson, or a group of young people, who wanted to see me.\n  It certainly proved beneficial to me because I've been inspired by \nthe estimated 60,000 young people with whom I've visited during the \nnearly 23 years I've been in the Senate.\n  Most of them have been concerned about the magnitude of the Federal \ndebt that Congress has run up for the coming generations to pay. The \nyoung people and I always discuss the fact that under the U.S. \nConstitution, no President can spend a dime of Federal money that has \nnot first been authorized and appropriated by both the House and Senate \nof the United States.\n  That's why I began making these daily reports to the Senate on \nFebruary 22, 1992. I wanted to make it a matter of daily record \nprecisely the size of the Federal debt which as of yesterday, \nWednesday, June 14, stood at $4,905,557,258,890.90 (or $18,621.58 for \nevery man, woman, and child in America).\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/15/senate-section/article/S8488-4", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8488-S8492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      ``TAKE THE MONEY AND TALK''\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, without a doubt, the relationship between \nthe media and politicians is a unique and interesting one. All would \nagree that press attention on politicians is a natural function of \njournalistic coverage of the legislative process. It is a necessary and \nuseful role for the members of the press.\n  Over the years, there has been a lot of media coverage focused on the \neffects of special interests on the legislative process. Reams have \nbeen written on how the wishes of the American people are compromised \nby the practice of legislators accepting gratuities from the pockets of \nhighly paid lobbyists. Miles of video tape have been aired on programs \ncritical of Members of Congress who cavort with special interest groups \nwhich have influence over matters under consideration by Congress. \nOften, by focusing their investigative light on elected officials, the \nmedia have brought instances of unethical behavior to the public's \nattention.\n  Partly as a result of this attention, Members of Congress got the \nmessage. In an effort, which I led here some years ago, to eliminate \npossible conflicts of interest and perceptions of such conflicts, \nMembers chose to prohibit the acceptance of honoraria and to require \npublic disclosure of gifts from outside groups. Now, because of \nreporting requirements, the American people are able to judge the \neffects that any undue influence lobbyists may have on their elected \nrepresentatives.\n  What is distressing to me is the lack of parity that exists in this \narea as far as the media are concerned. In the June 1995 edition of the \nAmerican Journalism Review, Alicia C. Shepard, in an article entitled, \n``Take the Money and Talk,'' makes a compelling argument for members of \nthe press to turn the light of honoraria disclosure on themselves. As \nthe article points out, journalists who receive honoraria from the very \ngroups they cover have become a matter of considerable concern. It \nseems that even many reporters feel uncomfortable with the large sums \nthat their peers receive from speaking engagements.\n  In this age of instant communication, no one can doubt the tremendous \nimpact of the media. Their stories--either in print, through newspapers \nand magazines, or on the air waves, through network news and talk \nradio--control the very way the public receives the news each day and \nperceives the issues and the players in the coverage. Reporters have \nthe ability to [[Page S8489]] frame a story through virtually any \nfilter they choose. Theirs is a powerful tool that cannot be taken \nlightly.\n  At a time when public cynicism with both politicians and the media \nseems to have reached new proportions, the journalism profession ought \nto put the brakes on and reflect on how it is tainted by the policy of \naccepting speaking fees. How is one to know if a given journalist has a \nprivate agenda or an ax to grind? Right now, the public is not assured \nof balanced reporting and can only hope that members of the press are \nabove ethical compromise. Although some media outlets are beginning to \nput restrictions into place, no rules of disclosure with respect to \noutside income are required by the journalism profession. There is no \nplace to go to find out if a reporter has been compromised.\n  Somewhat arrogantly or perhaps naively, many reporters have adopted \nthe ``trust me'' theory of reporting, insisting that their ethical \nstandards are not to be questioned. For some unclear reason, they \nassume that they are different from the individuals about whom they \nwrite. Simply by virtue of their name and employer, we are to believe \nthat they are above reproach.\n  The hypocrisy of this line of thinking is not only absurd, but it is \nalso truly disturbing. To have a virtual field day in castigating \npoliticians for allowing special interest groups access and influence, \nand then to turn around and ignore the same criticism in regard to \nthemselves, in my mind, portrays a press corps that is unaccountable \nand, as a result, compromised or at least highly suspect. In an age of \ninstant communications, the media hold an unequaled sway over the \ndistribution of information to the public. Their access to, and \ninfluence on, the American people are unparalleled. The communications \nindustry thus has an important obligation to guarantee the highest \nethical standards among its members. As the press are fond of pointing \nout, in the public arena there are no free rides. It is past time for \njournalists to accept the same responsibility in this regard and \nacknowledge the dangers, within their own ranks, of receiving money \nfrom special interest groups.\n  One of the liberties our Constitution speaks of is freedom of the \npress. Certainly, no one wants to see controls put on the media that \nwould jeopardize the ability to report objectively. But, we are all \nbetter served when possible perceptions of misconduct are removed. \nUnfortunately, by refusing to address what is perceived at the very \nleast as a double standard, the journalism profession runs the risk of \nlosing further credibility with its audience. It is time for all \nthinking members of the media to face up to the same standards they so \nstridently require of others, and let the light of day reflect the \nobjectivity of their work.\n  Mr. President, in this regard, I ask unanimous consent that the \narticle to which I have referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the American Journalism Review, June 1995]\n\n                        Take the Money and Talk\n\n                         (By Alicia C. Shepard)\n\n       It's speech time at the Broward County Convention Center in \n     Fort Lauderdale.\n       ABC News correspondent and NPR commentator Cokie Roberts \n     takes her brown handbag and notebook off of the ``reserved'' \n     table where she has been sitting, waiting to speak. She steps \n     up to the podium where she is gushingly introduced and \n     greeted with resounding applause.\n       Framed by palm fronds, Roberts begins her speech to 1,600 \n     South Florida businesswomen attending a Junior League-\n     sponsored seminar. Having just flown in from Washington, \n     D.C., Roberts breaks the news of the hours-old arrest of a \n     suspect in the Oklahoma City bombing. She talks of \n     suffragette Susan B. Anthony, of how she misses the late \n     House Speaker Tip O'Neill, of the Republican takeover on \n     Capitol Hill. Then she gives her listeners the inside scoop \n     on the new members of Congress.\n       ``They are very young,'' says Roberts, 52, ``I'm constantly \n     getting it wrong, assuming they are pages. They're darling. \n     They're wildly adept with a blow dryer and I resent them \n     because they call me ma'am.'' The audience laughs.\n       After talking for an hour on ``Women and Politics,'' \n     Roberts answers questions for 20 minutes. One woman asks the \n     veteran correspondent, who has covered Washington since 1978, \n     when there will be a female president.\n       ``I think we'll have a woman president when a woman is \n     elected vice president and we do in the guy,'' Roberts quips.\n       This crowd loves her. When Roberts finishes, they stand \n     clapping for several minutes. Roberts poses for a few \n     pictures and is whisked out and driven to the Miami airport \n     for her first-class flight back to Washington.\n       For her trouble and her time, the Junior League of Greater \n     Fort Lauderdale gave Roberts a check for $35,000. ``She's \n     high, very high,'' says the League's Linda Carter, who lined \n     up the keynote speakers. The two other keynote speakers \n     received around $10,000 each.\n       The organization sponsored the seminar to raise money for \n     its community projects, using Roberts as a draw. But shelling \n     out $35,000 wouldn't have left much money for, say, the \n     League's foster care or women's substance abuse programs or \n     its efforts to increase organ donors for transplants.\n       Instead, Robert's tab was covered by a corporate sponsor, \n     JM Family Enterprises. The $4.2 billion firm is an umbrella \n     company for the largest independent American distributor of \n     Toyotas. The second-largest privately held company in \n     Florida, it provides Toyotas to 164 dealerships in five \n     southeastern states and runs 20 other auto-related companies.\n       But Roberts doesn't want to talk about the company that \n     paid her fee. She doesn't like to answer the kind of \n     questions she asks politicians. She won't discuss what she's \n     paid, whom she speaks to, why she does it or how it might \n     affect journalism's credibility when she receives more money \n     in an hour-and-a-half from a large corporation than many \n     journalists earn in a year.\n       ``She feels strongly that it's not something that in any \n     way, shape or form should be discussed in public,'' ABC \n     spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said in response to AJR's request \n     for an interview with Roberts.\n       Roberts' ABC colleague Jeff Greenfield, who also speaks for \n     money, doesn't think it's a good idea to duck the issue. ``I \n     think we ought not not talk about it,'' he says. ``I mean \n     that's Cokie's right, obviously,'' he adds, but ``if we want \n     people to answer our questions, then up to a reasonable \n     point, we should answer their questions.''\n       The phenomenon of journalists giving speeches for \n     staggering sums of money continues to dog the profession. \n     Chicago Tribune Washington Bureau Chief James Warren has \n     created a cottage industry criticizing colleagues who speak \n     for fat fees. Washington Post columnist James K. Glassman \n     believes the practice is the ``next great American scandal.'' \n     Iowa Republican Sen. Charles Grassley has denounced it on the \n     Senate floor.\n       A number of news organizations have drafted new policies to \n     regulate the practice since debate over the issue flared a \n     year ago (see ``Talk is Expensive,'' May 1994). Time magazine \n     is one of the latest to do so, issuing a flat-out ban on \n     honoraria in April. The Society for Professional Journalists, \n     in the process of revising its ethics code, is wrestling with \n     the divisive issue.\n       The eye-popping sums star journalists receive for their \n     speeches, and the possibility that they may be influenced by \n     them, have drawn heightened attention to the practice, which \n     is largely the province of a relatively small roster of well-\n     paid members of the media elite. Most work for the television \n     networks or the national news weeklies; newspaper reporters, \n     with less public visibility, aren't asked as often.\n       While the crescendo of criticism has resulted in an \n     official crackdown at several news organizations--as well as \n     talk of new hardline policies at others--it's not clear how \n     effective the new policies are, since no public disclosure \n     system is in place.\n       Some well-known journalists, columnist and ``Crossfire'' \n     host Michael Kinsley and U.S. News & World Report's Steven V. \n     Roberts among them, scoff at the criticism. They assert that \n     it's their right as private citizens to offer their services \n     for whatever the market will bear, that new policies won't \n     improve credibility and that the outcry has been blown out of \n     proportion.\n       But the spectacle of journalists taking big bucks for \n     speeches has emerged as one of the high-profile ethical \n     issues in journalism today.\n       ``Clearly some nerve has been touched,'' Warren says. ``A \n     nerve of pure, utter defensiveness on the part of a \n     journalist trying to rationalize taking [honoraria] for the \n     sake of their bank account because the money is so \n     alluring.''\n       A common route to boarding the lecture gravy train is the \n     political talk show. National television exposure raises a \n     journalist's profile dramatically, enhancing the likelihood \n     of receiving lucrative speaking offers.\n       The problem is that modulated, objective analysis is not \n     likely to make you a favorite on ``The Capital Gang'' or \n     ``The McLaughlin Group.'' Instead, reporters who strive for \n     objectivity in their day jobs are often far more opinionated \n     in the TV slugfests.\n       Time Managing Editor James R. Gaines, who issued his \n     magazine's recent ban on accepting honoraria, sees this as \n     another problem for journalists' credibility, one he plans to \n     address in a future policy shift. ``These journalists say \n     things we wouldn't let them say in the magazine. . .,'' says \n     Gaines, whose columnist Margaret Carlson appears frequently \n     on ``The Capital Gang.'' ``It's great promotion for the \n     magazine and the magazine's journalists. But I wonder about \n     it when the journalists get into that adversarial atmosphere \n     where provocation is the main currency.'' [[Page S8490]] \n       Journalists have been ``buckraking'' for years, speaking to \n     trade associations, corporations, charities, academic \n     institutions and social groups. But what's changed is the \n     amount they're paid. In the mid-1970s, the fees peaked at \n     $10,000 to $15,000, say agents for speakers bureaus. Today, \n     ABC's Sam Donaldson can get $30,000, ABC's David Brinkley \n     pulls in $18,000 and the New York Times' William Safire can \n     command up to $20,000.\n       When a $4.2 billion Toyota distributor pays $35,000 for \n     someone like Cokie Roberts, or a trade association pays a \n     high-profile journalist $10,000 or $20,000 for an hour's \n     work, it inevitably raises questions and forces news \n     executives to re-examine their policies.\n       That's what happened last June at ABC. Richard Wald, senior \n     vice president of news,\n      decided to ban paid speeches to trade associations and for-\n     profit corporationsmuch to the dismay of some of ABC's \n     best-paid correspondents. As at most news organizations, \n     speaking to colleges and nonprofits is allowed.\n       When Wald's policy was circulated to 109 employees at ABC, \n     some correspondents howled (see Free Press, September 1994). \n     Protests last August from Roberts, Donaldson, Brinkley, \n     Greenfield, Brit Hume and others succeeded only in delaying \n     implementation of the new guidelines. Wald agreed to \n     ``grandfather in'' speeches already scheduled through mid-\n     January. After that, if a correspondent speaks to a forbidden \n     group, the money must go to charity.\n       ``Why did we amend it? Fees for speeches are getting to be \n     very large,'' Wald says. ``When we report on matters of \n     national interest, we do not want it to appear that folks who \n     have received a fee are in any way beholden to anybody other \n     than our viewers. Even though I do not believe anybody was \n     ever swayed by a speech fee, I do believe that it gives the \n     wrong impression. We deal in impressions.''\n       The new policy has hurt, says ABC White House correspondent \n     Ann Compton. Almost a year in advance, Compton agreed to \n     speak to the American Cotton Council. But this spring, when \n     she spoke to the trade group, she had to turn an honorarium \n     of ``several thousand dollars'' over to charity. Since the \n     policy went into effect, Compton has turned down six \n     engagements that she previously would have accepted.\n       ``The restrictions now have become so tight, it's closed \n     off some groups and industries that I don't feel I have a \n     conflict with,'' says Compton, who's been covering the White \n     House off and on since 1974. ``It's closed off, frankly, the \n     category of organizations that pay the kind of fees I get.'' \n     She declines to say what those fees are.\n       And it has affected her bank account. ``I've got four kids \n     * * *,'' Compton says. ``It's cut off a significant portion \n     of income for me.''\n       Some speakers bureaus say ABC's new policy and criticism of \n     the practice have had an impact.\n       ``It has affected us, definitely,'' says Lori Fish of \n     Keppler Associates in Arlington, Virginia, which represents \n     about two dozen journalists. ``More journalists are conscious \n     of the fact that they have to be very particular about which \n     groups they accept honoraria from. On our roster there's been \n     a decrease of some journalists accepting engagements of that \n     sort. It's mainly because of media criticism.''\n       Other bureaus, such as the National Speakers Forum and the \n     William Morris Agency, say they haven't noticed a difference. \n     ``I can't say that the criticism has affected us,'' says Lynn \n     Choquette, a partner at the speakers forum.\n       Compton, Donaldson and Greenfield still disagree with \n     Wald's policy but, as they say, he's the boss.\n       ``I believe since all of us signed our contracts with the \n     expectation that the former ABC policy would prevail and took \n     that into account when we agreed to sign our contracts for X \n     amount,'' Donaldson says, ``it was not fair to change the \n     policy midstream.'' Donaldson says he has had to turn down \n     two speech offers.\n       Greenfield believes the restrictions are unnecessary.\n       ``When I go to speak to a group, the idea that it's like \n     renting a politician to get his ear is not correct,'' he \n     says. ``We are being asked to provide a mix of entertainment \n     and information and keep audiences in their seats at whatever \n     convention so they don't go home and say, `Jesus, what a \n     boring two-day whatever that was.'''\n       Most agree it's the size of the honoraria that is fueling \n     debate over the issue. ``If you took a decimal point or two \n     away, nobody would care,'' Greenfield says. ``A lot of us are \n     now offered what seems to many people a lot of money. They \n     are\n      entertainment-size sums rather than journalistic sizes.''\n       And Wald has decided ``entertainment-size sums'' look bad \n     for the network, which has at least a dozen correspondents \n     listed with speakers bureaus. It's not the speeches \n     themselves that trouble Wald. ``You can speak to the American \n     Society of Travel Agents or the Electrical Council,'' he \n     says, ``as long as you don't take money from them.''\n       But are ABC officials enforcing the new policy? ``My \n     suspicion is they're not, that they are chickenshit and Cokie \n     Roberts will do whatever the hell she wants to do and they \n     don't have the balls to do anything,'' says the Chicago \n     Tribune's Warren, whose newspaper allows its staff to make \n     paid speeches only to educational institutions.\n       There's obviously some elasticity in ABC's policy. In \n     April, Greenfield, who covers media and politics, pocketed \n     $12,000 from the National Association and interviewing media \n     giants Rupert Murdoch and Barry Diller for the group. Wald \n     says that was acceptable.\n       He also says it was fine for Roberts to speak to the Junior \n     League-sponsored business conference in Fort Lauderdale, even \n     though the for-profit JM Family Enterprises paid her fee.\n       ``As long as the speech was arranged by a reasonable group \n     and it carried with it no tinct from anybody, it's okay,'' \n     says Wald. ``I don't care where they [the Junior League] get \n     their money.''\n       Even with its loopholes, ABC has the strictest restrictions \n     among the networks. NBC, CBS and CNN allow correspondents to \n     speak for dollars on a case-by-case basis and require them to \n     check with a supervisor first. Last fall, Andrew Lack, \n     president of NBC News, said he planned to come up with a new \n     policy. NBC spokesperson Lynn Gardner says Lack has drafted \n     the guidelines and will issue them this summer. ``The bottom \n     line is that Andrew Lack is generally not in favor of getting \n     high speaking fee,'' she says.\n       New Yorker Executive Editor Hendrik Hertzberg also said \n     last fall that his magazine would review its policy, under \n     which writers are supposed to consult with their editors in \n     ``questionable cases.'' The review is still in progress. \n     Hertzberg says it's likely the magazine will have a new \n     policy by the end of the year.\n       There's something aesthetically offensive to my idea of \n     journalism for American journalists to be paid $5,000, \n     $10,000 or $20,000 for some canned remarks simply because of \n     his or her celebrity value,'' Hertzberg says.\n       Rewriting a policy merely to make public the outside income \n     of media personalities guarantees resistance, if not outright \n     hostility. Just ask John Harwood of the Wall Street Journal's \n     Washington bureau. This year, Harwood was a candidate for a \n     slot on the committee that issues congressional press passes \n     to daily print journalists.\n       His platform included a promise to have daily \n     correspondents list outside sources of income--not amounts--\n     on their applications for press credentials. Harwood's goal \n     was fuller disclosure of outside income, including speaking \n     fees.\n       ``I'm not trying to argue in all cases it's wrong,'' says \n     Harwood. ``But we make a big to-do about campaign money and \n     benefits lawmakers get from special interests and I'm struck \n     by how many people in our profession also get money from \n     players in the political process.''\n       Harwood believes it's hypocritical that journalists used to \n     go after members of Congress for taking speech fees when \n     journalists do the same thing. (Members of Congress are no \n     longer permitted to accept honoraria.)\n       ``By disclosing the people who pay us,'' says Harwood, ``we \n     let other people who may have a beef with us draw their own \n     conclusions. I don't see why reporters should be afraid of \n     that.''\n       But apparently they are. Harwood lost the election.\n       ``I'm quite certain that's why John lost,'' says Alan J. \n     Murray, the Journal's Washington bureau chief, who made many \n     phone calls on his reporter's behalf. ``There's clearly a lot \n     of resistance,'' adds Murray, whose newspaper forbids \n     speaking to for-profit companies, political action committees \n     and anyone who lobbies Congress. ``Everybody likes John. But \n     I couldn't believe how many people said--even people who I \n     suspect have very little if any speaking incomes--that it's \n     just nobody's business. I just don't buy that.''\n       His sentiment is shared in the Periodical Press Gallery on \n     Capitol Hill, where magazine reporters applying for press \n     credentials must list sources of outside income. But in the \n     Radio-Television Correspondents Gallery, where the bigname \n     network reporters go for press credentials, the issue of \n     disclosing outside income has never come up, says Kenan \n     Block, a ``MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour'' producer.\n       ``I've never heard anyone mention it here and I've been \n     here going on 11 years,'' says Block, who is also chairman of \n     the Radio-Television Correspondents Executive Committee. ``I \n     basically feel it's not our place to police the credentialed \n     reporters. If you're speaking on the college circuit or to \n     groups not terribly political in nature, I think, if \n     anything, people are impressed and a bit envious. It's like, \n     `More power to them.'''\n       But the issue of journalists' honoraria has been mentioned \n     at Block's program.\n       Al Vecchione, president of McNeil/Lehrer Productions, says \n     he was ``embarrassed'' by AJR's story last year and \n     immediately wrote a new policy. The story reported that \n     Robert MacNeil accepted honoraria, although he often spoke \n     for free; partner Jim Lehrer said he had taken fees in the \n     past but had stopped after his children got out of college.\n       ``We changed [our policy] because in reading the various \n     stories and examining our navel, we decided it was not \n     proper,'' Vecchione says. ``While others may do it, we don't \n     think it's proper. Whether in reality it's a violation or \n     not, the perception is there and the perception of it is bad \n     enough.''\n       MacNeil/Lehrer's new policy is not as restrictive as ABC's, \n     however. It says correspondents ``should avoid accepting \n     money from individuals, companies, trade associations or \n     organizations that lobby the government or otherwise try to \n     influence issues the NewsHour or other special * * * programs \n     may cover.''\n       As is the case with many of the new, stricter policies, \n     each request to speak is reviewed [[Page S8491]] on a case-\n     by-case basis. That's the policy at many newspapers and at \n     U.S. News.\n       Newsweek tightened its policy last June. Instead of simply \n     checking with an editor, staffers now have to fill out a form \n     if they want to speak or write freelance articles and submit \n     it to Ann McDaniel, the magazine's chief of correspondents.\n       ``The only reason we formalized the process is because we \n     thought this was becoming more popular than it was 10 years \n     ago,'' McDaniel says. ``We want to make sure [our staff \n     members] are not involved in accepting compensation from \n     people they are very close to. Not because we suspect they \n     can be bought or that there will be an improper behavior but \n     because we want to protect our credibility.''\n       Time, on the other hand, looked at all the media criticism \n     and decided to simply end the practice. In an April 14 memo, \n     Managing Editor Gaines told his staff, ``The policy is that \n     you may not do it.''\n       Gaines says the new policy was prompted by ``a bunch of \n     things that happened all at once.'' He adds that ``a lot of \n     people were doing cruise ships and appearances and have some \n     portion of their income from that, so their ox is gored.''\n       The ban is not overwhelmingly popular with Time staffers. \n     Several, speaking on a not-for-attribution basis, argue that \n     it's too tough and say they hope to change Gaines' mind. He \n     says that won't happen, although he will amend the policy to \n     allow paid speeches before civic groups, universities and \n     groups that are ``clearly not commercial.''\n       ``Academic seminars are fine,'' he says. ``If some college \n     wants to pay expenses and a $150 honorarium, I really don't \n     have a problem with that.''\n       Steve Roberts, a senior writer with U.S. News & World \n     Report and Cokie Roberts' husband, is annoyed that some media \n     organizations are being swayed by negative publicity. He says \n     there's been far too much criticism of what he believes is \n     basically an innocuous practice. Roberts says journalists \n     have a right to earn as much as they can by speaking, as long \n     as they are careful about appearances and live by high \n     ethical standards.\n       ``This whole issue has been terribly over-blown by a few \n     cranks,'' Roberts says. ``As long as journalists behave \n     honorably and use good sense and don't take money from people \n     they cover, I think it's totally legitimate. In fact, my own \n     news organization encourages it.''\n       U.S. News not only encourages it, but its public relations \n     staff helps its writers get speaking engagements.\n       Roberts says U.S. News has not been intimidated by the \n     ``cranks,'' who he believes are in part motivated by \n     jealousy. ``I think a few people have appointed themselves \n     the critics and watchdogs of our profession. I, for one, \n     resent it.''\n       His chief nemesis is Jim Warren, who came to Washington a \n     year-and-a-half ago to take charge of the Chicago Tribune's \n     bureau. Warren, once the Tribune's media writer, writes a \n     Sunday column that's often peppered with news flashes about \n     which journalist is speaking where and for how much. The \n     column includes a ``Cokie Watch,'' named for Steve Roberts' \n     wife of 28 years, a women Warren has written reams about but \n     has never met.\n       ``Jim Warren is a reprehensible individual who has attacked \n     me and my wife and other people to advance his own visibility \n     and his own reputation,'' Roberts asserts. ``He's on a \n     crusade to make his own reputation by tearing down others.''\n       While Warren may work hard to boost his bureau's reputation \n     for Washington coverage, he is best known for his outspoken \n     criticism of fellow journalists. Some reporters cheer him on \n     and fax him tips for ``Cokie Watch.'' Others are highly \n     critical and ask who crowned Warren chief of the Washington \n     ethics police.\n       Even Warren admits his relentless assault has turned him \n     into a caricature.\n       ``I'm now in the Rolodex as iconoclast, badass Tribune \n     bureau chief who writes about Cokie Roberts all the time,'' \n     says Warren, who in fact doesn't. ``But I do get lots of \n     feedback from rank-and-file journalists saying. `Way to go. \n     You're dead right,' It obviously touches a nerve among \n     readers.''\n       So Warren writes about Cokie and Steve Roberts getting \n     $45,000 from a Chicago bank for a speech and the traveling \n     team of television's ``The Capital Gang'' sharing $25,000 for \n     a show at Walt Disney World. He throws in parenthetically \n     that Capital Gang member Michael Kinsley ``should know \n     better.''\n       Kinsley says he would have agreed a few years ago, but he's \n     changed his tune. He now believes there are no intrinsic \n     ethical problems with taking money for speaking. He does it, \n     he wrote in The New Republic in May, for the money, because \n     it's fun and it boosts his ego.\n       ``Being paid more than you're worth is the American \n     dream,'' he wrote. ``I see a day when we'll all be paid more \n     than we're worth. Meanwhile, though, there's no requirement \n     for journalists, alone among humanity, to deny themselves the \n     occasional fortuious tastes of this bliss.''\n       To Kinsley, new rules restricting a reporter's right to \n     lecture for largesse don't accomplish much.\n       ``Such rules merely replace the appearance of corruption \n     with the appearance of propriety,'' he wrote. ``What keeps \n     journalists on the straight and narrow most of the time is \n     not a lot of rules about potential conflicts of interest, but \n     the basic reality of our business that a journalist's product \n     is out there for all to see and evaluate.''\n       The problem, critics say, is that without knowing who \n     besides the employer is paying a journalist, the situation \n     isn't quite that clear-cut.\n       Jonathan Salant, president of the Washington chapter of the \n     Society of Professional Journalists, cites approvingly a \n     remark by former Washington Post Executive Editor Ben Bradlee \n     in AJR's March issue: ``If the Insurance Institute of \n     America, if there is such a thing, pays you $10,000 to make a \n     speech, don't tell me you haven't been corrupted. You can say \n     you haven't and you can say you will attack insurance issues \n     in the same way, but you won't. You can't.''\n       Salant thinks SPJ should adopt an absolute ban on speaking \n     fees as it revises its ethics code. Most critics want some \n     kind of public disclosure at the very least.\n       Says the Wall Street Journal's Murray, ``You tell me what \n     is the difference between somebody who works full time for \n     the National Association of Realtors and somebody who takes \n     $40,000 a year in speaking fees from Realtor groups. It's not \n     clear to me there's a big distinction. I'm not saying that \n     because you take $40,000 a year from Realtors that you ought \n     to be thrown out of the profession. But at the very least, \n     you ought to disclose that.''\n       And so Murray is implementing a disclosure policy. By the \n     end of the year, the 40 journalists working in his bureau \n     will be required to list outside income in a report that will \n     be available to the pubic.\n       ``People are not just cynical about politicians,'' says \n     Murray. ``They are cynical about us. Anything we can do to \n     ease that cynicism is worth doing.''\n       Sen. Grassley applauds the move. Twice he has taken to the \n     floor of the Senate to urge journalists to disclose what they \n     earn on the lecture circuit.\n       ``It's both the amount and doing it,'' he says. ``I say the \n     pay's too much and we want to make sure the fee is disclosed. \n     The average worker in my state gets about $21,000 a year. \n     Imagine what he or she thinks when a journalist gets that \n     much for just one speech?''\n       Public disclosure, says Grassley, would curtail the \n     practice.\n       Disclosure is often touted as the answer. Many journalists, \n     such as Kinsley and Wall Street Journal columnist Al Hunt--a \n     television pundit and Murray's predecessor as bureau chief--\n     have said they will disclose their engagements and fees only \n     if their colleagues do so as well.\n       Other high-priced speakers have equally little enthusiasm \n     for making the information public. ``I don't like the idea,'' \n     says ABC's Greenfield. ``I don't like telling people how much \n     I get paid.''\n       But one ABC correspondent says he has no problem with \n     public scrutiny. John Stossel, a reporter on ``20/20,'' \n     voluntarily agreed to\n      disclose some of the ``absurd'' fees he's earned. Last year \n     and through March of this year Stossel raked in $160,430 \n     for speeches--$135,280 of which was donated to hospital, \n     scholarship and conservation programs.\n       ``I just think secrecy in general is a bad thing,'' says \n     Stossel, who did not object to ABC's new policy. ``We [in the \n     media] do have some power. We do have some influence. That's \n     why I've come to conclude I should disclose, so people can \n     judge whether I can be bought.''\n       (Stossel didn't always embrace this notion so \n     enthusiastically. Last year he told AJR he had received \n     between $2,000 and $10,000 for a luncheon speech, but \n     wouldn't be more precise.)\n       Brian Lamb, founder and chairman of C-SPAN, has a simpler \n     solution, one that also has been adopted by ABC's Peter \n     Jennings, NBC's Tom Brokaw and CBS' Dan Rather and Connie \n     Chung. They speak, but not for money.\n       ``I never have done it,'' Lamb says. ``It sends out one of \n     those messages that's been sent out of this town for the last \n     20 years: Everybody does everything for money. When I go out \n     to speak to somebody I want to have the freedom to say \n     exactly what I think. I don't want to have people suspect \n     that I'm there because I'm being paid for it.''\n       On February 20, according to the printed program, Philip \n     Morris executives from around the world would have a chance \n     to listen to Cokie and Steve Roberts at 7 a.m. while enjoying \n     a continental breakfast. ``Change in Washington: A Media \n     Perspective with Cokie and Steve Roberts,'' was the scheduled \n     event at the PGA resort in Palm Beach during Philip Morris' \n     three-day invitational golf tournament.\n       A reporter who sent the program to AJR thought it odd that \n     Cokie Roberts would speak for Philip Morris in light of the \n     network's new policy. Even more surprising, he thought, was \n     that she would speak to a company that's suing ABC for libel \n     over a ``Day One'' segment that alleged Philip Morris adds \n     nicotine to cigarettes to keep smokers addicted. The case is \n     scheduled to go to trial in September.\n       At the last minute, Cokie Roberts was a no-show, says one \n     of the organizers. ``Cokie was sick or something,'' says \n     Nancy Schaub of Event Links, which put on the golf tournament \n     for Philip Morris. ``Only Steve Roberts came.''\n       Cokie Roberts won't talk to AJR about why she changed her \n     plans. Perhaps she got Dick Wald's message.\n       ``Of course, it's tempting and it's nice,'' Wald says of \n     hefty honoraria. ``Of course, they [ABC correspondents] have \n     rights as private citizens. It's not an easy road to go \n     [[Page S8492]] down. But there are some things you just \n     shouldn't do and that's one of them.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/15/senate-section/article/S8488-5", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO GEN. JOHN MICHAEL LOH, USAF, ON HIS RETIREMENT\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, today I want to recognize Gen. John Michael \nLoh for his 39 years of distinguished service to our Nation. General \nLoh has displayed exceptional leadership in a wide-ranging Air Force \ncareer that culminated as commander of the Air Combat Command. As a \nGeorgian, I am proud to note that General Loh is a native of Macon, GA.\n  General Loh graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy as a \ndistinguished graduate in 1960. Ultimately, he rose to command the \n250,000 men and women of Air Combat Command\n  General Loh is a highly decorated veteran of the Vietnam war. He flew \nover 200 combat missions in the F-4 at Da Nang Air Force Base, South \nVietnam. Later, General Loh also served as a test pilot, helping usher \nin the technological improvements we see in today's advanced fighters. \nAs the director of the F-16 System Program Office, he led the \nacquisition efforts that brought our country the world's best multirole \nfighter.\n  His numerous military awards and decorations include the \nDistinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster, the \nDistinguished Flying Cross, Meritorious Service Medal, and the Air \nMedal with seven Oak Leaf Clusters.\n  General Loh has flown over 5,000 hours as a command pilot in the F-\n16, A-7, F-4, and F-104 to mention just a few. He recently capped his \ncareer by flying our Nation's most sophisticated aircraft--the B-2 \nbomber. Perhaps his greatest feat, however, was in leading the \nsuccessful merger of Strategic and Tactical Air Commands into Air \nCombat Command. In fact, the Air Force Association awarded him its \nhighest military honor, the Hap Arnold Award, for his leadership of Air \nCombat Command and his national reputation for quality improvement. \nVice President Gore singled out Air Combat Command as a shining example \nof reinventing government.\n  Despite the significant changes in the Air Force and our military \nstructure as a whole, General Loh leaves a command that performed \nbrilliantly during and after the gulf war, and more recently, has \nresponded quickly and effectively to contingency operations around the \nworld.\n  The United States is indebted to General Loh for his selfless and \ndistinguished service. I offer my sincere thanks and appreciation for a \njob well done and wish General Loh and his wife, Barbara, continued \nsuccess in the future.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/15/senate-section/article/S8492-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8492-S8493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-987.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na reduction in the capital gains tax for assets held more than 2 years, \nto impose a surcharge on short-term capital gains, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             THE LONG-TERM INVESTMENT INCENTIVE ACT OF 1995\n\nMr. GREGG. Mr. President, I introduce a bill that will have a \nsignificant impact on the promotion of long-term investment through a \nreduction in the capital gains tax. I believe the Congress has a \nresponsibility to enact laws promoting long-term capital investment and \nsavings by all Americans. Part of fulfilling this obligation must \ninclude implementing a plan that would reduce the current capital gains \ntax rate on long-term investments.\n  We must also, however, balance this important economic goal against \nthe moral issue of adding increasing debt onto our children's \nshoulders. This becomes an unavoidable issue in the capital gains \ndebate because the Joint Committee on Taxation scores capital gains a \nbig revenue loser. This scoring issue is an unfortunate fact that we in \nCongress cannot ignore.\n  Accordingly, I have developed legislation that would encourage long-\nterm investment by amending the current capital gains tax using a \nsliding scale plan. My bill encourages an individual to hold an asset \nover a number of years, thus, allowing a greater tax reduction on \ninvestments, with the maximum benefit being reached after 4 years. It \nwould reward individuals who look toward contributing to a savings plan \nover a number of years, while at the same time making quick fix \ninvestments less attractive. This sliding scale plan would encourage \ninvestments that benefit long-term savings, [[Page S8494]] such as a \nchild's education, an individual's retirement, or other nonspeculative \nholdings.\n  The theory behind the sliding scale reduction on capital gains hinges \nupon an agreed goal: the promotion of savings and long-term investment \nthrough a capital gains cut, while recognizing our current fiscal \nrealities. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates this plan would \nlose just $7.4 billion in revenue over the 1995-2000 period.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 924\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to impose congressional notification and reporting \nrequirements on any negotiations or other discussions between the \nUnited States and Cuba with respect to normalization of relations; to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                            cuba legislation\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, on May 2, the Clinton administration \nreversed 30 years of United States policy by agreeing with Fidel Castro \nthat future refugees would be picked up by United States forces and \nreturned to Cuba. The administration portrays its decision as an \nimmigration control measure reached in secret for the good of misguided \nCubans who might set out on rafts and inner tubes to reach the United \nStates before the doors slammed shut. Apparently, it was necessary to \nkeep senior United States officials responsible for Cuba policy in the \ndark as well. The Clinton administration has not satisfactorily \nexplained its motives and objectives in reaching this agreement with \nthe Castro regime. Therefore, I am introducing this bill which would \ndeny funds for negotiations or other contacts related to normalization \nwith the Castro regime unless the administration has notified Congress \n15 days in advance.\n  This measure is not intended to interfere with the administration's \nability to conduct diplomacy. It simply requires that if and when \nPresident Clinton decides to abandon the centerpiece of the United \nStates' historic policy toward the Castro dictatorship, he does so in \nan open and public way.\n  For 36 years, Fidel Castro has terrorized Cuba's people, destroyed \nits economy, and used it as a base for subversion. I could never have \nimagined circumstances under which the United States would treat \nCastro's Cuba like just another negotiating partner. But last month, \nthat's just what the Clinton administration did when it cut a deal \nreversing 30 years of United States policy on welcoming refugees from \nCastro's Cuba.\n  I will not dignify what the administration did by calling it ``secret \ndiplomacy.'' It was a craven exercise. As A.M. Rosenthal wrote in the \nNew York Times, the Clinton administration ``got a contemptuous zero \nfrom Castro for breaking its promises, not even the release of some \npolitical prisoners, not the grant of a single civil liberty.''\n  At a briefing on Capitol Hill the day the policy U-turn was \nannounced, a Clinton administration official was asked whether, under \nthe terms of a deal between the United States and Cuba on interdiction \nand repatriation of refugees, the Castro regime had pledged to repeal \nthe Cuban law that makes it a crime to leave Cuba without \n[[Page S8496]] permission. The official didn't know. Then the official \nwas asked how we can be sure the Castro regime won't use the law to \nretaliate against returned rafters. ``Prosecutorial discretion,'' \nreplied the official.\n  In a nutshell, that anecdote illustrates the mindset of the Clinton \nadministration. Administration officials--some of them anyway--cannot \ndistinguish between the Castro regime and governments based on the rule \nof law. This is why many of my colleagues and I are so deeply disturbed \nby recent overtures to Castro. We don't know where they will stop. We \nhave no reason to believe that the administration won't continue to \nmake concessions at the expense of the Cuban people. My colleagues and \nI are introducing this bill to let the administration know that the \nfriends of the Cuban people in the United States Congress will not \nstand by and let this administration engage in anything but a strong \npolicy of support for democracy and freedom in Cuba.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BRYAN:\n  S. 926. A bill to improve the interstate enforcement of child support \nand parentage court orders, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                   the child support enforcement act\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing my Child Support \nEnforcement Act legislation from the last Congress to help further \nstrengthen our efforts to get deadbeat parents to responsibly provide \nfor their children.\n  Congress has recently taken many positive steps to increase the \neffectiveness of child support enforcement laws. In the 102d Congress, \nwe were successful in enacting legislation, which I sponsored in the \nSenate, to require credit bureaus to indicate on an individual's credit \nfile when he or she is delinquent in child support payments. This has \nprovided a strong incentive for parents to stay current in their \npayments.\n  The 103d Congress enacted laws to make deadbeat parents who fail to \npay child support ineligible for small business loans; to designate \nchild support payments as priority debts when an individual files for \nbankruptcy; to strengthen State paternity establishment procedures and \nto require health insurers to carry out orders for medical child \nsupport; and to restrict a State court's ability to modify a child \nsupport order issued by another State.\n  As part of much needed welfare reform, we must include improvements \nto the child support enforcement system. I will introduce portions of \nthis bill as an amendment when welfare reform is debated in the Senate, \nwhich I hope will be done before July 4. We need to find as many ways \nas possible to find delinquent parents, and hold them to their \nresponsibilities.\n  We all lament the increasing number of unwed teenage girls who have \nchildren. This situation is particularly disheartening when these young \nmothers are themselves mere children. But too often in the past, our \npublic policies have focused on the mother and ignored the \nresponsibility of the father. Those fathers, who many times have \nalready walked away before their children are even born, must face the \nreality of their parental and financial responsibilities.\n  During the past 2 months, I have visited child support enforcement \noffices in Las Vegas and Reno, NV. These visits included both the State \nwelfare division and the district attorney child support enforcement \noffices. It was an eye-opening experience.\n  I was overwhelmed by the thousands of case files stacked throughout \nthese offices. Employees in these offices are literally surrounded by \nfiles. They are joined by scores of investigators and attorneys who \nwork ceaselessly to ensure as many deadbeat parents as possible are \nfound, and legally persuaded to fulfill their financial \nresponsibilities.\n  Although Nevada is the fastest growing State in the Nation, it is a \ncomparatively small State with about 1.6 million people. Yet its State \nChild Support Enforcement Program had 66,385 cases in fiscal year 1994. \nThe program was able to collect $62.7 million. The unfortunate fact, \nhowever, is that the total owed was almost $352 million, leaving an \nuncollected balance of almost $290 million. In April of this year, \nNevada's caseload has already grown to over 69,000 cases.\n  These cases represent only those children whose families are \nreceiving aid to families with dependent children, or who are using the \nservices of the county district attorney offices to enforce child \nsupport. The many Nevadans using private attorneys are not included.\n  The facts are simple. Nationally, one in four children live in a \nsingle-parent household. But one of the most startling statistics is \nthat only half of these single parents have sought and obtained child \nsupport orders.\n  This means 50 percent of these single mothers either have been unable \nto track down the father, have not pursued support, or are unaware of \ntheir legal child support enforcement rights.\n  Of the parents who have sought out and obtained child support, only \nhalf receive the full amount to which they are entitled.\n  Let me make this clear--50 percent of single mothers do not even have \nchild support orders, and of the 50 percent that do, only half of them \nare getting what their children are entitled to receive. Thus 25 \npercent of the single parents who have child support orders actually \nreceive nothing at all.\n  These facts should concern us. It is all too true that many single \nparents must seek public welfare assistance in order to be able to \nsupport their children. When we taxpayers are asked to lend a helping \nhand to these children, we should be assured every effort is being made \nto require absent deadbeat parents meet their financial \nresponsibilities to those same children. Public assistance should not \nbe the escape valve relied upon by those parents who want to walk away \nfrom their children.\n  No one who shares the responsibility for bringing children into this \nworld should later be allowed to shirk that responsibility by refusing \nto admit paternity or failing to pay child support. The legislation I \nam introducing today adds to the arsenal available to those trying to \nenforce child support.\n  In April, I visited with eligibility workers in a local Las Vegas \nwelfare office. I was incredulous when I learned many Federal welfare \nassistance programs do not require recipients to participate in State \nand Federal child support enforcement efforts. In fact, only Aid to \nFamilies with Dependent Children or AFDC, and Medicaid currently \nrequire their recipients cooperate with child support enforcement \nefforts.\n  For example, if a parent with children receives food stamps, there is \nno requirement, as a condition of receiving that assistance, that the \nparent cooperate with child support enforcement agencies to collect any \nchild support payments to which he or she is entitled. Under my \nlegislation, all welfare assistance programs receiving Federal funds \nwill require all recipients to cooperate with efforts to collect child \nsupport benefits as a condition of receiving benefits.\n  Second, this legislation authorizes State and Federal Governments to \ndeny delinquent parents an array of benefits. A delinquent parent can \nbe denied an occupational, professional, or business license, a Federal \nloan or guarantee, and could even have his or her passport revoked if \nthe threat of fleeing the country was likely. The goal is not to drive \nthose who want to meet their obligations away, but rather to make sure \nthose ignoring their children understand society will not tolerate that \nirresponsible behavior.\n  These provisions should be particularly effective in dealing with \ndelinquent parents who are self-employed, and who are not covered by \nthe mandatory employer child support payment withholding.\n  The bill also builds on our past efforts of using the credit \nreporting system. It permits State agencies to obtain credit files in \norder to track down delinquent parents, or to help determine the \nappropriate amount of child support payment.\n  The bill also improves the interstate enforcement process by \nestablishing a jurisdictional basis for State court recognition of \nchild support orders of other States. The problems associated with \ncollecting child support are magnified when parents live in different \nStates. Part of the difficulty stems from differences in State laws, \npolicies, and procedures.\n  I have heard numerous cases of frustrating experiences in attempting \nto serve process on out-of-State delinquent parents, and in getting \ncertain [[Page S8497]] evidence obtained in one State admitted at a \nhearing in another State. One in three children support orders involve \nparents in different States. On average, it takes 1 year to locate an \nabsent parent, and 2 years to establish a court order if the parent has \ndeserted a family.\n  Finally, the bill makes it more difficult for parents to hide assets \nin an attempt to avoid paying their fair share of child support. A \ndifficult problem to resolve is when a delinquent parent transfers \nproperty to a friend or relative for little compensation to avoid child \nsupport payments. Under this bill, States would be allowed to void \nconveyances of property made to avoid paying child support.\n  We must give our courts and law enforcement agencies the tools they \nneed to crack down on delinquent parents. We must assure taxpayers who \nlend the helping hand to impoverished single mothers and their children \nthat every effort is being made to get the deadbeat parents to pay up. \nWe must ensure the children receive adequate and consistent child \nsupport, so they are able to have the opportunity to become successful, \nproductive and healthy adults.\n  I believe my legislation will move us a long way on the path to meet \nthose goals. I request my colleagues to join with me in this effort to \nmake this law before the end of the year. The children deserve no less.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HELMS:\n  S. 927. A bill to provide for the liquidation or reliquidation of a \ncertain entry of warp knitting machines as free of certain duties; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                            duty legislation\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I send to the desk, for appropriate \nreferral, a bill on behalf of D International of Burlington, NC, \nwhich imported from Germany, four warp knitting machines at a duty-free \nrate which D then sold to a Venezuelan company, which decided not to \nkeep the machines and returned them to D\n  Upon reentry, the Customs Service mistakenly classified the machines \nfirst as a reentry of United States goods, instead of a German, then \nmisclassified them at a duty rate of 4.4 percent.\n  D contacted Customs to protest the duty assessment. However, \nCustoms ruled that the D memorandum did not qualify as a formal \nprotest because D did not file form 19. Amazingly, no right of appeal \nexists within Customs on such rulings if a company misses the deadline \nfor protesting. D would have to spend a lot of money going to court \nto try to rectify the mistake.\n  Mr. President, as a result of these mistakes, D now owes $25,000 in \nduties on machines that were supposed to be duty-free. This error by \nthe Customs Service will be remedied by my bill, which instructs \nCustoms to reclassify the machines as duty-free and refund to D the \nduties improperly assessed.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Burns and Mrs. Kassebaum):\n  S. 928. A bill to enhance the safety of air travel through a more \neffective Federal Aviation Administration, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n         THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION REFORM ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I will be introducing a major piece \nof legislation with Senator Kassebaum and Senator Burns.\n  As a frequent user of the air traffic control system, I have a very \nreal stake in addressing the persistent problems which have plagued the \nFAA for many years. Former Senator Barry Goldwater accurately described \nway back in 1975 the current FAA shortcomings when he introduced a bill \nto reestablish the FAA as an independent agency.\n  Senator Goldwater noted, and this was back in 1975, 20 years ago:\n\n       In 1967, when the then new Department of Transportation was \n     created, the Federal Aviation Agency was terminated and its \n     powers and functions were transferred to and vested in the \n     Secretary of DOT. The previously independent Federal Aviation \n     Agency was in effect converted to a new bureau within the \n     Department of Transportation, named the Federal Aviation \n     Administration. The Administrator of this ``bureau'' reports \n     to and is subject to the control of the Secretary of \n     Transportation.\n\n  Barry Goldwater went on to say, 20 years ago:\n\n       There is extensive evidence to show that subsequent to this \n     transformation, there has been undue interference on the part \n     of the Department of Transportation in the internal affairs \n     of the Federal Aviation Administration, so much so that the \n     FAA's procurement process has been slowed down to an average \n     time period of 1\\1/2\\ years or more--\n\n  I understand it is more than that today, but I am quoting from 20 \nyears ago.\n\n     resulting in the cancellation of many procurement projects or \n     unnecessary losses in the millions of dollars to companies \n     involved. It is important to note, too, that aviation users, \n     who pay much of the money which goes into the Airport and \n     Airway Trust Fund, have no effective participation in the \n     development of FAA finance plans so long as it is under the \n     Department.\n\n  These words that were stated on the floor of the Senate by Senator \nBarry Goldwater 20 years ago are just as true today as they were then. \nUnfortunately, the Senate failed to pass the Goldwater bill. The \nproblems Senator Goldwater identified in 1975 are yet to be resolved.\n  As a pilot, I have found holding town hall meetings in small towns \nand airports is an effective way of communicating with people. In doing \nthese on the weekends--virtually every weekend, I do 10 or so--I talk \nto pilots, I talk to controllers. I do not think there is a controller \nthat I do not know by their first name in Oklahoma.\n  They all agree that something needs to be done about changing the \nFAA. Even though Barry Goldwater attempted to do this back 20 years \nago, what he said then is true today and we need to do it.\n  A careful analysis of these proposals that have been made in order to \ncorporatize or privatize shows that they really do not work and there \nis a lack of understanding.\n  Mr. President, there has been an effort by the administration to \nprivatize or corporatize the FAA. I think that while I do believe in \nprivatizing, it is not appropriate in this case.\n  People who use the system oppose the privatization of the FAA. After \nworking with users of the system, I am pleased to announce that we have \nbeen able to come up with a workable solution. Along with Senators \nConrad Burns and Nancy Kassebaum, I am introducing legislation to \nreform the Federal Aviation Administration.\n  Our bill is similar to a bill introduced in the House by my good \nfriend from Iowa, Representative Jim Lightfoot, and also Representative \nJohn Duncan. This bill provides dramatic yet realistic reform that will \nresolve the problems that were identified by Senator Goldwater in 1975 \nand continue today to plague the FAA.\n  It will restore the Federal Aviation Administration to an independent \nagency status. This will ensure that the agency is able to manage and \nregulate the safety of the air traffic control system without the \nsecond-guessing or interference by the politically appointed Department \nof Transportation officials and staff.\n  Our approach represents a reform from within Government. It offers a \nmore prudent and realistic approach to the FAA reform than the \nextremely risky alternative of privatizing or corporatizing the air \ntraffic control system.\n  As a former mayor of a major metropolitan area, I know something \nabout privatizing. I have been a fan of privatizing for a long time. In \nfact, I privatized everything I could when I was mayor of the city of \nTulsa, OK, many years ago.\n  One of the systems that has been emulated today by cities all over \nAmerica was the privatization of the trash system. A refuge or trash \nsystem is not a sensitive system like air traffic control.\n  As a believer in the ability of the private sector to generally do a \nbetter job of managing than Government, I believe that there are some \ninherently governmental functions. Oversight of our air traffic control \nsystem is one. The safety implications are too great to allow a \nmanagement team that has to worry about the bottom line to make these \ndecisions.\n  Those who use the system and those who use it in commercial \naircraft--it does not matter whether you are in an American Airline 747 \nas a pilot or a passenger, or you are with me in a 20-year-old Piper \nAztec. The fact is that your lives are in the hands of these \nindividuals on the ground. [[Page S8498]] \n  In addition, our proposal provides for appointment of an FAA \nAdministrator with a fixed term of 7 years. The average tenure of the \nFAA Administrator since I have been in Congress has been less than 2 \nyears. By the time they find their way to the cafeteria, they are out \nof there. There is no continuity in planning for the FAA. Clearly, we \nneed the continuity of leadership if real changes are to take hold.\n  This proposal establishes a personnel pilot program which would \nprovide FAA greater latitude managing personnel by giving increased \nflexibility in measuring performance. The pilot program has been \ndesigned to improve performance of individuals and departments, rather \nthan merely rewarding longevity.\n  Our bill establishes a procurement reform pilot program which will \npermit the FAA to simplify its procurement procedures by shifting from \nthe rigid procurement rules to allow routine off-the-shelf purchases.\n  We have example after example of instances where complicated \nprocurement practices have delayed the purchasing of technology and of \nproducts that are needed to save lives, until they are no longer \ncurrent, in terms of their technology.\n  A good example is the microwave landing system. The MLS system is \nsupposed to replace the ILS system. By the time they got around to \nimplementing this program, the GPS, the global position system, had \nreached a degree of technology that allows for precision approaches.\n  The other areas are in the area of costs. I mean, the same thing \nregarding the GPS system. I happen to be the only Member of Congress in \nhistory to fly an airplane around the world. I did it a couple of years \nago. In doing this I used a GPS system. Never, all the way around the \nworld, did I lose a satellite. This system is a beautiful system. Yet \nthat system that I used only 2 years ago flying around the world is \none-fourth the cost today that it was then.\n  That means if we and the FAA procure this highly technical machinery, \nthe mechanics to run the system, by the time the system goes through \nfollowing the procurement practices, that which you have purchased is \nmuch cheaper and it would be out of date. So, for cost purposes and \ntechnology purposes, this has to happen.\n  Under our bill, a select panel is created to review and report back \nto Congress on innovative financing mechanisms for long-term funding of \nour aviation infrastructure and needs. Panel members will review loan \nguarantees, financial partnerships with for-profit private sector \nentities, multiyear appropriations, revolving loan funds, mandatory \nspending authority, authority to borrow, and restructured grant \nprograms.\n  Each of these proposals has the support of virtually all of the \naviation industry. This bill is strongly supported by the Aircraft \nOwners and Pilots Association, who have, in just the State of Oklahoma, \n4,500 general aviation pilots; and throughout America have 340,000 \ngeneral aviation pilots. They support this.\n  In addition, the National Aviation Coalition Association, a \nconsortium of 28 major aviation organizations representing all segments \nof the aviation community, has indicated that this proposal is a \nvaluable contribution to a healthy debate concerning much needed reform \nof the FAA.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that everyone, the administration, \nCongress, and the aviation community, agrees on the need to reform the \nFAA. I urge my colleagues to join with Senators Burns and Kassebaum, \nRepresentative Lightfoot and Representative Duncan from the House, and \nSenator Goldwater and me in supporting a meaningful reform of the FAA.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Dole, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. \n        Nickles, Mr. Gramm, and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 929. A bill to abolish the Department of Commerce; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n           the department of commerce dismantling act of 1995\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, when President Theodore Roosevelt sat \ndown with his Cabinet for a meeting, he needed just nine chairs to \naccommodate everyone, including the Post-Master General. If he desired \nan impromptu gathering, he could just walk to the Old Executive Office \nBuilding next door. The offices of almost the entire executive branch \nwere located there.\n  Ninety-four years later, a Cabinet meeting has almost twice as many \nparticipants--even without the Postmaster's presence--and includes the \nSecretaries of 14 Cabinet-level Departments spread all over the \nDistrict of Columbia. These meetings don't include the heads of \nhundreds of administrations, commissions, boards, and other Federal \nagencies below the Cabinet level.\n  This tremendous growth in the size and scope of the Federal \nGovernment has resulted in enormous tax and debt burdens on our economy \nwhich, in turn, means lower living standards and fewer job \nopportunities for the American people. The Federal budget in 1901 \nconsumed just over 2 percent of total national income. Today, it spends \nalmost 25 cents for every dollar we produce. Measured against the size \nof the economy, the Federal Government is 12 times larger than it was \nat the turn of the century. In the meantime, a Federal budget that \nroutinely enjoyed surpluses of 10 percent or more during Roosevelt's \ntenure hasn't seen the black in 25 years.\n  In restraining the growth of the Federal Government, we need to \ntarget those departments and agencies whose activities are unnecessary, \nduplicative, wasteful, and simply outside the limits of Federal power \nprescribed by the U.S. Constitution. While this description fits much \nof the Federal Government, Majority Leader Bob Dole has set the \nstandard by calling for the elimination of four Cabinet departments--\nCommerce, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, and Education. These \nfour departments alone employ more than 74,000 bureaucrats and have \ncombined budgets of $70 billion--133 times more than the entire Federal \nGovernment spent in Roosevelt's era. While some of the programs within \nthese departments serve useful purposes, we don't need these huge \nbureaucracies and buildings to oversee them. Instead, these programs \nought to be consolidated, privatized, and devolved to the States and \nlocalities.\n  Today, I am joined by Senators Dole, Faircloth, Nickles, Gramm, and \nBrown in introducing legislation to begin that process by abolishing \nthe Department of Commerce. The Department of Commerce Dismantling Act \nof 1995 is the product of the Dole Task Force on the Elimination of \nFederal Agencies. It is the first of several bills the task force \nintends to introduce this Congress targeted at reducing the size of \nGovernment. It is the product of extensive work by several Senate \noffices, as well as the members of the House Freshmen Task Force, and \nit has been endorsed by the National TaxPayers Union, Citizens For a \nSound Economy, the Business Leadership Council, Americans For Tax \nReform, and the Small Business Survival Committee.\n  The Department of Commerce houses the least defensible collection of \nFederal agencies in Washington, many of which are either duplicated or \noutperformed by other Government agencies and private industry. \nAccording to the General Accounting Office [GAO], Commerce shares its \nmission with ``at least 71 Federal departments, agencies, and offices'' \nwhile former Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher recently called the \nDepartment ``nothing more than a hall closet where you throw in \neverything that you don't know what to do with.''\n  Ironically, regulating interstate commerce isn't one of them. That's \nhandled by the independent Interstate Commerce Commission, itself a \ntarget for elimination. Commerce is a bit player in international trade \nas well. At least 10 Federal agencies are charged with promoting U.S. \nexports, but only a fraction of the funding is directed to Commerce. \nThe Agriculture Department receives three-fourths.\n  So what's left for Secretary Ron Brown, 263 political appointees, and \nthe 36,000 bureaucrats who work for Commerce? Over half of the \nDepartment's $3.6 billion budget is consumed by the National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration [NOAA]--the Nation's weather and ocean \nmapping service.\n Another $400 million funds the notorious Economic Development \nAdministration [EDA], a traditional source of [[Page S8499]] pork \nbarrel spending on things like public docks and sewer systems. At one \npoint in its history, 40 percent of the Administration's loans were in \ndefault, while economic assistance grants were distributed to such \neconomically troubled areas as Key Biscayne, FL. Even when it is \neffective, the EDA duplicates the efforts of numerous other programs in \nother departments.\n\n  The Commerce Dismantling Act targets this waste and duplication. It \ntransfers those functions that can be better served elsewhere, \nconsolidates duplicative agencies, and eliminates the remaining \nunnecessary or wasteful programs. The terminations, transfers and \nconsolidations are to be completed over a 36-month period under the \ndirection of a temporary Commerce Programs Resolution Agency. According \nto preliminary Congressional Budget Office figures, the bill saves the \nAmerican taxpayer $7.7 billion over 5 years. Let me quickly go through \nthe bill.\n  While the activities of NOAA are only tangentially related to the \npromotion of commerce, it makes up over half of the Department of \nCommerce budget. The individual functions of this agency would be sent \nto more appropriate agencies or departments.\n  First, the enforcement functions of the National Marine Fisheries \nService are transferred to the Coast Guard, while the scientific \nfunctions are transferred to the Fish and Wildlife Service. Seafood \ninspection is transferred to the Department of Agriculture, which \nalready carries out most food inspection programs. The State fishery \ngrants and commercial fisheries promotion activities are terminated.\n  Second, the geodesy functions of the National Ocean Service are \ntransferred to the U.S. Geological Survey while coastal and water \npollution research duplicated by the Environmental Protection Agency is \nterminated. Marine and estuarine sanctuary management would be \ntransferred to the Interior Department, which already manages some \nfisheries. Nautical and aeronautical charting is privatized, as the \nprivate sector undertakes this activity already.\n  Third, the National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information \nService's weather satellite of this agency are transferred to the \nNational Weather Service to consolidate these functions which, in turn, \nis transferred to the Interior Department. The NESDIS data centers \nwould be privatized.\n  Fourth, because many of its activities are duplicative of other \nFederal agencies or could be better served by the private sector, this \noffice is terminated. The labs which could operate in the private \nsector will be sold and the remaining labs will be transferred to the \nInterior Department.\n  Finally, the NOAA Corps is terminated and its vessels sold to the \nprivate sector. Services can be obtained in the private sector and its \nfleet is in disrepair.\n  Another significant part of the Department of Commerce, the Economic \nDevelopment Administration, is terminated under this legislation. The \nEDA provides grants and assistance to loosely defined ``economically \ndepressed'' regions. EDA's functions are duplicated by numerous other \nFederal agencies including the Departments of Agriculture, HUD, and \nInterior, the Small Business Administration, the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority and the Appalachian Regional Commission. The parochial nature \nof the program often targets EDA grants to locations with healthy \neconomies which do not need Federal assistance. This bill terminates \nthe EDA, transferring outstanding obligations to the Treasury \nDepartment for management or sale.\n  Although the Minority Business Development Administration has spent \nhundreds of millions on management assistance--not capital assistance--\nsince 1971, the program has never been formally authorized by Congress. \nThe MBDA's stated mission, to help minority-owned businesses get \nGovernment contracts, is duplicated by such agencies and programs as \nthe Small Business Administration and its failed 8(a) loan program, and \nSmall Business Development Centers, along with the private sector. The \nMBDA is terminated and its 98 field offices closed.\n  The U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration seeks to promote travel \nand tourism in the United States through trade fairs and other \npromotional activities. According to the Heritage Foundation, ``the \nagency often works with private sector organizations, including the \nTravel Industry Association of America, to organize events such as the \n`Discover America Pow Wow' or the `Pow Wow Europe.' There is no \njustification for Federal involvement in such promotional\n activities of a commercial nature.'' Because functions such as these \nare already extensively addressed by States, localities, public sector \norganizations, and the private sector, the USTTA is immediately \nterminated.\n\n  The Technology Administration currently works with industry to \npromote the use and development of new technology. Because Government \nin general, and the Federal Government in particular, is poorly \nequipped to pick winners and losers in the marketplace--frequently \nallowing political criteria rather than market criteria determine the \nchoice--this agency is terminated, including the Office of Technology \nPolicy, Technology Commercialization, and Technology Evaluation and \nAssessment.\n  The Industrial Technology Service programs, including the Advanced \nTechnology Program [ATP] and the Manufacturing Extension Partnerships, \nare terminated; these programs are often cited as prime examples of \ncorporate welfare, wherein the Federal Government invests in applied \nresearch programs which should be conducted in the private sector.\n  The weights and measures functions of the National Institute for \nStandards and Technology would be transferred to the National Science \nFoundation. The National Technical Information Service, a clearinghouse \nfor technical Government information, would be privatized.\n  The National Telecommunications and Information Administration, an \nadvisory body on national telecommunications policy, would be \nterminated, including its grant programs. Federal spectrum management \nfunctions would be transferred to the Federal Communications \nCommission.\n  Providing for patents and trademarks is a constitutionally-mandated \nGovernment function. Our proposal would transfer this office to the \nJustice Department, requiring the PTO to be supported completely \nthrough fee collection.\n  The Bureau of the Census, another constitutionally-mandated function, \nis transferred to the Treasury Department. Select General Accounting \nOffice recommendations for savings at the Bureau would be implemented. \nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis is transferred to the Federal Reserve \nSystem to ensure the integrity of data. The superfluous ESA bureaucracy \nwould be eliminated.\n  The Bureau of Export Administration is one of several agencies \nresponsible for monitoring U.S. exports that may compromise national \nsecurity. Because this function remains important to the country, this \nlegislation would reassign these functions as follows.\n  The determination of export controls is transferred to the Department \nof Defense. The United States Trade Representative would advise the \nDefense Department in disputed cases. The Customs Service, which \nalready has the staff, expertise, and facilities, would enforce the \nexport licensing determined by the DOD.\n  While the Department of Commerce claims to be the lead in trade \npromotion, it actually plays a small part. Five percent of Commerce's \nbudget is dedicated to trade promotion, and it comprises only 8 percent \nof total Federal spending on trade promotion. The International Trade \nAdministration is the primary trade agency within the Department of \nCommerce. This bill makes the following changes.\n  The Import Administration is transferred to the Office of the United \nStates Trade Representative. The USTR, which already plays a role in \nthis area, would make determinations of unfair trade practices.\n  The U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service is transferred to the Office \nof the U.S. Trade Representative. The domestic component of USFCS is \nterminated, and the foreign component would be transferred to the \nOffice of the U.S. Trade Representative, which already takes the lead \nin trade policy.\n  The International Economic Policy is also terminated and these \nfunctions would continue to be carried out by the USTR.\n  Finally, the Trade Development functions are terminated and replaced \nwith [[Page S8500]] a series of industry advisory boards, composed of \nrepresentatives from the private sector to provide advice to policy \nmakers, at no cost to the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, the philosophy behind the Dole Task Force, and the \nunderlying objectives of this bill, are based upon the same fundamental \nprinciples of limited and efficient government that the electorate \noverwhelmingly supported last November. It is a reasonable approach to \nrestore some much needed fiscal sanity to our Federal Government; \nmaking it smaller, less costly, yet more efficient.\n  The new Republican Congress is committed to balancing the budget by \nthe year 2002. While this commitment means we must do the heavy lifting \nof reducing the growth of Government, it also presents us an \nopportunity to establish a proper balance between States and the \nFederal Government that protects the vigor and diversity of our States \nand local communities. Only by recognizing the limits of the Federal \nGovernment can we restore the vitality that breeds character, \ninnovation, and a sense of community.\n  This bill represents the first step in the process of achieving that \ngoal. It conforms with both the Senate and House-passed budgets and it \nhas the support of leadership in both House and the Senate. I encourage \nmy colleagues to support it as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     National Taxpayers Union,\n\n                                                    June 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: National Taxpayers Union is pleased \n     to endorse the ``Commerce Department Dismantling Act of \n     1995,'' as proposed by you and Congressman Dick Chrysler. \n     Your excellent proposal will streamline the federal \n     government and provide significant savings for America's \n     taxpayers.\n       The terminations, transfers and consolidations provided in \n     your proposed legislation would be completed over a thirty-\n     six month period. The ``Abraham/Chrysler Act'' would save \n     $7.765 billion over five years.\n       The General Accounting Office has reported that the \n     Commerce Department ``faces the most complex web of divided \n     authorities,'' sharing its ``missions with at least 71 \n     federal departments, agencies, and offices.'' Your bill will \n     finally end this wasteful duplication.\n       Again, NTU is pleased to endorse the ``Abraham/Chrysler \n     Commerce Department Dismantling Act of 1995.'' We urge your \n     colleagues to join you in this effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    David Keating,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                  Business Leadership Council,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 1995.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: The Business Leadership Council, a \n     newly-formed business association of entrepreneurial business \n     leaders who are committed to working to limit the size of \n     government and to expand global economic growth, strongly \n     endorses the Abraham-Chrysler Commerce Department Dismantling \n     Act of 1995.\n       BLC represents businesses of all types and sizes who want \n     what is best for America, rather than a perk or subsidy that \n     may be best in the narrow, short-term, self-interest of their \n     individual business. Its members are willing to take bold, \n     principled positions and are not afraid to confront the \n     status quo. They recognize that, although some of their \n     businesses may benefit from particular Commerce Department \n     programs, it is clear America is better off saving the money, \n     reducing subsidies, and eliminating unnecessary regulations.\n       For that reason, we enthusiastically support the \n     dismantling of corporate welfare, whose voice in the cabinet \n     has been the Commerce Department. The old established \n     business groups fear the wrath of their members who enjoy \n     corporate pork and therefore will not take a stand on this \n     controversial issue. BLC, on the other hand, applauds your \n     efforts to abolish unnecessary, duplicative, wasteful \n     programs and save the taxpayers $7.8 billion over the next \n     five years. In these times, when Congress is endeavoring to \n     balance the budget and reduce the size and scope of the \n     federal government, the business community must do its part.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Thomas L. Phillips,\n     Chairman of the Board of Governors.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                     Americans For Tax Reform,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: Americans for Tax Reform, a 60,000 \n     member coalition of individuals, taxpayer groups and \n     businesses concerned with federal tax policy and spending \n     reduction, enthusiastically endorses the Abraham-Chrysler \n     Commerce Department Dismantling Act of 1995.\n       The Commerce Department is a classic example of wasteful \n     government spending run amok. Its own Inspector General \n     referred to it as ``a loose collection of more than 100 \n     programs.'' If we are ever to balance the budget, rein in \n     federal spending and allow Americans to keep more of their \n     hard-earned dollars, unnecessary departments must be \n     eliminated. The Commerce Department is such a department.\n       We are impressed by the four principles used in drafting \n     the legislation: terminating unnecessary or wasteful \n     programs, consolidating programs duplicated by other \n     departments or agencies, transferring programs that serve a \n     valid purpose to other agencies, and privatizing programs \n     better performed outside the government. If all federal \n     agencies were scrutinized in this fashion, we would be well \n     on our way toward the smaller and more efficient government \n     that Americans are demanding. Indeed, your legislation alone \n     would allow budget savings of almost $7.8 billion over five \n     years, according to estimates by the Congressional Budget \n     Office. That's $7.8 billion more for hard-working Americans \n     to keep for themselves.\n       Certainly there will be howls of outrage from special \n     interests which gain some advantage from a pet program. But \n     for too long, Washington has ignored the concerns of the most \n     important national interest: the American taxpayer. That era \n     has come to an end. Americans have signalled that they have \n     had enough of endless government taxing and spending. The \n     Commerce Department Dismantling Act of 1995 begins the \n     scaling back of the overgrown federal government. Americans \n     for Tax Reform fully supports this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Grover G. Norquist,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                            Small Business Survival Committee,\n\n                                    Washington, DC., June 7, 1995.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: Every so often, a piece of \n     legislation crosses my desk that the Small Business Survival \n     Committee (SBSC) can support without any reservations. ``The \n     Commerce Department Dismantling Act of 1995'' is such a \n     legislative act.\n       First, let me compliment you on your four straightforward \n     principles for evaluating the Commerce Department. They \n     should serve as a guide for reviewing every federal \n     government department:\n       Terminating unnecessary and wasteful programs;\n       Consolidating programs duplicative of other departments or \n     agencies;\n       Transferring valid programs to more appropriate agencies; \n     and\n       Privatizing programs which can be better performed in the \n     private sector.\n       Federal government spending has been out of control for \n     decades. The Commerce Department, with its myriad unnecessary \n     and duplicative programs, serves as one of the most glaring \n     examples of wasting taxpayer dollars. The elimination of the \n     Department of Commerce will send a loud and clear message to \n     the American people--business-as-usual, big-government \n     politics is finished. Indeed, eliminating the Commerce \n     Department would be an historic step toward bringing some \n     sanity back to the federal government, while saving U.S. \n     taxpayers an estimated $7.8 billion over five years.\n       ``The Commerce Department Dismantling Act of 1995'' offers \n     a sound plan for eliminating programs within the Commerce \n     Department that government should not be undertaking in the \n     first place (e.g., the United States Travel & Tourism \n     Administration); for moving programs to more appropriate \n     areas of the federal government (e.g., the Bureau of the \n     Census and the Bureau of Economic Analysis); or for \n     privatizing programs (e.g., the National Technical \n     Information Service).\n       Naturally, every federal department or program has a vocal \n     special interest attached to it. The Commerce Department is \n     no different. Indeed, a small part of the business community \n     likely will oppose the termination of the Commerce \n     Department. Please rest assured that any business voices \n     raised in support of the Commerce Department will be a very \n     small minority. America's entrepreneurs have little use, if \n     any, for the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n       The best agenda for entrepreneurs, business and the economy \n     is clear: deregulation, tax reduction, and smaller \n     government. Eliminating the Department of Commerce has the \n     full support of SBSC and our more than 40,000 small business \n     members. The time has come to rein in federal government \n     spending, and the Department of Commerce is a fine place to \n     start.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Karen Kerrigan,\n                                                        President.\n\n\n                                 s. 929\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nthe Commerce Department Dismantling Act of 1995. I want to compliment \nSenator Abraham and Senator [[Page S8501]] Faircloth for their hard \nwork in producing this legislation, and I look forward to working with \nthem as this legislation is considered in committee and the Senate. The \nCommerce Department is the only Cabinet-level agency terminated in the \nSenate budget resolution, and it is important that we keep our promise \nto the American people to put the Federal Government on a budget, say \nno to more Federal spending, and allow American families to keep more \nof what they earn.\n  Mr. President, I do have concerns about some specific transfers of \nCommerce authority to other Departments and feel that, with further \nstudy, we can find a more appropriate destination for those functions \nthat are retained. Nevertheless, I am strongly supportive of our effort \nto eliminate the Commerce Department, and will work with my colleagues \nto strengthen the bill we are introducing today.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. PRESSLER (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \n        Harkin, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 931. A bill to authorize the construction of the Lewis and Clark \nRural Water System and to authorize assistance to the Lewis and Clark \nRural Water System, Inc., a nonprofit corporation, for the planning and \nconstruction of the water supply system, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n           THE LEWIS AND CLARK RURAL WATER SYSTEM ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nauthorizes construction of the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System. This \nsystem, when complete, will provide much needed, safe drinking water \nfor hundreds of communities in southeastern South Dakota, northwestern \nIowa, and southwestern Minnesota.\n  Joining me in introducing this legislation are Senators Daschle, \nGrassley, Harkin, and Wellstone.\n  Mr. President, this is the second year I have introduced legislation \nto authorize this water project. I am proud of the citizens of South \nDakota who have worked extremely hard on this project. They are to be \ncommended. Nothing is more important to the health of the South Dakota \nranchers, farmers, and people living in towns and cities than the \navailability of safe drinking water. The bill I am introducing today \nwill achieve that goal.\n  Since first coming to Congress, I have continually fought for the \ndevelopment of South Dakota water projects. In return for the \nsacrifices South Dakota made for the construction of the dams and \nreservoirs along the Missouri River, the Federal Government made a \ncommitment to South Dakota. That commitment was to support water \ndevelopment in my State. This water project, in part, helps to meet \nthat commitment.\n  In this day of fiscal austerity, only projects of the greatest public \nbenefit can be brought forward. The Lewis and Clark Rural Water System \nis the only feasible means of ensuring that future supplies of good \nquality water will be available well into the next century. The Lewis \nand Clark Rural Water System will provide a supplemental supply of \ndrinking water that is expected to serve over 180,500 people.\n  Mr. President, water development is a health issue, economic \ndevelopment issue, and a rural development issue. The ability of rural \nAmerica to survive and grow is intrinsically related to its ability to \nprovide adequate supplies of safe drinking water. Without a reliable \nsupply of water, these areas cannot attract new businesses and cannot \ncreate jobs. The creation of jobs is a paramount issue to a rural State \nsuch as South Dakota. The Lewis and Clark Rural Water System will help \nassure job growth in the areas to be served.\n  It is extremely difficult for rural communities and residents to \nmaintain a healthy standard of living if they do not have access to \ngood quality drinking water.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a close look at this legislation. We \nwould greatly appreciate their support for it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Pressler, in \nintroducing legislation to authorize the Lewis and Clark Rural Water \nSystem. The Lewis and Clark Rural Water System is seeking authorization \nfor the construction of a rural water system to provide clean water to \nsoutheastern South Dakota, northwest Iowa, and southwest Minnesota.\n  The need for this project is clear. In Sioux Falls, and in the rural \ncounties that rely on Sioux Falls as a center of economic growth, we \nare now face-to-face with water shortages. Population growth is \noutstripping existing supplies of clean water.\n  Despite heroic efforts by the city of Sioux Falls to conserve water, \nsupplies are not keeping up with demand. Sioux Falls has imposed water \nrestrictions every year since 1987. Water rights for the Big Sioux \naquifer, which supplies water to Sioux Falls, have been committed. \nTherefore, Sioux Falls has been forced to explore other long-term \noptions. Similar problems exist in the nearby rural counties in \nsoutheastern South Dakota, Iowa and Minnesota, areas where water use \nrestrictions are not uncommon. Unless the water supply problem is \nresolved, it could affect the long-term growth and development of the \ncity.\n  Not only are there shortages of water, but much of the water that \ncurrently supplies the area is contaminated with high levels of iron, \nmanganese, sulfate, and total dissolved solids. In many cases, drinking \nwater is at or above EPA limits, leading to concern over public health \nin those areas.\n  There is a solution; the people of this region can tap the enormous \nresources of the Missouri River to provide long-term public health and \neconomic development benefits. But they cannot do this alone. It will \nrequire a partnership between local, State, and Federal governments.\n  With the Missouri River carrying billions of gallons of water by this \narea each year, I am reminded of the ironic line ``water, water \neverywhere, but not a drop to drink.'' With the construction of the \nLewis and Clark system to convey Missouri River water to the people of \nthis region, that irony will cease. Impacts of this project on the flow \nof the Missouri River will be negligible. Nearly all the water would be \nreturned to the Missouri River via the James, Vermillion, Big Sioux, \nLittle Sioux, Rock, and Floyd Rivers.\n  In conclusion, there is a strong need for this project throughout the \nthree-State area. The water supply shortages, the poor water quality, \nand the need to allow this region to grow economically, all demand that \na solution be found that allows the people of this region access to \nclean, safe drinking water. The Lewis and Clark project is a sensible \nand timely answer to those needs. I encourage my colleagues to lend \ntheir support to this project in hopes that Congress will authorize its \nconstruction in the near future.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Akaka, \n        Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Bradley, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Feingold, \n        Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Glenn, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Kerrey, \n        Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Moynihan, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Packwood, Mr. Pell, Mr. Robb, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. \n        Simon, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 932. A bill to prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of \nsexual orientation; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n             the employment non-discrimination act of 1995\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nEmployment Non-Discrimination Act of 1995. I am joined in doing so by \nnearly one-third of the Members of the Senate.\n  In my view, Mr. President, this bill is perhaps the most important \ncivil rights legislation to come before Congress this year. I am \nhonored to be a principal sponsor of the legislation in the Senate.\n  The legislation extends to sexual orientation the same federal \nemployment discrimination protections established for race, religion, \ngender, national origin, age, and disability. The time has come to \nextend this type of protection to the only group--millions of \nAmericans--still subjected to legal discrimination on the job.\n  The principles of equality and opportunity must apply to all \nAmericans. [[Page S8502]] Success at work should be directly related to \none's ability to do the job, period. People who work hard and perform \nwell should not be kept from leading productive and responsible lives--\nfrom paying their taxes, meeting their mortgage payments and otherwise \ncontributing to the economic life of the nation--because of irrational, \nnon-work-related prejudice.\n  Mr. President: As a 61-year-old white male who grew up in a rural \narea, I fully understand how one could feel prejudice. I was not immune \nto it myself. However, through education and understanding, we must \novercome such prejudice, as individuals and as a nation.\n  When this issue has been raised in the states, the debate has often \nturned on the phrase ``special rights.'' This bill does not create any \n``special rights.'' Rather, it simply protects a right that should \nbelong to every American, the right to be free from discrimination at \nwork because of personal characteristics unrelated to successful \nperformance on the job.\n  I'm proud to say that my home state of Vermont is one of several \nstates that have enacted sexual orientation discrimination laws. It is \nno surprise, Mr. President, that the sky has not fallen. I am not aware \nof a single complaint from Vermont employers about the enforcement of \nthe state law. However, I do know that thousands of Vermonters no \nlonger need to live and work in the shadows.\n  My little state of Vermont was the first to abolish slavery, the \nfirst to answer Lincoln's call to arms, and the only state I know of \nwith the audacity to declare war on Germany before Pearl Harbor. Once \nagain, I think it is time for the federal government to follow the lead \nof Vermont, and the other states and cities across the country that \nhave declared war on this, the final front of discrimination. The bill \nwe introduce today takes important steps in that direction. I look \nforward to the day when we can see it signed into law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Summary--Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 1995\n\n       The Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 1995 (ENDA) \n     extends federal employment discrimination protections \n     currently provided based on race, religion, gender, national \n     origin, age and disability to sexual orientation. Thus, ENDA \n     will ensure fair employment practices--not special rights--\n     for lesbians, gay men and bisexuals.\n       ENDA prohibits employers, employment agencies, and labor \n     unions from using an individual's sexual orientation as the \n     basis for employment decisions, such as hiring, firing, \n     promotion, or compensation.\n       Under ENDA, covered entities cannot subject an individual \n     to different standards or treatment based on that \n     individual's sexual orientation, or discriminate against an \n     individual based on the sexual orientation of those with whom \n     the individual associates.\n       The ``disparate impact'' claim available under Title VII of \n     the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII) is not available \n     under ENDA. Therefore, an employer is not required to justify \n     a neutral practice that may have a statistically disparate \n     impact based on sexual orientation.\n       ENDA exempts small businesses, as do existing civil rights \n     statutes, and does not apply to employers with fewer than \n     fifteen employees.\n       ENDA exempts religious organizations, including educational \n     institutions substantially controlled or supported by \n     religious organizations.\n       ENDA prohibits preferential treatment, including quotas, \n     based on sexual orientation.\n       ENDA does not require an employer to provide benefits for \n     the same-sex partner of an employee.\n       ENDA does not apply to the uniformed members of the armed \n     forces and thus does not affect the current law on lesbians \n     and gay men in the military.\n       ENDA provides for the same remedies (injunctive relief and \n     damages) as are permitted under Title VII and the Americans \n     with Disabilities Act (ADA).\n       ENDA applies to Congress, with the same remedies as \n     provided by the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995.\n       ENDA is not retroactive.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, from the beginning, civil rights has been \nthe great unfinished business of America--and it still is. In the past \nthirty years, this nation has made significant progress in removing the \nburden of bigotry from our land. This ongoing bipartisan peaceful \nrevolution of civil rights is one of the great hallmarks of our \ndemocracy and an enduring tribute to the remarkable resilience of the \nnation's founding principles.\n  Federal law now rightly prohibits job discrimination on the basis of \nrace, gender, religion, national origin, age, and disability. \nEstablishing these essential protections was not easy or quick. But \nthey have stood the test of time--and they have made us a better and a \nstronger nation.\n  Today, we seek to take the next step on this journey of justice by \nbanning discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n  The Employment Non-Discrimination Act is a significant step in that \ndirection. The Act parallels the protections against job discrimination \nalready provided under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. It prohibits \nthe discriminatory use an individual's sexual orientation as the basis \nfor decisions on hiring, firing, promotion, or compensation. This kind \nof prohibition on job discrimination is well-established in the civil \nrights laws and can be easily applied to sexual orientation.\n  Our bill is not about granting special rights--it is about righting \nsenseless wrongs. Its goal--plain and simple--is to eliminate job \ndiscrimination against fellow Americans. It does not allow for \ndisparate impact claims, it prohibits quotas, it does not require \ndomestic partners benefits, and it does not apply to the armed forces.\n  What it does require is basic fairness for gay men and lesbians, who \ndeserve to be judged in their job settings--like all other Americans--\nby their ability to do the work.\n  Today, job discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is too \noften a fact of life. From corporate suites to plant floors, qualified \nemployees live in fear of losing their livelihood for reasons that have \nnothing to do with their skills or their job performance. Yet in 42 \nstates a person can be fired--just for being gay.\n  This bill is not about statistics. It is about real Americans whose \nlives are being shattered and whose potential is being wasted. They are \nAmerican heroes who paid dearly for being true to themselves as they \npursued their professions. They performed well and were rewarded by \nbeing fired or brutally beaten. For them, ability didn't count--bigotry \ndid.\n  That kind of vicious discrimination happens every day, in communities \nacross America. The price of this prejudice, in both human and economic \nterms, is unacceptable. It is time for Congress to take a stand against \nit.\n  Job discrimination is not only un-American--it is counterproductive. \nIt excludes qualified individuals, lowers workforce productivity, and \nhurts us all. For the nation to compete effectively in a global \neconomy, we have to use all our available talent, and create a \nworkplace environment where everyone can excel.\n  This view is shared by many leaders in labor and management. They \nunderstand that ending discrimination based on sexual orientation is \ngood for workers, good for business, good for the economy, and good for \nthe country.\n  In the absence of federal action, many state and local governments \nhave acted responsibly to prohibit job discrimination based on sexual \norientation. Over a hundred mayors and governors, Republicans and \nDemocrats, have signed laws and issued orders protecting gay and \nlesbian employees. It is time for the federal government to make this \nprotection nationwide.\n  We know we cannot change attitudes overnight. But the great lesson of \nAmerican history is that changes in the law are an essential step in \nbreaking down barriers of bigotry, exposing prejudice for what it is, \nand building a strong and fair nation.\n  I am honored to join my colleagues in introducing the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act of 1995. This bipartisan legislation has the support \nof a broad bipartisan coalition that includes Coretta Scott King and \nBarry Goldwater--the conscience of civil rights and the conscience of \nconservatives.\n  Today's action brings us one step closer to the ideals of liberty. \nOur case is strong, our cause is just, and we intend to prevail.\n  I urge the Senate to support this essential effort.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMON:\n  S. 933. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to ensure that \naffordable, comprehensive, high quality health care coverage is \navailable [[Page S8503]] through the establishment of State-based \nprograms for children and for all uninsured pregnant women, and to \nfacilitate access to health services, strengthen public health \nfunctions, enhance health-related research, and support other \nactivities that improve the health of mothers and children, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n             HEALTHY MOTHERS, HEALTHY CHILDREN ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, we have a serious problem in health care. \nWe have almost 41 million now who do not have health care coverage.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, because he has now been designated to \nlead the effort for the Republican Party, and he and I last year had \nsome discussions about what kind of a practical compromise could be \nmade.\n  This is a compromise. I would love to have universal coverage for \neveryone. This is a practical compromise that says ``Let's protect \npregnant women and children 6 and under.'' It provides affordable, \ncomprehensive, quality private health care coverage for these groups.\n  The health of America's mothers and children is simply unacceptable. \nThe U.S. is No. 1 in wealth; we are 22d in infant mortality; we are \n18th in maternal mortality.\n  Mr. President, 24 percent of the children of our country live in \npoverty. No other Western industrialized nation has anything like these \nfigures. Many developing countries have much more coverage in terms of \nimmunization.\n  Mongolia is a country I have had a chance to visit. Very few \nAmericans visit Mongolia. It is really remote. Talk about developing \nnations that have problems, and yet they have a higher percentage of \ntheir children immunized than we do.\n  Mr. President, 22 percent of pregnant women do not have prenatal care \nin the first trimester. Uninsured children of the United States today, \n11.1 million, or 1 out of 6, and it is getting worse.\n  What is going to happen, whether the Clinton bill passes in terms of \nthe budget or the Republican budget passes--and obviously it is more \nlikely to be the Republican budget--what if the distinguished junior \nSenator from Utah were a hospital administrator and the amount you get \nfor coverage for Medicare and Medicaid goes down, what happens is you \nshift the burden to the nonMedicaid/nonMedicare patient and health \ninsurance premiums go up? As health insurance premiums go up, the \npercentage of employers providing insurance will go down.\n  The estimate is the year 2002, somewhere between 17 million and 20 \nmillion children will not be covered.\n  Incidentally, I would love to have a bill that covers all children, \ncovers 18 and under. But I know, realistically, that does not have a \nchance of passage.\n  But if we were to say let us at least cover pregnant women and \nchildren 6 and under, of the 1.1 million net increase in uninsured \npersons from 1992 to 1993, 84 percent, 922,000, were children. That is \nthe increase for children. That is the increase for adults. Obviously, \nwe are talking about the future of our Nation when we talk about the \nchildren.\n  Guiding principles of this act, the Healthy Mothers, Healthy Children \nAct? Coverage is independent of family income, employment, or health \nstatus. Everyone can get insurance.\n  This is a single-tier health care system for everyone.\n  Coverage is affordable for all families. We have some flexibility \nhere. Health services are comprehensive. And we ensure quality.\n  Eligibility? All children under the age of 7 and pregnant women; \nreplaces Medicaid for those groups. The States save money and the \nFederal Government would save money. And it calls for a report on \npossible future expansion.\n  Enrollment? There would be a national open enrollment month; plus, if \nyou go to the hospital, if you go to a physician, if you are not \nenrolled, you can enroll at that point. It is administratively simple. \nPlans must accept any eligible person, no preexisting conditions. And \nwithin the State, you would have competition among the insurers so we \nkeep the rates down.\n  Cost sharing is part of it. Our friends in Canada say they made a \ngreat mistake in not having all people contribute something. There is \noverutilization of the system when you do not have everyone \ncontributing something. So we have all families contributing. Families \nreceive premium subsidies ranging from 99 percent to 5 percent, \ndepending on income. And there is a cap because even a family of upper \nincome, if you have a devastating kind of an illness--we just heard \nSenator Chafee talk about someone who had a $3 million medical bill.\n  State flexibility and accountability--States and plans are given \nmaximum flexibility; States develop and administer the program; States \nand Federal Government and health plans are accountable for meeting \ncertain objectives.\n  There is a matching rate. The Federal matching rate is more generous \nthan Medicaid. The national average would be 80 percent. That means \nvery substantial savings for Illinois, for Utah, and for the other \nStates. The maximum matching rate would be 90 percent.\n  Comprehensive health care services, and there are some limits here, \nlet me just say, because--which I will outline in a minute. Preventive \nhealth, ambulatory care, laboratory services, prescription drugs, \nhospital, and in-home services, mental health services, dental and \nvision care--this is an example where there are limitations. We do not \ncover orthodontia services. We do not cover cosmetic surgery. There are \nobviously limitations that have to be here.\n  Long-term health care for children with disabilities and chronic \nhealth conditions, durable medical equipment, allied health services. \nHere is the way it would work. A family of four at 250 percent of \npoverty, that is $37,000 with one child under 7, the mother is \npregnant, the father works in a small business, with no dependent \nhealth care coverage, they would have the option to enroll into this \nplan. They would receive comprehensive coverage for the mother and the \nchild--not for the father, not for any children over the age of 6. With \ntheir income, they would receive a 40 percent premium subsidy. In other \nwords, they would have to pay 60 percent of the costs and they would \npay a maximum, during the course of the year, of $1,830 per year. Then, \nif their costs exceed that $1,830, the Federal Government would pay.\n  Here is a lower-income family, a family of four at 100 percent of \npoverty, $15,000 with two children under 7, a single parent who works \npart time and is covered by Medicaid. Both children are automatically \nenrolled. Everyone who is on Medicaid is automatically enrolled into \nthe Healthy Mothers, Healthy Children Act. The parent remains in \nMedicaid also, but we do not cover that parent. The Medicaid Program \ncontinues as is for that parent. They would have a choice of provider, \nget quality services, and coordination of care improves. They would \nreceive a 90-percent subsidy. In other words, if they have a problem, \nthey would have to pay 10 percent, even a poor family. So we do not \nhave overutilization. But they would pay a maximum of $80 per year. For \na family that is on the poverty level or below, that is still a sizable \namount of money but it is a restraining factor. But then the Federal \nGovernment picks the tab up after that.\n  An upper-income family, a family of four, at 500 percent of poverty, \n$75,000, with two children under 7, one parent works for a large \ncompany and has a health plan through the employer but no coverage for \npreexisting conditions. They have the option of staying with the \ncompany plan or enrolling in this plan. They receive complete coverage, \nincluding preexisting conditions. They receive only a 5 percent premium \nsubsidy. They would have to pay 95 percent. Obviously, at $75,000 a \nyear, they can afford that.\n  But they can pay a maximum of $6,000 per child for a year. So if you \nhave a child who is a diabetic, who has a serious problem--if you have \nthe kind of problem that Senator Chafee just mentioned, with somebody \nwho had a $3 million expenditure--that would be covered.\n  Financing sources? Medicaid funds, that we have right now. Here is \nthe tough one. We increase the tax on a package of cigarettes by $1.50. \nThere is no question that is going to be tough. Some of our colleagues \nare going to resist it strongly. I add, even if we were not providing \nany benefits for anybody, [[Page S8504]] we would have a healthier \nAmerica if we increase the tax on cigarettes $1.50 per pack. Young \npeople, particularly, like these pages--if I may pick on them here--\nthey are very price sensitive. That really would make a difference.\n  The State has to match. They will not have to match as much as they \nhave been. The States would save some money; some employers would save \nsome money. The family has to contribute. I think that is proper. There \nwould be savings from elimination and reduction of duplicative \nprograms.\n  In controlling costs, they are controlled by market competition. They \nhave to bid within the State. Premium subsidies are based on the \nlowest-priced plan. Obviously, quality has to be there. The funding \nincreases to States limited to the national rate of inflation.\n  If, for example, in Utah you have a plan and it increases the cost 20 \npercent while the national average is 5 percent, we say to Utah: Sorry, \nyou can only have a 5-percent increase. So there is that limitation.\n  Specific options for reducing program costs to ensure financial \nintegrity of the program.\n  Then, finally, a quote from this radical by the name of Herbert \nHoover. Herbert Hoover said:\n\n       The greatness of any nation, its freedom from poverty and \n     crime, its aspirations and ideals are the direct quotient of \n     the care of its children.\n       There should be no child in America that is not born and \n     does not live under sound conditions of health.\n\n  That is not the case today. We ought to make Herbert Hoover's dream \nfor America a reality.\n  So I have this bill. I think it is appropriate that the two Members \non the Republican side who are here right now are Senator Bennett and \nSenator Chafee. Senator Chafee provided excellent leadership last \nsession. We were not able to put the package together. Senator Bennett \nnow has that mantle on the Republican side.\n  We ought to do something. My proposal is let us provide coverage for \npregnant women and children 6 and under. That would be a great initial \nstep for the future of our country, and would protect 11 million \nchildren in our country today. I hope we take a look at this. At some \npoint, whether the Finance Committee approves this idea or not, I am \ngoing to offer it as an amendment on the floor so we get a vote on it.\n  My instinct is you have to be pretty hardhearted to vote against \ncoverage for pregnant women and children 6 and under. I think this \nmight be politically acceptable. I certainly know the American people \nwould favor it.\n  So I am introducing this bill today. I hope we will consider it. I \ncommend it to my colleagues who have done more work in the health care \nfield on the other side of the aisle than any others--Senator Chafee \nand Senator Bennett.\n  The purpose of this act is to ensure that affordable, comprehensive, \nhigh quality private health care coverage is available through State-\nbased programs for all children, initially for those under seven, and \nfor all uninsured pregnant women.\n  Mr. President, friends, yesterday was Flag Day. A day for all \nAmericans to reflect upon our country, where we've been and where we \nare heading. When I think about the future of this country, I realize \nthat the future is already here--in our children. What should be our \nnational direction? Let me share with you my vision for our children. I \nsuggest that we move towards a society where every child at least has \nadequate health care, receives a good education, lives in a caring \nfamily, and grows up in a safe community.\n\n\n           the poor health of america's mothers and children\n\n  How are we doing in fulfilling that vision? My friends, I have to \ntell you that we as a country are failing to properly care for our \nchildren. We are the wealthiest Nation in the world. But if our wealth \nwas measured by the health status of mothers and children, we fall well \nbehind the other major industrialized nations. Despite the highest per \ncapita spending on health care of any country, we currently rank 22d in \ninfant mortality and 18th in maternal mortality. Approximately 24 \npercent of all our children live in poverty. Many developing countries \nincluding Albania, Malawi, Mongolia, and Turkmenistan, have higher \nchildhood immunization rates than we do. In addition, approximately 22 \npercent of mothers did not receive prenatal care in the first \ntrimester. We can do better.\n\n\n     lack of health insurance among children and pregnant women is \n                               increasing\n\n  What about health care coverage? Unfortunately, the lack of insurance \namong children and pregnant women is unacceptable and is getting worse. \nA recent report by the Employee Benefit Research Institute shows that \nbetween 1992 and 1993, the number of uninsured people increased by 1.1 \nmillion or 17.8 percent to 40.9 million. The most alarming finding is \nthat children accounted for the largest proportion of the net increase \nin the number of the uninsured: Of the 1.1 million net increase between \n1992 and 1993, 922,500 or 84 percent, were children under 18.\n  In 1993, 11.1 million or one of every six children did not have \nhealth insurance or publicly-financed health care, up from 10.2 million \nor 15 percent in 1992. Despite recent expansions in Medicaid, 22 \npercent of all poor children were uninsured, and approximately 500,000 \npregnant women did not have health insurance in 1992.\n  In addition, if this Congress significantly reduces the Medicaid \nbudget as proposed under the current Senate and House budget \nresolutions, it is estimated that between five and seven million \nchildren in addition to the 12.6 million children already projected to \nbe uninsured under the current health care system, will not have health \ncoverage by the year 2002.\n  It is important to note that lack of health insurance is not solely a \nproblem of poverty. A large proportion of children in middle class \nfamilies are uninsured. For example, among children in families with \nincomes between 100 and 199 percent of poverty, 25 percent are \nuninsured. And among children in families with incomes between 200 and \n399 percent of poverty, 12 percent lack insurance.\n  My friends, we can do better. We must do better.\n            investing in the health of mothers and children\n\n  Given the state of the Federal deficit, some of you may question \nwhether the Government should be expanding health coverage for \nchildren. You may ask, ``Is this a proper role for government?''\n  I think the words of Abraham Lincoln are helpful. He said: ``The \nlegitimate object of government, is to do for a community of people, \nwhatever they need to have done, but cannot do, at all, or cannot, so \nwell do, for themselves--in their separate, and individual \ncapacities.'' Children do not have the capacity to ensure their health. \nYes, families have primary responsibility for ensuring that their \nchildren receive medically necessary care. The Government's role is to \nensure that health coverage is accessible and affordable for all. It is \nclear that the private sector has been unable to accomplish this goal.\n  There are more reasons why we should invest in our children's health. \nInvesting in health services for children substantially increases their \npotential to be productive members of society and averts more serious \nor more expensive conditions later in life. Similarly, ensuring that \nall pregnant women receive adequate prenatal care is cost saving to \nsociety. Ensuring coverage for children is also relatively inexpensive: \nIn 1993, the Medicaid program spent an average of $1,012 per child \ncompared to $8,220 per elderly adult.\n  Therefore, if the question to me is ``Can we afford to invest in the \nhealth of our children?,'' I reply by asking you, ``How can we afford \nnot to?''\n\n\n    guiding principles for the healthy mothers, healthy children act\n\n  In developing the Healthy Mothers, Healthy Children Act, I considered \n10 fundamental guiding principles that I believe should be the basis \nfor any national health care program for children and pregnant women. \nThey are:\n  First, coverage is independent of family income, employment, or \nhealth status;\n  Second, there is a single-tier health care system;\n  Third, coverage is affordable for all families;\n  Fourth, health services are comprehensive;\n  Fifth, ensuring quality is a primary goal; [[Page S8505]] \n  Sixth, everyone shares responsibility for mothers and children;\n  Seventh, health, not just health care, is emphasized;\n  Eighth, States and health plans have maximum flexibility and \naccountability;\n  Ninth, administrative costs and complexity are minimized; and\n  Tenth, program costs and fraud and abuse are controlled.\n\n\n          summary of the healthy mothers, healthy children act\n\n  Let me summarize the legislation I am introducing:\n  A national trust fund is established to support state-based programs \nthat involve private health plans. Participation is voluntary for \nstates, health plans, and families.\n  All children under age seven are eligible, regardless of family \nincome, employment, or insurance status. Pregnant women without \nemployer-based coverage are eligible. Medicaid-eligible children and \npregnant women are brought into the program to enhance their choice of \nproviders and to avert a multi-tier health care system. There is no \nimpact on the Medicaid program for nonparticipating States for \nnoneligible children seven years of age and older. Every 2 years, if \nsufficient funds are available and the public is supportive of the \nprogram, the Secretary will increase eligibility to older children on a \nnational basis. A State that has achieved universal coverage for \nchildren under seven in their State can extend coverage to older \nchildren before such children are eligible on a national basis.\n  In my legislation, children are enrolled during a national open \nenrollment period. States ensure that the enrollment process is simple \nand is not a barrier to care. Participating plans must accept any \neligible person who wishes to enroll and cannot deny coverage for pre-\nexisting conditions or any other reason.\n  All families contribute according to their ability to pay and receive \na premium subsidy, ranging from 99 percent to 5 percent, based on a \nsliding scale of income. There is a cap on annual family medical \nexpenses and a required $5 copayment for most services, except for \npreventive services.\n  The legislation is based on a management by objectives approach: \nStates and health plans are given maximum flexibility to determine how \nthey will meet program objectives, but are also fully accountable for \nresults. States develop and administer the program, and are evaluated \non an annual basis regarding their progress in achieving program \nobjectives.\n  State funds are matched by Federal funds at a rate based on the State \nper capita income that is more generous than the State's current \nMedicaid matching rate. The average Federal matching rate for all \nStates is 80 percent with a maximum matching rate of 90 percent.\n  Health services in the Healthy Mothers, Healthy Children Act are \nprovided by private health plans. States certify health plans and \nnegotiate premium rates with all interested plans. Participating plans \ncompete to deliver the highest quality care at the lowest price. There \nare a series of standards to prevent adverse selection and \ndiscrimination, ensure access to primary and specialty care, and ensure \nthat all participating plans compete on a ``level playing field.'' The \nprogram encourages innovation by existing plans and formation of new \nhealth plans.\n  All participating health plans must provide a comprehensive package \nof services.\n  The services will be specified by the Secretary and health \nprofessional groups. In general, services include: preventive health, \nambulatory care, laboratory services, prescription drugs, hospital and \nin-home services, mental health services, dental and vision care, long-\nterm health care for children with disabilities and chronic health \nconditions, durable medical equipment, and allied health services.\n  Because I believe that we must emphasize quality and accountability, \nthe bill includes a series of standards to ensure quality at the health \nplan, State, and Federal levels. National guidelines for quality \nassessment and improvement, utilization review, and other programs are \ndeveloped in consultation with private health plans and other \nnongovernmental organizations. All participating States must have a \nprogram for preventing, monitoring, and controlling fraud and abuse. As \na check and balance, nongovernment advisory council provides program \noversight and advises the Secretary on program administration and \nmodifications. A national maternal and child health information system \nand a national childhood immunization database are established to \nmonitor program quality and to increase childhood immunization rates.\n  How would employers be affected by this bill? Experience from the \nlast Congress demonstrates that the issue of the role of employers in \nhealth care reform is extremely difficult to resolve. I propose that \nemployers who drop coverage of employee-dependent children as a result \nof this Act must pay a temporary (5-year) annual maintenance of effort \nfee equivalent to 50 percent of health coverage costs for their \nemployees' children. To discourage dropping of coverage, families whose \ncoverage is dropped by their employers are not eligible for the program \nfor 6 months.\n  In my legislation, there is a strong emphasis on prevention. Up to 5 \npercent of trust monies can be used to fund activities by States and \nnonprofit organizations to improve the health of mothers and children. \nEligible activities include: supporting school-based clinics, \nincreasing the use of telecommunications and computer technology to \nincrease health care access, supporting biomedical and health-related \nresearch,\n enhancing core public health functions, and supporting health \npromotion and disease prevention activities. To minimize duplicative \nprograms, existing Federal and State maternal and child health programs \nare integrated and coordinated under the bill.\n\n  Controlling health care costs is crucial. Therefore, I have several \nmechanisms designed to control costs in the program. Costs are \ncontrolled by market competition and delivery of care primarily through \nmanagement care plans. Because premium subsidies for families are based \non the lowest priced plan in an area, plans have an incentive to \ncontrol costs. Because annual funding increases to the States are \nlimited to the average increase in medical care costs for children and \npregnant women on a national basis, states have an incentive to control \nprogram costs. There are also mechanisms in the bill that allow the \nSecretary to reduce program costs or request additional funds as \nnecessary to ensure the financial integrity of the program. I am asking \nthe Congressional Budget Office to score the bill.\n  How will we pay for the program? Funding sources for my legislation \ninclude shifting of Federal Medicaid funds for targeted groups, \nincrease in Federal excise taxes on cigarettes of $1.50/pack, state \nmatching funds, partial premiums from families, savings from \nelimination/reduction of duplicative Federal and State programs, and \ncharitable contributions.\n  Perhaps I can best summarize my legislation by illustrating how it \naffects different families.\n  First, let's take the example of a middle class family of four at 250 \npercent of poverty with one child under seven, a pregnant mother, and a \nfather who works in a small business that does not offer dependent \ncoverage. In this situation, the mother and child may be enrolled into \nthe Healthy Mothers, Healthy Children Program. They would receive \ncomprehensive health care coverage and 40 percent of the cost would be \nsubsidized. The family would pay a maximum of $1,830 per year for total \nmedical expenses for the mother and child.\n  Now let's look at a lower income, single parent family at 100 percent \nof poverty with two children under 7, the parent works part time and \nthe family is covered by Medicaid. In this case, the children would be \nautomatically enrolled into the Healthy Mother, Healthy Children \nprogram. Under this program, the choice of provider, quality of care, \nand coordination of care would improve. Ninety percent of the cost of \nthe coverage would be subsidized, and the family would pay a maximum of \n$80 per year for total medical expenses for both children.\n  Finally, what about higher income families? Let's consider a family \nat 500 percent of poverty with two children under 7, one parent works \nin a large company that provides family coverage but does not cover the \nchildren's preexisting conditions. This family may [[Page S8506]] elect \nto stay with their coverage or enroll their children into the Healthy \nMothers, healthy Children program. The children would receive \ncomprehensive health coverage including for pre-existing conditions. \nThe family would also receive a 5 percent premium subsidy, and pay a \nmaximum of $6,000 per year for total medical expenses for the mother \nand child.\n\n\n                 toward a healthy future for our nation\n\n  Mr. President, I am introducing this bill today as a starting point \nfor discussions towards a bipartisan bill to ensure that the most \nvulnerable members of our society have a chance to lead productive \nlives regardless of the circumstances of their birth. I urge all of my \ncolleagues who are concerned with our Nation's future to join me and \nfurther develop my proposal.\n  As Congress revisits health care reform this year, it is likely that \nwe will agree to at least provide for portability of coverage for \nemployed individuals and limit exclusions for pre-existing conditions. \nThese insurance reforms will improve access for some, but such reforms \nunfortunately fall far short of what we should and can do to expand \ncoverage for children and pregnant women. We can do better.\n  There is a health care crisis in this country. Should we accept a \nsociety where children in many neighborhoods have better access to drug \nand handguns than to doctors? A society that ensures health care for \nall prisoners but does not extend that guarantee to all children?\n  I recognize that health care reform is complex. We must move \ncautiously and incrementally. A sensible approach is to start by at \nleast ensuring that every child under seven and all uninsured pregnant \nwomen have affordable, comprehensive, high quality health care \ncoverage.\n  In accepting the Republican nomination for President in 1928, Herbert \nHoover said ``* * * the greatness of any nation, its freedom from \npoverty and crime, its aspirations and ideals are the direct quotient \nof the care of its children.'' And that ``* * * there should be no \nchild in America that is not born and does not live under sound \nconditions of health * * *''\n  Sixty-seven years later, we are the only developed Nation that does \nnot ensure that all children and pregnant women have health coverage as \npart of national maternal and child health policy. I know we can do \nbetter.\n  There is a saying that children will treat us as they have been \ntreated. I urge that we, our society, start treating them well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Healthy Mothers, Healthy Children Act of 1995\n\n       Purpose.--Amends the Public Health Service Act to ensure \n     that affordable, comprehensive, high quality health care \n     coverage is available through the establishment of state-\n     based programs for all children and for all uninsured \n     pregnant women; and to facilitate access to health services, \n     strengthen public health functions, enhance health-related \n     research, and support other activities that improve the \n     health of mothers and children.\n\n\n      Title 1--National Health Trust Fund for Mothers and Children\n\n                        Sec. 101. Establishment\n\n       Amends subchapter A of chapter 98 of Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986.\n\n\n                    Part II--Health Care Trust Funds\n\n     Sec. 9551. National Health Trust Fund for Mothers and Children\n\n       Establishes the National Health Trust Fund for Mothers and \n     Children to support state-based programs that ensure \n     affordable, comprehensive, high quality health care coverage \n     for all children, and for all uninsured pregnant women.\n       Transfers into the Trust Fund shall include: (1) revenue \n     from an increased tobacco tax, (2) shifting of funds from the \n     Medicaid program, (3) designation of overpayments on tax \n     returns and charitable contributions, and (4) savings from \n     duplication of services or functions of existing federal \n     programs.\n       Expenditures from the Trust Fund shall include: (1) funding \n     state-based programs to cover children and pregnant women; \n     (2) up to 5% of Trust Fund monies for awarding grants to \n     states, universities, and other nonprofit organizations for \n     activities to improve the health of mothers and children; and \n     (3) up to 0.2% of the annual revenue from the increased \n     tobacco tax to fund activities at the Office of Smoking and \n     Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent \n     the use of tobacco products by children and to coordinate \n     federal and state tobacco control initiatives.\n\n\n           Title 2--Healthy Mothers, Health Children Program\n\n            Sec. 201. Establishment and Allocation of Funds\n\n       Amends the Public Health Service Act (42 USC 201).\n\n\n         Title XXVII--Healthy Mothers, Healthy Children Program\n\n                  Sec. 2700. Establishment of Program\n\n       States that wish to participate in this program must \n     establish a state program to provide for or cover \n     comprehensive, high quality health services for eligible \n     individuals.\n\n\n                      Part A--Allocation of Funds\n\n         Sec. 2701. Allocation of Funds to Participating States\n\n       For the first two years, the amount of funds allocated to \n     each participating state will be determined by the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services, hereafter referred to as the \n     Secretary, based on three factors: the estimated number of \n     eligible children under seven years, the number of uninsured \n     pregnant women in the state, and a geographic adjustment \n     factor that is dependent on the average cost of health care \n     in the state. In subsequent years, to encourage enrollment of \n     all eligible persons, allocations to each state shall also be \n     based on the number of persons enrolled in the state program \n     in the previous year (the greater the number of eligible \n     persons enrolled in the previous year, the greater the funds \n     to the state).\n       After the first two years of funding to participating \n     states, the annual per capita allocation to the states shall \n     be increased each year up to an amount as determined by a \n     formula, calculated and established annually by the \n     Secretary. The formula shall be based on an index that \n     reflects the estimated national average rate of inflation or \n     health care expenditures for children and a similar index for \n     pregnant women. The Secretary may consider state-specific \n     waivers to this requirement on an annual basis if the state \n     can demonstrate that extenuating circumstances within the \n     state caused unavoidable increases in the cost of health \n     services to children and pregnant women, and that the state \n     has considered all reasonable strategies to control costs, \n     including, but not limited to, working with certified plans \n     to control costs, reducing administrative costs, \n     restructuring the state program, and minimizing fraud and \n     abuse.\n\n         Sec. 2702. State Trust Funds and Matching Contribution\n\n       Each state shall establish its own state trust fund (or in \n     the case of regional programs, a regional trust fund) in \n     which allocated federal funds and matching state funds shall \n     be deposited. States are allowed to deposit additional funds \n     into their trust fund at any time, but these state funds \n     shall not be subject to federal matching unless they are \n     deposited for the purposes specified in sections 2732, 2735, \n     and 2753. Monies from the state or federal trust funds may be \n     used only for activities directly related to the provision of \n     health services or other activities specifically covered by \n     this Act. Monies from the Trust Fund shall be transferred \n     directly to the state's trust fund on an annual basis and the \n     states shall deposit their matching funds\n      on an annual basis. The annual transfer of funds to the \n     states is contingent on a satisfactory annual evaluation \n     of the state's program and approval of the state's annual \n     plan by the Secretary as specified in section 2731.\n       Each participating state is required to match federal funds \n     to the state trust fund at a rate determined by a formula \n     developed by the Secretary that takes into account each \n     State's annual per capita income. The Secretary shall ensure \n     that: 1) each State's matching requirement is more generous \n     for the State than the State's matching requirement under the \n     Medicaid program at the time of the approval of the State \n     program, 2) the average State matching requirement for all \n     States is $2 for every $8 of Federal funds under the \n     allocation (average Federal matching rate for all States of \n     80%), and 3) no State shall have a matching requirement less \n     than $1 for every $9 of Federal funds under the allocation \n     (maximum Federal matching rate of 90%).\n       States may elect to accept a donation of funds, services, \n     or equipment toward a state program under this Act from \n     individuals and the private sector. However, the state shall \n     ensure that donations from individuals and for-profit \n     entities do not result in a conflict of interest in terms of \n     the state giving preference to the individual or entity \n     related to the award of contracts for a federal or state \n     health program.\n\n        Sec. 2703. Excess and Insufficient Funds in Trust Funds\n\n       In the case that monies exist in the Trust Fund that are \n     not transferred to participating states or awarded for \n     activities under this Act, such monies shall remain in the \n     Trust Fund and be available for use in subsequent years. In \n     the event that there exists a surplus of monies in a state \n     trust fund, such monies do not need to be transferred back to \n     the Trust Fund. However, such surplus state monies must be \n     used to expand eligibility to older children.\n       In the case that there exist insufficient monies in the \n     Trust Fund, or it is expected that insufficient funds will \n     exist, in any given year to fully transfer to the states the \n     amount ordinarily allocated by the Secretary, then the \n     National Advisory Council [[Page S8507]] for Mother's and \n     Children's Health as established under section 2742, and to \n     be referred to hereafter as the Council, shall recommend to \n     the Secretary, within 60 days of the Council's discovery, \n     strategies for correcting the discrepancy. The Council may \n     choose to recommend additional sources of revenue for the \n     Trust Fund, adjusting the state matching requirements under \n     section 2702, adjusting the range or nature of health \n     benefits provided under section 2721, adjusting the cost \n     sharing requirements for families under sections 2725-2728, \n     decreasing grants awarded under Part F, or other measures as \n     deemed appropriate by the Council. In consultation with the \n     Council, the Secretary shall submit implementing legislation \n     to Congress, within 60 days of the Council's recommendations, \n     for correcting the problem.\n       In the event that a state does not have sufficient monies \n     in the state trust fund to meet its obligations during a \n     given year, the state may petition the Secretary for \n     additional monies and the Secretary shall make a decision for \n     funding or a loan from the Trust Fund within 90 days of the \n     petition. However, the Secretary shall not transfer any \n     additional funds to the state if it is determined that the \n     state mismanaged funds, failed to prevent foreseeable fiscal \n     problems, or failed to control fraud and abuse.\n\n\n                   part b--eligibility and enrollment\n\n                         subpart i--eligibility\n\n                 Sec. 2710. Eligibility of Individuals\n\n       The following groups are eligible under this Act:\n       1. All children under seven years of age regardless of \n     income or insurance status, plus older children (up to 21 \n     years) as the Secretary or states expand eligibility as funds \n     are available.\n       2. All pregnant women, regardless of income, who are not \n     insured through their own employer or their family's \n     employer. However, pregnant women who have employer-based \n     coverage, but do not have coverage for pregnancy-related \n     health benefits, shall also be eligible. (The 1978 Pregnancy \n     Discrimination Act, which applies to employers who have 15 or \n     more employees and requires that any health insurance \n     provided to employees must cover expanses for pregnancy-\n     related conditions on the same basis as expenses for other \n     medical conditions, shall remain in effect.)\n       3. Legal residents or United States citizens only. States \n     may elect to extend eligibility to other residents, but no \n     federal funds shall be used to provide for such coverage.\n       An individual is not eligible under this program if he/she \n     was covered under an employer-based health plan and coverage \n     was dropped by the employer within the six-month-period prior \n     to the individual's application.\n\n                   Sec. 2711. Election of Eligibility\n\n       Children who are eligible for or receive health services \n     from the Department of Defense (military medicine or the \n     Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniform Services \n     (CHAMPUS)), the Indian Health Service, or the Department of \n     Veterans' Affairs, may continue to use such services or elect \n     to enroll in a certified plan under this Act.\n       All age-eligible children who are enrolled in Medicaid at \n     the time of full\n      implementation of this Act in their state of residence shall \n     be automatically enrolled in the respective state program \n     under this Act. In the case of an age-eligible child in \n     state-supervised care or a child who does not live with \n     his/her parents, the child shall be enrolled in a plan by \n     the state agency or guardian that has been awarded \n     temporary or permanent custody of the child unless there \n     is a specially designed health care system for such \n     children.\n       Pregnant women who are enrolled in Medicaid at the time of \n     full implementation of this Act in their state of residence \n     shall be automatically enrolled in the respective state \n     program under this Act. Pregnant women who are eligible for \n     health services under the Department of Defense, the Indian \n     Health Service, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and \n     other federally sponsored health plans are not eligible under \n     this Act.\n       In the case where an individual elects or is automatically \n     enrolled in a state program under this Act, all privileges \n     (such as choice of certified plans) and responsibilities \n     (such as payment of premiums or copayments) accorded to their \n     families or themselves under this Act shall apply.\n\n             Sec. 2712. Eligible Health Plans and Providers\n\n       All health plans and providers who are licensed and \n     credentialed, or otherwise legally authorized by their state, \n     to provide the health services specified under this Act, \n     under the respective rules and regulations of their state, \n     are potentially eligible to participate in the state program \n     if they meet all relevant state and federal requirements \n     under this Act.\n\n\n                         subpart ii--enrollment\n\n               Sec. 2715. Enrollment of Eligible Persons\n\n       Families with eligible children may enroll their children \n     during a national open enrollment period as defined by the \n     Secretary. Congress shall designate this one-month period as \n     National Healthy Mothers, Healthy Children's Month.\n       Participating states shall establish a system for enrolling \n     eligible children and pregnant women that minimizes barriers \n     to enrollment. The application process shall be reasonably \n     convenient, efficient, and available through a wide range of \n     methods. At a minimum, enrollment shall be available through \n     the mail, telephone (via a toll free number), and in person.\n       Enrollment materials shall be available from health care \n     providers, health provider organizations, hospitals, health \n     clinics, and at facilities that provide health and nutrition \n     services to children and women, and from local and state \n     government health offices. The Secretary, in consultation \n     with the states and representatives of certified plans, shall \n     develop the essential data elements for a standardized \n     enrollment form and it shall not be more than one page in \n     length. However, additional data collection instruments for \n     the purposes of program assessment and improvement may be \n     allowed as long as they are not a requirement for enrollment.\n       States shall process enrollment applications and give a \n     final decision on the application to the family and relevant \n     plan within 30 days of application submission. Approval of \n     the application shall be dependent on eligibility and income \n     verification and must occur within 30 days. Upon approval, \n     the state shall notify the family and relevant plan of the \n     family's expected annual premium contribution, the first \n     payment of which must be received by the plan or the state \n     within 30 days of application approval. Income verification \n     mechanisms and requirements shall be developed by the state. \n     States may elect to waive income verification requirements \n     for families who are already subject to similar requirements \n     under other state or federal programs or in other situations \n     deemed to be appropriate by the state.\n       Children may also be enrolled by their family at any time \n     outside of the open enrollment period, but a late enrollment \n     surcharge, to be determined by the state, will be imposed for \n     doing so. Families shall be given the opportunity to enroll \n     their newborn before or at the time of delivery (through the \n     hospital or birthing center). In order to avoid a surcharge, \n     newborns must be enrolled into the program prior to their \n     birth, within 30 days of their birthdate, or during the open \n     enrollment period.\n       Upon enrollment application, the family shall indicate \n     their choice of certified plan. The period of enrollment \n     shall not be less than one year for a child, and in the case \n     of a pregnant woman, the period shall be for the duration of \n     her pregnancy and eligible post-partum period. Families with \n     enrolled children in a certified plan may freely elect to \n     change plans during the next open enrollment period. Families \n     with enrolled children may also change plans outside of the \n     open enrollment period but the state shall impose a \n     substantial surcharge, to be determined by the state, for \n     doing so. However, there shall be no surcharge for families \n     with enrolled children or pregnant women if the change of \n     certified plans is due to the family moving to another area \n     not served by the current plan, in the case of a plan \n     withdrawing from a market area, or for other justifiable and \n     legitimate reasons as determined by the state.\n       A pregnant woman may enroll at any time after the diagnosis \n     of pregnancy is confirmed by a physician or qualified health \n     professional, or she may enroll in order to confirm her \n     pregnancy. Women who plan to become pregnant may also enroll \n     in the program, but covered benefits are available only after \n     the pregnancy is confirmed by a physician or qualified health \n     professional.\n       There shall be no waiting period for covered health \n     services; access to services shall\n      be effective immediately at the time of enrollment \n     application. All applicants shall be presumed to be \n     eligible until the state has determined otherwise. \n     Certified plans must provide covered health services to \n     any pregnant woman or child who has not been enrolled in a \n     certified plan under this Act and who reasonably appears \n     to be of an eligible age until such time that the state \n     has notified the plan that the applicant is not eligible \n     under this Act. In these cases, however, an application \n     for enrollment in the certified plan must be submitted by \n     the pregnant woman or on behalf of the child during the \n     initial point-of-service visit. The state shall impose a \n     surcharge, to be determined by the state, for enrollment \n     at the point-of-service. States may elect to directly \n     compensate plans for services delivered to persons who are \n     subsequently deemed ineligible, or allow plans to factor \n     in the estimated costs of providing services to such \n     persons in their rate negotiations with the state.\n       Waivers to any enrollment surcharge may be obtained from \n     the state if the applicant can demonstrate that he/she was \n     out-of-state during the open enrollment period or for other \n     unavoidable and legitimate reasons as determined by the \n     state, including, but not limited to, sudden loss of health \n     coverage due to unemployment, divorce, and financial crisis.\n\n                 Sec. 2716. Transition from Eligibility\n\n       When a child enrolled in a certified plan reaches the end \n     of an enrollment period on the day of or after attaining his/\n     her seventh birthday, he/she shall no longer be eligible for \n     premium subsidies under this Act. However, the child's health \n     plan in effect immediately prior to the individual attaining \n     his/her seventh birthday must continue to provide coverage \n     indefinitely, at the discretion of the child's family, for as \n     long as the full unsubsidized premium and copayments are \n     paid. There shall not be any exclusion of coverage for pre-\n     existing conditions. In addition, if the individual's family \n     elects to leave [[Page S8508]] the current health plan for \n     another plan or for an employer-provided plan that provides \n     similar benefits to employee dependents, the plan or employer \n     must accept the individual into the plan and is not allowed \n     to exclude coverage for any pre-existing conditions.\n       A woman shall no longer be eligible for health benefits \n     under the program two months after the end of pregnancy. If \n     the woman was covered under a health plan or employer-based \n     plan (without pregnancy-related benefits) immediately prior \n     to her enrollment in the state program, her previous plan and \n     employer must readmit her into the plan with no exclusions \n     for pre-existing or pregnancy-related conditions at a cost \n     comparable to what she had paid prior to her enrollment in \n     the state program.\n\n Sec. 202--Comprehensive Health Benefits and Cost Sharing Requirements\n\n       Amends title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act.\n\n\n  part c--comprehensive health benefits and cost sharing requirements\n\n                subpart 1--comprehensive health benefits\n\n            Sec. 2721. Comprehensive Health Benefits Package\n\n       Within 180 days of enactment of this Act, the Secretary, in \n     consultation with specific health care professional and \n     health-related organizations, shall develop a specific \n     comprehensive benefits package for children and pregnant \n     women based on the general groups of benefits outlined in \n     section 2722. The Secretary shall determine the organizations \n     that will be consulted in development of the benefits \n     package. At a minimum, the American Academy of Pediatrics, \n     the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs, and \n     the American Dental Association shall be consulted in \n     developing the benefits package for children, and the \n     American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the \n     Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs shall be \n     consulted in developing the benefits package for pregnant \n     women. To the extent possible, periodicity schedules for \n     preventive services shall be specified in the benefits \n     packages.\n       As a guide for development of the comprehensive benefits \n     packages for children and pregnant women, the Secretary shall \n     ensure that the specific comprehensive benefits packages are \n     consistent with the following ``floor'' and ``ceiling'': The \n     actuarial equivalent of the specific comprehensive benefits \n     packages must exceed the average actuarial equivalent of \n     health benefits offered to the children and pregnant women by \n     all states under the Medicaid program on the date of \n     enactment of this Act. In addition, the actuarial equivalent \n     of the specific comprehensive benefits packages shall not \n     exceed the actuarial equivalent of health benefits provided \n     to children and pregnant women in the specifics state(s) with \n     the most generous Medicaid benefits package for these \n     populations on the date of enactment of this Act.\n       In addition to developing the specific benefits package, \n     the Secretary, in consultation with selected health \n     professional organizations, shall determine which types of \n     services shall be subject to utilization copayments under \n     section 2727. At a minimum, preventive services shall be \n     exempt from any utilization copayment.\n       The benefits packages shall be reviewed and revised as \n     necessary every two years by the Secretary in conjunction \n     with relevant professional organizations and the Council. \n     Revision of the benefits packages shall be consistent with \n     changes in the age group of eligible children, standard \n     medical practice, new technologies, emerging health problems \n     and health care needs. The benefits package may be revised \n     immediately if children seven and older are eligible on a \n     national basis or in a state within two years of the \n     development of the initial benefits package.\n       Certified plans operating under this Act shall cover or \n     provide the comprehensive\n      health services as specified by the Secretary. Certified \n     plans may not offer any plan to eligible individuals under \n     this Act that does not cover or provide for all the \n     benefits specified by the Secretary. However, certified \n     plans may offer additional plans that have more generous \n     benefits than those specified by the Secretary.\n       In the case where the State has determined that no \n     participating health plan is able to provide for or cover all \n     the services in the comprehensive benefits package, or the \n     State has determined that certain services are most \n     effectively delivered by providers other than participating \n     health plans, then the State may elect to develop an \n     alternative mechanism, such as entering into agreements with \n     other providers, to provide for or cover specific services. \n     In all cases, however, the State must ensure that all \n     services covered under the comprehensive benefits package are \n     of high quality and are fully coordinated and integrated.\n\n            Sec. 2722. General Categories of Health Benefits\n\n       At a minimum, the following general categories of health \n     services shall be provided for or covered by certified plans \n     participating under this Act:\n       For children, from birth up to seventh birthday (or end of \n     enrollment period after birthday): preventive services \n     (including immunizations as recommended by the Advisory \n     Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), well baby/child \n     care, routine exams and check ups, recommended screening \n     tests, dental prophylaxis and exams, preventive health \n     counseling and health education); ambulatory care; laboratory \n     services; prescription drugs; inpatient care; vision, \n     audiology and aural rehabilitative, and other rehabilitative \n     services (including prescription eyeglasses, hearing aids); \n     durable medical equipment (including orthotics, prosthetics); \n     dental care (excludes orthodontic care); mental health and \n     substance abuse services; long-term and chronic care \n     services; special health care services for children with \n     disabilities or chronic health conditions; occupational, \n     physical, and respiratory therapy; speech-language pathology \n     services; investigational treatments (limited to \n     participation in a clinical investigation as part of an \n     approved research trial as defined by the Secretary. Services \n     or other items related to the trial normally paid for by \n     other funding sources need not be covered.)\n       For pregnant women, from diagnosis of pregnancy through 60 \n     days after the end of pregnancy: maternity care (including \n     prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care, including preventive \n     services such as routine exams and check ups, recommended \n     immunizations and screening tests, family planning services, \n     preventive health counseling including nutrition and health \n     education); ambulatory care; laboratory services; \n     prescription drugs; inpatient care; inpatient hospital and \n     nonhospital delivery services; mental health and substance \n     abuse services; any other pregnancy- or nonpregnancy-related \n     health condition; investigational treatments (limited to \n     participation in a clinical investigation as part of an \n     approved research trial as defined by the Secretary. Services \n     or other items related to the trial normally paid for by \n     other funding sources need not be covered.)\n       States may elect to extend comprehensive coverage or \n     coverage of selected health services to pregnant women beyond \n     the two-month postpartum period as long as federal funds are \n     not used for such additional coverage.\n       During the first two years of the implementation of this \n     Act, the items and services in the comprehensive benefits \n     package shall not be subject to any duration or scope \n     limitation. In addition, there shall be no cost sharing that \n     is not required or allowed under this Act. In subsequent \n     years, however, the Secretary, in consultation with selected \n     professional organizations and the Council, may implement \n     utilization or other limitations on covered benefits on a \n     national basis if such limitations are deemed to be \n     absolutely necessary for the solvency of the program and \n     Congress fails to authorize and appropriate additional monies \n     to the Trust Fund. However, alternatives to decrease program \n     costs such as minimizing administrative costs, increasing \n     cost sharing requirements, and increasing federal or state \n     funding shall be considered before limitations on covered \n     benefits are considered. In no case, however, shall \n     preventive services in the benefits package be subject to \n     such limitations.\n       Certified plans need not provide coverage for health \n     services that are greater in frequency than that specified in \n     recommended periodicity schedules, to the extent they are \n     specified under section 2721. However, certified plans must \n     cover any health services, within the general scope of the \n     comprehensive benefits package, that are medically necessary \n     or appropriate for children and pregnant women.\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed as limiting the \n     ability of states or certified plans\n      from providing additional health services not covered by \n     this Act, as long as federal funds are not used to pay for \n     such additional services. However, a certified plan may \n     provided for extra contractual services and items \n     determined to be appropriate by the plan and individual \n     (or family).\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed as limiting the \n     ability of individuals to obtain additional health services \n     that are not covered by the benefits package as long as \n     federal funds are not to pay for such services.\n       In the interest of ensuring that all children in the United \n     States receive comprehensive health services, employer-based, \n     self-insured, and other health plans not participating under \n     this Act, are encouraged to, but are not required to, provide \n     comprehensive benefits to children and pregnant women similar \n     to those specified in this Act.\n\n\n                 Subpart II--Cost Sharing Requirements\n\n                 Sec. 2725. Principles of Cost Sharing\n\n       All families who participate under this Act shall \n     contribute towards the cost of their own or their child's \n     health care. There shall be two types of costs for \n     individuals participating in a state program: a premium and \n     copayments. There are no deductibles allowed under this Act.\n       The following schedules for determining premium subsidies, \n     copayments, and maximum annual family contributions are \n     intended as a guide for participating states. States may \n     elect to develop their own specific cost sharing requirements \n     as long as they are consistent with the principles that all \n     participating families contribute towards the program and all \n     families receive premium subsidies, all families pay the same \n     copayment for services, and coverage is affordable for all \n     income levels. In addition, state cost sharing schedules \n     shall not result in any overall funding obligations to the \n     federal government in excess of that based on the cost \n     sharing schedules specified in this Act. In all participating \n     states, the annual family contribution under this Act shall \n     not be less than $10 per child and $20 per pregnant woman.\n       States may not require additional cost sharing for families \n     with annual incomes less [[Page S8509]] than 150% of the \n     federal poverty level that exceed the cost sharing amounts \n     specified in this title. States may elect to provide \n     additional premium or copayment subsidies for families whose \n     income is less than 400% of the federal poverty level if \n     there are sufficient funds in the state trust fund and no \n     additional federal monies are used for such additional \n     subsidies.\n       Participating states, in conjunction with certified plans, \n     shall monitor the impact of cost sharing requirements \n     (premiums and copayments) on low income families and ensure \n     that any cost sharing requirements are not significant \n     barriers that prevent such families from enrolling in a \n     certified plan or from obtaining medically appropriate care. \n     An analysis of the impact of cost sharing on low income \n     families shall be presented to the Secretary in the State's \n     annual quality assessment and improvement plan specified in \n     section 2741.\n\n                Sec. 2726. Premiums and Premium Subsidy\n\n       All families are responsible for paying their portion of \n     the premium to enroll into a certified plan. Premium payments \n     are payable directly to the plan or the state (as elected by \n     the state) on a monthly, quarterly, or other basis. Upon \n     final approval of an enrollment application, states shall \n     transfer funds directly to certified plans for the amount of \n     the premium subsidy calculated for each individual enrolled.\n       All families, regardless of income, shall receive a subsidy \n     on their premiums. The annual premium amount to be paid by \n     families to the plan is the annual per capita premium \n     negotiated by the state with each certified plan minus the \n     premium subsidy provided by the state. In no case shall the \n     annual premium subsidy be greater than the annual premium \n     negotiated with the plan.\n       In the case where multiple certified plans are available in \n     a geographic area or a certified plan offers additional \n     benefits package options at additional cost, the premium \n     subsidy shall be calculated based on the lowest priced \n     certified plan that is available in the area. Families shall \n     be responsible for any costs not covered by the premium \n     subsidy as a result of enrolling in higher priced plans. In \n     addition, any such premium amounts that result from the \n     selection of higher priced plans shall not be credited toward \n     the maximum annual family contribution amounts under section \n     2728.\n       In the case where the calculated annual premium \n     contribution for a family after applying the appropriate \n     premium subsidy exceeds the maximum annual family \n     contribution, the difference shall be paid by the state \n     directly to the plan.\n       In the case of a single eligible individual enrolled, the \n     percentage of the annual premium subsidy shall apply to the \n     individual annual premium, and, in the case of multiple \n     eligible individuals enrolled from one family, the premium \n     subsidy percentage shall be applied to the total annual \n     family premium.\n       The annual premium subsidy percentage is based on the \n     following scale of adjusted annual family gross income as a \n     percentage of federal poverty level (FPL):\n     Annual Income (% FPL) and Percentage Subsidy:\n     \n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/15/senate-section/article/S8493-4", "month": "06",

Mr. President, Lindsey Nelson, Tennessean, died this \nweek. He left behind a rich national heritage in broadcasting matched \nby very few in our history. During his life he was voted by his peers \ninto the Baseball Hall of Fame at Cooperstown; the Broadcasters' Hall \nof Fame; and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, OH.\n  He richly deserved this recognition for his remarkable achievements \nin sports broadcasting.\n  After working in administration at NBC in New York City for a number \nof years, Mr. Nelson took to the airwaves and started his career in \nbroadcasting. [[Page S8518]] \n  In 1962, he became the announcer for the just-formed New York Mets, \nwhere he remained for 17 years. Working with Ralph Kiner and Bob \nMurphy, he broadcast the Miracle Mets' World Series season of 1969.\n  Later he became the voice of the San Francisco Giants. He also \nbroadcast Notre Dame football during his distinguished career, along \nwith many of our Nation's great sporting events, including the Masters \nGolf Tournament and the Cotton Bowl.\n  But, as distinguished as Lindsey Nelson's career was at the national \nlevel, he was first and foremost a son of Tennessee. He graduated from \nthe University of Tennessee in 1941. While in UT he tutored English to \nfootball players, and planned to go into sports writing.\n  However, the Second World War intervened, and Mr. Nelson joined the \nArmy and saw battle duty in Italy, Germany, and France. He won seven \nbattle campaign stars and a Bronze Star.\n  After the war he did the play-by-play for the University of Tennessee \nfootball team. In 1949 he founded the Vol Network, and became the \nuniversity's sports information director in 1951. He also did \nannouncing for the school's basketball games and the Knoxville Smokies \nbaseball team.\n  The university's baseball stadium, one of the finest in the Nation, \nwas named after Lindsey Nelson.\n  For a number of years Mr. Nelson wrote a column for The Knoxville \nNews-Sentinel.\n  Lindsey Nelson loved Tennessee. He loved its State university in \nKnoxville. Wherever he served in his long and productive life, he was \nnever far from his beloved State and school.\n  Tennessee lost one of its most favored and distinguished sons with \nthe passing of Lindsey Nelson. As his old friend Ben Byrd, former \nsports editor of The Knoxville Journal, said on hearing of Mr. Nelson's \ndeath: ``A lot of people knew him, and without exception they all loved \nhim. He was just something special.''\n  I join all of Lindsey Nelson's many friends in Tennessee and around \nthe world in mourning his passing.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/15/senate-section/article/S8517-5", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n RETIREMENT OF RICHARD A. GIESSER, CHAIRMAN OF THE MASSACHUSETTS PORT \n                               AUTHORITY\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Richard A. \nGiesser as he leaves office after 10 years as chairman of the \nMassachusetts Port Authority.\n  Mr. President, I have known Dick Giesser as a friend and adviser for \nmany years. He is one of those all-too-rare individuals who balanced a \nsuccessful career in business with a deep commitment to public service. \nI have no doubt that his service to the public will continue long \nbeyond his tenure at the Massachusetts Port Authority.\n  Dick Giesser will be remembered, not only as the longest serving \nchairman of the port authority, but as a chairman who worked tirelessly \nto build MassPort's strength while providing safe and efficient service \nto the public. Under his leadership MassPort put the highest premium on \nsafety, building inclined runway safety ramps at Logan International \nAirport and developing state-of-the-art fire and rescue facilities.\n  Mr. Giesser was a key architect of the Logan Airport modernization \nplan, now known as Logan 2000, which will enable Logan Airport to meet \nthe ever-increasing demands of the regional integration into the global \neconomy.\n  In the meantime, Dick Giesser kept faith with communities surrounding \nLogan Airport, by pioneering noise rules that alleviate the impact of \nair traffic over East Boston and Winthrop. He was instrumental as well \nin providing MassPort's support to the adjoining city of Chelsea so \nthat Chelsea could climb back from bankruptcy and regain its fiscal \nstability.\n  Under Dick Giesser's guidance in MassPort became an important \npromoter of New England companies in international trade. During his \ntenure the authority hosted the successful Sail Boston exhibition, \nwhich showcased Boston Harbor and Massachusetts to the world, and with \nhis leadership MassPort launched a broad effort to restore marine-\nrelated industries to the harbor.\n  Dick Giesser is proud that the Massachusetts Port Authority achieved \na AA bond rating for the first time during his tenure. I am sure he is \neven prouder that he leaves MassPort a stronger agency, capable of \nmeeting the demands of the 21st century without turning its back on its \nneighbors.\n  Mr. President, once again, I salute Richard Giesser for his service \nto MassPort, to Massachusetts, and to New England. He exemplifies the \nimportance of public service, but beyond that, he is a friend, and I \njoin with my colleagues and the people of Massachusetts and New England \nin wishing him well.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/15/senate-section/article/S8518-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO THEO POZZY\n\n Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Theo \nJ. Pozzy, a close friend of mine who passed away on May 29 at the age \nof 94. Theo was a longtime community volunteer in my hometown of Bangor \nand was revered by everyone in the community.\n  In 1919, while still a teenager, Theo came to the United States from \nFrance. Even toward the end of his life, his voice contained the \ntelltale sign of a French accent. His love for his adopted country, \nhowever, could not have been stronger.\n  Theo served admirably in World War II under the command of Gen. \nDouglas MacArthur. After the war, he helped carry out the Marshall plan \nin Europe, working closely with Ambassador Averill Harriman. On the \nrecommendation of French President Charles DeGaulle, Theo was awarded \nthe French Medal of the Legion of Honor for his work abroad.\n  After returning from Europe, Theo dedicated much of his life to \nhelping others through volunteer work. Toward the end of his life, he \nwas very active with programs that helped individuals cope with drug \nand alcohol addictions, and he was the treasurer of the Eastern \nRegional Council on Alcohol and Drug Abuse in Bangor.\n  Some may ask what kept Theo going all these years. After all, many \npeople view their golden years as a time to relax, and they eagerly \nlook forward to enjoying themselves after a lifetime of working for and \nrewarding others.\n  I truly think that Theo Pozzy knew nothing other than giving of \nhimself. While most people slow down in retirement, Theo sped up. While \nmany people are anxious to celebrate themselves, Theo celebrated \nothers. While some ask for something in return for their charity, Theo \nwas much more comfortable as a benefactor than a beneficiary. These are \nsome of the things that made him great.\n  Mr. President, I and many others lost a very close friend last month. \nTheo Pozzy will truly be missed.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/15/senate-section/article/S8518-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8518-S8519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO CAPT. CAROLYN V. PREVATTE, U.S. NAVY\n\n Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the dedication, \npublic service, and patriotism of Capt. Carolyn V. Prevatte, U.S. Navy. \nShe has retired from active duty after more than 23 years of faithful \nservice to our Nation. Captain Prevatte's contribution in formulating \nand implementing personnel policy helped to sustain the highest quality \nnaval force we have had in the history of our armed services. Her \nstrong commitment to excellence will have a lasting effect on the \nvitality of our modern warfighters. Her outstanding service commands \nthe admiration and respect of her military colleagues and the Members \nof Congress.\n  Captain Prevatte is a native of the great State of Tennessee, but it \ncan truly be said that she has spent her entire life in the service of \nour country since she is the daughter of a retired Army master \nsergeant. Commissioned in August 1971 at the Women Officers School, \nNewport, RI, Captain Prevatte served her first tour in Training \nSquadron 28, Naval Air Station, Corpus Christi, TX. Her department head \ntour followed at Naval Station, Annapolis, MD. While in Annapolis, she \nserved as an assistant company officer on plebe detail for the U.S. \nNaval Academy class of 1980, the first to include women. In 1977, she \ncommenced duty as Senior Instructor, Naval Reserve Officer Training \nCorps Unit, at the Texas A University. From there, she served as \nOperations Officer, Office of Legislative Affairs and as a Joint \nManpower Planner, organization of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in \nWashington, DC. While on the joint staff, she was \n[[Page S8519]] assigned additional duty as a military social aide at \nthe White House. Captain Prevatte was Executive Officer of Navy \nRecruiting District, Houston, TX, from April 1984 to December 1985.\n  In January 1986, Captain Prevatte returned to Washington, DC for \nassignment as Head, Fleet Command Support Branch, Naval Military \nPersonnel Command [NMPC]. In April 1987, she became the Deputy \nDirector, Restricted Line/Staff Corps Officer Distribution and Special \nPlacement Division, NMPC, and in February 1989, she became \nAdministrative Assistant/Aide to the Commander, NMPC. Captain Prevatte \nserved as Commanding Officer, Personnel Support Activity, Pensacola, \nFL, from December 1989 through August 1991. She reported to the Bureau \nof Naval Personnel in September 1991, where she served as Director, \nAllocation Division (Pers-45) prior to her assignment to the staff of \nthe Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Manpower and Reserve Affairs) as \nExecutive Director, Standing Committee on Military and Civilian Women \nin the Department of the Navy in April 1993. Additionally, in June \n1993, she assumed duties as Staff Director (Manpower) in the Office of \nthe Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Manpower).\n  In March 1994, Captain Prevatte was selected to serve as Executive \nAssistant and Naval Aide to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy \n(Manpower and Reserve Affairs). She transferred to the Office of the \nSecretary of Defense in October 1994, where she served as Military \nAssistant to the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Force Management \nPolicy) until her retirement.\n  A proven Navy subspecialist in Manpower, Personnel and Training \nAnalysis, Captain Prevatte holds a bachelor of science degree from \nMiddle Tennessee State University and a master of science degree from \nTexas A University. She was named an Outstanding Young Woman of the \nYear in 1982. Her military awards include the Legion of Merit, Defense \nMeritorious Service Medal, Navy Meritorious Service Medal with three \ngold stars, Navy Commendation Medal, and Navy Achievement Medal with \none gold star.\n  Our Nation, the U.S. Navy, and her parents, Master Sergeant (Retired) \nand Mrs. James L. Prevatte, can truly be proud of the captain's many \naccomplishments. A woman of such extraordinary talent and integrity is \nrare indeed. While her honorable service will be genuinely missed in \nthe Department of Defense, it gives me great pleasure to recognize \nCaptain Prevatte before my colleagues and wish her all of our best \nwishes in her well deserved retirement.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/15/senate-section/article/S8518-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       HONORING NICHOLAS KALIKOW\n\n Mr. D'AMATO.

Peter is an accomplished \nbusinessman, philanthropist, and public servant. Recently, the Governor \nof New York appointed him to the board of the Port Authority of New \nYork and New Jersey.

Mr. President, on March 2, I was honored to \nparticipate in a press conference on a report to the National \nInstitutes of Health on Alternative Medicine: Expanding Medical \nHorizons. The report, which was prepared by an editorial committee \nchaired by Dr. Brian Berman and Dr. David Larson, represented more than \ntwo years of work by more than two hundred practitioners of alternative \nmedicine. It is my sincere hope that the NIH carefully read this \ndocument and use some of its recommendations as the basis for a long-\nterm strategic plan for the NIH's Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM).\n  For my colleagues' review, I am attaching the opening remarks of Dr. \nJames Gordon. Dr. Gordon, a Clinical Professor in the Departments of \nPsychiatry and Family Medicine at Georgetown Medical School as well as \nthe Chair of the Advisory Council of the Office of Alternative \nMedicine, presents an excellent overview of various kinds of \nalternative therapies now being used by America's health consumers \nalong with a cogent justification for the expansion of NIH-sponsored \ninvestigations into those therapies. I have also included the short \nintroductory remarks I made at the March 2 press conference. I ask that \nthese remarks be printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n  Alternative Medicine: A Report to The National Institutes of Health\n\n                  [Statement by James S. Gordon, M.D.]\n\n       Welcome to the press conference on the Report to the \n     National Institutes of Health on Alternative Medicine. This \n     is a very happy and fulfilling occasion for us. For the last \n     two and a half years the efforts and good will of more than \n     two hundred people have gone into creating this Report.\n       I'm James S. Gordon, M.D.--a psychiatrist who uses a number \n     of alternative therapeutic approaches in his medical \n     practice. I'm a Clinical Professor in the Departments of \n     Psychiatry and Family Medicine at Georgetown Medical School; \n     Director of the Center for Mind-Body Medicine here in \n     Washington; and Co-Chair of the section on Mind-Body \n     Interventions of this report. I'm going to be the moderator \n     for today as we discuss this Report and its origins, and \n     present it to the National Institutes of Health.\n       I'll begin with an overview of the field and set the \n     context for the development of this Report. I'll then \n     introduce Senator Tom Harkin. Afterwards Brian Berman, M.D. \n     and David Larson, M.D.--the Chair and Co-Chair of the \n     Editorial Board of this Report--will speak briefly\n      on the contents of this Report. Drs. Berman and Larson will \n     present the Report to Alan Trachtenberg, M.D., the Acting \n     Director of the Office of Alternative Medicine. Then, I'll \n     introduce the Editorial Board and several other \n     contributing writers, and we'll be available to discuss \n     the Report and answer your questions on it.\n       I'd like to begin by giving you some background on the \n     Report and putting it in the context of the field of \n     alternative medicine. Let's start with the name ``alternative \n     medicine.'' Alternative comes from the word ``other,'' and, \n     indeed, this is the other medicine or, more accurately, the \n     other medicines--the ones that are not taught in our medical \n     schools or ordinarily practiced in our hospitals or clinics.\n       This use of this term is of recent origin. Over the last \n     two decades, it is one of several that has been created to \n     apply to new developments in medicine. Others include \n     ``humanistic medicine;'' ``holistic'' or ``wholistic'' \n     medicine; ``mind-body medicine;'' and ``complementary \n     medicine.'' Holistic medicine refers to an understanding of \n     the whole person in his or her total environment and the wide \n     range of both conventional and alternative treatments that \n     comprise the whole or comprehensive approach. Humanistic \n     medicine emphasizes the interaction between those who come \n     for help and those who offer it. Mind-body medicine suggests \n     the importance of the two-way connection between mind and \n     body and their integrity. Complementary medicine--the term of \n     choice in Europe--implies a mutually enhancing effect between \n     conventional medicine and other approaches. [[Page S8520]] \n       Alternative medicine does indeed emphasize other practices. \n     It calls attention deliberately to what is not, or not yet, \n     conventional. It is a way for medicine and our society to \n     observe and evaluate what is new or unfamiliar--to hold it at \n     arm's length while deciding whether and how it may be used \n     and integrated into our larger practice.\n       The emphasis on alternative medicine emerges now as part of \n     the ongoing development of our medical system and practice. \n     Thirty-five years ago the great microbiologist Rene Dubos \n     suggested that we had begun to approach the limits of modern \n     biomedicine, the surgical and pharmacological treatment of \n     discrete disease entities. We still appreciate the great \n     power of this approach in curing infections and treating \n     acute, life-threatening illnesses, but we have also begun to \n     see how difficult it is to use these methods to treat a \n     variety of kinds of chronic illnesses. And we have begun to \n     become painfully aware of the side effects and overuse of \n     once promising therapies. During these last two decades both \n     patients and physicians have also become increasingly \n     impatient with the kind of care that they have been receiving \n     and offering. They feel a lack of participation and \n     partnership. According to polls taken by Gallup and the \n     A.M.A. itself, there is a sense of alienation on both sides.\n       During this time, too, the world has become smaller and \n     more intimate. We've become increasingly aware of the healing \n     traditions of other cultures, and of approaches that have \n     been ignored, neglected, marginalized, or scorned within our \n     own culture. Finally, all of us have become acutely sensitive \n     to the enormous financial\n      drain that health care and our medical system are putting on \n     our government and all of us. Health care required four \n     percent of the Gross National Product when Dubos was \n     writing in the 1950's. Now, it is almost fifteen percent. \n     These forces have set the stage for a new approach and new \n     techniques that have propelled alternative medicine to the \n     front of many of our minds, and to a significant place in \n     the on-going health care debate.\n       With an appreciation and experience of the potential of \n     some of these new therapies, a sensitivity to the wisdom of \n     traditional approaches, and a weather eye on financial \n     realities, Senator Tom Harkin drew up legislation to create \n     the Office of Alternative Medicine three and a half years \n     ago. He and the Health Appropriations Sub-Committee gave that \n     Office a mandate to study these alternative approaches; to \n     find out which ones were most useful; and to make the \n     information widely available.\n       This Report is one of the Office's first and most \n     significant projects. It had its genesis in Chantilly, \n     Virginia in 1992, when more than two hundred people--among \n     them some of the most experienced and best known researchers \n     and clinicians--gathered to begin to assess the state of the \n     art. This effort was requested and supported, then and now, \n     by the Office of the Director of NIH and by the Principal \n     Deputy Directors--initially, Dr. Jay Moskowitz and, more \n     recently, Dr. Ruth Kirschstein.\n       At that conference and since, participants divided into \n     groups to work on the thirteen major sections that are \n     covered in this Report. Later, as members of the smaller \n     Editorial Board (most of whom are here today), they began to \n     shape its overall structure, content and tone. Each of these \n     sections are worked on by its own writers and editors. Then, \n     the Editorial Board re-evaluated, discussed, debated, and re-\n     wrote each section.\n       Each section has its different emphasis and tone. The one \n     on mind-body medicine highlights the range of what we know \n     about the mind's capacity to affect the body--the power of \n     hypnosis, meditation, biofeedback and visual imagery. It \n     provides thoroughgoing documentation of their efficacy and \n     suggests now easily these approaches can and should be \n     integrated into every aspect of medical care. The section on \n     bioelectro-magnetism emphasizes the theoretical promise of \n     this field and its possible role in explaining the underlying \n     mechanisms of many alternative approaches, including \n     acupuncture, homeopathy and laying on of hands. The section \n     on pharmacological and biological therapeutics, by contrast, \n     records the vital importance of studying therapies that are \n     already widely used for such life-threatening conditions as \n     cancer and AIDS--but have never received any critical \n     attention.\n       In virtually all of the sections there are also common \n     themes. To begin with we see the sometimes surprising number \n     of authoritative articles. There are literally thousands of \n     articles in peer reviewed journals on biofeedback, hypnosis \n     and visualization. And there are also hundreds on herbal \n     therapies, acupuncture, and homeopathy. We see as we read \n     through the Report how deep the historical use of these \n     practices is. Foods like ginger, onions and\n      garlic which we are just beginning to validate \n     scientifically have been used therapeutically for \n     thousands of years. The same is true of spinal \n     manipulation, herbal and mind-body therapies. We learn \n     also how widely used these approaches are. In 1990, a \n     third of the people in this country were using alternative \n     medicines. It is likely that the number now is far higher. \n     Worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, 80% \n     of all people use these ``alternatives'' as their primary \n     care.\n       We see, too, how cost effective these approaches can be. To \n     cite several examples: (1) A study done at the Harvard \n     Community Health Plan showed that six weeks of behavioral \n     medicine teaching, including meditation, enabled patients to \n     record savings of $171.00 each in the six months following \n     the treatment. (2) A program of diet, mind-body therapies, \n     yoga, exercise and group support, designed by Dean Ornish and \n     his colleagues of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute, \n     has been shown to reverse coronary heart disease in patients \n     who would otherwise have had coronary by-pass surgery. This \n     program costs approximately $5,000 for its one year--in \n     contrast to the $40,000-$60,000 for each by-pass surgery. (3) \n     At the University of Miami, Tiffany Field's use of several \n     minutes of gentle massage several times a day to treat low \n     birth weight babies not only helped the babies to gain 47 \n     percent more weight per day in the hospital, but enabled them \n     to leave the hospital six days sooner, at a savings of $3,000 \n     per child.\n       Taken as a whole then, this Report is a unique compilation \n     of authoritative information. It is also a remarkable \n     bibliographical resource for those who wish to learn more--to \n     prepare them to undertake research, select treatments or \n     participate in their own care. Finally, it is a guidebook for \n     the Office of Alternative Medicine--a map to help the Office \n     to develop new directions in research and to undertake \n     specific studies. It suggests new research methodologies and \n     new programs of research training which need to be developed. \n     It offers suggestions for new ways to collect and disseminate \n     information; improve peer review; and enlarge and expand \n     collaboration between conventional and non-conventional \n     researchers and practitioners. It explores possible new links \n     between the Office of Alternative Medicine and the rest of \n     NIH, and between the OAM and the general public.\n       In the Report, there are a number of creative tensions--\n     tensions that reflect the diversity of the medical enterprise \n     and our own experience as people trained in conventional \n     science and medicine, and interested in alternative medicine. \n     I want to acknowledge these tensions because they give life \n     and excitement to the Report.\n       Among them are tensions between conventional practitioners \n     and researchers who have been outside the mainstream; between \n     those applying conventional research methodologies to\n      unconventional therapeutic methods and those searching for \n     new, perhaps more appropriate, methodologies; between \n     respect for the integrity of traditional healing systems \n     and a need to study their effectiveness in a way that \n     conventionally trained scientists and clinicians can \n     appreciate; between the requirements of scientific \n     precision and the need for easy, popular accessibility; \n     between the hope for encyclopedic inclusion and the need \n     for careful selection; between the demands of activists \n     desperate for answers to desperate public health \n     problems--among them AIDS, cancer, cardiovascular \n     disease--and the requirements of rigorous, definitive \n     research; between the huge number of tasks to be \n     accomplished and the, so far, very small amounts of money \n     ($5 million dollars out of NIH's total budget of $10 \n     billion dollars) available to these tasks.\n       I hope and believe we are on our way to resolving these \n     tensions in favor of our own greater understanding and the \n     greater understanding and progress of the field as a whole.\n       This Report is a compilation of much of the best that is \n     known and thought about alternative medicine. It is \n     comprehensive and authoritative. It has many and varied \n     recommendations for future directions for NIH. And, there is \n     more as well.\n       All of us who have worked on it see this Report as an arrow \n     towards the future as well as a progress report and a summing \n     up. In the end, alternative medicine becomes most important \n     as it helps, in the words of the subtitle of our Report, ``To \n     expand medical horizons.'' Our goal is then to create a more \n     comprehensive, responsive, humane and cost-effective system \n     and practice of medicine and health care.\n       We are concerned with establishing a way of understanding \n     and practicing which balances the power of definitive \n     treatment with the authority of self care; which is both open \n     to and critical about new approaches; which respects and \n     enjoys the interplay of modern science and perennial wisdom.\n       Finally, then, this is a Report which goes beyond the \n     opposition of either/or, conventional or alternative. It is a \n     Report based on the concept of both/and, it is, we hope, a \n     step on the way to a healing synthesis and a new synthesis of \n     health care and medical practice--one which includes and is \n     greater and more valuable than either its conventional or \n     alternative halves.\n   Statement of Senator Harkin Alternative Medicine Press Conference\n\n       I want to commend Dr. Brian Berman and Dr. David Larson for \n     their leadership in preparation of this report, Alternative \n     Medicine: Expanding Medical Horizons, as well as the other \n     members of the Editorial Committee present here today.\n       In October 1991, Congress provided $2 million to establish \n     the Office of Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes \n     of Health for two main reasons. First, to seriously \n     investigate the potential of alternative medical practices; \n     and second, to break down the bias in medical research \n     against review of worthy treatments not now in the mainstream \n     of conventional medicine.\n       Before this Office's creation, the NIH and the medical \n     establishment failed to accept the important of alternative \n     medicine. But the American people had already voted their \n     [[Page S8521]] support for alternative therapies with their \n     pocketbooks.\n       In 1990 alone, the New England Journal of Medicine found \n     that Americans spent nearly $14 billion on alternative \n     therapies, and made more visits to alternative practitioners \n     than they did to primary care doctors.\n       American consumers are turning to these therapies because \n     they're a less expensive and more prevention-based \n     alternative to conventional treatments. And they're investing \n     their dollars and their hopes without hard scientific \n     evidence of the effectiveness--or ineffectiveness--of these \n     alternative treatments. The American people have a right to \n     know whether these alternative treatments are effective! \n     That's why the Office of Alternative Medicine was created in \n     the first place * * * to begin evaluating the efficacy, \n     safety and potential cost effectiveness of alternative \n     medical therapies. This is a health issue and a consumer \n     issue, and the American people deserve nothing less!\n       Admittedly, since its creation three years ago, the Office \n     has gotten off to a slow start. That's due to the continued \n     skepticism of the medical establishment as well as the \n     office's own mismanagement and lack of planning. It's for \n     this reason that I'm so encouraged by the document being \n     presented today to the NIH. This report, which represents \n     more than 2 years of work by more than 200 practitioners and \n     researchers of alternative medicine, should serve as the \n     basis for a long-term strategic plan for the Office of \n     Alternative Medicine.\n       It's my sincere hope that the NIH will carefully read this \n     document and use some of its recommendations to put the \n     office back on track, to begin operating efficiently and \n     expand its investigations of alternative therapies.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/15/senate-section/article/S8519-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON SMALL BUSINESS\n\n Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \njust concluded 1995 White House Conference on Small Business, and \nespecially to 18 of my fellow Arkansas who traveled a great distance at \npersonal expense to participate in this conference. These delegates \ntook time away from their work and their families to represent the \nArkansas business community and are to be commended for their \ndedication and sacrifice. The Arkansas business owners who attended the \nconference as national delegates and their respective businesses are as \nfollows:\n  J. Baker, Baker Car and Truck Rental, Inc., Little Rock; Bob Boyd, \nBoyd Music and Pro Sound, Inc., Little Rock; Greg Brown, Union \nBancshares of Benton, Inc., Benton; Mel Coleman, North Arkansas \nElectric Cooperative, Salem; Dexter Doyne, Doyne Construction Company, \nInc., North Little Rock; Bill Ferren, B-B-F Oil Company, Inc., Pine \nBluff; Michael Jackson, Jackson Development Group, Brinkley; Thomas \nJacoway, Artran, Inc., Springdale; Phyllis Kinnaman, P.K.

In 1993, small business \nin this country was responsible for 50 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct, while employing 54 percent of the American work force. This \nconference was attended by approximately 2,500 delegates from around \nthe country to discuss the most pressing issues facing small \nbusinesses.\n  Although political circumstances have changed, the President and \nCongress still deeply care about the views and interests of small \nbusiness owners. Recently, President Clinton signed into law a \nreauthorization of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1992, a law that was \noriginally proposed by the first White House Conference on Small \nBusiness during the Carter administration in 1980.\n  Recognizing the important role that the Small Business Administration \nplays in promoting the entrepreneurial spirit, Congress has said no to \nproposals to abolish that agency. I am proud to say that last year SBA \nwas directly responsible for stimulating $10.6 billion in small \nbusiness growth while spending only $232 million of American taxpayer \nmoney--an amount, I might add, less than the taxes paid by three \ncompanies that started with SBA loans--Intel, Apple, and Federal \nExpress.\n  It's time to listen again to the backbone of our country. In the \nweeks to come, the White House Conference delegates will be sending \ntheir suggestions for the future of small business to both the \nPresident and the Congress. On behalf of the 18 delegates from my home \nstate, I urge this Congress to take a close look at their suggestions \nand debate the legislative agenda set forth by the 1995 White House \nConference on Small Business.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/15/senate-section/article/S8521-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                SEVENTH ANNUAL CHINESE HERITAGE FESTIVAL\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, our country is a remarkable \nmosaic--a mixture of races, languages, ethnicities and religions--that \ngrows increasingly diverse with each passing year. Nowhere is this \nincredible diversity more evident than in the State of New Jersey. In \nNew Jersey, schoolchildren come from families that speak 120 different \nlanguages at home. These different languages are used in over 1.4 \nmillion homes in my State. I have always believed that one of the \nUnited States greatest strengths is the diversity of the people that \nmake up its citizenry and I am proud to call the attention of my \ncolleagues to an event in New Jersey that celebrates the importance of \nthe diversity that is a part of America's collective heritage.\n  On June 4, 1995, the Garden State Arts Center in Holmdel, New Jersey \nbegan its 1995 Spring Heritage Festival Series. This Heritage Festival \nprogram salutes many of the different ethnic communities that \ncontribute so greatly to New Jersey's diverse makeup. Highlighting old \ncountry customs and culture, the festival programs are an opportunity \nto express pride in the ethnic backgrounds that are a part of our \ncollective heritage. Additionally, the Spring Heritage Festivals will \ncontribute proceeds from their programs to the Garden State Arts \nCenter's Cultural Center Fund which presents theater productions free-\nof-charge to New Jersey's schoolchildren, seniors and other deserving \nresidents. The Heritage Festival thus not only pays tribute to the \ncultural influences from our past, it also makes a significant \ncontribution to our present day cultural activities.\n  On Saturday, June 17, 1995, the Heritage Festival Series will \ncelebrate the 7th Annual Chinese Heritage Festival. Cochaired by \nMargaret Ko Ma of Murray Hill and Chia Wang Whitehouse of Freehold, \nthis year's event promises to be a grand celebration alive with \ncolorful costumes, traditional foods, ethnic arts and crafts and \ntalented entertainers of Chinese descent. The day-long event will \nfeature a martial arts display by the Shaolin Hung School, as well as \ntraditional flower, lion and drum dancers and music from China will \nhighlight the artistic program. Mall activities will also include an \narts and crafts exhibit, vendors selling Chinese food and a fine arts \nexhibit will feature both traditional and modern Chinese art.\n  On behalf of all New Jerseyans of Chinese descent, I offer my \ncongratulations on the 7th anniversary of the Chinese Heritage \nFestival.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/15/senate-section/article/S8521-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8521-S8522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     SKI AREA FEE STRUCTURE REFORM\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to ask my colleagues to take \na close look at a bill which I cosponsored with Senator Murkowski and \nothers. The ski area fee system for Forest Service special use permits \nneeds reform and S. 907 is a good way to get this done.\n  Skiing is one of the best uses that we have today on our national \nforests. The ski industry brings millions of people to the mountains to \nenjoy fresh air, scenery, and the mountain environment. Few other \nnational forest activities are able to host such intense public use \nwith relatively minimal impact.\n  In fact, many resorts have taken extra steps to protect and enhance \nthe environmental resources with trail and resort designs that include \nmodifications for wildlife use, special sensitivities to wetlands, base \nvillages that minimize the need for cars, and plantings that provide \nforage for birds. Over the years ski resorts have become adept at \nreducing water pollution, erosion, and snowmaking. There are still \n[[Page S8522]] problems to resolve, but I am confident that citizens, \ncommunities, and the ski industry will find solutions to each \nchallenge.\n  In addition to providing access to National Forests on a mass scale, \nthe ski industry provides critical economic benefits. From the first \nAmerican rope tow installed in Woodstock, VT, in 1934, to the high-\nspeed quads on Sugarbush 60 years later, the ski industry has brought \neconomic opportunity to Vermont towns. The 1993-1994 ski season in \nVermont generated $230 million from 4.3 million visitor days according \nto the Vermont Ski Area Association. These revenues translate into $17 \nmillion in tax revenue for Vermont towns. The ski industry represents a \nsustainable use of national forests and a good neighbor. They deserve \nour support.\n  The Murkowski-Leahy bill refines the fee structure for ski areas on \nnational forests. The Independent Offices Appropriations Act of 1952 \nand the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 both mandate that \nthe Federal Government collect fair market value for the use of Federal \nproperty. In 1965, the Forest Service developed the graduated rate-fee \nsystem [GRFS] which is still in use today. GRFS is based on the ski \narea's investment in fixed assets and sales generated in nine business \ncategories. The ski industry and the Forest Service together agree that \nthe system is complex, outdated, inefficient, and in need of reform.\n  I wish we could say that the reform we propose is based on a \ncomprehensive assessment of fair market value as current law, but such \nan assessment simply does not exist. Neither the General Accounting \nOffice nor the Forest Service--or any other organization--has been able \nto offer assistance in developing a widely accepted assessment of fair \nmarket value. The revenue collected today is the closest approximation \nof fair market value, and therefore we have used the total revenue \ncollected as the best available assessment. This bill solves the \nproblems that we know how to solve, and does not preclude adjustments \nfor issues that may benefit from further study.\n  The solution proposed in the Murkowski-Leahy bill is a simple \nprogressive rate structure based on gross sales. Since it operates much \nlike an annual tax form, it is easy to prepare, relatively easy to \naudit, and less prone to litigation. The fees are linked to the economy \nso ski areas can make regular and fair payments that reflect their \nability to pay. The bill also has a provision to adjust the rate \nstructure for inflation and it would be easy to amend if the public \nwants to adjust the ski-fee revenues up or down based on further \ninformation on fair market value.\n  This bill is a reasonable, balanced, and progressive bill that offers \nclear reform for the ski area fee system. This is basically the same \nbill that the Senate passed in 1992 with strong bipartisan support. I \nhope we can pass the S. 907 this year with equally strong \nsupport.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/15/senate-section/article/S8521-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         SALUTING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ZYGO CORPORATION\n Mr. DODD.

DOMINIC ACADEMY\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a group of \nstudents whose accomplishments are as varied as they are praiseworthy. \nOn Thursday June 15, 1995, the young women of Mount St. Dominic Academy \nin Caldwell, NJ, will celebrate their championship season in three \nsports at their annual athletic awards dinner. With championship \nseasons in basketball, volleyball, and softball, the students of the \nMount captured the attention of the Bergen Record as the ``sports story \nof the year.'' In addition to these championship titles, the school won \nthe New Jersey Interscholastic Athletic Association's C. Clarke Folsom \nSportsmanship Award for the 1994 basketball tournament. This award is \nmade annually to the school whose players, coaches, cheerleaders, and \nfans demonstrate the ideals of good sportsmanship throughout the \ntournament. The Mount has made a name for itself not only through \noutstanding athletic ability; but through the commitment of the school \nto a strong academic and extracurricular program with an emphasis on \ncommunity service.\n  Students at the Mount participate in the Siena program of community \nservice as part of their curriculum by donating their time to service \nprojects, in addition to their regular studies and extracurricular \nactivities. Although their prizewinning athletics certainly merit \nattention, I offer additional praise to these students for their \nschool's unique commitment to community service. The Siena program \nteaches that the donation of time and energy in service to others is as \nmeaningful as winning a championship season or scoring well on the \nSAT's. I can only admire a program which views giving back to the \ncommunity as a basic part of education. In the words of the Mount's own \nSister Fran Sullivan, these promising young women ``use their own \ngiftedness to better the world.''\n  Mr. President, once again I offer my congratulations to these \ntalented and generous young women, who are truly athletes, scholars and \npublic servants.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/15/senate-section/article/S8522-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8522-S8523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              GENERAL MOTOR'S 1997 FLEXIBLE FUEL VEHICLES\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to offer my congratulations \nto General Motors for making what I believe is a good move for our \nenvironment, for our economy, and for their business. All of GM's 1997 \nfour cylinder light-duty pick-up trucks will have the capability to run \non ethanol as well as gasoline. This represents a significant milestone \nin the acceptance of ethanol as a widely-used fuel for America. Ethanol \nhelps clean the air and is a renewable domestic energy resource. I ask \nto have printed in the Record the May 11, 1995, news release from GM \nconcerning this development.\n\n                      General Motors News Release\n\n       Des Moines, Iowa--General Motors today announced the \n     largest single-model alternative fuel vehicle production \n     program of any manufacturer. All of GM's 1997 four-cylinder \n     light-duty pickup trucks will be flexible fueled to permit \n     them to run on gasoline, ethanol, or a combination of the \n     two.\n       Speaking at a meeting of the Governors' Ethanol Coalition, \n     GM Vice President Dennis R. Minano said GM will use the 1997 \n     Chevrolet S-series and GMC Sonoma pickups as flexible fuel \n     vehicles because they will meet the broad spectrum of needs \n     of many fleet and retail buyers.\n       ``The inclusion of ethanol capability in this program is a \n     win/win for the environment and the customer,'' Minano said. \n     ``As a near-term alternative fuel, ethanol provides many \n     positives. Ethanol is a renewable domestic energy source, \n     provides more range than some other alternative fuels, and is \n     good for the environment.''\n       ``We are making this announcement today,'' said Minano, \n     ``in order to provide time for us all to develop an \n     infrastructure and prepare for the volume of ethanol capable \n     trucks Chevrolet and GMC Truck will [[Page S8523]] begin \n     selling in 1997 in the U.S. and Canada.'' Minano said the \n     ethanol industry needs to continue to work with the \n     automobile manufactures to finalize fuel specifications, \n     commonize fuel delivery systems, and develop a refueling \n     infrastructure.\n       Minano also said, ``We are particularly pleased to have the \n     opportunity to make this announcement at the Governors' \n     Ethanol Coalition meeting. I know the governors are committed \n     to working with us and with the private infrastructure \n     business to make this program a success. This program is \n     really a partnership in the truest sense of the word.''\n       General Motors has been a leader in developing alternative \n     fuel vehicle technologies for more than 25 years. Our \n     strategy has been, and will continue to be, fuel neutral. \n     This strategy includes continuing the development of gaseous, \n     alcohol, and electric vehicles. Minano said, ``The market has \n     to have room to allow multiple fuels. There should not be a \n     mandate for a single technology.''\n       The trucks are scheduled for production beginning in the \n     summer of 1996 and will be produced at North American Truck \n     Group facilities in Shreveport, Louisiana, and Linden, New \n     Jersey. They will be sold in the U.S. and Canada under the \n     GMC Truck and Chevrolet nameplates.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/15/senate-section/article/S8522-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             DISAPPOINTMENT OVER DELAY IN FOSTER NOMINATION\n Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I was recently contacted by the \nO'Brien family in Iowa about a very special event that will happen on \nJune 21. On that day, Esther Earnest Hewicker, of Remsen, IA, will \ncelebrate her 100th birthday. Mrs. Hewicker has lived a long and \nvibrant life and I want to join with her family and her many friends in \nIowa in wishing her my warmest birthday greetings on this very special \nday. During her lifetime, Iowa and our Nation have undergone many \nchanges and endured many great challenges.\n  Mr. President, in commemoration of this very special day and in \ntribute to Esther Hewicker, I ask that a letter to me from the O'Brien \nfamily reviewing her life be included in the Record at this point.\n  The letter follows:\n\n       Dear Senator Harkin: It is with great pride that we, the \n     O'Brien family, inform you of the one hundredth birthday of a \n     woman who has dedicated her life to the welfare of those \n     around her. Esther Earnest Hewicker, born June 21, 1895, near \n     Remsen, Iowa, was the youngest of eight surviving children. \n     At that time Esther's life was typical of the era. Her days \n     were spent going to school, doing chores, and often caring \n     for the children of her adult siblings. Esther lost her \n     father to a medical condition, ``consumption'', when she was \n     ten years old and as a result she, her mother, and remaining \n     underage siblings left the farm and moved into Remsen.\n       Esther graduated from Remsen High School in 1913. After \n     working for one year as a seamstress and caring for various \n     nieces and nephews, Esther borrowed money from her mother to \n     enter the Normal School in Cedar Falls, Iowa, where she \n     earned a two-year degree in intermediate education. Esther \n     taught seventeen years in small towns in Northwestern Iowa; \n     two years each in Akron and Aurelia, and thirteen years in \n     Marcus.\n       Esther began teaching in 1916 in Akron, Iowa, during World \n     War I. At that time, it was important for civilian citizens \n     to do what they could to support the war. Esther served \n     through the Red Cross, making bandages and rolling gauze. \n     Further, when teaching, Esther incorporated war effort \n     projects into appropriate school subjects. For instance, \n     during the teaching of hand work, Esther got yarn pieces from \n     the Red Cross and had her students knit squares that would \n     later be sent back to the Red Cross and sewn into lap \n     blankets.\n       At the onset of her career, teachers earned approximately \n     $65.00 monthly for only nine months of the year. During \n     summers, holidays, and weekends Esther returned home and \n     assisted her mother with a house full of chores, for \n     everything in those days was done by hand and without \n     refrigeration. Food preservation, preparation and storage \n     were long-term projects involving gardening, butchering, \n     canning, and baking using a wood stove. Water was carried for \n     daily needs, drinking, bathing, cleaning, etc. General \n     housekeeping involved floor scrubbing, hardwood waxing, rug \n     beating, lamp trimming and window washing. Often the supplies \n     for doing such chores needed to be made. The soap used for \n     laundry and cleaning was made at home, usually in conjunction \n     with butchering. Further, more time had to be made when \n     specific attention needed to be paid to caring for the sick \n     or repairing broken items.\n       In 1920, at the time Esther began teaching in Marcus, she \n     also took on the responsibility of singlehandedly caring for \n     her aging and ailing mother on a full-time basis. To \n     supplement their income and make ends meet. Esther also \n     ``kept roomers''. Esther maintained her full-time teaching \n     position and eventually became Junior High principal, which \n     in those days constituted an increase in responsibility as \n     her teaching duties continued. Esther continued to live \n     independently, maintaining her career, caring for her mother \n     and keeping roomers. Esther did this until 1934.\n       At the age of 37\\1/2\\, Esther married Frank Hewicker, a \n     Remsen, Iowa farmer. Her mother was transferred to the care \n     of other siblings. Esther then began a new career, farming \n     with her husband, for in those days, farming could only \n     succeed if done as a partnership between husband and wife. \n     The volume of work and sheer labor required to complete \n     necessary tasks could not be done by one person alone. Esther \n     cared for twin lambs abandoned by their mothers, raised \n     ducks, geese and up to one thousand chickens each year. She \n     kept a huge garden and did all of the housework, laundry, \n     mending and cooking necessary for her family and the hired \n     help, all without the aid of electricity, running water or \n     refrigeration. The Hewickers began farming land south of \n     Remsen and after approximately twelve years purchased land \n     south of Marcus, where they stayed their entire married life. \n     Presently, with the help of dedicated renters, Esther \n     continues to oversee the farm.\n       At the age of 45, prior to the couple's move to the new \n     land, Esther gave birth to a daughter, Ila Jean Hewicker. \n     Esther continued to run the farm with her husband, and raised \n     her family. At that time, Esther and her family were active \n     contributors to their church and community, both in a \n     physical and financial sense. Esther maintained a position on \n     the Marcus Fair Committee for twenty-five years and was part \n     of the decision-making process for the building of the Marcus \n     Theater, original community swimming pool, health clinic, and \n     countless other projects. Further, the couple found time to \n     frequent area nursing homes, where they provided the \n     residents with fresh produce and flowers. Esther and her \n     husband also made a point to tend to the sick, shut-in or \n     underprivileged within and outside their immediate families \n     whenever they could.\n       Strong believers in education, there was never a doubt that \n     their daughter would go to college. Esther and Frank \n     supported and encouraged Ila through college and proudly \n     watched her earn her Bachelor's Degree in Education. Ila \n     eventually married and had a family of her own.\n       It is important to note that Esther's dedication to \n     education did not stop with her career or her daughter's \n     completion of college. Esther was an active member of the \n     P.E.O. Club for many years and following Ila's high school \n     graduation, Esther was elected to the Marcus School Board. \n     Further, Esther and Frank created college funds for all four \n     of their grandchildren, adding substantial amounts of money \n     to each over the years. With that financial assistance, \n     Esther's two eldest grandchildren received Masters degrees, \n     one in Education, and one in Social Work. The third is \n     presently an undergraduate in an Art Education program and \n     the fourth will enter college in the Fall.\n       Esther is presently a resident of Happy Siesta Nursing Home \n     in Remsen, Iowa, and has been for the past nine years. Esther \n     made this move independently and presently continues to \n     welcome new residents, helps ease their transition from home \n     to nursing home living and encourages them to participate in \n     the many activities available to them. Esther often receives \n     visitors from the area and enjoys keeping up with the news \n     and lives of life-long friends. Though her old students are \n     senior citizens now, she sees many who visit, and makes a \n     point to ask after those who cannot.\n       Clearly, Esther Earnest Hewicker's contributions to society \n     have been vast throughout her long lifetime and still her \n     humor, character, and gregarious personality have yet to be \n     mentioned. It is with sincere pride that we ask that Esther's \n     contributions be recognized formally, as the benefits of her \n     life reaped by others are immeasurable.\n       Thank you for your time.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Kathy O'Brien\n                            and the entire O'Brien family.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/15/senate-section/article/S8523-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8523-S8524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          ORDERS FOR TOMORROW\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE.
