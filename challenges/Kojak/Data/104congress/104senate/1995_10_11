Mr. President, I just came from the ceremony held in the \nHouse Chamber. It was a marvelous ceremony, and I want to thank Senator \nThurmond and Congressman Spence for putting it together.\n  Our colleague from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, said something that I \nthink is significant for this body and for the other. He said, ``You do \nnot need to look to Los Angeles to see needless divisions in our \ncountry.'' He said, ``You can look right here at the House and the \nSenate.''\n  I think that is true. Each of us is partisan. I am proud to be a \nDemocrat. Other colleagues are proud to be Republicans. But when we \ncome here, sure, let us have differing opinions, but the excessive \npartisanship that is here, I think, discourages this country about our \nprocess. I think it harms both parties, and I think there is nothing \nfiner that we could do at this point than to listen to our colleague, \nSenator Inouye--in both political parties; I am not suggesting either \none is better on this. We can work together more.\n  As I leave this body at the end of next year, my greatest regret is \nthat I have seen this body deteriorate gradually over the years and \nbecome more and more partisan. That has not helped the American public. \nThat has not helped the two-party system.\n  I see my colleague from Wyoming. He is going to seek the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/11/senate-section/article/S14957-6", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S 14958]]\n\n\n                   WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak in support of \nS. 143, the bill that is on the floor and will be on the floor later \ntoday, the job training bill.\n  Mr. President, I first want to commend Senator Kassebaum for the work \nshe has done on this bill, and the others as well. I am not on that \ncommittee, but I am interested in this bill and what it seeks to do. I \nthink it is symptomatic of the changes that need to be made in many of \nthe programs, and it seeks to bring together 150, roughly, programs \nthat have been designed over the years, each with a certain amount of \nmerit, of course, and certainly each now with a constituency, and to \nbring those together and to seek to make them more efficient.\n  It seems to me, Mr. President, that one of the exciting things about \nthis year in this Congress has been that there has been, for the first \ntime in very many years, an opportunity to look at programs, to \nevaluate programs, to examine their purpose and then to see if indeed \nthey are carrying out that purpose to see if there are better ways to \ndo it and, perhaps as important as anything, to see if there is a way \nto shift those programs with more emphasis on the States and local \ngovernment.\n  I come from a small State; I come from Wyoming. When I am in \nWashington, I live in Fairfax County, and there are twice as many \npeople in Fairfax County as there are in the State of Wyoming. So we \nhave a little different and unique need there for the kinds of \nprograms. We still have a need for the programs, whether it be welfare \nor job training, but we need to have it tailored in a way that, I \nsuspect, is quite different from that of Pittsburgh or New York City, \nand that is what this program is all about.\n  I think too often--and I am concerned about this, Mr. President--as \nwe seek to make change--and I think voters want to make change; they \nsaid they want to make change in November 1994. Yet, of course, there \nare people who legitimately do not want to change and want to stay with \nthe status quo. It is much easier to oppose change than it is to bring \nit about. So we find often those who are, for whatever the reason, \nopposed to change, saying, well, that is going to gut the program, that \nis going to do away with the program, and that is going to eliminate \nthe help for the people who have been the beneficiaries of the program. \nAnd that is not true. That is not true in this program, it is not true \nin health care, it is not true in Medicare, and it is not true in \nwelfare.\n  On the contrary, these programs are designed to bring to those \nbeneficiaries a more efficient program to specifically deal with the \nneeds where those folks live. It gets us away from that idea that one \nsize fits all, away from the idea that Washington knows best. Instead, \nit moves the programs where the decisions can be made by local people \nwho respond to local needs. So we have, in this case, lots of money--\n$20 billion--going in these 150 programs, and this is an effort to \nbring them together and to block grant many of them to the States so \nthat the States can say, in effect, here is where we need that \neducation money.\n  We do need change, Mr. President. There undoubtedly has been a strong \nfeeling that the things that the Government is doing are not \nsucceeding. We have more poverty now than we had 40 years ago. So it is \nhard to say that the programs that are designed to alleviate poverty \nhave been workable. It is not a matter of not having spent enough \nmoney, in my judgment, but rather not spending it as efficiently as we \ncan. I think there is an adage that we need to adhere to, and that is \nthat you simply cannot expect things to continue by doing the same \nthing. You cannot expect different results by doing the same thing, \nwhich is basically what we have done.\n  So, Mr. President, I rise in strong support. I think we have a great \nopportunity to make some changes. This is a testing time. Probably the \ngreatest test of representative government, when voters say, look, we \nare not happy with the way things are, we think we need to change them, \nthe greatest test is to see whether that Government will indeed be \nresponsive to that request for change. I am first to say how difficult \nit is. And in each year it gets increasingly difficult. As we have more \nprograms and we have more money and we have more people involved in \nthese programs, we have more people involved in bureaucracies, more \npeople involved in lobbying, there is a great resistance to change. I \nthink we have, for the first time in many years, the greatest \nopportunity to bring about that change.\n  We need to reduce bureaucracy. We need to increase the private sector \ninvolvement. We need, perhaps most of all, to increase the \naccountability, to measure productivity in these programs, and we can \ndo this.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to move forward with this \neducation bill, this training to work, S. 143. I urge that we pass it. \nI urge that we shift many of these funds and responsibilities to local \ngovernment, to State government, so that they can, indeed, be oriented \nto the problems that we seek to fix.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

She is \nthe widow of Dr. Schlesinger, a mutual friend.\n  Mr. President, I was privileged to serve in the Department of Defense \nduring the period of 1972-74 with the Secretary of Defense Schlesinger. \nAt that time I had the privilege of learning to know and revere his \nlovely wife, Rachel, who just passed on.\n  She was a source of great strength to Dr. Schlesinger as he undertook \nthe important posts of Director of Office of Management and Budget, \nSecretary of Defense, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and \nSecretary of Energy.\n  He has had one of the most remarkable public service careers of any \nliving American. I worked with him in each of these assignments through \nthe years and learned to know and to love his late wife.\n  She was a great source of strength to this fine public servant. I am \ndoubtful he could have fulfilled these important posts without that \nsource of strength given by his wife and his children.\n  I join today with my distinguished friend and colleague, the senior \nSenator from Georgia, [Mr. Nunn], who, likewise, through the years, \nlearned to respect and admire Jim Schlesinger and his wife, Rachel.\n  Our prayers go to their family, and I express my gratitude for the \nfriendship given me through the years by Mrs. Schlesinger. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to pay tribute to a \nwonderful lady and wonderful friend, Rachel Mellinger Schlesinger. \nRachel died yesterday morning in Arlington, VA. Rachel was the wife of \nJames Schlesinger, a remarkable public servant who served in Cabinet \npositions in three administrations.\n  In a real sense Rachel served as first lady of the Department of \nDefense, first lady of the Department of Energy, and first lady of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency, when Jim Schlesinger held these important \nCabinet posts.\n  Rachel was a remarkable and accomplished woman, by every measure. She \nwas a talented musician. She was active in the mental health movement, \nhistoric preservation, and in the preservation of the rural lands that \nshe loved so much. She was also founder and first chairman of the \nBallston Symphony and a deacon in her church.\n  Rachel rarely involved herself in public issues. She always had her \nown convictions and opinions, but her capacity to deal with crisis was \nfamous. She accompanied Jim to many distant places in connection with \nhis work and on several occasions, by putting herself willingly in \ndangerous situations, she helped calm and reassure her friends and our \nfriends around the world and our allies around the world.\n  On one occasion which reached public attention, Jim was then Chairman \nof \n\n[[Page S 14959]]\nthe Atomic Energy Commission. A Spartan missile warhead test was \nscheduled in the Aleutians, and there was widespread fear that it would \ncause an earthquake and a tidal wave known as a tsunami in that area. \nRachel packed up her two daughters and her husband and moved them to \nthe island where the test was to take place. The family's presence was \nwidely publicized and calmed much of the alarm in that area.\n  Rachel traveled with Jim on an extended trip to Asia in 1975 when Jim \nbecame the first United States Secretary of Defense to visit Japan for \nmany years. It was after the fall of Saigon, and there were widespread \ndemonstrations. But the trip also generated an outpouring of support, \ndue in no small part to Rachel Schlesinger's presence by Jim \nSchlesinger's side.\n  Rachel served as college editor of Mademoiselle magazine after \ngraduation from Radcliffe with honors in American history and \nliterature. After her marriage to Jim, she did some freelance writing \nfor a time, but she soon devoted herself entirely to their growing \nfamily, and of course she was very, very proud of their eight wonderful \nand successful children. After their eight children had grown up, she \nbecame active again in charitable and cultural affairs. One of those \neight, their daughter, Clara, served very ably in my office as an \nintern in 1985.\n  Rachel was a violinist with the Arlington Symphony since 1983. She \nwas on the board of directors and on the executive committee of the \nsymphony. She served on the overseers' committee of the Memorial Church \nat Harvard, was a deacon and Sunday school teacher at Georgetown \nPresbyterian Church, and distributed food on many, many occasions to \nthe homeless over a large number of years.\n  Rachel was absolutely committed to mental health, and she worked \nclosely with the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, including \ntestifying before the Congress. Rachel always retained her love of the \nland, from her childhood days on the family farm in Ohio. In the \n1980's, she began to raise Christmas trees in the Shenandoah Valley, \ndelivering them herself near Christmastime, including the delivery of \nseveral to the Nunn home just in time for our Christmas celebration.\n  Rachel's long battle with cancer is now over, but the memory of her \nrare spirit will comfort and sustain those she loved and cared for in a \nlife of courage and a life of commitment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/11/senate-section/article/S14958-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RACHEL SCHLESINGER\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, sadly we learned yesterday of the death \nof Rachel Mellinger Schlesinger, the wife of Jim Schlesinger and the \nmother of his eight children. On behalf of the Senate, I want to convey \nto Jim our deepest sympathy on the loss of his beloved companion of \nmore than 40 years. I also want to say something about Rachel who, \nquietly and without fanfare, did those good works that the Book of \nProverbs praises. She genuinely did open her hands to the poor and \nreach out her hands to the needy, distributing sandwiches to the \nhomeless and testifying before Congress on the problems of the mentally \nill. Rachel was a gifted, energetic, and compassionate woman, but such \na private person that few Americans know of her contributions to the \nquality of our community life. I would like to take this opportunity to \nexpress our appreciation of what she did for us.\n  Rachel Line Mellinger was born on a farm in Springfield, OH, and \nalways considered herself a country girl. She loved gardening, and in \nthe 1980's, she bought a farm in the Shenandoah Valley to raise \nChristmas trees which she delivered personally to satisfied customers \nand delighted children. Thanks to her interest in the preservation of \nhistoric sites and rural land, Americans will have more of both to \nenjoy in times to come.\n  Like Thomas Jefferson, a fellow Virginia farmer, she was a talented \nwriter and musician. She played the violin, not only for her own \npleasure, but to give pleasure to others. She played with the Arlington \nSymphony Orchestra for 12 years and served on its board of directors. \nShe was the founder and first chair of the Ballston Pops, a May \nfestival which she originally organized 10 years ago.\n  She was active in the community both publicly and privately. She \nserved as deacon of the Georgetown Presbyterian Church and on the \noverseers committee of the Memorial Church at Harvard, but on Sundays \nshe could be found in the Sunday school where she taught classes. She \nwas active in the mental health movement, and worked with the National \nAlliance for the Mentally Ill.\n  We all know that in public life, public service can be hard on \nfamilies. Jim Schlesinger served in Cabinet positions in three \nadministrations. Rachel Schlesinger also served, in strength and \ndignity, preserving the privacy of her children and supporting her \nhusband with the warmth of her presence. It is not an exaggeration to \nsay that in all the agencies in which her husband served, she was \nuniversally loved.\n  Rachel Mellinger Schlesinger was a wonderful person, wise, kind, and \nthoughtful, who did good and not harm all the days of her life. She \nwill be missed.\n  Mr. President, I was please to be able to see her 3 days ago and can \nreport that in her last days she was cheerful and reassuring to all of \nthose around her. She will be greatly missed. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/11/senate-section/article/S14959-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14959-S14960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE POLITICS OF FEAR\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, my Minnesota office is located in the town \nof Anoka, the Halloween capital of the world.\n   For most of my neighbors there, a good scare means nothing more than \na Halloween visit to a haunted house, or maybe a roller coaster ride at \nthe amusement park, or an evening in front of the TV watching old \nhorror movies. So who would have ever guessed that, in 1995, the list \nof ways to give somebody a good scare would include handing them a \nletter from their U.S. Congressman.\n  There is a campaign of fear and misinformation being waged around us, \nMr. President, and I come to the floor today to share with you my \nabsolute contempt for it, and my sincere sympathy for its innocent \nvictims.\n  The perpetrators? My colleagues in the minority party, in both \nChambers, who are sinking to new lows as they fight desperately against \nthe tide of public opinion that came crashing down on them last \nNovember.\n  Their victims? Senior citizens, who have done nothing to deserve this \nkind of treatment, except, apparently, to grow old.\n  Let me tell you about one of those victims.\n  She is 91 years old, and for the last couple of years, she has lived \nin a nursing home in the town of Cambridge, MN.\n  Her name is Ethel Grams, and she is my grandmother. My grandmother \nreceived a letter, delivered right to her nursing home bed, from her \nRepresentative in the House. And I am appalled that older Americans, \nwho are among the most vulnerable in society, are being subjected to \nthese kinds of scare tactics, fear-mongering, and blatant, self-serving \ndistortions.\n  The letter is about Medicare, and is sprinkled--liberally--with \ninflammatory phrases like drastic cuts and benefits coming under \nattack.\n  Her Congressman writes of Republicans, quote ``coercing seniors into \nhealth plans'' and ``herding as many seniors as possible into managed \nhealth care programs.''\n  ``Republicans in Congress are proposing to cut Medicare by $270 \nbillion over the next 7 years,'' he writes, ``in order to pay for a tax \ncut of $245 billion for the wealthiest of Americans--those making over \n$350,000 a year.''\n  Those assertions would be laughable if they were not so serious.\n  Mr. President, imagine suggesting to a 91-year-old woman, bedridden \nin a nursing home, that her health care plan is under attack, that with \nRepublicans in the majority, the medical benefits she is relying upon \nwill be slashed.\n  What is she supposed to think? How could she not be scared?\n  I cannot speak for every senior citizen, but I know how much it \nfrightened my grandmother.\n  Unfortunately, this is not the only example of the damage being \nspread through this campaign of fear. \n\n[[Page S 14960]]\n\n  Another of my colleagues has mailed out his own letter to seniors, at \ntaxpayer's expense, and portions of it were printed recently in the St. \nPaul Pioneer Press and Dispatch.\n  This Congressman wrote of drastic cuts and proclaimed that ``the GOP \nplan in Congress would force seniors to give up their personal \ndoctor.''\n  ``Millions of seniors would be forced into managed care programs. * * \n* While older Americans pay more for Medicare,'' he wrote, ``the \nprivileged will pay less in taxes, with some receiving lavish tax \nbreaks.''\n  Newsweek aptly labels the Democrats' campaign as ``Medi-Scare'' in a \ncover story last month. Let me quote a paragraph for you:\n\n       ``Democrats depict the GOP's Medicare plan as a \n     bloodthirsty attack on the elderly. ``More people will die,'' \n     declares a hysterical new ad from the AFL-CIO. ``And it's \n     only for the sake of tax cuts for the rich,'' says Democrat \n     Ed Markey of Massachusetts.\n\n  ``That's hyperbole, for sure,'' writes Newsweek.\n  It is more than hyperbole. Anywhere else, this would be labeled, at \nbest, a blatant distortion of the truth and the State attorneys general \nwould be called in to investigate.\n  In Washington, we call the practice spin control. This is the only \ncity I know where once a lie is repeated three times, it is accepted by \nmost as being a fact.\n  Mr. President, it is time we hold our colleagues accountable for \ntheir misrepresentations, and, beginning today, that is what I intend \nto do.\n  They say our plan to preserve Medicare, cuts benefits to seniors--I \nsay ``show me.'' They say the majority of our tax cuts will go to the \nrich--I say ``show me.''\n  They say we are forcing seniors to give up their doctors--I say \n``show me.'' But I know they cannot, because the facts say otherwise.\n  Fact No. 1: We have to reform Medicare to ensure quality health care \nfor our seniors at a cost we can honestly afford. Unless we do, there \nare only two options.\n  Either the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund, which has provided \nhealth care services for 37 million Americans, will go out of business, \nbankrupt in 7 years, or we can raise taxes on our seniors and working \nfamilies by $388 billion over the next 7 years.\n  That is the option the Democrats have chosen seven times over the \npast three decades--they have reduced benefits and raised taxes.\n  But going to the taxpayers for more money is the easy way out, and \nAmericans have said ``enough.'' They are demanding reform, not higher \ntaxes.\n  Fact No. 2: We are going to save Medicare by increasing spending, but \nat a slower rate not with the dangerous cuts breathlessly predicted by \nthe Democrats.\n  Medicare spending under the Republican plan will increase by 40 \npercent, from $4,800 per beneficiary this year to $6,700 in the year \n2002.\n  Like Americans do every month around their kitchen tables, we have \nset a budget we can afford, and then decided the best way to deliver \nthe benefits.\n  We are not promising benefits and then raising taxes again and again \nto pay for them.\n  Fact No. 3: Medicare reform has no connection at all to our efforts \nto provide tax relief to the middle-class taxpayers, the working \nfamilies who so desperately need it.\n  With or without tax cuts, Medicare is in severe financial trouble. \nEven President Clinton, who has been virtually absent during the \nMedicare debate, realizes that.\n  In fact, the budget he proposed last June combined slowing the growth \nin Medicare spending with $110 billion in tax cuts.\n  The Washington Post addressed the attempt to link tax relief and \nMedicare reform in a September 25 editorial:\n\n       The Democrats have fabricated the Medicare-tax cut \n     connection because it is useful politically. It allows them \n     to attack and to duck responsibility both at the same time. \n     We think it's wrong.\n\n  Fact No. 4: The vast majority of the tax relief in the Republican \nbudget is directed right where it is needed most--to middle-class \nAmerican families.\n  Every family with children will benefit from the $500 per child tax \ncredit, and more than 85 percent of the children eligible for it live \nin families with incomes at or below $75,000.\n  These families are not the privileged or the wealthiest of Americans. \nThey are average folks who are struggling to meet their tax burden \nwhile trying to make a good life for themselves.\n  Those are the facts, Mr. President. They are an honest attempt to \nlook at the options, the costs, and the consequences--we are not taking \nsome figures and then blatantly distorting them and proclaiming them as \ntruth.\n  If my colleagues want to write and distribute fiction, they ought to \nlabel it as such and sell it through the Book of the Month Club.\n  The taxpayer-financed fiction like the letter received by my \ngrandmother--and similar letters received by hundreds of thousands of \nother senior citizens--must come to an end.\n  Government does have the power to do good, but the minority party \nundermines everyone's credibility when it preaches the politics of \nfear.\n  I suggest the next time someone wants to scare a senior citizen, they \nshould invite over a willing relative and pop in a videotape of \n``Frankenstein'' or ``The Silence of the Lambs.''\n  Do not threaten the security of strangers, and do not prey on their \nfears, because it is immoral and it is wrong, and it should be shame on \nthem, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/11/senate-section/article/S14959-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14960-S14961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WALTER T. STEWART\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an exemplary \ncitizen from the State of Utah, Walter T. Stewart, and to recognize his \nextraordinary service to our Nation in World War II.\n  It is my privilege and honor to report that Walter Stewart is being \nawarded the Distinguished Service Cross, our Nation's second highest \nmilitary medal, for his extraordinary heroism and gallantry in the most \ndecorated military battle in U.S. history.\n  At that time, he was a 25-year-old pilot with the 330th Bombardment \nSquadron, 93rd Bombardment Group, based in the North African city of \nBenghazi, Libya. A dedicated veteran of the air war, Stewart had \nalready flown 30 dangerous bomber missions.\n  Walter Stewart was skilled and he as courageous. Although only a \nfirst lieutenant, he was selected as deputy force leader of a large \nformation of B-24 heavy bombers assigned to attack the Ploesti oil \nrefineries in Nazi-occupied Romania in a massive low-level assault. The \ntarget, 1,200 miles in distance from Libya, was so vital to the Third \nReich that it was the most heavily defended stronghold in Europe, well \nexceeding the defenses of Berlin itself.\n  On August 1, 1943, Stewart's combat unit fearlessly spearheaded the \nenormous on-rush of 176 American heavy bombers over the Romanian \ncountryside. As the attacking force neared its target, murderous \nantiaircraft fire erupted from a fully alerted and prepared enemy. The \n93rd Bombardment Group heroically pressed on in its attack, defying \nextremely heavy fire from hundreds of enemy guns and cannons.\n  Only minutes from the target, the force leader's bomber and wingman \nwere shot down in flames, and it fell to Lieutenant Stewart to take \ncommand at this perilous moment. Under his leadership, the attacking \nforce swept over the target in waves, at roof-top altitude, and \ninflicted devastating damage upon its. As the lead aircraft, Lieutenant \nStewart's B-24 Utah Man, dropped the first bomb on target.\n  Utah Man sustained heavy battle damage and became separated from the \nrest of the attacking force. Utah Man had been hit with hundreds of \nshells and bullets, sustained damage to its cockpit instruments, and \nwas heavily leaking fuel. Yet, Lieutenant Stewart skillfully piloted \nUtah Man over the long and perilous route over rugged alpine mountains \nand across the Mediterranean Sea back to its home base in North Africa. \nLieutenant Stewart's crew suffered no casualties.\n  On that August day in 1943, 310 men of the 93rd Bombardment Group \ndied, 185 were taken prisoner, and 150 were wounded. Fifty-four \naircraft never returned.\n  Sadly, that was a fate that eventually befell Utah Man as well. In \nNovember 1943, after Water Stewart's reassignment to the United States, \nUtah \n\n[[Page S 14961]]\nMan and its crewmen would be lost over Bremen, Germany.\n  Lieutenant Stewart's coolness under fire, excellent judgment under \npressure, courageous determination to reach the target, and his \nmagnificent and inspiring leadership were of paramount value in the \naccomplishment of this dangerous mission. His service was such as to \nreflect great credit upon himself, the crew members of Utah Man, his \nhome State of Utah, the University of Utah--his affinity for his alma \nmater is reflected in the name of his plane, his church, and his \ncountry.\n  Today, Walter Stewart is a highly cherished member of his church and \ncommunity, an enormously respected businessman and farmer, a former \nmissionary, a musician, the husband of 51 years to his beloved wife \nRuth, a devoted father to his 5 children, and a loving grandfather to \nhis 23 grandchildren.\n  Today, as in 1943, Walter Stewart exemplifies the American qualities \nof courage, hard work, integrity, and faith.\n  I am proud to serve citizens like Walter Stewart in the Senate and \nproud to call my colleagues attention to this man's distinguished \nservice to our country. I am delighted that he is finally to be awarded \nthis significant military honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/11/senate-section/article/S14960-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE END OF WORLD WAR II\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, this afternoon we are going to be \ndiscussing some of the amendments to the current Job Corps Program. One \nof those amendments will be offered by Senators Specter and Simon in a \nbipartisan fashion.\n  There is something that is unique about this program. I have had some \npersonal experiences with the Job Corps Program formerly as mayor of \nthe city of Tulsa. We were able to use the participants of this program \nin doing massive public works within our city. Somehow none of this \never shows up to the credit of the Job Corps Program.\n  While I am the strongest supporter of virtually every element of the \nContract With America, I do believe that there are some areas where we \nshould give serious consideration to allowing a program to exist where \nit can breathe more freely across State lines, and this just might be \nthe case as opposed to sending it in block grants back to the States.\n  The construction industry is an industry that, First, is cyclical \nand, second, varies from State to State. One of the problems that \nexists right now in the construction industry is that it is very \ndifficult to find young people who will go into the construction \nindustry, into carpentry, into masonry, some of these areas where \nperhaps the future does not look as glamorous as it would in some type \nof highly skilled or high-technology position. As a result of that, \nmany people do not choose this except when there is a building boom \ngoing on.\n  One of the problems we have is that nationwide we could have a \nbuilding boom in Pennsylvania and there could be a slump in Oklahoma. \nBy the time you gear up to the boom in Pennsylvania, it could be in a \nslump again. Consequently, it has worked quite well to have these \nprograms in a national scope where they do provide for a ready supply \nof skilled labor jobs, carpentry jobs, masonry jobs, and jobs that are \ncritical to the building industry.\n  It is my understanding that the Specter-Simon amendment will not be \nscored, and if that is the case I would urge some of my conservative \ncolleagues to give serious consideration to supporting the Specter-\nSimon amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/11/senate-section/article/S14961-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14961-S14962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               GOALS 2000\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss \nfurther legislation which I introduced yesterday to amend Goals 2000 to \nmake some changes which may satisfy a number of States which are \nconcerned about excessive Federal intrusion under Goals 2000.\n  It is my view that there are no excessive intrusions at the present \ntime. But in order to eliminate any concern about that issue, it was my \nthought that legislation might ease the concerns of some in the country \nwho think there are too many intrusions.\n  The House of Representatives, in the Labor, Health and Human Services \nand Education appropriations bill, has eliminated the funding for the \nGoals 2000 Program. President Clinton has asked for an appropriation of \n$750 million and the Appropriations Subcommittee, which I chair, which \nincludes funding for Department of Education, has recommended an \nappropriation slightly more than one-half of what the President has \nrequested. This is because of the overall budget constraints.\n  But as we move forward in the legislative process and look ultimately \nto a conference with the House of Representatives, it is my view that \nwe can ease many concerns, regarding Goals 2000, by a number of \namendments which are incorporated into my proposed legislation, and at \nthe same time make moneys available to a number of States which have \nnot taken the funding.\n  Last year, two States, New Hampshire and Virginia, declined to \nparticipate in the Goals 2000 Program, and this year notice has been \ngiven by Montana and Alabama that they will not be participating.\n  The Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee held a hearing on September 12, \n1995 to bring together Secretary Riley and Mr. Ovide Lamontagne, who is \nthe chairman of the Board of Education of the State of New Hampshire, \nto consider the matter before we had the markup by the subcommittee. At \nthat time, a number of suggestions were made which might bridge the \ngap.\n  Again, I wish to emphasize my own personal view that there are not \nexcessive strings, but in order to satisfy any concerns, we are seeking \nto move in a number of directions.\n  One of them would be to eliminate the National Education Standards \nand Improvement Council, which was designed to certify national and \nState standards. Some view this as a national school board, which I do \nnot think it is, but the Secretary of Education, Richard Riley, thought \nwe \n\n[[Page S 14962]]\nmight eliminate it and still maintain the central thrust of the \nlegislation; and that is that there ought to be some standards and \ngoals, but to let the States establish their own standards and goals.\n  This program, Goals 2000, was very carefully crafted after a 1983 \nreport by then-Secretary of Education Terrell Bell, a very conservative \neducator, who found something we all know: That the American \neducational system is in a state of disarray.\n  Some schools are very good, like the high school I went to in \nRussell, KS, with 400 people, small classes, a good debating team, and \na first-rate education. Notwithstanding other distinguished \nuniversities which I have attended--the University of Oklahoma, the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania, Yale Law School--I think my best \neducational days were in high school, which underscores, at least my \nview, that some schools are very good. It also emphasizes the \nimportance of elementary school.\n  But educational standards across the country are in a state of \ndisrepair. Remedial action is necessary. Some of the items coming out \nof our subcommittee involve experimentation with privatization to take \nover the public school system, not competing with private school \nsystems, but trying to eliminate the bureaucracies in schools in cities \nlike Washington, DC, or in Baltimore, MD, Boston, MA, Hartford, CT, \nsome schools in Florida.\n  I am not saying that privatization is the answer, or the charter \nschool concept, which is also a program contained in the bill coming \nout of my subcommittee. But I think it is clear that the basic concept \nof goals is a valid one; that there ought to be a measurement, \nillustratively into the 4th year, at the end of the 8th year, at the \nend of the 12th year, but they do not have to be necessarily Federal \nstandards.\n  I compliment a distinguished legislator in the State of New \nHampshire, the Honorable Neals Larson, who is the chairman of the house \nof representatives education committee. Representative Larson is trying \nvery, very hard to see to it that New Hampshire would accept funding \nunder Goals 2000 in its current form.\n  Candidly, I agree with Representative Larson that there are no \nstrings attached which are intrusive and that, if you take a look at \nother Federal funding for the disadvantaged, for school to work, that \nit is not unusual to have some articulation of standards. But \nnotwithstanding all of that, let us see if we cannot move ahead and \nfind a way to accommodate those who may have a contrary view.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, time is limited to 5 \nminutes and time has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be permitted \nto proceed for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, stated very briefly, \nand the statement which was submitted yesterday will amplify these \ncomments, this legislation will eliminate the requirement that the \nSecretary of Education approve and review State plans. Secretary Riley \nhas been very accommodating and cooperative. He has expressed some \nconcerns about this legislation. There may be others who will have \nconcerns, others who were involved in the original Goals 2000 \nlegislation, and we will make an effort to work with them on those \nconcerns.\n  As a result of a public meeting which I participated in at Nashua \nHigh School back on September 9, an interesting thought was advanced, \nand that is to have funds go directly to local school boards for those \nStates which decline to accept Goals 2000 funds.\n  Mr. Ovide Lamontagne, the chairman of the New Hampshire State Board \nof Education, thought that was an idea which would be acceptable. I am \nnot suggesting that he made a final commitment to it, but at least from \nhis point of view, it had merit subject to the power of the State to \nintervene if something extraordinary was done which was contrary to the \nState's views.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to take a look at the \nlegislation as a way to amend Goals 2000, as a way of seeking an \nadjustment and accommodation with the House on the appropriations \nprocess and encouraging States which are not now entering into \ncompliance with the ultimate view that we have to better the education \nof school children in America.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/11/senate-section/article/S14961-4", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2894 to Amendment No. 2885\n\n  (Purpose: To maintain a national Job Corps Program, carried out in \n                partnership with States and communities)\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for himself, \n     Mr. Simon, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Johnston, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2894 to amendment No. 2885.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \nAmendments Submitted.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in the interest of time--and I understand \nmy distinguished cosponsor, Senator Simon, will be arriving in the \nChamber shortly--I will proceed with some of the opening \nconsiderations.\n  This is a carefully crafted amendment which builds upon the work of \nthe distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator Kassebaum. It is \nresponsive to concerns raised by the General Accounting Office to \nmaintain the Job Corps Program in its current structural form with \nreforms addressing many of the needs identified by Senator Kassebaum \nand the GAO report.\n  In my capacity as chairman of the appropriations subcommittee which \nhas the responsibility for funding Job Corps, I have been intimately \nfamiliar with the operation of Job Corps. During the 15 years that I \nhave been in the U.S. Senate, I have been an advocate for its \nimplementation and have worked to secure funding of almost $1.1 billion \nfor the program.\n  It is my view, after seeing the application of the Job Corps in my \nhome State of Pennsylvania and in other States, after working \nassiduously with my former colleague, Senator Heinz, for the opening of \na major Job Corps center in Pittsburgh and having seen the successful \nimplementation of the other three Job Corps centers in Pennsylvania, \nthat the current requirements operating as a Federal program ought to \nbe maintained.\n  I appreciate the general concept of block grants, but it is a concern \nof \n\n[[Page S 14963]]\nmine that we may be going too far on the block grant concept at the \noutset, especially at a time when we have given the States great \nauthority on welfare reform. To lump the funds for Job Corps with the \nother block grants which are being given to the States, in my judgment, \nis an open invitation to have these very important funds on job \ntraining diverted to other purposes.\n  There is no question about the need for a well-trained American work \nforce, and there is no question about the importance of people having \nthe ability to find jobs. If there is one core answer for the problems \nof crime, it is that people are able to hold a job and support \nthemselves. I have long been interested in providing early intervention \nincluding education, job training, and realistic rehabilitation for \njuveniles and for first-time offenders. I believe that Job Corps goes a \nlong way toward achieving that objective.\n  The legislation Senator Simon and I have crafted and introduced here \nincorporates many of, if not most of, the remedies which have been \nproposed by Senator Kassebaum, such the provision regarding zero \ntolerance on drugs, alcohol, and violence. We have also responded to \nintegrating the Job Corps into the overall work force development \nscheme, which is part of Senator Kassebaum's legislation.\n  This amendment works on issues identified by Senator Kassebaum, by \nstrengthening State and local ties to the Job Corps, and by requiring \nthat any plans to operate a center be submitted to the Governor for \ncomment and review prior to submission to the Secretary of Labor. This \nallows for the integration of local interests of the Governor, but not \ntotal discretion to abolish the Job Corps or to abolish the great \nstrides which have been made in so many Job Corps centers.\n\n  The amendment also requires screening and selection procedures for \nparticipating at-risk youth to be implemented through local \npartnerships and community organizations with the local work force \ndevelopment corps and one-stop career centers, again being responsive \nto concerns raised by Senator Kassebaum.\n  The Specter-Simon amendment relies on Chairman Kassebaum's national \naudit approach, but we submit that measure calls for the closing of \nfive poorly performing centers by September 30, 1997, and five more by \nSeptember 30 of the year 2000. We do allow discretion to the Secretary \nof Labor regarding this important provision which will allow him to \nclose additional centers after an appropriate audit.\n  In essence, Mr. President, what we are looking at here is very \nextensive work done by the Committee on Labor and Human Resources under \nthe direction of my distinguished colleague from Kansas. The GAO has \nidentified certain problems which this Senator acknowledges to be true. \nBut in the context of block grants being made this year beyond welfare \nsuch as with Medicaid, it is my judgment and the judgment of the other \ncosponsors, and I think a large part of the Senate, that we ought not \ngo too far too fast.\n  The Job Corps has been an effective program that ought to be \ncorrected, but we ought not allow the States to abolish the program at \ntheir own discretion. I have total confidence in my State of \nPennsylvania. However, there are other States where that kind of \nconfidence does not exist.\n  Now, Mr. President, without really trying to filibuster or speak at \nany undue length, I note the arrival of my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Simon. However, first I yield to my distinguished colleague \nfrom Utah, Senator Hatch, 4 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Thank you. Mr. President, I rise in support of the \namendment offered by my colleagues, Senators Specter and Simon, to \nmaintain the Job Corps as a national program.\n  Now I have to say that I understand what the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kansas is trying to do and I generally support her on this bill.\n  With regard to Job Corps, I really do not believe it can work unless \nit is a national program, because much of the Job Corps Program depends \nupon the in-resident training. People coming to the actual Job Corps \ncenters, living there, many of these kids culturally deprived, \neconomically deprived, child abuse, kids that are in real trouble. This \nis the only program that works or that we have, in essence, for hard-\ncore unemployed youth, and it does work. It is expensive. On the other \nhand, not nearly as expensive as if these kids wind up on welfare or \nwind up in the drug culture or wind up in the criminal culture of our \nsociety.\n  As my colleagues know, Utah is the home of two outstanding Job Corps \ncenters. Wever Basin is a conservation center that is consistently \nrated in the top 10 centers; Clearfield Jobs Corps Center is run under \ncontract by the Management Training Corps of Ogden, UT, which has a \nlong and stellar history of managing Job Corps programs throughout the \nUnited States and has been named contractor of the year by the Labor \nDepartment. We are very proud of Utah's contribution to the Job Corps \nProgram.\n  The Job Corps itself is unique. It is unlike education and training \nprograms offered under the Job Training Partnership Act which I helped \nto author, the Carl Perkins Vocational Act, which I also worked on, or \nany other Federal initiative. First of all, it is geared to those young \npeople who have failed in traditional settings and whose traditional \nsupport systems and often their own families have failed them.\n  Second, the Job Corps is primarily, as I said, a residential program. \nIt is designed specifically to get these young people out of the \nstreets, off the streets, and out of harm's way, away from the \ninfluences of gangs and drugs and violence. Job Corps centers can \nprovide clean, structured, positive, environments, and they do.\n  For many young people, it makes little sense for them to spend 8 \nhours a day in a constructive learning situation only to return at 5 \np.m. to abusive homes, pressure from unenlightened peers, or the \ntemptations of drugs and alcohol.\n  Frankly, it would be hard for me to support the Job Corps if it were \nonly another job training program. I think I would have great \ndifficulty. I cannot justify $1 billion to duplicate something that \nStates and local governments are already doing.\n  On that score, I think the Senator from Kansas is absolutely right. \nWe need consolidation, and we need more State and local flexibility.\n  We learned during last year's debate on the crime bill we have over \n150 separate job training and youth development programs, all having \ndiffering sets of regulations, reporting requirements, and so forth.\n  That is a waste of bureaucracy, pure and simple. I want to commend \nthe Labor and Human Resources Committee for putting together this bill \nto do something about it. This is a commonsense solution to the \nproliferation of programs and to the needless expenditure of time and \nresources just to keep up with the paperwork.\n  But the Job Corps is not just another program. Its residential \ncapability makes it different, and I believe the current national \nadministration of Job Corps is necessary to promote both continuity and \naccountability. For that reason, I support the Specter-Simon amendment.\n  Another reason for supporting this amendment is it deals honestly and \nforthrightly with some of the legitimate criticisms that have been \nraised about Job Corps.\n  Again, I commend Senator Kassebaum for holding thorough oversight \nhearings on the Job Corps. The results of these hearings as well as the \nreports from the General Accounting Office and the Labor Department \ninspector general have identified specific areas in which Job Corps \nmust improve.\n  No program should be immune from congressional inquiry. Any program \nthat is doing its job effectively should welcome such hearings. Should \nthis amendment carry, I encourage the Labor Department to continue its \nscrutiny of the program in its efforts to improve the identified areas.\n  Those of us who support this amendment to maintain Job Corps as a \nnational program need to make it clear that this is not a hands-off Job \nCorps vote or license for business as usual. On the contrary, if Job \nCorps remains a national program, it remains subject to national \noversight, including continual progress reports by the GAO and the \nLabor Department inspector general.\n  In this case, however, the way to address these issues is not \nthrowing the baby out with the bath water. The Specter-Simon amendment \nmakes many important reforms in the Job Corps. \n\n[[Page S 14964]]\n\n  For starters, the amendment ties the Job Corps more closely to the \nintegrated job training system being created by S. 143. This only makes \nsense. Without making Job Corps a State program, we can make sure that \nJob Corps programs are coordinated with other State and local efforts. \nWe can also utilize the one-stop career centers to make the Job Corps \noption more available to young people who could benefit from it.\n  Again, I want to thank Senators Specter and Simon for providing more \ninput for State Governors on this amendment. I believe this change will \nnot only solidify cooperation, but will also be an additional check on \nJob Corps contractors.\n  I am also encouraged by the codification of Job Corps' guidelines \nconcerning behavior by corps members. The zero-tolerance policy on \ndrugs, alcohol, and violence must be strictly enforced. Of course, it \nmeans nothing if it is not.\n  By including these provisions in this amendment, we are giving \ncongressional weight to the efforts of the Department of Labor and \nindividual Job Corps contractors and center directors to ensure the \nstate of Job Corps centers. Nothing less than the viability of the \nresidential center concept is at stake.\n  In short, this is a we-mean-business provision. Students who want to \nturn their lives around should not have to confront the same negative \ninfluences in Job Corps as they left on the streets behind them.\n  Finally, the amendment requires the closure of the 10 worst \nperforming centers. We have too many needs and too little money to \ncontinue to prop up consistently poor performing centers. The costs of \noperating Job Corps centers will continue to go up along with \neverything else. We must make tough decisions about where to make cuts.\n  It seems to me that one obvious place to look is the bottom rung of \nthe performance ladder. While I applaud the efforts DOL made to enforce \nperformance standards, there are still centers that have such a long \nway to go--that it is more economical to close them than to conserve \nresources to maintain program quality at other centers.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Specter-Simon amendment is a balanced \nresponse to the criticisms that have been raised about the program, as \nwell as desirable of maintaining the Job Corps as a national program. I \nurge Senators to support the amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my distinguished colleague from Utah, and \ninquire how much time remains on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes and thirty seconds remain.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield to my distinguished colleague from Illinois, \nSenator Simon.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania and \nI thank him for sponsoring this amendment and I appreciate the comments \nof Senator Hatch.\n  Mr. SPECTER. May I inquire of my colleague from Illinois how much \ntime he intends to take? We have had some requests from other Senators.\n  Mr. SIMON. If my colleague can give me 5 minutes, that will be great.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Five minutes? Fine.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, first of all, we are not talking about the \nSunday school class of Our Savior's Lutheran Church at Carbondale, IL. \nWe are talking about a marginal group of young people: 79 percent high \nschool dropouts, 73 percent have never been employed before. While they \nhave problems, they have been improving.\n  This is the placement rate for the Job Corps. For those who criticize \nit and say only 36 percent graduate, those figures are also gradually \ngoing up. I point out, U.S. News & World Report just came out with the \nbest colleges and universities in the Nation and I notice that Wichita \nState University, a great school in my colleague's State, had a 30-\npercent graduation rate. That is not an abysmal rate, when you take a \nlook at what is happening. With the placement rate, it is not only that \nyou get over 70 percent placed in jobs, it is also that 79 percent--\ninterestingly the same percentage; these are high school dropouts--79 \npercent of the employers speak very highly of these young people who \nare marginal, who have really been struggling.\n  In 1991 the National Commission on Children, a bipartisan body of 34 \nmembers wrote, ``We recommend that the Job Corps component of JTPA be \nexpanded over the next decade''--not cut back, as this will do, without \nthis amendment--``be expanded over the next decade to increase \nparticipation from its present level of approximately 62,000 a year to \napproximately 93,000 a year.''\n  In 1993, the Milton Eisenhower Foundation, commemorating the 25th \nanniversary of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders--\nlisten to what they have to say, the Milton Eisenhower foundation.\n\n       Next to Head Start, the Job Corps appears to be the second \n     most successful across-the-board American prevention program \n     ever created for high-risk kids.\n\n  What we are being asked to do is automatically cut back on 25 Job \nCorps centers and then block grant. There are areas where block grants \nmake sense, but this is sure not one of them. Most States have no \nexperience whatsoever in this field. Here we know we have a program \nthat is working, is being commended by a great many people.\n  I will have printed in the Record a letter signed by Peter Brennan, \nSecretary of Labor under the Nixon administration, Dick Schubert, \nDeputy Secretary of Labor under both the Nixon and Ford administration, \nBill Usery, Secretary of Labor under the Ford administration, Ray \nMarshall, Secretary of Labor under the Carter administration, Frank C. \nCasillas, Assistant Secretary of Labor under the Reagan administration, \nMalcolm Lovell Jr., Assistant Secretary for Manpower under the Nixon \nadministration, and Under Secretary of Labor under the Reagan \nadministration, Roger Semarad, Assistant Secretary of Labor under the \nReagan administration--all them saying we ought to keep the Job Corps.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n           [From the Washington Times, Letters to the Editor]\n\n              Killing Job Corps Will Put Young at Jeopardy\n\n       Job Corps is our country's successful national residential, \n     educational and job-training program for at-risk youth. The \n     Workplace Development Act (S.143) puts Job Corps' future, and \n     the young people it serves, in jeopardy.\n       If passed, it will close 25 centers and turn over \n     operations of this most comprehensive program to the states. \n     In 30 years, no state has successfully operated such a \n     program. The legislation ignores Job Corps' solid track \n     record and poses a risky alternative.\n       This bill, which was amended to the welfare reform bill \n     (H.R.4) is in sharp contract to all other proposed \n     consolidation recommendations.\n       Four million young people in the United States need of \n     basic education, job skills and job-placement assistance only \n     Job Corps offers. Most youths who enroll in Job Corps have \n     inadequate education. Most do not have the skills or \n     attitudes needed to find and keep good jobs. All are from \n     poor families.\n       As the largest, most comprehensive and cost-effective \n     program of its kind, Job Corps is a solution for \n     disadvantaged youths between the ages of 16 and 24. Seven out \n     of 10 graduates enter jobs or pursue further education. Job \n     Corps should remain a national program because it works, is \n     accessible, cost-efficient, accountable and helps \n     communities.\n       The American public, Congress and the Clinton \n     administration should be proud of Job Corps. We implore the \n     members of Congress from other sides of the aisle to continue \n     support for Job Corps as a distinct national program.\n     Peter J. Brennan,\n         Secretary of Labor, Nixon Administration, New York.\n     Dick Shubert,\n         Deputy Secretary of Labor, Nixon/Ford Administration, \n           Washington.\n     W.J. Usery, Jr.,\n         Secretary of Labor, Ford Administration, Washington.\n     Ray Marshall,\n         Secretary of Labor, Carter Administration, Austin, TX.\n     Frank C. Casillas,\n         Assistant Secretary of Labor, Reagan Administration, \n           Chicago.\n     Malcolm R. Lovell Jr.,\n         Assistant Secretary for Manpower, Nixon Administration, \n           Under Secretary of Labor, Reagan Administration, \n           Washington.\n     Roger Semarad,\n         Assistant Secretary of Labor, Reagan Administration, \n           Leesburg, VA.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I think the evidence is just overwhelming \nthat we should not put the Job Corps on the chopping block. This is a \nprogram that has some difficulties because you are \n\n[[Page S 14965]]\ndealing with marginal young people, but it works. And when we have a \nprogram that works we ought to be expanding it and not cutting back on \nit.\n  I urge my colleagues to accept the amendment that Senator Specter and \nI have introduced. I think it is in the national interest.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nOhio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today very reluctantly to oppose \nthe amendment from my friends from Pennsylvania and Illinois and Utah. \nI say reluctantly because I totally agree with their objectives and I \ntotally agree with their analysis of what is one of the gravest \nproblems this country faces and that is the growing number of young \npeople in this country who are literally growing up in a society that \nis separate from the rest of us.\n  Someone has come up with the term ``at-risk youth.'' You see these \nat-risk youth when you go into a Job Corps center site, as I have in \nDayton, OH, or in Cincinnati or in Cleveland. You talk to these kids--\nreally not kids, young adults--and you find they have grown up in a \nfamily where there is one parent, that one parent may be an alcoholic \nor drug addict, where no one in the family has worked for years--where \nno one has in the neighborhood, really. They do not seem to know \nanybody in the neighborhood who has worked. That is not true in every \ncase, but it is not atypical.\n  The thing we have to keep in mind, though, is when we go into a Job \nCorps site and see these young people, for every one you see in a Job \nCorps site there are 10, 100, maybe 1,000, maybe 10,000 more out there \nin every one of our States, so we are just seeing a small number of \nthese individuals.\n  So I applaud the purpose of this amendment but I differ in the \napproach. We looked at this issue at length in the Labor Committee. The \ncommittee adopted an amendment that I offered that ensures that \napproximately 40 percent of the money that will be spent at the State \nlevel will be spent for these at-risk youth and that we will not allow \nthe States to cream off the top, to just help those young people who \nare between jobs, to help just those in the middle class, but that the \nStates will be required --the total package provides $2.1 billion that \nhas to be spent on the at-risk youth.\n  Now we move to the question how do we spend this money the most \neffectively? There are those who look at Job Corps and say, ``Do away \nwith it.'' They cite the statistics of crime, drug abuse, lack of any \ndefinable results or quantitative results. There are others who say \nvery eloquently, ``The Job Corps does work and we have to have a \nresidential facility.'' I believe the Senator from Kansas, who chairs \nour committee, has come up with a very rational compromise and it is a \nmiddle position. It is a position, I believe, that marries the best of \nboth worlds.\n  What does it do? It says we understand there are problems with the \nJob Corps. We are going to try to fix those. It says, of the 111 or so \nJob Corps sites--we have eight more coming on, that makes 119--we are \ngoing to take 25, the worst, in an objective measure, and those will be \neliminated. But the rest will stay in existence.\n  I want Members who are listening back in their offices to keep this \nin mind. They will continue and they will continue under the authority \nand the power of the States. Any State that might lose a Job Corps \nsite--25. For example, let us say Ohio might lose one. It may. I do not \nknow. But that money would continue to flow to the State and that money \nwould have to be spent for at-risk youth. It could not be creamed off. \nIt could not be used by the State for any other purpose but to target \nthis at-risk youth. That, to me, is very, very significant.\n  I think it is important to point out exactly where this bill stands \nnow. As a result of the amendment that I offered and other changes that \nwere made, and the good work of the chairman, the Workforce Development \nAct now targets $2.1 billion of the funding on Jobs Corps and other \neducation and training programs directly on the problems of at-risk \nyouth.\n  States have to spend roughly 40 percent of job training dollars in \nthis bill on the at-risk youth problem. They cannot cream off the easy \npart for the job training problem. They have to tackle the tough cases.\n  The bill provides us a framework based initially on a residential \nconcept for Job Corps. But it requires that a major portion of this \nmoney be targeted at this at-risk youth population.\n  I believe that this legislation now represents a rational compromise. \nIn this compromise, States must target the at-risk youth population. \nBut along with this requirement, or mandate, they are given \nflexibility--flexibility that I think is essential if we are to empower \nthe States and to encourage the States to develop a full-fledged \nprogram for at-risk youth.\n  States should not be in a position to turn and say, ``Well, the at-\nrisk youth is the Federal Government's problem. The at-risk youth is \nwhat we have Job Corps for.'' I do not think so. I think it is much \nbetter if it is integrated to the State's entire program to deal with \nall of the at-risk youth in the State.\n  This compromise keeps most Job Corps centers in place. But it shifts \ncontrol of the centers to the States to promote a greater focus on \nlocal jobs. The goal of the compromise is to make sure States see \nhelping at-risk youth as an integral, very significant part of their \nmission.\n  The specific issue of the future of the Job Corps Program is of great \nconcern to myself and my colleague from Pennsylvania and other Members \non the floor. Some people, as I said, want to abolish Job Corps. Some \nwant to keep it with the status quo and make some minor changes. I \nbelieve the compromise that we have come up with will actually rescue \nJob Corps and start it down the path of truly fixing it.\n  It is clear that many of these at-risk youth that I have talked about \nwill continue to need the kind of residential education that Job Corps \nprovides. I think we need to keep that option open. That is why Job \nCorps was not abolished in this compromise. That is why the Labor \nCommittee bill provides for a great deal of flexibility in how this \nfund for at-risk youth will be used. Indeed, the bill cures what has \nbeen one of the major complaints about the Job Corps program in the \npast--the fact that Job Corps is a nationally administered program that \ndoes not respond to the needs of the local labor markets. I will come \nback to that in a moment.\n  One of the key insights into a recent American political discourse is \nthat we need to rebuild the sense of community. My friend from Indiana, \nSenator Coats, has talked about that. He has spoken eloquently on the \nneed to rebuild the ties that make for a successful civil society.\n  But let us look at a typical Job Corps experience. A young woman or \nyoung man from Detroit, MI, may be sent to a Job Corps Center in \nDayton, OH, and that Job Corps Center in Dayton, OH, may be run by a \ncontractor from Utah. Then when that young man or that young woman goes \nout to find a job, the agency that is charged with helping that person \nfind a job may be based in Atlanta, GA. You lose the sense of community \nwhich I think most people truly understand is essential if the person \nin the Job Corps is not only going to be trained but if they are going \nto have a real job afterward, 6 months or 12 months later, because that \nis the true test of whether it works or not.\n  The problem with the current system is that very few people involved \nin this process have any real ties to the local community or to the \nparticular young adult being trained.\n  This is an extremely disjointed process, not a focused, locally \noriented approach. More often than not, the young person does not \nremain in the community where a Job Corps center is. The person quite \nnaturally tends to go home. I think a truly successful Job Corps \nProgram should look at that young person not just as another client who \nis shipped somewhere, but as a member of the local community.\n  That is why streamlining the job training program into block grants \nto the States is how we have done it in this bill. We have also decided \nto shift the Job Corps Program to the States. There is a much greater \nchance that Job Corps will succeed in rescuing an at-risk youth if that \nprogram is tapped \n\n[[Page S 14966]]\ninto a local community--local youth, local employers, and local jobs. \nThe Job Corps needs to be part of a focused, comprehensive, locally \noriented system. I think that is very, very important.\n  So let me conclude by saying, Mr. President, that everyone on this \nfloor--as I look around at all the Members-- has a great concern about \nat-risk youth. The only issue today is how we best serve these at-risk \nyouth.\n  I believe that the continuation of Job Corps--and an improved Job \nCorps providing for residential services but integrated into a State \nsystem--is really the only way that we can go. It is a rational \napproach. It is a rational compromise. I think it has a much greater \nchance of success than continuing the current system.\n  So, I ask my colleagues--again, I say this quite reluctantly--to \ndefeat this amendment and assure them that when they look at this bill \nthey will find it is a bill that has considered at-risk youth, and not \nonly has considered at-risk youth but has put a star behind that term, \nand say we care, we care about the at-risk youth in this society, and \nthat this Congress, this Senate, is not going to forget about them but, \neven more importantly, the States are not either.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve minutes and thirty seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 3 minutes to my distinguished colleague from \nRhode Island with whom I served for many years on the authorizing \ncommittee, and who knows the subject very well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, when the subject of Job Corps was being discussed on \nthe Senate floor at an earlier time, I spoke about solutions to,\n\n       The important problems and challenges facing our young \n     people: the need for originality and new ideas; the need for \n     knowledge to combat ignorance; and, above all, the need for \n     broadening the horizons for youth, so that each young man and \n     young woman in the United States can develop the best of his \n     or her talents in a climate of maximum opportunity.\n\n  I delivered those remarks in March 1964 during debate on President \nJohnson's poverty program, which created, among others, the Job Corps \nProgram. Thirty-one years later, the problems and challenges are \nsurprisingly, and unfortunately, the same. I doubt any of my colleagues \nwould disagree with the importance of allowing our young people to \ndevelop to the best of their ability.\n  For many, colleges and universities are the places they go to develop \ntheir talents; still others find vocational schools or service in our \nArmed Forces to be the place. Regrettably, Mr. President, there remain \nsome young men and women who do not even know what their talent is.\n  They are referred to as poverty youth. In reality, they are young \nAmericans who, through no fault of their own, lack the skills needed to \nget an education or find a job.\n  It is for these people that Job Corps was created, has flourished, \nand must continue. It is just as important today as it was 34 years ago \nto do all we can to look for new ideas to old problems; to replace \nignorance with knowledge; and most important, allow all of our young \npeople, no matter who they are, where they live, or how much they make, \nto discover their special talent and go on to develop that talent.\n  This is why I am a cosponsor of and will vote for the Simon-Specter \namendment. I am pleased the amendment calls for a review and closing of \nany centers that are not serving their students. I am also pleased \nabout the strong emphasis the amendment places on community \ninvolvement. The hearings held by the Senate Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee certainly pointed out the strong, positive impact an involved \ncommunity can have on the success of a Job Corps Center. Most \nimportant, I am pleased that the Simon-Specter amendment keeps the Job \nCorps Program as a national program. This, I feel, is vital.\n  My only lingering regret, Mr. President, is that my own State of \nRhode Island is one of four States which so far does not have a Job \nCorps Center of its own. I continue to hope that this omission can be \naddressed in the context of strengthening and improving the program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I would like to yield 7 minutes to the \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I \nbelieve the intent to preserve the Job Corps is a good intent. The Job \nCorps in the main has been a program that has had a substantial amount \nof success. However, the purpose of S. 143, of this piece of \nlegislation, is to give not just the States more flexibility but \nprovide, for the first time, taxpayers with a real system of \naccountability, requiring States to develop a plan, present benchmarks \nfor that plan and suffer monetary penalties if they do not meet the \nobjectives under the plan.\n  This says we are not just going to block grant money back to the \nStates and allow them to willy-nilly spend the money. This legislation \ncreates, for the first time, an accountable system and allows Governors \nand people in the States to preserve their Job Corps Program, but it \nsays that we are going to transfer primary responsibility for any Job \nCorps Center to the State in which the Job Corps Center is located.\n  States rather than the Federal Government under this legislation, we \nbelieve, are in the best position to manage and operate these centers \nand, most important, to integrate them with their statewide work force \ndevelopment system.\n  I would actually make the case that this is a good area for us to \nbegin to consider what kind of swaps we might be able to work with the \nStates entirely. We are not only talking about giving the States \nresponsibility. We are collecting a lot of taxpayer money here and \nshipping it back to the States to do a function that I believe is \nlargely something that the States do better than the Federal Government \nanyway, which is to work with small business, to work with big \nbusiness, to work with educational institutions to try to develop \nprograms that will help individuals acquire skills they need to either \nget in the work force for the first time, which is typically what Job \nCorps does, or to acquire the skills to enable them to move up the \neconomic ladder.\n  I actually would love to get into a debate, into a discussion as we \ntalk about shifting more power back to the States about whether we want \nto not just shift power back to the States but whether we want to shift \nall funding responsibilities. I think it was a mistake for us to block \ngrant, for example, Medicaid and give Medicaid back to the States under \na block grant program. I did not support the welfare bill because I do \nnot think income maintenance programs can be run by the States. But \nsome kind of a swap as we are trying to decide what does the Federal \nGovernment do well and what do the States do well it seems to me to be \nappropriate rather than just assuming that everything ought to be \nshifted back to the States.\n  Some things the Federal Government does quite well. One of them, \nhowever, Mr. President, I do not believe is in the area of job training \nand economic development. There I believe very strongly the States \nshould be given the principal responsibility and be given not just \nflexibility but as long as they are asking us for tax dollars that we \non behalf of our taxpayers need to hold them accountable for what is \ngoing on.\n  Again, this legislation, S. 143, as I said yesterday when I spoke on \nit, is one of the very small number--in fact, I only have two on my \nlist right at the moment--of changes in the law where I am certain a \ncouple of years from now people on the street in Nebraska are going to \ncome up and say, ``You know, that work force development legislation, I \nhave a job today because of that. I am earning $5,000 more a year \nbecause of that. My family survived as a consequence of that \nlegislation.''\n  This piece of legislation will produce real change that people will \nappreciate at the local level, where they are asking increasingly, what \nis this Congress all about? What are you doing that is relevant to our \nlives?\n  The other one, I point out again for emphasis, is S. 1128, the health \ninsurance reform legislation. Mr. President, \n\n[[Page S 14967]]\n25 million Americans will benefit if we end the practice of excluding \npeople on the basis of preexisting conditions and allow people to port \ntheir insurance from one job to another.\n  Last year, in the debate over health care, it seemed no one was for \nthat, and this year it has become popular to suggest it; 25 million \nAmericans benefit from that. Again, by coincidence, it is sponsored by \nthe Senator from Kansas and the Senator from Massachusetts. S. 143, \nlike S. 1128, will enable you in townhall meetings to have people stand \nup and say: This one made a difference in my life. My family is \nstronger; my income is higher; I have that job; I have adjusted to the \nmarketplace; I have skills and am able to do things I was not able to \ndo before.\n  So those who are wondering whether or not you are voting against Job \nCorps, you are not voting against Job Corps by voting against this \namendment. Job Corps is still alive under S. 143. We do not kill Job \nCorps with this proposal.\n  I have a letter--I suspect all my colleagues do--with a very \nimpressive list of many of my friends here in Washington, DC, advocacy \ngroups urging me to vote for this amendment. I will vote against this \namendment and say to my friends and those at-risk youths I believe the \nStates will in fact do a much better job.\n  We have a Job Corps facility in Nebraska. My guess is my Governor is \ngoing to say it does a good job; they are going to integrate it into \ntheir plan; they are not going to shut down the Job Corps Program in \nCrawford, NE, but they are going to integrate it into their development \nprogram. If it fails to do the job, Mr. President, they will know that \nthey cannot come back to Washington and have the Congress bail them \nout. They will know if they do not do the job, they will have to turn \nto their legislature and their own Governor and try to make a losing \nprogram still get funding by the taxpayers.\n  So I believe this amendment should be defeated because I think it \nactually undercuts long-term the support for the Job Corps Program. It \nis much more likely that this particular piece of legislation does the \nright kind of empowering, does empower people at the local level, \nempowers small business to participate in economic development markets, \nenables us to turn to taxpayers and say these 90 different job training \nprograms have been consolidated into one and we have tough requirements \nfor benchmarking and tough requirements for standards. You know that \nyou are going to get your money's worth in this program and much more \nlikely that taxpayers will be satisfied as well.\n  Perhaps most important for me, S. 143 is going to empower people at \nthe local level to get involved, trying to figure out what we can do to \nmake sure that half of the graduating class that goes directly into the \nwork force has the skills that the market says they need in order to \nget a job.\n  Increasingly, I talk to citizens who say: We are cut out of it; we do \nnot seem to have much power, much opportunity. We try to get to our \nschool boards to get help but we are not able to.\n  Mr. President, I request 2 additional minutes.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I yield the Senator 2 minutes.\n  Mr. KERREY. I say in conclusion, Mr. President, I think the amendment \nis well intended and I understand there is strong support for the Jobs \nCorps. I have been a strong supporter of Job Corps as well. But it is \nmuch more likely to survive if the taxpayers say: We are getting our \nmoney's worth if it is integrated into the State plan for job training \nand economic development.\n  So I hope my colleagues who support Job Corps will oppose this \namendment and make sure that S. 143 does in fact empower the people at \nthe local level.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will my colleague yield for a question on my time?\n  I just have one very brief question. I inquire of my colleague from \nNebraska if he would see a difference between the Job Corps in a State \nlike Nebraska, administered by a Governor like Governor Kerrey, or a \nState like Ohio, by my distinguished colleague, Senator DeWine, \ncompared to some of the other States in the United States where with a \nblock grant we might not be so confident that we have Job Corps \nmaintained?\n  Mr. KERREY. It is entirely possible that you are going to get \nsituations where Governors are less friendly to the Job Corps than I \nwould be or he might be, I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, but \none of the things that I have a difficult time with in general when it \ncomes to Federal programs is people at the local level say: We know \nthis thing is not working but the power to determine whether it \nsurvives reverts back to Washington.\n  And again I wish to say for emphasis there are some things that I do \nnot want to shift to the States. I do not want to shift income \nmaintenance to the States. I do not want to shift Medicaid to the \nStates. I would like to empower people to make more decisions when it \ncomes to health care, empower them to make more decisions. I do not \nwant the Federal bureaucracies to control all the decisions, but when \nit comes to job training and economic development I really see it as a \nState role.\n  I would love to get into a discussion of how we get a swap with the \nStates taking over things that are Federal responsibilities but saying \nto them where it is a State responsibility, you are going to be \nrequired to come up with your own money.\n  I would say to the Senator from Pennsylvania as well----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. KERREY. I know from my own State of Nebraska, when people \ncampaign for the office of Governor--I suspect it is similar to \nPennsylvania--the No. 1 question they have to answer is, What are you \ngoing to do to create jobs?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KERREY. Economic development is so important, no Governor is \ngoing to get away with shutting down a Job Corps center that is doing a \ngood job.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Harkin be added as \na cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to yield myself 7 minutes on \nthe bill. And then I will yield 5 minutes on the bill to the Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n  I want to speak in support of the amendment. I must say I was in such \nagreement with my good friend, Senator Kerrey, yesterday, and I am at \ndifference with him today. We are talking about the same subject \nmatters. But I very much appreciate his longstanding interest in terms \nof the training programs that have been developed out of the Human \nResources Committee under the leadership of Senator Kassebaum.\n  I want to also pay tribute to Senator DeWine, although I differ with \nhim on this issue as well. He has spent an enormous amount of time as a \nLieutenant Governor and in our committee in working across the partisan \nlines to bring focus and attention to at-risk youth in this country and \nhas made it one of his priorities. I think all of us that care about \nthe issue of at-risk youth are very much in his debt at this time and \nlook forward to working with him down the road on other ways that we \ncan be more effective.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to support the Job Corps amendment. \nThe committee bill on this issue is a classic case of throwing out the \nbaby with the bathwater. I strongly support the basic purpose of the \nbill, which is to consolidate the current overlapping and often \nconfusing array of Federal job training and job education programs. But \nit makes no sense to eliminate the Job Corps, which is a program that \nis not broken and does not need this kind of fixing. The Job Corps is a \nFederal program that works, and it deserves to remain a Federal \nprogram. It works extremely effectively to bring hope and opportunity \ninto the lives of tens of thousands of disadvantaged young men and \nwomen every year. And it works extremely cost effectively as well.\n  A study in the 1980's found that the Job Corps saves $1.46 in future \ncosts for crime and welfare for every $1 invested in the program. And \nthere have been more than 200 IG reviews of the Job Corps Program, and \nthey have been overwhelmingly in support of the Job Corps Program over \nthe period of these last 30 years.\n  I will just quote briefly the IG report of 1991 where it says, ``85 \npercent of the investment in Job Corps resulted in \n\n[[Page S 14968]]\nparticipants receiving measurable benefits.'' The GAO report of 1995: \n``Job Corps is serving its intended population. Employers who hire Job \nCorps students were satisfied with the students' work habits and \ntechnical training.''\n  Mr. President, the Job Corps has its problems, like any social \nprogram, dealing with the difficult challenges of assisting \ndisadvantaged youth and helping them to become productive and \nresponsible citizens. We can deal with the program's problems. No one \nis trying to sweep them under the rug. But it would be very wrong and \nhighly counterproductive to use these problems as a pretext to turn the \nentire Job Corps over to the States and abandon the many positive \nfeatures that far outweigh the problems in this innovative Federal \nprogram.\n  Any fair assessment of the Job Corps demonstrates its success. The \nJob Corps is a unique residential program that provides education and \ntraining for at-risk youth. It is national in scope. A third of Job \nCorps participants are enrolled in centers outside their own States. \nThat means Job Corps can offer a real choice to young men and women \nabout the kind of careers they want. If the Job Corps center in their \nState does not provide that kind of training, they can enroll in a \ncenter in another State that does. If we fragment this national focus \nand turn the Job Corps into 50 separate programs, at the option of each \nState, the obvious advantage of this impressive national capability \nwill be lost.\n  There is no question that Job Corps has succeeded in fulfilling its \nmission. In 1994, 73 percent of all the Job Corps participants were \nplaced in jobs, joined the military, or went on to some form of further \neducation. I will point out, in response to points that were made \nearlier about the issues of accountability for the Job Corps that \nincluded in the Specter-Simon amendment, there are required evaluations \nwhich look at placement rates, verified after 13 weeks, learning gains, \nplacement wages, dropout rates, enrollees obtaining GED's--all \ndifferent assessments and evaluations of the programs so that we will \nhave a closer review of the success of the programs and also its \nchallenges.\n  Finally, there is talk by some opponents of Job Corps of eliminating \nexcessive Federal bureaucracy. The total bureaucracy consists of a \ngrand total of about 190 officials. Some bureaucracy. It should be \nobvious to everyone that three to four officials per State cannot \nmanage the Job Corps if we turn the program over to the States. The \ncommittee bill is a prescription for increased Job Corps bureaucracy, \nnot reduced bureaucracy.\n  For all these reasons I urge the Senate to save the Job Corps. This \nis a vote for a Federal program that works. It is a vote for hope and \njobs and opportunity for young men and women across the country who \nneed our help the most. For them Job Corps is a lifeline. The Senate \nshould preserve it, not cut it off.\n  Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for yielding me this time off the \nbill. I did want to support the amendment and be a cosponsor of the \namendment because I feel so strongly that Job Corps has done an \noutstanding job. There have been problems. Yes, there have been \nproblems. I believe that we have addressed those problems. I believe \nthis amendment addresses those problems.\n  But just to arbitrarily close 25 centers around the United States and \nthen to turn this back over to the States with almost no benchmarks at \nall, I think would be the death knell for Job Corps, and it would be \nthe end of it. Job Corps, as has been stated so many times, I am sure, \nby people who have spoken on the floor of the Senate here, Job Corps \nserves our most disadvantaged youth. These are not young people who \nhave gone through high school and gotten good grades, maybe got a job; \nthese are hardcore, unemployed, disadvantaged youths. To close them \ndown would be a big mistake.\n  Despite the disadvantages of the youths that come into this program, \nthe program has succeeded. The last comprehensive study of Job Corps \nfound each $1 invested returns a $1.46. Last year, 73 percent of Job \nCorps students found jobs or entered higher education after leaving the \ncenters. I challenge any State-run job training program to match that \nkind of figure. You cannot find it anywhere--73 percent. Now, they may \nplace them, but in the Job Corps center that we have in Iowa, 95 \npercent of those found jobs with an average hourly wage of $6.20 an \nhour, and not minimum wage, more than minimum wage.\n  We have a Job Corps center in Denison, IA. I have to tell you, Mr. \nPresident, when this thing first started in Iowa, the Job Corps center, \nthey took over an old junior college that had gone under. When it first \nstarted in Denison--Denison is a small community, community of about \n6,700 people--when they thought about this Job Corps center there and \nthey were going to bring these inner-city kids in and kids who had been \non drugs, there was a public outcry, and it just about did not succeed \nin being located in Denison.\n  Finally, some cooler heads prevailed. They opened it up. And I can \ntell you, Mr. President, it has so much support in Denison and the \nsurrounding countryside you cannot believe it. I know my friend from \nNebraska was saying that we have got to get more local level \ninvolvement. You cannot get more local level involvement than what you \nhave in the Denison, IA, Job Corps Center and, I daresay, a lot of \nother Job Corps centers around the country because they work closely \nwith businesses in the community.\n  They are taught by people with skills in different occupations. They \ngo out and work among people, so they get to understand what it is like \nto be in the work force. And the people in the Denison area have \nsupported it overwhelmingly since it has come in. Five hundred kids a \nyear go through there. And I might add it is one of the handful of \ncenters that provides child care for students.\n  The child development center there opened in 1993. It allows parents \nto keep their children with them while they are enrolled in training \nprograms. So a young mother, maybe with one or two kids, can come \nthere, go through the program and keep her children with her. Children \nfrom 6 months to 2 years are in a developmental child care program. And \nat the Denison Job Corps Center, for children 3 to 5, we have a Head \nStart Program.\n  So, again, it is fully integrated with developmental for early \nchildhood, Head Start, and allow these kids to stay there with their \nparents.\n  As I said, Job Corps in Denison is the third largest employer. It has \n121 full-time employees and a $3.4 million annual payroll. And the \ncenter gives back to the community. It makes civic contributions. They \nbuilt a new press box at the high school athletic field. The kids went \nout and built it. They contributed to the community. They built a new \nstage for the Donna Reed Performing Arts Festival that we have annually \nto commemorate the hometown of Donna Reed.\n  So, again--I do not know--when I hear people say that we need more \nlocal involvement, you cannot get more local involvement than what we \nhave in the Job Corps Center in Denison, IA. We talk about turning it \nback to the States so they do not come to the Federal Government when \nthey get in trouble. The fact is, under the bill, if you turn it back \nto the States with almost no benchmarks, they would not run to the \nFederal Government because there is nothing for them to meet.\n  But under the amendment, we set up benchmarks, we set up strict \nguidelines on drug usage and that type of thing, and we make sure that \nthey meet certain stringent guidelines. So we have, I believe, \naddressed the problems that we have confronted in some Job Corps \ncenters.\n  I am not going to stand here and say every Job Corps center has been \nthe epitome of correctness and that they have been run right. But to \njust take a blunt meat-ax approach and cut them out is, I believe, the \nwrong way to go. I believe this amendment is the right way to go. It \nsolves the problems. It keeps the centers going. It, indeed, closes 10, \nbut not the 25, and it sets up the strict guidelines we need to make \nsure we do not have these problems in the future.\n  I urge those who want to make sure that we instill in these young \npeople \n\n[[Page S 14969]]\nfamily values and a work ethic so they can get out of the environment \nthey are in and put them in a new work environment in a community, you \ncannot beat the Job Corps for what they are doing. It is one of the \nbest investments we have ever made. I certainly hope we do not do away \nwith it, and I support the amendment wholeheartedly.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if the distinguished sponsor of the \nbill, Senator Kassebaum, would yield, I would like to ask her a few \nquestions about the impact this bill would have on Kentucky. Would the \nSenator yield for some questions?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Yes, I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Our State has six Job Corps Centers. These centers \ncurrently receive a total of approximately $51 million annually to \noperate. Does this bill target any of the Kentucky facilities for \nclosure?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. This bill does not target any particular facility, in \nKentucky or elsewhere, for closure.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The bill does provide that 25 centers will be closed \nover a 2-year period. How will the decisions on closure be made.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. The bill mandates that there be a national audit, \nover a 2-year period, of all Job Corps Centers, and that the national \nboard make recommendations, based on objective performance criteria, to \nthe Secretary of Labor. The national board will recommend that the 10 \nworst performing centers be closed in the first year after the audit, \nand that 15 additional poorly performing centers be closed in the \nfollowing year.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will particular States, for example, with a \ndisproportionate number of centers compared to the State's population, \nbe targeted for closures?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. No, there is no national formula established in this \nbill, based on geographic or population considerations. For allocating \nJob Corps funds, the only factors will be performance related. In fact, \nsection 161(c) specifically provides that each State will continue to \nreceive the same amount of funds for Job Corps even if any of the \nStates' centers are closed. In that case, the State could then use \nthose funds for other at-risk youth activities.\n  Among the factors that will be examined to determine the closure of \ncenters are: Whether the center has experienced high incidents of \ncriminal or violent activity; the physical condition of the facility; \nthe degree to which the center has State and local support; and the \ncosts of the center compared to other centers.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Kansas for her explanation.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I appreciate the interest of the Senator from \nKentucky in the impact of this bill upon his State. And, I would point \nout that, in the section of the bill dealing with other training \nprograms, the State of Kentucky, according to the Congressional \nResearch Service, will receive more funds than it currently receives. \nThe reason for this is that the bill alters the funding formula for job \ntraining programs, and based on the new formula, Kentucky should \nreceive a 4.2 percent increase in job training funds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator for her assistance.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I speak today in support of the Simon-\nSpecter amendment to the Workforce Development Act, which seeks to save \none of America's most important programs--Job Corps.\n  For over three decades, the Job Corps has received bipartisan support \nand has created a tradition of success. In this time, Job Corps has \nempowered 1.6 million of America's disadvantaged youth to become \nresponsible, tax-paying citizens.\n  Job Corps has proved its worth as a time-tested national program for \nat-risk youth. it is the only program offering a unique combination of \nresidential education, support services, job training, and placement \nservices.\n  This amendment reflects inspector general and Department of Labor \ntestimony and General Accounting Office data that do not suggest or \nrecommend State block granting as a means to improve Job Corps \naccountability.\n  The Workforce Development Act, as it currently exists, would close 25 \nJob Corps centers, one-fourth of the total Job Corps network. This \nrepresents an abandonment of $500 million in Federal facilities and the \nloss of thousands of jobs. The act would also currently end universal \naccess to Job Corps for students and creates State restrictions for Job \nCorps programs.\n  The Specter-Simon amendment takes a much more rational approach to \nJob Corps consolidation. The amendment would simply close 10 Job Corps \ncenters--5 by 1997 and 5 more by the year 2000, providing weaker \nperforming centers time to improve. It would preserve Job Corps as a \nnational program and protects national partnerships that provide \nessential support, training and job placement services along with \nuniversal access to Job Corps for all eligible at-risk youth, \nregardless where they reside.\n  Last year, 73 percent of Job Corps students found jobs with an \naverage wage of $5.50 or returned to higher education after leaving the \nprogram. These numbers speak volumes about the success of the Job Corps \nProgram.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to seek out Federal programs \nwithin each of their States that have proven track records. This is \nclearly one of those programs that has year-in and year-out provided \nthe necessary direction of millions of disadvantaged young Americans.\n  I applaud the work of my colleagues--Senators Simon and Specter, for \ntheir leadership, which strives to maintain a program so vital in each \nof our States. I believe this amendment will improve a Job Corps \nProgram already demonstrating continued success.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I would like to lay out in some detail \nwhy I have reached the conclusion that something is seriously wrong \nwith the Job Corps Program.\n  I know this program has broad bipartisan support. The Secretary of \nLabor has called Job Corps the crown jewel of all Federal training \nprograms. We have a Job Corps Center in Kansas, and I initially \nsupported that effort.\n  I strongly support the concept of a program that truly helps at-risk \nyouth finish their high school education, obtain marketable job skills \nand get a job on which they can build a career. But Job Corps, as it is \nnot operated by the Department of Labor, falls far short of delivering \non those promises.\n  For years, Job Corps has claimed it places 80 percent of its \nparticipants in jobs, the military, or in higher education. I was \nsurprised to learn, however, that half of the students dropped out in \ntheir first 6 months. Despite the fact that more than 50 percent of the \nstudents find their own jobs, Job Corps claims the majority of those \ndropouts as successful placements.\n  I also learned that Job Corps is by far the most expensive job \ntraining program operated by the Federal Government, with a budget of \n$1.2 billion. That translates to a cost of $23,000 for each student \nplacement, far more than the average State college tuition.\n  A year ago last June, I asked for a briefing by the Department of \nLabor inspector general, which has been monitoring Job Corps regularly \nfor the last several years. One of the most troubling of the inspector \ngeneral's findings was Job Corps' extremely high dropout rates. One-\nthird of new trainees drop out within the first 90 days and, as I said, \n50 percent leave within 6 months.\n  The IG also found that only 12 percent of students were being placed \nin jobs requiring the skills they learned in the program. The vast \nmajority of jobs found by Job Corps graduates were low-paying, low-\nskill positions.\n  The inspector general also questioned Job Corps' claimed placement \nrate of 80 percent. The IG found the actual number was closer to 60 \npercent. However, even this number is misleading because a job \nplacement is defined by Job Corps as being on the job for only 20 \nhours.\n  In addition to poor performance and high dropout rates, the IG found \nvery little accountability for Job Corps operators. The Department of \nLabor rarely took action to improve or upgrade centers that performed \npoorly year after year after year.\n  The inspector general also told me about an aspect of Job Corps about \nwhich, up until that time, I knew very little about. In addition to \noperating Job Corps Centers, the program also contracts out to \nemployers and labor unions for advanced training programs for Job Corps \ngraduates.\n  The inspector general examined one of these advanced training \nprograms \n\n[[Page S 14970]]\nfor computer skills and found the cost to be almost $37,000 per \nstudent. Yet, the contractor placed only 9 percent of the students in \njobs using the data processing skills they learned in the program.\n  Almost half of the program's students dropped out and were not \nplaced. Nearly one-fourth of so-called successful placements last less \nthan a year in the job. And yet, Mr. President, this contractor had his \ncontract renewed without competitive bidding.\n  In fact, none of these advanced training contracts--worth over $40 \nmillion--are subject to competitive bidding. Again, we found poor \nperformance and little accountability within Job Corps.\n  On October 4, 1994, the first oversight hearing in more than a decade \non Job Corps was held by the Senate Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee, and then-Chairman Kennedy, at my request.\n  The essence of the testimony presented by the Department of Labor was \nthat Job Corps was still an extremely successful program with minor \nproblems. Reports of violence in the centers were dismissed as minor \noccurrences blown out of proportion.\n  Yet following the oversight hearing, I began to receive disturbing \nphone calls and letters from parents, former Job Corps students and Job \nCorps employees about the violence that existed throughout the program.\n  On December 13, 1994, Job Corps provided me with information on \nserious incidents of violence and drug use on Job Corps centers. I was \ntold that 23 homicides were committed by Job Corps students between \n1992 and 1994.\n  For the same period, there were nearly 300 sexual assaults, 993 \nincidents of violence, and 416 serious drug-related incidents, all \ntaking place on Job Corps centers.\n  Worst of all, according to Job Corps' own figures, the program \nadmitted 4,520 students with a criminal record, and 9,678 students with \na history of psychological or emotional problems.\n  Mr. President, this flies in the face of the statute, which requires \nthat Job Corps enrollees be screened in order to prevent admission of \nstudents who will disrupt the program. It seems this requirement is \nroutinely ignored.\n  In January of this year, the Labor and Human Resources Committee held \ntwo days of oversight hearings to examine performance, accountability \nand the incidence of violence at Job Corps sites.\n  Only days before the hearings, a 19-year-old girl was murdered by \nthree other Job Corps students just outside the fence of the Knoxville \nJob Corps center. The police described the murder as ``ritualistic.''\n  Testimony at the hearing confirmed the pervasiveness of violence and \nlack of discipline throughout the program. The most compelling \nwitnesses were the students themselves. Rhonda Wheeler lasted 10 days \nat the McKinney Job Corps Center in Texas.\n\n       As for the violence on center, I saw twelve fights in the \n     ten days I was there . . . I went to clerical class because \n     that was one of my choices. Five minutes after I got there, \n     two students started punching each other. Both were bleeding \n     and one student picked up a typewriter and threw it at the \n     other . . . Illegal drugs were rampant at McKinney . . . It \n     was another one of those things that was part of the \n     atmosphere of the place.\n\n  Fred Freeman, Jr., a former student at the Woodstock Job Corps center \nin Maryland, made this statement:\n\n       The second night I got my ``blanket party.'' This was \n     standard treatment for new guys. A blanket party for those \n     not familiar with the term is when you are sleeping in your \n     bunk, somebody suddenly throws a blanket over you, and eight \n     to ten guys take turns punching and kicking you. I told the \n     residential advisor after it happened. He said he would \n     report it, but nothing ever happened.\n\n  Two weeks later, Freeman said:\n\n       Someone turned out the lights in the room and I was kicked \n     and punched by him and his buddies. About 20 guys jumped me, \n     and I got kicked from head to toe. After they left, my \n     roommate took me down to the duty officer and they took me to \n     Baltimore County Hospital. I had two cracked ribs and my \n     right temple was swollen up like a balloon . . . No one got \n     disciplined for the incident.\n\n  Shortly thereafter, the Knoxville Job Corps center was ordered closed \nby the Department of Labor. The McKinney Job Corps center was also \nclosed, thanks in no small part to the compelling testimony of the \nyoung witnesses before the Committee.\n  Following the hearings, the Department of Labor agreed to take action \nto strictly enforce a One-strike-and-your-out policy on violence and \ndrug use. Job Corps also identified, in conjunction with the inspector \ngeneral, more than 25 Job Corps centers considered to be problem \ncenters due to violence and consistent low performance.\n  While the new policy has helped, I am sorry to say the violence \ncontinues. About 6 weeks ago, a 20-year-old Job Corps student in \nOklahoma was murdered by two of his classmates.\n  Last June, the General Accounting Office released the results of a \nstudy I requested they conduct of Job Corps. These results only \nreinforced the inspector general's earlier conclusions. Mr. President, \nI think the title of the report speaks for itself: ``High Costs and \nMixed Results Raise Questions About Program's Effectiveness.''\n  The GAO reviewed outcomes for nearly 2,500 students terminees from \nsix Job Corps centers. This is some of what they found:\n  Nearly 70 percent of the students dropped out before completing \nvocational training. Of the 30-percent who graduated with a job skill, \nnearly two-thirds found no work or found a low-paying, no skill job.\n  The percentage of students obtaining jobs that matched their training \nwas only 13 percent. This corroborates the IG's earlier findings. GAO \nalso found that half of the graduates who do get jobs only lasted two \nmonths or less at first job.\n  Mr. President, I know that Job Corps is circulating information to \nshow that their performance has recently improved. My colleagues should \nbe aware that none of the recent figures have been independently \naudited, and if their past records are any indication, Job Corps \nnumbers are unreliable at best, intentionally misleading at worst.\n  The GAO also found that national training contractors who get paid \nsubstantial sums for finding students jobs, accounted for only 3 \npercent of all job placements. They also questioned the current Job \nCorps policy of awarding nine major national training contracts--at a \ncost of $41 million annually--without competitive bidding.\n  The report also noted that 84 percent of Job Corps vocational \ntraining is in construction, a field in which the number of job \nopenings have steadily declined.\n  Mr. President, why are we spending tens of million of dollars for \ntraining for jobs that don't exist? It is little wonder Job Corps' \nplacement rate is so low. We do a great disservice to our youth if we \ngive them the expectation of a job where none really exists.\n  The inspector general continues to question the improper use of \nmillions of dollars spent by Job Corps contractors, including some of \nthose awarded contracts on a sole source basis.\n  Some of the costs these contractors claimed were identified by the IG \nto include: liquor and dry cleaning bills for more than $100,000; \ntravel to China and South America by the president of one group; The \nson of the contractor's college tuition; $500,000 for an office in \nTokyo; $300 a night rooms in resort hotels; and excessive salary \nincreases and bonuses for company executives.\n  More recently, the inspector general found that Job Corps was forced \nto write off nearly $1.76 million owed by terminated students during \nprogram years 1992 to 1994. The write-offs were partly the result of \njob placement bonus payments to students which later proved to be \nnonexistent.\n  Mr. President, I could go on and on with more facts and figures. But \nI think the case for reform is clear. Even more compelling than the \nfacts and figures are the complaints I have received from students and \nstaff across the program, as recently as this past weekend.\n  Let me conclude with an excerpt of a letter I received from a Job \nCorps recruiter, dated August 1 of this year. He writes:\n\n       I could not morally, ethnically or consciously send my \n     friend's children and community members of Northeastern \n     Wisconsin to these (Job Corps) centers and expect them not to \n     be harmed physically and emotionally. . . .\n        . . . All in all, the program is very dysfunctional and \n     mismanaged at all levels of operation. It needs to be \n     reorganized. The best way of doing this is to block grant it \n     to the states. Let the states have responsibility for \n     assisting young adults into the program--the states have a \n     stronger commitment in helping become productive and well-\n\n[[Page S 14971]]\n     rounded individuals. This is not happening under such a mismanaged \n     oversized federal bureaucracy . . .\n\n  Mr. President, the amendment of the Senator from Pennsylvania will \nonly perpetuate a national program that has clearly gone awry. I urge \nmy colleagues to support true reform of the Job Corps Program, and \nreject the Specter amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I must reluctantly oppose the Specter \namendment. This is clearly a difficult vote for many of us, \nparticularly for those of us who strongly support Job Corps, because I \nknow there will be many who argue that a vote against the Specter \namendment represents a vote against the Job Corps Program. I want to \nmake it very clear that my vote should not in any way be interpreted as \na lack of support for the Job Corps Program. Quite the contrary is \ntrue. I have been a strong supporter of local Job Corps programs, and I \nbelieve my vote only reinforces that support.\n  Job Corps is our Nation's oldest, largest, and most comprehensive \nresidential training and education program for unemployed and under-\neducated youth. It is also one of the best-loved Federal programs we \nhave in place, and it has had strong bipartisan support over the past \nthree decades. I have heard all the accolades showered on Job Corps \nhere on the floor. I join my fellow Senators in their praises and I \nshare in their endorsement of the program.\n  However, as Senator Kassebaum has pointed out, over the past decade, \nJob Corps has fallen short of its promise. At any one time, Job Corps \nserves around 44,000 young men and women at a cost of around $23,000 \nper individual. That is a hefty investment. For the most part, it has \nbeen a worthwhile investment. But as hearings have shown, and as the \nDepartment of Labor and the inspector general have reported, there is \nincreasing evidence that the program is not meeting the needs of \nstudents or remaining fully accountable to the taxpayer.\n  Clearly, reform is in order. Both sides of the aisle acknowledge \nthis, the administration acknowledges this, and even Job Corps, I \nthink, would acknowledge this. And I think Senator Kassebaum  and \nSenator Specter largely agree on how we go about improving the program. \nFor example, both require a zero tolerance policy on drugs, alcohol and \nviolence. Both require an external audit to determine which centers are \nnot operating efficiently and closes those that perform poorly. Both \nrequire increased community participation and integration into the \nState's overall workforce development system.\n  I also want to make it clear that the underlying bill language does \nnot eliminate Job Corps. Nor does it eliminate or reduce the funding \nfor the program. Both the Specter amendment and the underlying bill \nacknowledge the role of the Job Corps Program, and there is certainly \nno intention of abolishing the program.\n  However, there is one major disagreement between the underlying bill \nand the Specter amendment. While the Specter amendment maintains the \nFederal oversight of the program, the Kassebaum bill places management \nfor the program where it belongs: with the local communities.\n  In New Mexico, we have two outstanding Job Corps Centers, one in \nAlbuquerque and one in Roswell. I have visited these centers, and I \nhave seen first hand the kind of work they do. They each have a no-\nnonsense approach to placement and training, and they get results. They \neach have a proven record of success, and I anticipate they will \ncontinue with this track record under a statewide workforce development \nsystem.\n  I know local Job Corps have expressed concern that if we turn \nmanagement over to the States, their administrative costs will go \nthrough the ceiling. The Department of Labor, for example, has \nestimated that the number of full-time staff will increase by 6.1 full-\ntime administrative staff per center, and that annual administrative \nexpenses will increase by $650,301 per center.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, I don't think the Department of Labor is \ngiving these centers enough credit. New Mexico's Job Corps Centers can \ndo a better job than that. New Mexico's Job Corps Centers already \nactively seek strong community involvement. With increased local \nactivity and control, our local centers can manage themselves more \nefficiently and can make an already successful program even better. But \nthe Department of Labor would have us believing otherwise.\n  If I sound as if I have high expectations of New Mexico's Job Corps \nCenter, it is because I do. Are my expectations unrealistic? I don't \nthink so. If Job Corps is truly made an integral part of the statewide \nsystem--and if our Governors seek the input of Job Corps Administrators \nwhen developing their State plans, as I believe they will--I think the \nreturns will be enormous.\n  I have full confidence that New Mexico's centers will continue in \ntheir remarkable records of success. When they have shown such promise, \nsuch a commitment to these young men and women, and have shown that \ntheir programs do make a difference, I think it would be a shame not to \nlet them take control of their own programs. Why must we continue to \ninsist that Federal management of the program is necessary to maintain \nthe integrity of the program? Again, let's give our local centers a \nlittle credit.\n  I do not believe this program marks the end of Job Corps. If \nanything, I believe it marks a new beginning for a program with a great \ndeal of potential. My vote today reflects my commitment to ensuring \nthat Job Corp lives up to that potential by sending the decision-making \nhome and into the hands of those who have shown that they can produce \nresults: the local communities.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank New Mexico's Job Corps Centers for all \ntheir input during this debate, especially the input of Sue Stevens, \nprogram director of admissions and placement. I want them to know that \nmy vote reflects my full confidence in their abilities to continue Job \nCorps' tradition of excellence in New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas has 3 minutes and 30 \nseconds; the Senator from Pennsylvania has 2 minutes and 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I yield myself 10 minutes on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I would like to answer some of the \nquestions that have come up during the course of this debate, but first \nI would like to thank the Senator from Ohio for an excellent statement \non exactly why the language that is in the bill answers the concerns \nthat we have for the population being served by Job Corps centers. This \nis one of the reasons I must oppose the amendment offered by Senator \nSpecter and Senator Simon.\n  What is of concern to us is the at-risk youth population. The Job \nCorps is not on the chopping block. The same amount of funding will go \nfor Job Corps centers. The Denison center in Iowa is an excellent Job \nCorps center, and there is not any reason to believe that operation \nwill necessarily change, except it will be under the responsibility of \nthe State instead of the Federal Government. This means the State can \ncontract with a private contractor to continue running the center or \nany center that is being run by a private contractor. That does not \nchange for those centers.\n  As to the question about whether a Governor will be responsive, any \nGovernor worth his salt is going to care about the population of his or \nher State. Certainly, the most vulnerable population is the one that we \nare trying to reach with improving and building on what was started \nwith the Job Corps Program. The Job Corps was an excellent idea and is \nan excellent purpose still.\n  But, Mr. President, I hear over and over again that this is a very \ndifficult group of young people to train and we should not expect a \nhigh success rate. I could not disagree with this view more. I think we \ndo a disservice to the very young people that we are wanting to reach, \nand we are sending them a message that somehow they are at risk and \nthis is the best they can do. When we fail to challenge at-risk youth \nwe peg them by saying that the best they can do are menial jobs. Many \ntimes that is where they ultimately end up after \n\n[[Page S 14972]]\nspending time in the Job Corps Program, and we will never help them to \nmove toward a better future.\n  I will be glad to yield in just a moment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just have one question.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I feel very strongly that in our \ndesire to try and improve upon the record of the Job Corps centers. We \nare really wanting to say that we need to be able to look at a \ndifferent delivery service that will help us meet a growing population, \nat-risk youth, and which I think can be held to greater success by \nstronger accountability.\n  Frankly, I think it is rather patronizing to suggest that these \nchildren cannot be motivated and accept the kind of discipline that \nthey need to have to be higher achievers. We must do better, and we can \ndo better.\n  Father Cunningham of Detroit, MI, who runs a program called Focus \nHope, and has done a superb job with that program, takes inner-city \nyouth from Detroit and turns them into machinists and engineers. He has \na remediation program which increases the math and reading levels of \nat-risk youth at the third and fourth grade levels in 7 weeks. It can \nbe done. I have seen other programs that do the same thing. He has a 6-\nmonth machinist training program that places graduates in jobs, often \non an auto assembly line in Detroit earning $12 to $15 an hour to \nstart. He has created a university-level school of engineering to train \nthese same at-risk youth to be engineers at Chrysler and Ford and \nGeneral Motors.\n  How has he done that? He does that by challenging them to be the best \nthat they can be, by really making sure that they themselves are going \nto be self-disciplined enough to care about the program and strong work \nrequirements that they have to meet.\n  That is what the Job Corps is supposed to be all about. I think we \nhave seen a population that has changed since the beginning of the Job \nCorps Program, and we need to recognize that change and provide some of \nthe requirements that will allow it to be what it should be.\n  I feel very strongly that we must recognize that we are falling short \nof the promise that the Job Corps Program has made. At a cost of almost \n$23,000 per student each year taxpayers are not getting their money's \nworth. More importantly, the at-risk youth for whom the program was \ndesigned are all too often being left empty handed as well.\n  The placement rate was mentioned by the Senator from Iowa. Different \nfigures will meet different facts. Maybe it is 73 percent; maybe it is \na much lower rate. But the important thing is that the placement rate \nin the Job Corps Program right now is being based on finding a job for \n20 hours. If a person finds a job for 20 hours, that then is the \nplacement rate on which that percentage is based. I do not think that \nis really the kind of figure that we need to strive for and I think we \ndo a real disservice to the youth who are in the program.\n  In short, I feel strongly the Job Corps must change. Rather than \nleaving assistance for these vulnerable young men and women in the \nhands of the Federal Government, as the amendment before us offered by \nSenator Specter and Senator Simon would do, S. 143 would return the \nprogram to where I believe it best belongs--the community.\n  I suggest, again, what S. 143 does not do, because there have been \nmany myths that have gone around about what would be accomplished under \nthe Workforce Development Act. It does not eliminate the Job Corps, and \nit is not just another job training program. It does not eliminate \nresidential capability. That is entirely a decision that would be made \nby the Governor, and my guess is that where there is a residential \nprogram that is going well it will be maintained.\n  It does not reduce funding for the Job Corps, and Senator Specter, \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee for these funds, has \nalways maintained a strong support funding level for Job Corps. It is \nin a section of a bill for at-risk youth. And if that amount of money \nis not used on the Job Corps center, as designed for use by the State, \nit stays with the at-risk youth program. It cannot be used somewhere \nelse. As the Senator from Ohio says, it puts a star behind the at-risk \nyouth, which is where we want to focus. It does not prohibit the use of \nJob Corps centers by private contractors. It will not prevent well-run \ncenters from operating. It will not prevent construction of newly \nproposed centers. It does not prevent a State from recruiting \nnonresident students. It links Job Corps centers to the community and \nstatewide training systems established under the bill. It gives States, \nnot the Federal Government, the primary responsibility for the \noperation of the Job Corps centers. It eliminates wasteful national \ncontracting abuses documented extensively by the GAO and the inspector \ngeneral. It closes the 25 consistently poor-performing centers as \ndetermined by an independent audit. It establishes strong antiviolence \nand antidrug policies at the Job Corps centers and reforms the entire \nprogram by returning Job Corps to local control, which I believe can be \nand is a proven recipe for success.\n\n  I just suggest, Mr. President, that we sometimes have to be willing \nto be innovative and take some risks. This is not to, in any way, \ndiminish the concept or the idea of the Job Corps program. It was a \ngreat concept when it was initiated. I believe it continues to have \nmerit. I suggest that we are in a different time, with a different at-\nrisk population of youth today that need to be addressed in a different \nway. It is not the same young men and women today that need assistance \nthat were once there when the program started. We have to be willing to \nchange it here and provide some different guidance to make it a more \nconstructive, successful program.\n  Mr. President, I reserve any time that I may have remaining.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 2 minutes 30 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 1 minute 15 seconds to my cosponsor.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, someone said this does not kill the Job \nCorps. It sure severely wounds it. I have not had a letter from a \nsingle Governor saying we want to do this. Yet, the Job Corps in \nDenison, IA, and Golconda, IL, across State lines, takes care of \npeople. That will not happen anymore.\n  Look at the language of the bill:\n\n       The State shall use a portion of the funds made available \n     through the allotment to maintain the center . . .\n\n  A portion. That means 5 percent, 50 percent. Mostly, these are \nresidential right now. You can be sure if the State can save that money \nand use it for some other purpose, they are going to knock out those \nresidential centers. Make no mistake about it, if you vote against the \nSpecter-Simon amendment, you are voting to severely wound the Job \nCorps.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know the proponents of the amendment \nwanted to speak last, so I will yield myself 2 minutes on the bill.\n  Mr. President, the reason for the job Corps is probably more urgent \ntoday than at any other time. We set national priorities. We said the \nHead Start and other national programs are a national priority. We take \nthe title I program for young people to try and bring them up, to try \nto make sure they are going to be competitive in our public education \nsystem. I think if we look around this country, these are the \nindividuals that, without at least a helping hand, are going to fall \ninto the class of the criminal element in our society.\n  This is the last best chance. The only problem I have with the \nSenator from Kansas is when she says we have problems and therefore we \nought to take this rather dramatic step which, as I think the Senator \nfrom Illinois points out, can really undermine or end the program.\n  We say, let us do the evaluation and strengthen the program, let us \nbuild on this program, let us find out what needs to be done and deal \nwith its particular problems. That is what this issue is. Are we going \nto give a focus and attention to the young people of this country that \nneed focus and attention the most? I believe that is what is behind \nthis amendment. I hope that it will be accepted.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  (Mr. GORTON assumed the Chair.)\n  \n[[Page S 14973]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. President, I agree with my distinguished colleague from Kansas \nwhen she says that we have a different group of youth. But I say that \nthe differences in our society today from when the Job Corps was \nestablished, simply underscores the need for intensive job training and \nintensive care and intensive effort be made to see that the young \npeople in America are trained to hold jobs and do not require welfare \nor enter the crime cycle.\n  My colleague and cosponsor from Illinois puts his finger on a key \npoint, and that is that under a changed position of the bill there \nwould be only an obligation to use a portion of the funds. Although we \nhave $1.1 billion allocated, that really is not too much.\n  Mr. President, the four Job Corps centers which are available in my \nhome State of Pennsylvania have done really an outstanding job. I had \noccasion to visit the Job Corps training center in Denison, IA--an \noutstanding job. My able staffer, Craig Higgins, has visited Job Corps \ncenters across the country and finds an outstanding job. It is true \nthat there are some that need to be closed. Our bill, in a more \nmodulated way, provides for closure of 10 Job Corps centers, plus more \nclosures if it is determined, after an audit, that more ought to be \nclosed.\n  I believe that in an era where we are looking to block grants, we \nought to proceed with a bit of caution, and that a program like Job \nCorps, with remedial reform measures, as suggested by GAO and Senator \nKassebaum, will enable Job Corps to complete this very important \nfunction.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at this point a letter to \nme from the National Job Corps Coalition, setting forth an impressive \nlist of sponsors be printed in the Record; that a letter from the \nPennsylvania Job Corps Leadership Coalition, with a recitation of a \nconsiderable number of student success stories, as compiled by the \nPennsylvania Job Corps Leadership Coalition, be printed in the Record; \nthat an open letter to Congress from the Secretaries of Labor and \nAssistant Secretaries endorsing the Job Corps center be printed in the \nRecord; that a letter from Mayor Tom Murphy of the city of Pittsburgh \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     National Job Corps Coalition,\n\n\n                                        National Headquarters,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 1995.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: On behalf of the more than 70 \n     undersigned organizations representing business, labor, non-\n     profit, advocacy and volunteerism, we are writing to express \n     our collective and strong support for the Job Corps amendment \n     that you and Senator Simon will offer during consideration of \n     S. 143, the Workforce Development Act.\n       This amendment reflects 3 decades of solid bipartisan \n     support for Job Corps and its tradition of success. Over the \n     past 30 years, Job Corps has empowered more than 1.6 million \n     of America's dis-advantaged youth to become responsible, tax-\n     paying citizens.\n       We support the Specter-Simon Job Corps amendment because it \n     preserves Job Corps as America's time tested national program \n     for at-risk youth. It is the only program offering a unique \n     combination of residential education, support services, job \n     training and placement services. The amendment incorporates \n     reforms suggested by the Inspector General, Department of \n     Labor, Congressional testimony and General Accounting Office \n     data. It should be noted that none of these reports and \n     studies have recommended a state block grant approach as a \n     means to improve or strengthen Job Corps' performance or \n     accountability.\n       We are encouraged that the amendment preserves universal \n     access to all eligible at-risk youth in need of Job Corps \n     comprehensive services--regardless of where they live. \n     Additionally, the amendment will continue to provide these \n     youth access to strong national and regional labor markets \n     for job placement. Overall, the Specter-Simon amendment \n     codifies the strongest reforms to the program in Job Corps \n     history. We support these reform efforts.\n       Senator Specter, we appreciate that you recognize that S. \n     143, as currently drafted, is counter to all other \n     evaluations, recommendations and reforms offered in the \n     spirit of helping young people through Job Corps. Your \n     amendment will maintain Job Corps so that another 1.6 million \n     youth will be able to participate in our nation's most \n     effective residential education and training program.\n           Respectfully,\n                                            LaVera Leonard, Ed.D.,\n                              Chair, National Job Corps Coalition.\n\n\n    organizations committed to support the specter-simon job corps \n                               amendment\n\n       AFL-CIO Appalachian Council; AFL-CIO International \n     Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades; AFL-CIO \n     International Union of Operating Engineers; AFL-CIO National \n     Maritime Union of America; AFL-CIO United Auto Workers; Alpha \n     Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.; American Youth Policy Forum; \n     Association of Jewish Family & Children's Agencies; Bread for \n     the World; Career Systems Development Corporation; Cavillo \n     and Associates; Center for Law & Social Policy; Cherokee \n     Nation of Oklahoma; Child Welfare League of America, Inc.; \n     Children's Defense Fund; Chugash Development Corporation; \n     Coalition on Human Needs; Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; \n     Council of Jewish Federations; Coyne American Institute; Dau, \n     Walker & Associates; Dynamic Education Systems, Inc.; and \n     DMJM/HTB.\n       Education Management Corporation; Empire State Organization \n     of Youth Employment Services; Fresh Air Fund; FEGS--New York \n     City; General Electric Government Services; Grand Rapids \n     Public Schools; Home Builders Institute, the educational arm \n     of the National Association of Home Builders; International \n     Masonry Institute; ITT Job Training Services, Inc.; Jobs for \n     Youth--Boston; Jobs for Youth--New York; Joint Action in \n     Community Service; League of United Latin American Citizens; \n     Management and Training Corporation; The MAXIMA Corporation; \n     MINACT, Inc.; National Assocation of Child Care Resource and \n     Referral Agencies.\n       National Child Labor Committee; National Association of \n     Social Workers; National Congress of American Indians; \n     National Youth Employment Coalition; National Urban League; \n     Operative Plasterers and Cement Masons International; \n     Opportunities Industrialization Centers for America; Pacific \n     Education Foundation; Puerto Rico Volunteer Youth Corps; Res-\n     Care, Inc.; Teledyne Economic Development Company; Texas \n     Educational Foundation; The EC Corporation; Training and \n     Development Corporation; Training and Management Resources; \n     Transportation Communications International Union; Tribal \n     Council of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the \n     Flathead Indian Reservation; and Tuskegee University.\n       United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America; \n     U.S. Conference of Mayors; U.S. Department of Agriculture--\n     Forest Service; U.S. Department of the Interior--Bureau of \n     Reclamation; U.S. Department of the Interior--Fish and \n     Wildlife; U.S. Department of the Interior--National Park \n     Service; U.S. Department of Labor; University of Nevada--\n     Reno; Utah Youth Employment Coalition; Vinnell Corporation; \n     Wackenhut Educational Services, Inc.; Women Construction \n     Owners and Exces.; Women in Community Service; American G.I. \n     Forum Women; Church Women United; National Council of \n     Catholic Women; National Council of Jewish Women; National \n     Council of Negro Women; YWCA of U.S.A.; YWCA of Los Angeles; \n     and Youth Build USA.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            Pennsylvania Job Corps\n\n\n                                         Leadership Coalition,\n\n                                Edwardsville, PA, October 5, 1995.\n     Sen. Arlen Specter,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: I write on behalf of the Pennsylvania \n     Job Corps Leadership Coalition to applaud your efforts to \n     save Job Corps. The Amendment you and Senator Simon are \n     cosponsoring is testimony to your support of this one-of-a-\n     kind program. It is also a credit to your leadership and \n     vision, as you have forged a bipartisan alliance that \n     institutes reforms but retains Job Corps' national mission.\n       The PJCLC continues to be adamantly opposed to the Job \n     Corps provisions of the Workforce Development Act (S. 143) as \n     its passage would be detrimental to the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania and its four Job Corps campuses. S. 143 mandates \n     the closure of 25 centers, but exempts those states with one \n     or no centers. The burden of center closures would fall \n     disproportionately on states with more than one center, such \n     as ours. State management would force an untested \n     Pennsylvania administrative system to operate the most \n     complex and challenging of programs for at-risk youth.\n       The failure of your amendment would constitute a national \n     tragedy as thousands of young people would be deprived of the \n     opportunity that is Job Corps. Its passage will mean the \n     chance of the American Dream for millions more. Thousands of \n     Pennsylvanians stand tall in their support of the Specter/\n     Simon Amendment to S. 143. Thank you for your unwavering \n     commitment to and steadfast support of Pennsylvania and \n     America's Job Corps.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Eric S.

The Workforce Development Act (S. 143), puts Job \n     Corps' future in jeopardy. If passed, it will close 25 \n     centers and turn operations of our nation's most challenging \n     residential education and job training program over to the \n     States. In 30 years, no state has successfully operated such \n     a program. The legislation ignores Job Corps' solid track \n     record of success and invites a risky and tenuous future.\n       This bill is in sharp contrast to all other job training \n     consolidation recommendations including the House of \n     Representatives CAREERS Act of 1995, which has strong \n     bipartisan support.\n       Four million young people in the U.S. are in need of the \n     basic education, job skills and job placement assistance only \n     offered by Job Corps. Most youth who enroll in Job Corps have \n     inadequate education. Most do not have the skills or \n     attitudes needed to find and keep good jobs. All are from \n     poor families.\n       Job Corps is a solution for them. Over the years, Job Corps \n     has helped 1.6 million young men and women become self-\n     sufficient citizens. Job Corps is the nation's oldest, \n     largest, most comprehensive and cost-effective residential \n     education and training program for disadvantaged youth \n     between the ages of 16 and 24. Seven out of 10 graduates get \n     jobs or enter further education. Job Corps works. Job Corps \n     should remain a national program because: Job Corps is cost-\n     effective.\n       Job Corps is a public-private partnership that ensures \n     consistently good residential education and training services \n     for young people. Residential services are among the most \n     complex services offered to youth. Few states have the \n     expertise or desire to take on this challenge.\n       Job Corps returns $1.46 for every dollar invested in it \n     through increased taxes paid by graduates and decreased costs \n     of crime, incarceration and welfare.\n       Job Corps uses economies of scale to offer comprehensive \n     services, including basic education, job training, \n     counseling, social skills training, medical care, and \n     leadership training. All this costs just $65 a day per \n     student.\n       Job Corps is accountable. No other job training program is \n     so rigorously monitored. Job Corps is evaluated on national, \n     regional, and local levels, by the private and public \n     sectors, and by the Inspector General and Government \n     Accounting Office.\n       Job Corps is also fiscally accountable to America's \n     taxpayers. Those who complete the Job Corps program boost \n     their earnings by 15 percent. While in Job Corps, young \n     people jump an average of two grade levels. They are most \n     likely to complete high school and attend college.\n       Job Corps is accessible. Job Corps has always been \n     available to all eligible youth.\n       If the Workforce Development Act of 1995 passes, local \n     youth will not have equal access to Job Corps. All young \n     people in need of Job Corps' comprehensive services should \n     have the opportunity to succeed--like millions before them--\n     regardless of state boundaries. Job Corps graduates should \n     also be able to continue crossing state lines to take \n     advantage of strong job markets.\n       Job Corps is a part of its community. Job Corps centers \n     work for youth and for their communities. Job Corps students \n     across the U.S. have completed more than $42 million in \n     construction and service projects for their communities, \n     including flood and disaster relief.\n       The American public, Congress and Administration should be \n     proud of Job Corps. We implore the Members of Congress from \n     both sides of the aisle to continue your support for Job \n     Corps as a distinct national program.\n\n     Peter J.

Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: I understand that the Senate will be \n     taking up Senator Dole's welfare reform package (H.R. 4) in \n     the next few weeks. I am writing to express my concerns about \n     the decision to incorporate Senator Kassebaum's workforce \n     development consolidation legislation into this package.\n       First, as you know, I support efforts to consolidate our \n     nation's training and employment programs. Members of the \n     Pittsburgh Private Industry Council, appointed by me, assure \n     me that clients, service providers and employers will all \n     benefit from a more coherent workforce development system.\n       I do not believe, however, that welfare reform provides an \n     adequate context in which to address workforce development \n     consolidation. Although many welfare recipients receive \n     services, employment and training programs benefit a much \n     broader clientele. In order to ensure their diverse needs are \n     considered, workforce development legislation deserves its \n     own forum.\n       Such a forum would provide you and your colleagues with the \n     opportunity to analyze the provisions of the Workforce \n     Development Act in depth. At least two aspects require \n     attention. First, local governance is still an issue. \n     Although the legislation refers to local workforce \n     development boards, there is no guarantee that these \n     employer-driven boards will continue to play a strong role in \n     the planning and implementation of employment and training \n     programs. Having worked closely with the Pittsburgh Private \n     Industry Council, I understand the extent of expertise and \n     experience that members bring.\n       Second, the legislation contains a provision that \n     jeopardizes the future of Job Corps. The Pittsburgh Job Corps \n     center is vital to the region. Since 1972, it has provided \n     opportunities for disadvantaged youth to develop the \n     attitudes and skills required for productive employment. \n     Given the high rate of unemployment, particularly among \n     African-Americans, employment and training programs like Job \n     Corps represent a critical component of our economic \n     development strategy.\n       The proposed legislation would transfer governance of Job \n     Corps to the states without providing any incentives for \n     continued operation. Furthermore, twenty-five unspecified \n     centers would be closed. In light of the evidence \n     demonstrating Job Corp's success with at-risk populations, \n     these measures are unjustified and should be stricken.\n       In summary, I urge you to support efforts to decouple the \n     Workforce Development Act from H.R. 4. If these efforts are \n     not successful, I request your assistance in ensuring that my \n     concerns about local governance and the future of the Job \n     Corps program are addressed.\n       Thank you for your attention.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Tom Murphy,\n     Mayor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                  \n[[Page S 14975]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I \nreserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-five seconds remain.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. How much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3 minutes 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I yield briefly to the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the Senator \nfrom Illinois and the Senator from Pennsylvania. They are absolutely \ncorrect in what they read. But the rest of the story is that all of \nthat money, in that area, that title, has to be spent for at-risk \nyouth. So it is not a question of the State being able to take part of \nthat money and divert it over here for some other purpose. You cannot \neven use it for some other purpose that has to do with job training. It \nhas to specifically be targeted at at-risk youth. To me, that is the \nsignificant part.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I appreciate the observation made by \nthe Senator from Ohio. He is exactly correct. In the section of the \nbill that is ``At Risk Youth'' there is an authorization for $2.1 \nbillion, of that, $1.1 billion is for Job Corps.\n  If there are any savings to be found in Job Corps with the \nelimination of extra administration layers that money stays with the \nat-risk program in this section.\n  I cannot stress enough that those centers being well run will \ncontinue to be well run. I appreciate the Senator from Pennsylvania \nsaying that the intensive training and intensive care are things that \nwe would all want to accomplish with these initiatives.\n  I believe strongly that it can be better done by the State than by \nthe Federal Government at this point in time. I hope that my colleagues \nwould oppose the Specter-Simon amendment.\n  I yield the floor and yield my time back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 25 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand that it is the desire of the \nleader to conclude the debate on this and then move to the conclusion \nof the Ashcroft amendment, of which there was a 20-minute time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a memorandum \nto me from Craig Higgins and Jim Sourwine be printed in the Record, as \nwell as a table on the impact of the Job Corps in Pennsylvania.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n                                                 October 10, 1995.\n     To: Senator Specter.\n     From: Craig Higgins and Jim Sourwine.\n     Re: Staff visits to Job Corps Centers.\n       As per your direction, outlined below is a description of \n     staff visits to Job Corps centers.\n\n\n                      Timberlake Job Corps Center\n\n       January 1990, staff visited the Timberlake Job Corps Center \n     outside of Estacada, Oregon. Estacada is a small town located \n     high in the Cascade mountains about 2 hours from Portland, \n     Oregon. It is a Civilian Conservation Corps center operated \n     by the Forrest Service serving about 250 students annually. \n     The strength of their training programs was in forestry \n     related jobs, however, they did offer vocational training in \n     some construction trades, culinary arts and building \n     maintenance. What was most striking was that the majority of \n     the students were not from Oregon, but from large urban \n     areas, such as Detroit, Chicago and Los Angeles. Most of the \n     kids had been uprooted from their ``street life'' in the city \n     and been transported high in the mountains of the Northwest \n     to study and receive vocational training. There was nothing \n     else to do but to study. The nearest town was 8 miles down \n     the mountain and was not much more than a gas station, a \n     country store, and a post office. Therefore, according to the \n     staff, the kids worked hard to finish their training so they \n     could get back to ``civilization.'' Additionally, the staff \n     reported most of the students who completed their training \n     did not return home to the big cities, but found jobs in the \n     Northwest.\n       The Kassebaum bill establishes Job Corps as a state-based \n     program and would eliminate the possibility of students from \n     Chicago or Detroit from receiving training from a center in \n     Oregon, Pennsylvania or Arizona. For some kids, being far \n     from the home environment is just what they need.\n\n\n                       Woodstock Job Corps Center\n\n       In 1988 or 1989, staff visited the Woodstock Job Corps \n     Center located in Randallstown, Maryland. This was a large \n     center which served approximately 500 students annually. The \n     majority of the students came from the Baltimore/Washington \n     area. The bulk of the training offered was in the \n     construction trades and the culinary arts. This was a clean, \n     well organized, center on property which had once been a \n     monastery. Center staff reported having good ties with local \n     businesses in the construction trades, which made job \n     placement once the training was completed easier. The one \n     problem identified was the difficulty in getting to jobs in \n     suburban communities due to the lack of transportation.\n       At the time of the visit, Center staff reported that while \n     there were discipline problems, they were controllable and \n     were not unexpected given the size of the center and the \n     severely disadvantaged population they served. In recent \n     years, however, the Center has had more serious problems with \n     violence.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                  IMPACT OF JOBS CORPS IN PENNSYLVANIA                  \n        [Data for Program Year 1994 (July 1, 1994-June 30, 1995)]       \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                             In percent--               \n                                       -----------------------          \n                                           Total                Average \n                                          overall   Placement    hourly \n                                         placement   rate job     wage  \n                                         rate (all   training           \n                                        terminees)    match             \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKeystone JCC..........................        74.8       68.0      $5.61\nPhiladelphia JCC......................        90.4       61.0       6.28\nPittsburgh JCC........................        74.8       47.9       5.37\nRed Rock JCC..........................        80.1       66.5       5.53\n                                       ---------------------------------\n    Pennsylvania Composite rates......        80.0       60.9       5.70\n    National rates....................        73.0       47.0      6.16 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Pennsylvania provided service for approximately 3,000 at-risk     \n  youth of which 65% were from Pennsylvania and 35% were from other     \n  states.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside \nthe pending amendment offered by Senator Specter; that the Senate \nresume consideration of the Ashcroft amendment numbered 2893; that \nthere be 20 minutes of debate equally divided in the usual form on that \namendment, to be followed by 4 minutes equally divided for debate on \nthe Specter amendment, to be followed by a vote on or in relation to \nthe Specter amendment; further, that following that debate there be an \nadditional 4 minutes debate on the Ashcroft amendment numbered 2893, to \nbe followed by a vote on or in relation to the Ashcroft amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2893\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the Ashcroft amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2893.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is located in the Record of Tuesday, \nOctober 10, 1995.)\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for providing this \ntime for explanation and debate regarding the amendment I have \nproposed.\n  The amendment which I have proposed is an amendment which would allow \nus to target and focus our scarce job training resources on individuals \nwho would be most likely to use those resources effectively, most \nlikely to benefit from training.\n  The amendment requires random drug testing for all job training \napplicants. The number of the individuals tested and the frequency \nwould be left to the localities. The amendment would also ask the \nStates to test participants in the program based on a standard of \nreasonable suspicion. If an applicant or participant tested positive \nthey could reapply after 6 months from the date of disqualification but \nthey must show for reapplication that they passed a drug test within \nthe last 30 days.\n  Mr. President, as the chart behind me indicates, 89 percent of all \nthe manufacturers test for drug utilization; 88 \n\n[[Page S 14976]]\npercent of all people in the transportation industry. It is true that \nin the financial services sector only 47 percent of employers test for \ndrugs. The fact of the matter is, however, we are not in the business \nof developing mutual fund managers. We are talking about applicants and \nparticipants who will seek jobs in major industries like manufacturing \nand transportation.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that if we have a scarce resource, we \nought to focus it on individuals who will be able to get jobs at the \nconclusion of the program. Those individuals who are going to be placed \nare the ones who are drug-free.\n  Let us not perpetuate the myth that you can travel down the road of \ndrug utilization and job development at the same time. You cannot. The \ntruth of the matter is if you want a job, you are going to have be \ndrug-free. These are the facts, and to suggest otherwise is both \ninaccurate and inappropriate.\n  So a vote ``yes'' for this amendment is a vote for the belief that a \nfinite resource should be focused on individuals who are employable.\n  Are we interested in saving millions of dollars for the taxpayers? \nThat is what the American people have asked us to do. Why should we \nspend thousands of dollars to train individuals who are going to hit \nthis wall? Do we want to reduce the $140 billion companies lose to \ndrug-addicted workers every year?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 6 minutes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I yield myself another minute and 30 seconds.\n  The National Institute on Drug Abuse indicates that $140 billion a \nyear is lost in this country from theft, loss of productivity, \naccidents, and absenteeism related to drug use. Let us send a clear \nmessage that drug use is incompatible with the kind of productive \nemployment necessary to our survival.\n  I think an intelligent policy is to say that we should have a random \ndrug testing policy. Random testing will send a clear signal that drug \nutilization and job training are incompatible. A message that the \nCongress has failed to send in the past, but that we can and should \nsend today.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri would \nrequire applicants and participants in job training programs to submit \nto drug testing. I am opposed to the amendment because it represents an \nunwarranted and unprecedented intrusion into the privacy of the \nthousands of ordinary Americans who use job training services.\n  In addition, the amendment is a costly and unfunded Federal mandate. \nOne of the innovations of this job training bill is the degree of \nflexibility it gives States and localities. The Ashcroft amendment is \ncompletely out of step with that goal.\n  Drug testing has an important role in certain job training settings, \njust as it has in certain workplace settings. But the proposal by the \nSenator from Missouri is overbroad, excessively expensive, and an \nexample of the intrusive Federal policy role that this bill is designed \nto combat.\n  The vast majority of the people who will use the job training \nservices authorized in this bill are upstanding citizens, not \ncriminals. They are displaced defense workers. They are blue collar \nworkers who have been laid off as a result of a factory closing. They \nare professionals seeking to improve their skills in specialized \nfields.\n  The Ashcroft amendment says to these people: If you want this \nassistance to try to improve your skills and obtain employment, you \nhave to agree to submit to a Government test for possible drug abuse. I \ndo not believe that the privacy of ordinary citizens hoping to improve \ntheir job skills should be routinely invaded in this intrusive manner.\n  The Government uses drug testing today for airline pilots, train \nconductors, and other employees involved in sensitive public safety \ntasks. If programs funded by this bill train people in sensitive jobs, \nthere is nothing that would prohibit drug testing.\n  But routinely testing of everyone is too extreme. We do not do it in \nother programs, and we should not do it in this one.\n  We do not drug-test people seeking Government assistance in financing \na mortgage; we do not drug-test flood or earthquake victims applying \nfor disaster relief; we do not drug-test crime victims seeking \nassistance from the Federal Office of Victim Services; we do not drug-\ntest farmers seeking crop subsidies.\n  We do not drug-test corporate executives seeking overseas marketing \nassistance from the Commerce Department.\n  Why are job training recipients singled out for this stigma? No case \nhas been made that this population is more susceptible to drug abuse \nthan the population at large.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri requires drug \ntesting in two situations. First, every applicant to a job training \nprogram is subject to testing on a random basis. Second, participants \nin training programs are subject to testing based on reasonable \nsuspicion of drug use. Both random basis and reasonable suspicion are \nundefined concepts. They raise the specter that excessive distinctions \nwill be made based on stereotypes and prejudices.\n  As we have often been told, Washington does not have all the answers. \nWe should not replace one set of Federal mandates with another set of \nFederal mandates. This bill is designed to maximize local flexibility, \nbut the Ashcroft amendment goes in the opposite direction.\n  Indeed, the Ashcroft amendment would actually preempt some State \nlaws. A number of State legislatures have addressed the circumstances \nunder which drug testing can be utilized, but the Ashcroft amendment \nwould actually override the considered judgments of those legislative \nbodies and put in place a one-size-fits-all Federal mandate.\n  Drug testing on the scale contemplated by this amendment would be \nenormously expensive. By some estimates, 1 million Americans use the \njob training services included in this bill. The Department of Health \nand Human Services estimates that the average cost of a drug test is \nabout $35.\n  That means it would cost $35 million each year to administer an \naverage of one test to each person. Either this amendment saddles local \ngovernments with a huge unfunded mandate, or it eats up a large portion \nof the Federal funds made available under this bill.\n  It is also important to note that drug testing technology is not \ninfallible. Depending upon the type of testing technology that is used, \nas many as 4 percent of all drug tests result in false positives. That \nmeans that if a million drug tests are administered, some 40,000 \nAmericans might be inaccurately labeled as drug users.\n  Of course there are often opportunities for appeals and confirmation \ntests and retests. But we should think long and hard before we adopt \nthis amendment and subject tens of thousands of ordinary, law-abiding \nAmericans to the Kafka-esque nightmare of being falsely accused of drug \nuse.\n  The amendment requires those who test positive for drugs to obtain \ndrug treatment. But who will pay for treatment? Right now, only a third \nof the Americans who need substance abuse treatment receive it because \ninsurance coverage and public funding are inadequate. At the very \nmoment that we debate this proposal, the Appropriations Committees of \nCongress are poised to slash Federal support for drug treatment. The \nHouse has already passed a bill that cuts Federal spending on drug \ntreatment and prevention by 23 percent.\n  In light of that fiscal reality, it makes no sense to institute a \nmassive new Government drug testing program.\n  Perhaps the intent of the Ashcroft amendment is to require local \ngovernments or job training programs themselves to pay for the \ntreatment of those who test positive. That would at least guarantee \nthat treatment is available, but it would cause the price tag of this \namendment to reach an even more prohibitive level.\n  Finally, the amendment is objectionable because it may deter people \nwho need job training services from seeking them. The threat of an \nintrusive drug test may put off drug users and non-drug users alike. We \nwant to encourage people to improve their skills. We want to encourage \nthe unemployed to become employed. We should not erect barriers to the \nservices authorized in this bill.\n  Job training programs do not need the Federal Government to tell them \n\n\n[[Page S 14977]]\nhow to deal with drug abuse. They have the tools they need. Where drug \ntesting is appropriate, it will occur. But a sweeping Federal mandate \nis completely unnecessary and excessively expensive, and I urge the \nSenate to reject this amendment.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is a complete conflict with the whole \nspirit of the legislation. Rather than the Federal Government and \nCongress setting the rules, leave this up to the States and local \ncommunities.\n  I have concerns about the privacy issue, concerns about the cost \nissue, preempting State laws, the whole issues on quality control for \nrandom tests and what the circumstances are, what the definitions would \nbe for reasonable suspicion. There are all kinds of reasons.\n  Mr. President, 6 years ago we had a very similar amendment. It was \nfocused on welfare recipients. We say we have scarce resources and we \nneed to be careful with our spending. But simply because they are on \nwelfare should we require drug testing? The Senate said no and that \namendment was soundly defeated.\n  I do not know what it is about the workers of this country. The \nSenator has in effect said that the displaced Raytheon workers who \nbuilt the Patriot missile ought to be required to take some kind of a \ntest.\n  In this legislation, under the national activities, if there are \nhurricanes, as we have just had, there will be members of communities \nin south Florida who will be eligible for help and assistance. What \ndoes the Ashcroft amendment say? You have to go out and take a drug \ntest. If you are going to have people take a drug test, what about \nfarmers? Are we going to say, because we have had national disasters, \nyou are going to have to go out and get a drug test? We do not say that \nto the small business men and women. We do not say that to all the \nstudents in the country. We do not say that to all the people who are \ngoing to get generous tax breaks on mineral rights. We do not say that \ncattle growers who are going to get benefits from the Federal \nGovernment must take a drug test first. Why are we picking out workers \nin this country? Where is the case for it? Where is the justification? \nWhere is the right to do that? Yesterday it was the people on welfare. \nToday it is the American workers. The case has not been made. It is a \nmandate to the various States and communities. You are going to be \npreempting the States.\n  If there is a justification, for example in terms of safety, if there \nis a justification in terms of security--like airline pilots and those \nwho are in public transportation--they have the right to go ahead and \ndo that now. There is no prohibition against them doing it now. There \nis no prohibition, if they set up training programs where public safety \nis at risk, that prohibits them from going ahead. We give that \nflexibility to the local community. So why should we superimpose a \nFederal mandate on it? It makes no sense. The case has not been met.\n  It may be a feel good amendment, but when we talk about scarce \nresources going to training--we see significant cuts in these programs \nin any event. And for the reasons the Senate soundly defeated a similar \namendment just a few years ago, that targeted those individuals who are \npoor and needy and need some help and assistance, this amendment should \nbe defeated as well. I do not think we ought to put at risk the workers \nof this country, who, generally because of the downsizing or because of \nmergers, are thrown off and become unemployed. It is clear that all \nthey are trying to do is get into a training program and get a job, why \nshould we threaten their rights of privacy.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I regret the fact that not everyone in \nthe Senate was in attendance last night when we debated these issues.\n  The Senator raises the question of why deal with job training? It is \nbecause reality is going to deal with job training applicants and \nparticipants on drugs. Mr. President, 89 percent of the employers will \ntest for them in manufacturing; 88 percent in transportation. Why do we \nnot move that test up and help people get started down the right path, \ninstead of going through some kind of training and then being hit by \nthis wall. We do not have that problem in farming. There is not going \nto be a drug test that keeps a farmer from selling his cattle. That \nissue is totally specious.\n  I do not know why we choose to discuss the welfare situation here, \nbut we just passed a welfare bill that provides that States may suspend \nbenefits to welfare recipients who test positive for drugs. I do not \nknow what we did in 1986, but I know what we did in 1995 and that is \npart of the welfare reform measure we just passed.\n  The point is we do have scarce resources. Why waste them on \nindividuals who are not going to be employable when they are through \nwith the work training program? Since the resources are scarce, let us \nfocus them on the individuals who are responsible enough, who care \nenough about their families, who care enough about their future to be \nable to benefit from the training program because they are not high on \ndrugs. Let us not stick our heads in the sand, while someone else is \nsticking a needle in his arm.\n  Let us say if you have to be drug free to work then drug testing \nought to be a fundamental part of your training. You have to learn to \nbe drug free because that is the way the work force is going to \nsurvive. It is that simple.\n  Let us not perpetuate a myth that somehow you can go down the dual \nhighway, one of the roads being drug utilization and the other road \nbeing job training or job seeking. The truth of the matter is, American \nindustry is clear. Mr. President, 77 percent of all employers test for \ndrugs, 89 percent in manufacturing, 88 percent in transportation.\n  We ought to send a signal loudly and clearly to individuals who are \npart of our training program. Part of your training is to adopt a \nlifestyle which will be productive and which will result in \nemployability, not to persist in a lifestyle which will send you \nslamming into a wall of unemployment and despair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 more minutes. The fact \nof the matter is, many of the defense-related industries require \nreasonable cause, not just suspicion or random selection, which the \nSenator has talked about here. I do not know why the Senator has a \nfeeling that all displaced workers, like the 12,000 workers that were \nlaid off when Chemical Bank and the Chase merged the other day in New \nYork City, is where the problem is. Why is it that the Senator believes \nthat workers are more at risk than farmers are? Than family-farmers \nare? Where is the justification to say the workers who work in the \nStates of this country, that work in plants, work in small business--\nmay even be a homemaker, because homemakers are included in here--where \nis the Senator's justification for it? It just is not there. We have \nasked for the justification. He has not been able to demonstrate it. \nAnd I fail to understand why we would single out those individuals.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am pleased the Senator asked the question, because I \nhave the answer. The farmer who gets assistance does not have to pass a \ndrug test before he sells his cattle. But the employee who seeks \ntraining will have to pass a test before he can be hired. In the latter \ncase, the benefit is denied, the benefit for which the training was \nundertaken. That is the answer to your question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I listened. I was prepared to yield. I \nfail to understand why the farmer who gets price subsidies, which are \ntaxpayers' dollars, are not expected to have a drug test but our \nworkers are. I am not out there to say every farmer who gets price \nsupports ought to have this kind of test, because the case has not been \nmade for any such test.\n  If we are going to say about farmers or small business men and women \nthe case has not been made, then they should not be tested. Why are you \ngoing to say the workers ought to be? That is what the Senator is \nsaying. You have not made the case that there is a requirement, you \nhave not shone that there is a need for it, and you do not set any \nother kinds of standards. \n\n[[Page S 14978]]\nYou say, return this activity to the States. What are the States going \nto do? They are going to use the least expensive methods, which in many \ninstances are the most faulty systems.\n  There are standards which are established and should be established \nwhen you are talking about public safety and transportation, which are \ngoing to provide for the safety and well-being, the lives of the \npublic. There should be standards and there should be adequate \ninspection and investigation and tests when necessary. We support that. \nThere is nothing in the bill that denies anybody the opportunity to do \nit. But to suddenly say to those workers who are going to be affected \nby national activities, because of the hurricane you are going to be \ntested, or the homemakers, you are going to be tested. The Senator has \nnot made the case.\n  I just wonder why we ought to be doing that, let alone preempting, \nwhich the Senator would do, any of the State laws that provide \nprotections in terms of privacy, or set requirements in terms of \nvarious standards. You are preempting a number of State laws that are \nin effect, and you are effectively running over those.\n  The case has not been made for it. If the States want to be able to \ndo it, there is no prohibition under the Kassebaum amendment. If there \nis a need for it, desire for it, if it is necessary, you can do it. I \ndo not think the justification has been made that we should do it for \nall of those covered by the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Missouri has \n1 minute 56 seconds, the Senator from Massachusetts, 3 minutes 12 \nseconds.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, this is a simple amendment. We have a \nlimited number of dollars we devote to job training. We can either \ntrain people regardless of whether they use drugs, or we can decide to \ntrain people who are drug-free. If we train people who are drug-free, \nthere will more people who will get jobs than if we train both the drug \nfree and abusers of illicit drugs. It seems to me, if our ultimate \nobjective is to train people to be employed, we should train people who \ncare enough about working that they are willing to put aside a \nlifestyle of drug addiction and abuse.\n  In the end, the reason this amendment is worthy of our consideration \nis that 77 percent of all firms test for drug use. So, we can continue \nto waltz people along in the sleepy myth that you can be on drugs and \nget a job or we can embrace the truth.\n  Why waste the $2,000 or $4,000 in training a person only to have them \ndisqualified when they get finished with the training? That is the \ndifference between the farmer. That is the difference between the \nwelfare recipient. There is reality at the end of the training. It is \ncalled employment and you cannot get it if you are on drugs.\n  I urge the Members of this body to respond, to allocate our training \nfunds to individuals who are drug-free. Thank you.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes and 12 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is interesting that in the Senator's \namendment it provides that if an individual applicant fails the drug \ntest, they can seek treatment through a drug treatment program. How \nmuch does the Senator think will be allocated for drug treatment \nprograms?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am not sure how much is available in \ndrug treatment programs. There are drug treatment programs.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much does the Senator allow in his amendment? Does \nhe expect the drug treatment programs to be paid for out of this?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. No. There are separate funds available in every \njurisdiction for drug treatment programs, some of which are Federal \nfunds and some of which are State funds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Does the Senator know what happened to those treatment \nprograms in the appropriations bills this last year? They have been \nreduced by close to a quarter, Mr. President.\n  This amendment just does not make any sense.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2894\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). There are 4 minutes remaining \non amendment No. 2894 offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator \nSpecter.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes. Senator Kassebaum \nhas 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I would be prepared to yield back time.\n  Mr. SIMON. I will take 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, there is no question that without the \nSpecter amendment, we severely wound Job Corps. It is the only program \nwe have working with at-risk young people which is really working, and \nworking effectively. When the legislation says they have to use a \nportion of the money that we give to them to maintain Job Corps \ncenters, they can use this for parole agents. It is revenue sharing \nwith the States. It really is important. If you believe in helping at-\nrisk young people in our Nation, pass this, the Specter-Simon \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I want to say in closing that I think \nwe have had a good debate on the pros and cons of the needs of the Job \nCorps Program and at-risk youth.\n  I suggest that this debate is about whether the Federal Government \nshould continue in the same way as it has in running the Job Corps \nprograms, or whether the States can do a better job. Can the local \ncommunity be more involved and bring about a greater sense of \naccountability and responsibility for helping this very vulnerable \npopulation, which with the right set of guidelines and expectations can \nachieve more than it has done.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Specter-Simon amendment, and \nto be willing to invest in trying to achieve even greater success with \nthe Job Corps Program.\n  I yield back any time that I have remaining,\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Specter-Simon \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Pennsylvania. On this question, the yeas and nays \nhave been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Maine [Mr. Cohen] is \nabsent due to a death in the family.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 57, nays 40, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 485 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--57\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--40\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Gregg\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Cohen\n     Moynihan\n       \n  So the motion was agreed to.\n  \n[[Page S 14979]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. SIMON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2893\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, their will now be 4 \nminutes for debate on amendment No. 2893, offered by the Senator from \nMissouri [Mr. Ashcroft].\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask for order in the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order.\n  There will be 4 minutes of debate before the next vote. The Senator \nfrom Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President. This amendment would provide \nfor random drug testing for individuals in job training programs. The \ntruth of the matter is that 89 percent of all manufacturers, 88 percent \nof all those in the transportation industry, 77 percent of all \nemployers provide for drug testing prior to employment. If we expect \nfor people who move through our job training programs to be really \nemployable, we need to ask them to participate by getting drug free in \nthe process. We need to send a clear signal that being on a track of \ndrug use and job training or employability are incompatible and \ninconsistent tracks.\n  We have limited job training resources. We do not have enough to go \naround. Let us make sure that we use them well by saying that those \nindividuals who are drug-free will be the individuals for whom we \nprovide job training. To ask that individuals undergo random drug tests \nin job training is merely to reflect the reality of the marketplace \nwhere 89 percent of manufacturers will require it.\n  Let us not perpetuate a myth that somehow drugs are compatible with \nemployment and that productivity and achievement are compatible with \ndrugs. Let us say that we provide for random drug testing that will \nfocus our job training resources on those who care enough to be drug \nfree and will be employable upon the completion of the program.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. President, there are job training programs where this kind of \ntesting is appropriate. When we talk about public safety, when we talk \nabout the airlines, when we talk about the railroads, that is \nappropriate and that is permitted under this bill.\n  Effectively, what this Senator is saying is that every worker in this \ncountry is somehow under the suspicion of drug usage. The case has not \nbeen made. The people eligible for these benefits are the people in \nFlorida who suffered under Hurricane Opal. They are going to be the \nhomemakers, they are going to be the displaced workers, they are going \nto be the 12,000 workers from Chemical Bank and Chase Bank squeezed out \nas a result of mergers.\n  The case has not been made. Random, there is no definition of random. \nReasonable suspicion, there is no definition of what reasonable \nsuspicion is. There is no definition of what the cost is, plus \npreempting the States.\n  In the Kassebaum bill, if there is a desire and need for that kind of \ntesting it can be done locally. Why should we have an additional \nFederal mandate that is going to interfere with the workers of this \ncountry? We do not require it of farmers who get various benefits. We \ndo not require it of small businessmen. We do not require it of defense \ncontractors. We do not require it in the timber industry or the mining \nindustry or those who use the public lands for grazing, who all get \nbenefits. Why should we say to the workers who have been displaced with \ndownsizing or mergers that you are going to be subject to this random \ntesting? It was tried 6 years ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  We had a similar amendment to do it for all welfare recipients. That \nwas rejected overwhelmingly. For the same reason it was rejected for \nwelfare recipients, we ought to reject it for the workers of this \ncountry.\n  I yield back the remainder of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 2893. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 201, strike lines 18 through 22 and insert the \n     following:\n       (B) Scope.--\n       (i) Initial reductions.--Not later than the date of the \n     transfer under subsection (b), the Secretary of Labor and the \n     Secretary of Education shall take the actions described in \n     subparagraph (A) with respect to not less than \\1/3\\ of the \n     number of positions of personnel that relate to a covered \n     activity.\n       (ii) Subsequent reductions.--Not later than 5 years after \n     the date of the transfer under subsection (b), the Secretary \n     of Labor and the Secretary of Education shall take the \n     actions described in subparagraph (A)--\n       (I) with respect to not less than 60 percent of the number \n     of positions of personnel that relate to a covered activity, \n     unless the Secretaries submit (prior to the end of such 5-\n     year period) a report to Congress demonstrating why such \n     actions have not occurred; or\n       (II) with respect to not less than 40 percent of the number \n     of positions of personnel that relate to a covered activity, \n     if the Secretaries make the determination and submit the \n     report referred to in subclause (I).\n       (iii) Calculation.--For purposes of calculating, under this \n     subparagraph, the number of positions of personnel that \n     relate to a covered activity, such number shall include the \n     number of positions of personnel who are separated from \n     service under subparagraph (A).\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. This amendment pertains to provisions of S. 143 \ndealing with reductions in the Federal work force, as we consolidated \noffices at the Federal level to oversee the new work \n\n[[Page S 14980]]\nforce development system. This language was worked out with the Senator \nfrom Texas, and I believe it is acceptable on both sides.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge the support of the amendment, \nwhich clearly is in focus with what the intention is for this \nlegislation--that is, the reduction of personnel and manpower.\n  There has been a dramatic reduction in the period of the last 3 \nyears. That flow line we expect to continue. This establishes some \nadditional benchmark to be able to achieve it.\n  I think it is a reasonable amendment. I hope it would be accepted.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nNo. 2895.\n  The amendment (No. 2895) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I would like to discuss the important \nissue of encouraging competition between the private and public sectors \nin the delivery of training and employment services at the State and \nlocal levels.\n  As you know, the Workforce Development Act consolidates nearly 100 \nseparate education and job training programs into a single, universal \nwork force development system through block grants to the States.\n  I want to commend the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness, the National Alliance of Business, and other business groups \nfor their efforts to help shape legislation to restructure the Nation's \neducation and training system. These representatives of the business \ncommunity are advocating a comprehensive work force development system \nthat is market-based, customer-driven, and that gets results.\n  Would the Senate majority leader, my colleague from Kansas, please \ncomment on the role of business in restructuring Federal training \nprograms?\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I agree with the distinguished Senator from \nKansas. America needs a work force that is trained for private sector \noccupations--especially those generated by small businesses and \nentrepreneurs--that will help ensure a competitive U.S. economy. I \nbelieve the system must be private sector driven to ensure it is \nflexibile and responsive to the evolving dynamics of the labor market, \ninternational competition, and technological advances over the coming \nyears and decades.\n  I believe small business should be able to compete with the public \nsector in the delivery of training and employment services and in the \noperation of the one-stop centers. If the consolidation of Federal \nprograms is to adequately reflect the realities of today's labor \nmarket, business--particularly small business--absolutely must play a \nlead role in ensuring workers are equipped with the skills needed by \nAmerica's employers. Incorporating competition and free market \nprinciples into training services at the local level will also \nencourage public sector programs to operate more effectively. \nOpportunities for private-public sector competition in the \nimplementation of local work force development plans is an area \nstrongly pursued by U.S. business interests. In particular, I want to \nrecognize the work by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers in this area and welcome their input in \neducation and job training services on behalf of small business.\n  Does the distinguished chairman of the Senate Labor and Human \nResources Committee agree on the unique role of small business?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, the bill I introduced enables both \nlocal chambers and small businesses to compete with the public sector \nin the course of restructuring the Federal training system. I believe \nlocal chambers of commerce--in addition to small businesses--are \nuniquely positioned to operate one-stop centers and to serve as \ntraining providers. Today, local chambers are leading the way in many \nof the Nation's most innovative and effective work force development \ninitiatives. I understand the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has undertaken a \nmajor initiative to mobilize local chambers of commerce to be in the \nvanguard in this effort to revolutionize training for America's private \nsector.\n  Similarly, regional and local affiliates of the National Association \nof Manufacturers serve as a strong intermediary source in bringing \nbusiness, education and government leaders together at the State and \ncommunity level to form meaningful and sustained work force development \nprograms.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Kansas for opening \ndiscussion on the important role that business brings to the table. \nWith strong private sector input, efforts to turn primary \nresponsibility for education programs to the State and local levels \nwill hold much promise.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I appreciate the comments from the Senate majority \nleader on this important issue and I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a letter from the chamber of commerce with an \naccompanying statement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America,\n                                  Washington, DC, October 5, 1995.\n       Members of the United States Senate: The U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce, representing 215,000 businesses, 3,000 state and \n     local chambers of commerce, 1,200 trade and professional \n     associations, and 73 American Chambers of Commerce abroad, \n     urges your support for the Workforce Development Act (S. \n     143), which is scheduled for floor consideration on October \n     10.\n       The Workforce Development Act, sponsored by Senator Nancy \n     Kassebaum (R-KS), contains many provisions that the Chamber \n     supports. S. 143 would consolidate and decentralize roughly \n     100 federal education and training programs into a simpler, \n     integrated block grant system for states. The bill also would \n     enable small businesses and local chambers of commerce to \n     compete with the public sector in the delivery of education \n     and training services; recognize the important role of \n     business in the design and implementation of the new system; \n     and promote the effective use of technology and the \n     development of labor-market information to orient education \n     and training services.\n       In additional to these provisions, the Chamber is \n     encouraged that the Workforce Development Act maintains the \n     important goal of preparing students and workers for skills \n     needed in the modern workplace. S. 143 aims to achieve this \n     goal by adopting many new approaches to workforce \n     development. Examples include promoting the use of vouchers \n     rather than funding streams for institutions and programs; \n     establishing user-friendly, one-stop delivery centers where \n     individuals and employers can share and obtain relevant job \n     information; opening the door to new measures of \n     accountability rather than relying on the old measure of \n     bureaucratic processes; and encouraging the creation of \n     effective business-education partnerships.\n       Many, if not most, of these provisions are found in the \n     Chamber's policy statement on restructuring the federal \n     training and employment system. A copy of this statement is \n     attached, for your review.\n       For American business, the knowledge and skills of \n     employees are the critical factors for economic success and \n     international competitiveness. The Workforce Development Act \n     embodies language that can help achieve this end by creating \n     a world-class workforce development system that is responsive \n     to today's skill needs. Again, we urge your support for S. \n     143, and your opposition to any weakening amendments. Doing \n     so will dramatically enhance the possibility of enacting \n     meaningful workforce development legislation during the 104th \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Bruce Josten,\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n     Membership Policy Group.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Statement on Restructuring the Federal Training and Employment System\n\n       The U.S. Chamber recognizes that America's training and \n     employment system is inadequate to meet the demands of \n     rapidly evolving technologies and intensifying global \n     competition. The current system is fragmented and \n     duplicative, and often fails to provide workers and employers \n     with the fast and effective training and placement services \n     they need. Equally compelling is the fact that growing \n     numbers of workers are becoming permanently displaced through \n     structural changes in government policy and corporate \n     restructuring, as opposed to cyclical changes in the economy. \n     These weaknesses in the existing work-to-work transition \n     system need to be resolved.\n       The U.S. Chamber, therefore, supports restructuring the \n     federal training and employment system to make it more \n     responsive to the needs of dislocated workers and skill \n     requirements of employers. To be effective, it is essential \n     that the new system reflect the following principles:\n\n[[Page S 14981]]\n\n       The business community must be centrally involved in all \n     phases of the restructured system's design, development, \n     operation, and evaluation.\n       The new system must not impose any new federal mandates or \n     regulatory burdens upon employers. It must not be financed \n     through the creation of a new tax or an increase in any \n     current tax on business.\n       The new system should assist workers in pursuing job search \n     and placement assistance, career advancement, and a career \n     change. Services must be delivered as promptly and \n     effectively as possible to help employers make quicker and \n     less costly connections with prospective employees. Training \n     services must reflect the local and regional skill needs of \n     employers.\n       Information regarding career and training services should \n     be offered competitively at the local level. Service \n     providers may include representatives of the private sector. \n     The creation and governance of the streamlined system must be \n     business led. Attempts should be made to factor in the \n     education, employment and training programs of all federal \n     agencies.\n       There must be sufficient state and local flexibility \n     incorporated into the design and implementation of the new \n     re-employment system. Provisions to maintain accountability \n     and standards of quality at the state and local level should \n     be a part of the national restructuring plan.\n       The current labor market information system must be \n     strengthened and enhanced. Voluntary occupational skills \n     standards should be integrated into this system, so \n     dislocated workers can know exactly what types of skills they \n     will need for certain occupations.\n       In addition to strengthening state and local flexibility, \n     the private sector should be encouraged to compete for the \n     delivery of education, employment and training services. One \n     way to help spur local competition and encourage public \n     sector programs to operate more efficiently is to put \n     financial resources directly in the hands of individuals to \n     pursue private or public sector postsecondary education and \n     training. The overall goal should be to improve the learning \n     and achievement of individuals and help them to succeed in \n     the workplace of the 21st century.\n       Block grants are considered a viable mechanism for \n     diminishing control from the federal government and \n     increasing state and local flexibility. State and local \n     workforce development plans emerging from the block grants \n     must maintain the goal of preparing students and workers for \n     skills needed in a high performance workplace. Appropriate \n     performance and skill standards and accountability measures \n     should be incorporated into state and local programs that \n     emanate from the block grant system.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Is it not your understanding that nonresidential programs \nfor at-risk youth described under section 161(b) (2) and (3) of the \nbill, could be provided by local, community-based organizations?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Yes, of course. The States could elect to provide \nthese services through such organizations or other organizations in the \nprivate sector.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2896\n\n  (Purpose: To make amendments with respect to museums and libraries)\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Jeffords and myself and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Pell] for himself and \n     Mr. Jeffords, proposes an amendment numbered 2896.\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, the House of Representatives recently \napproved the Careers Act which contains extensive provisions regarding \nlibrary services. This is the companion bill to the legislation we are \nnow considering and the bill the House will bring to conference, Senate \nbill 143.\n  I am of the mind we should have library services provisions formally \non the table when we go to conference with the House. Thus, the \namendment now being offered would include the Institute of Museum and \nLibrary Services reauthorization as part of S. 143.\n  Those provisions stress the importance of both museums and libraries \nto literacy, economic development and most importantly, the work force \ndevelopment, all of which are relevant and important to the bill now \nunder consideration.\n  Mr. President, I believe this amendment is or should be considered \nnoncontroversial, and I urge its approval.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I rise today in support of the amendment offered by my \ndistinguished colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Pell, and myself \nwhich would incorporate the Institute of Museum and Library Services as \npart of S. 143, the Workforce Development Act of 1995.\n  Libraries have been key players in developing literacy programs and \nit only makes sense to include the Institute for Museum and Library \nServices [IMLS] as part of this bill today. The problem of illiteracy \nis of great concern to me and I believe that we should not pass up this \nopportunity today to recognize the power and purpose that libraries \nhave in dealing with this problem and finding solutions to it. \nLibraries have made a positive impact in communities throughout the \nNation and have been instrumental in enhancing educational and lifelong \nlearning opportunities. Because of its focus on literacy as well as \nworkforce and economic development, I believe that ensuring that the \nIMLS is part of the S. 143 is an action which will benefit individuals \nin all of our States. The Pell/Jeffords amendment today represents a \nholistic and winning approach to lifelong learning.\n  Mr. President, I am especially pleased that the Artifacts Indemnity \nAct has been included as part of this amendment. The Indemnity Program, \ncreated in 1975, has been an extraordinarily successful program. I \nbelieve that there has been only one claim for a very modest amount of \nmoney since it first began 20 years ago. Over the years, I have had \nmany opportunities to speak with museum directors who have shared with \nme their thoughts on the importance of this program along with \nfrustrations regarding the difficulty they have had in getting \ninsurance for their exhibitions to travel throughout the United States, \nor for bringing some of the great U.S. exhibitions to their region. In \nresponse to those conversations, an extension of the indemnity program \nfor domestic exhibitions has been included. We have also moved \nadministration of this program to the Institute of Museums and Library \nServices, which I believe is a sensible and logical change that will \nonly enhance the program's successes.\n  So again, I would like to thank the Senator from Rhode Island for \noffering his assistance in crafting this amendment and look forward to \nits adoption.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I do not believe there is an objection \non either side of the aisle regarding this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is right. We appreciate the Senator bringing \nthis to the attention of the Members. We hope it will be included.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I urge the adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2896) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2897\n\n                (Purpose: To make technical amendments)\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM.

Mr. President, we urge the acceptance of this amendment \nand appreciate the working out of the technical issues which have been \nincluded in this proposal.\n  We urge the Senate to accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2897) was agreed to.\n\n\n the repeal of the mc kinney act provisions for homeless children and \n                                 youth\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would first like to thank Senator Kassebaum for her \nexcellent work on this long-awaited legislation to improve the delivery \nof America's work force training and education programs. This is a \nmammoth task well done, and I look forward to final passage this \nmorning. Let me say, however, that I have a serious concern about \nhomeless children that I would like to clarify with the Senator.\n  The legislation before us in its present form repeals the McKinney \nHomeless Assistance Act provisions for the Homeless Children and Youth \nProgram. I believe this is an oversight and I agree with the chairman's \nintent to repeal the McKinney Act job training provisions to include \nthem in this much improved legislation for those purposes. \nUnfortunately, the repeal language includes a repeal of the program for \nhomeless children. This critical program helps homeless children to \nenroll in and attend school.\n  Before the McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, almost half of all \nschool aged homeless children were not in school at any given time. The \nvery poor attendance was caused in large part by school policies that \ndid not take into account the unique problems of homeless families.\n  Residency requirements, for example, often prevented homeless \nfamilies from enrolling their children in school because by definition \na homeless family did not have an address that could be used to prove \nresidence in a district. Furthermore, because a number of shelters only \nallowed people to stay for 30 days at a time, homeless families were \noften forced to move from shelter to shelter.\n  If these shelters were zoned for different schools, as is often the \ncase, the children were forced to transfer as frequently as the \nfamilies moved. This is a most difficult hurdle for any family, and \nmore so for homeless families. Frequent school changes impede rather \nthan promote the education of homeless children. Transfer of records \nbetween schools slowed the process even more, often keeping children \nout of school for weeks at a time.\n  To address this problem, we created the Education for Homeless \nChildren and Youth Program in the McKinney Act. This program for \nhomeless children requires States and local governments to ease the \ntypes of barriers I have described and to improve the support \nmechanisms for homeless children in schools. This program also provides \nmoney to States to identify homeless students, ease transfers and \nplacements, and provide tutoring and school supplies.\n  I am proud to say that this program has made a difference. Since \n1987, school attendance by homeless children nationally has risen from \n50 percent to 82 percent and continues to increase each year. These \nimprovements occur despite the fact that the number of homeless \nchildren continues to rise with the number of homeless families, as \nreported by the U.S. Conference of Mayors.\n  For homeless children, education will be their best chance to break \nthe cycle of poverty. This McKinney Act program ensures that homeless \nchildren will have access to that chance. Now is not the time to repeal \nthis program.\n  I understand, Senator Kassebaum, that you have indicated your support \nfor the continuation of the McKinney Act Education for Homeless \nChildren and Youth Program. Since the technical language of S. 143 \nrepeals this program along with job training for homeless adults, I \nalso understand that it is your intention to revisit this matter in \nconference.\n  I hope the Senator can reassure me that it is not her intent to \nrepeal the McKinney Act program for homeless children, and that she \nwill work in conference to assure that the final bill contains explicit \nprotections for homeless children so that the progress we have made in \nhelping homeless children continues.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Yes, I support the McKinney Act program for homeless \nchildren, and I appreciate the effort of the Senator from New Mexico in \nbringing this matter to the attention of the Senate. I assure the \nSenator and the Senate that I will work in conference to protect this \nprogram for homeless children by accepting language to ensure its \ncontinuation. I thank the Senator on behalf of homeless children and \ntheir families. They \n\n[[Page S 14983]]\nknow the full benefits of this McKinney Act program for school \nplacement and support and should have every assurance of its \ncontinuation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/11/senate-section/article/S14962-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14983-S14993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  NOTE\n\n  Due to a printing error, a statement by Senator Harkin on page S14840 \nof the Record of October 10, 1995, appears incorrectly. The permanent \nRecord will be corrected to reflect the following correct statement.\n\n\n SUPPORT OF THE PROVISIONS PERTAINING TO INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nDisability Policy, I would like to take a few minutes to discuss the \napplicability of S. 143, the Work Force Development Act, to individuals \nwith disabilities.\n  I would like to compliment Senator Kassebaum, the sponsor of the \nlegislation and chair of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, \nand Senator Frist, the chair of the Subcommittee on Disability Policy, \nfor including specific provisions in S. 143 that will enhance our \nNation's ability to address the employment-related needs of individuals \nwith disabilities, including individuals with significant disabilities. \nI am particularly pleased that these provisions were developed on a \nbipartisan basis and enjoy the broad-based support of the disability \ncommunity.\n  On January 10, 1995, the Labor Committee heard testimony from Tony \nYoung, on behalf of the employment and training task force of the \nConsortium for Citizens With Disabilities. CCD urged the Senate to \nrecognize the positive advances made in the 1992 amendments to the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 and to take a two-pronged approach to \naddressing the needs of individuals with disabilities in our jobs \nconsolidation legislation. I am pleased that the Senate bill adopted \nthis two-pronged approach.\n  Under prong one, S. 143 guarantees individuals with disabilities \nmeaningful and effective access to the core services and optional \nservices that are made available to nondisabled individuals in generic \nwork force employment activities and to work force education activities \ndescribed in the legislation, consistent with nondiscrimination \nprovisions set out in section 106(f)(7) of the legislation, section 504 \nof the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and title II of the Americans With \nDisabilities Act.\n  The commitment to ensuring meaningful and effective access to generic \nservices for individuals with disabilities is critical. Advocates for \nindividuals with disabilities have often expressed concern that many \ncurrent generic job training programs such as JTPA have not met the \nneeds of individuals with disabilities. Ensuring access to generic \nservices is critical for many people with disabilities who can benefit \nfrom such services.\n  The promise of access to generic services is also illustrated through \nother provisions in S. 143. The purposes of the bill--(section 2(b))--\ninclude creating coherent, integrated statewide work force development \nsystems designed to develop more fully the academic, occupational, and \nliteracy skills of all segments of the population and ensuring that all \nsegments of the work force will obtain the skills necessary to earn \nwages sufficient to maintain the highest quality of living in the \nworld. The content of the State plan set out in section 104(c) of S. \n143 must include information describing how the State will identify the \ncurrent and future work force development needs of all segments of the \npopulation of the State. The term all is intended to include \nindividuals with disabilities.\n  The accountability provisions in S. 143--(section 121(c)(4)--specify \nthat States must develop quantifiable benchmarks to measure progress \ntoward meeting State goals for specified populations, including at a \nminimum, individuals with disabilities.\n  Under S. 143, State vocational rehabilitation agencies must be \ninvolved in the planning and implementation of the generic system. For \nexample, under section 104(d) of S. 143, the part of the State plan \nrelated to the strategic plan must describe how the State agency \nofficials responsible for vocational rehabilitation collaborated in the \ndevelopment of the strategic plan. Under section 105(a) of S. 143, the \nwork force development boards must include a representative from the \nState agency responsible for vocational rehabilitation and under \nsection 118 of S. 143, local work force development boards must include \none or more individuals with disabilities or their representatives.\n  Under prong two the current program of one-stop shopping for persons \nwith disabilities, particularly those with severe disabilities, \nestablished under title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended \nmost recently in 1992, is retained, strengthened, and made an integral \ncomponent of the statewide work force development system.\n  The current vocational rehabilitation system has helped millions of \nindividuals with disabilities over the past 75 years to achieve \nemployment. Since the 1992 amendments, the number of individuals \nassisted in achieving employment each year has increased steadily. In \nfiscal year 1994, 203,035 individuals achieved employment, up 5.8 \npercent from fiscal year 1992, the year just prior to the passage of \nthe amendments. Data for the first three quarters of fiscal year 1995 \nshow a 8.4 percent increase in the number of individuals achieving \nemployment as compared to the first three quarters for fiscal year \n1994.\n  In fiscal year 1993, 85.7 percent of the individuals achieving \nemployment through vocational rehabilitation were either competitively \nemployed or self-employed. Seventy-seven percent of individuals who \nachieved employment as a result of the vocational rehabilitation \nprogram report that their own income is the primary source of support \nrather than depending on entitlement or family members.\n  The percent of persons with earned income of any kind increased from \n21 percent at application to 90 percent at closure. The gain in the \naverage hourly wage rate from application to the achievement of an \nemployment outcome was $4.36 per person. Of the individuals achieving \nemployment in fiscal year 1993, their mean weekly earnings at the time \nof their application to the program was $32.20, compared to $204.10 at \nclosure, an average weekly increase of $164.90.\n  In 1993, the General Accounting Office [GAO] found that an individual \nwho completed a vocational rehabilitation program was significantly \nmore likely than an individual who did not complete the program of \nworking for wages 5 years after exiting the program. In addition, the \nGAO found that individuals who achieved an employment outcome \ndemonstrated four times the gain in wages compared to the other groups \nstudied.\n  I am also pleased to share with my colleagues the positive impact \nthat vocational rehabilitation is having in my home State of Iowa. \nDuring fiscal year 1993-94, 5,717 Iowans with disabilities were \nrehabilitated through the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation \nServices [DVRS]. At referral to DVRS, 33 percent have weekly earnings; \nat closure the rate went to 98 percent. Average weekly earnings rose \nfrom $49.94 at referral to $229.45 at closure. In addition, the Iowa \nDepartment for the Blind provided 765 blind persons with vocational \nrehabilitation services. At closure the average weekly income was \n$352.00. Seventy-three percent of those rehabilitated found work in the \ncompetitive labor market, including work in occupations such as \npsychologist, tax accountant, teacher, food service, and radio repair.\n  Mr. President, as I explained previously in my remarks, under S. 143, \ntitle I of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended most recently in 1992, is \nnot repealed; rather it is retained, strengthened, and made an integral \ncomponent of the statewide work force development system.\n  For example, the findings and purposes section of title I of the \nRehabilitation Act are amended to make it clear that programs of \nvocational rehabilitation are intended to be an integral component of a \nState's work force development system. Further, the amendments clarify \nthat linkages between the vocational rehabilitation program established \nunder title I of the Rehabilitation Act and other components of the \nstatewide work force development system are critical to ensure \neffective and meaningful participation by individuals with disabilities \nin work force development activities.\n  Section 14 and section 106 of title I of the Rehabilitation Act \npertaining to \n\n[[Page S 14984]]\nevaluations of the program are amended to make it clear that, to the \nmaximum extent appropriate, standards for determining effectiveness of \nthe program must be consistent with State benchmarks established under \nthe Work Force Development Act for all employment programs.\n  Provisions in the State plan under title I of the Rehabilitation Act \nof 1973 are also amended to include specific strategies for \nstrengthening the vocational rehabilitation program as an integral \ncomponent of the statewide work force development system established by \nthe State. A cooperative agreement will be required to link the VR \nagency with the consolidated system. The cooperative agreement will \naddress each State's unique system and will assure, for example, \nreciprocal referrals between the VR agency and the other components of \nthe statewide system. The linkages will also assure that the staff at \nboth agencies are adequately and appropriately trained. Most \nimportantly, the linkages must be replicated at the local level so that \nthe local office of the VR agency is working closely with the one-stop \ncenter in the community to make a seamless system of services a \nreality.\n  Many State vocational rehabilitation agencies, including the agency \nin Iowa, are already involved with efforts to link vocational \nrehabilitation with other components of the statewide system of work \nforce development. The States that report the most success are those \nwhere the vocational rehabilitation agencies are involved in the \nconsolidation efforts at the early planning stages. The other aspect \nthat is critical to ensure success is the replication of cooperative \nagreements in local communities so that the VR counselors are working \nclosely with the other job training programs in the statewide system.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I strongly support the provisions of S. \n143 pertaining to individuals with disabilities. The bill ensures \nmeaningful and effective access to the generic training and education \nprograms. In addition, the amendments to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \nwill strengthen and support the involvement of vocational \nrehabilitation in a State's seamless system of work force development \nwhile ensuring the continued integrity and viability of the current \nprogram.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the Workforce \nDevelopment Act. It confronts one of the most important issues \naffecting this Nation today--that is to make sure that America's work \nforce is job ready for the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, I like this bill because it creates a one-stop \ndelivery system for employment services. It recognizes the needs of \ndislocated workers; and it helps to streamline the job training process \nfor everyone, including welfare recipients, by consolidating existing \njob training programs.\n  First, I like one-stop shopping, and I like streamlining the process. \nWith this bill, States will be required to create one-stop career \ncenters offering access to anyone who needs it. One-stop career centers \nmean more centralized services all in one place. They make the job \ntraining system more efficient and more effective.\n  Anyone who wants to can go to one location for job placement, job \nassistance, and job referral. One-stop centers link workers to the full \nrange of services they will need, and I think that is great.\n  My State of Maryland is ahead of the game in creating one-stop \ncenters. Maryland's one stop center in Columbia, MD is up and running \nand helping to make job training services easier and more efficient for \nall Maryland workers. It is an idea that I wholeheartedly support.\n  Second, Mr. President, I especially like the amendments to this bill \nthat protect dislocated workers. Senator Dodd has worked very hard to \ninclude a provision that creates a rapid response emergency fund for \npeople affected by base closing, plant closing, and natural disasters.\n  In Maryland, we have seen tremendous job loss, plant closures, and \ncompany downsizing. According to the Baltimore Sun, Maryland could lose \n20,000 to 50,000 Federal jobs in the next 5 years. That is a lot of \njobs, a lot of people, and lot of families that will receive a big \nfinancial blow.\n  The Dodd amendment is very important to Maryland families who have \nlost income due to base closing--like Fort Richie, White Oak, David \nTaylor in Annapolis, and the Army Publications Distribution Center in \nMiddle River.\n  These workers are men and women who have mortgages to pay, homes to \nheat, and other bills to pay in order to keep their families going. \nThey need to know that their concerns were heard.\n  Further, Mr. President, Senator Breaux and Senator Daschle have also \noffered an amendment to create vouchers for dislocated workers. The \namendment further improves the bill by maximizing dislocated workers \nability to chose what job training best fits their needs. They can make \ntheir own judgments and determine their own future.\n  I support the Dodd and Breaux amendments on behalf of all the \nMarylanders who have lost their jobs or who stand to lose their jobs \ntoday, tomorrow and in the future.\n  I am also pleased that we will continue our commitment to workers who \nhave lost their jobs through changes in the international market.\n  I am talking about the importance of keeping our promises. Promises \nwe made to protect workers from the possible effects of NAFTA and GATT.\n  I am pleased that this bill will not repeal the Target Adjustment \nAct, and instead preserves our responsibility to help dislocated \nworkers. That is why I support Senator Moynihan's amendment to take the \nTrade Adjustment Act out of this bill.\n  Third, Mr. President, the Senate recently considered welfare reform \nlegislation. Welfare reform and the job training bill we consider today \nmust work hand-in-hand.\n  If we want to be successful in keeping people off welfare, we must \nhave in place a system that will allow people to change careers and \nchange skills when the economy and technology forces them to.\n  I think that good job training programs are important to making \nwelfare reform efforts successful. Welfare reform is about helping \npeople get into jobs and stay jobs through job training and part-time \nwork. This bill does that.\n  The one-stop centers created in this bill will allow welfare \nrecipients to get the help they need to be job ready. They will get job \ncounseling, skills assessment and other services all in one place. I \nbelieve that everyone can be well prepared, self sufficient and \nsuccessful.\n  Finally, Mr. President, a lot of progress was made to improve this \nbill since the Labor Committee markup. I support the changes and the \namendments improving the job training programs so that they operate \nmore efficiently.\n  But, I am pleased that this bill does not repeal title V of the Older \nAmericans Act, the Senior Employment Program.\n  When the Labor Committee considered this bill, I had very serious \nconcerns about how it would impact on our seniors. I offered an \namendment in committee to take the Senior Employment Program out of the \nblock grant because it provides an important service to seniors in this \ncountry. And although my amendment lost in committee, the Senior \nEmployment Program has been removed from the bill we consider today.\n  The Senior Employment Program provides over 100,000 seniors an \nopportunity for employment, community service, and self-reliance.\n  Throughout this Nation, the Senior Employment Program is essential to \nproviding important community services. Libraries are kept open in \nBaltimore so children can read. Ailing older people and children \nreceive care through child and adult day care. Seniors and homebound \npersons in Catonsville and Hagerstown receive nutritious meals at \nsenior centers and through Meals-on-Wheels.\n  Mr. President, this program is based on the principles of personal \nresponsibility, lifelong learning, and service to community. It is too \nimportant to seniors to be considered as part of this bill, and it \nshould rightfully be considered as part of the Older American's Act \nreauthorization.\n  I would like to thank the Labor Committee chair, Senator Kassebaum, \nfor \n\n[[Page S 14985]]\nher willingness to work with me to remove the Senior Employment Program \nfrom this block grant.\n  Mr. President, I am all for the idea of one-stop shopping, \nstreamlining and simplifying the job training process, providing \nassistance for job readiness, and promoting some state flexibility. I \nam supporting this bill because I believe that job training and \neducation are vital to creating a productive work force.\n  I commend Senator Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy for their work on \nthis bill and I look forward to its passage.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today the Senate will complete its \nconsideration of the Work Force Development Act, legislation which will \nreform the existing system of Federal job training programs. As a \nmember of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, I recommend this \nbill to my colleagues for three specific reasons.\n  This bill before us will reduce the size and scope of the Federal \nGovernment's bureaucracy by eliminating a number of ineffective or \nduplicative job training programs and, in addition, consolidating many \nothers. This legislation will shift much of the resources and \nresponsibility for operating the remaining programs to the States which \nare better capable of designing and running effective education and job \ntraining programs. Finally--and I believe most importantly--these \nreforms will help ensure that American workers have the necessary \neducation and skills to compete successfully in the global economy our \nNation faces as we enter the 21st century.\n  Before I elaborate on each of these important endeavors, let me first \ncommend the Senator from Kansas, the chairman of the Senate Committee \non Labor and Human Resources, for her dedication to this issue and for \nher efforts to develop this measure and bring it to the floor. This has \nbeen an area of longstanding interest for the chairman, and her staff \nalong with all of the members of the committee have been working on \nthis legislation the entire year. In fact, job training reform was the \nsubject of the first hearings the Labor Committee held this session.\n  Mr. President, it also should be noted that the chairman and the \ncommittee staff have worked very closely with the Governors--Democrat \nand Republican alike--in developing a structure for this work force \ndevelopment system which will allow the necessary Federal oversight to \nensure accountability for the States while still providing them with \ntremendous flexibility. As with welfare reform, this bill represents \nthe advent of a renewed effort toward consultation and cooperation \nbetween the Federal Government and the States. This new Federal-State \nrelationship is critical not only to making programs such as job \ntraining and welfare successful, but it is essential to solving many \nother problems confronting our society as well.\n  Mr. President, let me return to the accomplishments of this \nlegislation. First is the issue of eliminating unnecessary duplication \nand bureaucracy among the existing Federal job training programs.\n  At last count, according to the Government Accounting Office, there \nare 163 separate Federal job training programs being run by 1 of 15 \nFederal agencies. Altogether, these programs cost taxpayers more than \n$20 billion a year. While those numbers alone are astounding, what is \neven more surprising is the incredible overlap and redundancy of many \nof these programs. For instance, there are at least 60 programs aimed \nat assisting the economically disadvantaged, including 34 programs \ndesigned to address literacy alone. To add to the confusion, many of \nthese same programs have differing standards for assessing income and \nother eligibility criteria.\n  However, Mr. President, perhaps the most shocking aspect of the \npresent Federal job training system is the near total lack of \naccountability. There is essentially no reliable record of results. \nFewer than half of the sixty-two training programs scrutinized in a \nrecent GAO investigation bothered to keep track of whether participants \nhad obtained jobs following their training. And only a handful of those \nprograms chose to evaluate whether the training that was provided \nproved integral to securing employment or whether the individual \nparticipant could have obtained the job without receiving the training \nin question.\n  Mr. President, these facts alone would warrant a dramatic overhaul of \nthe Federal job training system with the goal of eliminating \nineffective programs, consolidating programs with identical or similar \nconstituencies and services, and creating a reliable measure of \naccountability. However, I believe we should go further. And in this \nbill, we do.\n  In the legislation which is before us, we give the States the \nresources and the responsibility to establish their own comprehensive, \nintegrated statewide work force development systems. We allow each \nState to develop a network of education, job training and employment \nservices which reflects their own unique needs and circumstances. Yet \nwe also demand results from the States and have devised a means by \nwhich we can assure fairness, integrity, and results.\n  Why, Mr. President, is it so important that the States be given the \nresponsibility for running these programs? There are two basic reasons. \nThe first is efficiency. It should come as no surprise that any Federal \njob training system--responsible for serving all 50 States--would \nsuffer from inordinate overlap and redundancy. The present system has \n19 programs which target youth, as well as several programs serving \neach of a variety of constituencies, including veterans, seniors, \ndislocated workers, and displaced homemakers.\n  States, however, are better situated to determine the actual needs of \nparticular constituencies--to the extent those needs differ from that \nof other individuals seeking assistance. And States are much more \nlikely than the Federal Government to have an accurate assessment of \nthe realistic job opportunities which exist within the State's economy. \nAs Father Bill Cunningham of Detroit's fabulously successful Focus: \nHope training program told the Labor Committee back in January: Before \nany job training program can be successful, we must understand the \ndifference between simply providing jobs for people and that of \nproviding capable and skilled persons to meet the job demands. That is \na critical distinction, but one that is often overlooked.\n  Mr. President, a significant problem with the current system is that \nit is both diffuse and duplicative; individuals seeking assistance \noften have no idea of where to turn for the help they need. And the \nvarious outlets for services usually have no capability or network they \ncan utilize to connect those individuals with particular needs with the \nservices they require. The States are better suited to devise and \noperate a comprehensive, integrated system that will address these \nshortcomings while still remaining sensitive to local needs and \nproblems. Whereas the current system generally creates an new program \nto address every exigent circumstance, States can create a central \nsystem which will meet a variety of needs and demands and serve a \ndiverse array of clientele.\n  In the State of Michigan, we have already spent enormous time and \neffort creating our own statewide work force development system, one \nthat we call Michigan Works! The Michigan Works! system utilizes an \napproach known as no wrong door. This concept means that through \nwhatever point you access the State work force development system, you \nwill either be directly provided or put in contact with any of the \nservices you need.\n  Mr. President, this is the case:\n  If you are an adult on public assistance trying to get your high \nschool equivalency degree so you can get a job; or\n  If you are working at a low skill, low wage job, and you are desiring \nto learn a trade or a skill which will allow you to find a better job \nand earn a better living to support you and your family; or\n  If you are a laid-off assembly line worker who wants to receive \ncomputer training or another high-technology skill to prepare you for \nthe high-wage jobs that are increasingly the boon of our economy.\n  Regardless of who you are or where you enter the system, all the \nservices you could possibly need are only a phone call away because \nMichigan Works! has instituted a 1-800 number to \n\n[[Page S 14986]]\nfacilitate access into its work force development system.\n  Mr. President, the second reason that States ought to be given \ncontrol of these job training programs is one to which I have already \nalluded: namely, flexibility.\n  Each State has its own distinct demographic or economic concerns that \nrequire a unique approach, and Michigan is no different. However, \nMichigan must also take into consideration its geographical diversity \nas well. Michigan's southeastern and south central regions are \nprimarily urban and suburban, whereas the western and northern portions \nof the Michigan's lower peninsula are predominantly rural. And the most \nobvious unique feature that Michigan has to contend with is the Upper \nPeninsula. While the Upper Peninsula is in many areas is essentially \nremote wilderness, there are still over 300,000 people living there. \nWith the area economy linked as it is to agriculture and tourism, the \nunemployment rate during the winter months can be as high as 20 to 25 \npercent. And this is true as well for a number of areas in the northern \nportion of the Lower Peninsula.\n  Obviously, these contrasting areas will require vastly different \napproaches by the Michigan Works! system if the residents of these \nareas are all to be served adequately. It would not be logistically \nfeasible or economically efficient for us to have every possible \nresource or service that a person in the Upper Peninsula might need \navailable just around the corner. That is just not practical. So for \nMichigan it is imperative that options exist beyond the conventional \nnotion of the one-stop career center, where all of the requisite \nservices are available in one central location.\n  Michigan Works! envisions having several different service delivery \noptions. One of these, the multiple points of entry would be ideal for \nthe Upper Peninsula since it proposes to electronically link work force \ndevelopment agencies with service delivery providers and customers--\neven when all three may be separated geographically. Another option \nwould possibly be ideal for the rural areas of the northern southern \npeninsula and among the smaller cities sprinkled throughout western \nMichigan. The hub and cluster model would contain a main center with \nseveral multiple points of entry throughout the given region to provide \noutreach and additional service delivery. These mechanisms could be \ncombined with one-stop centers in our major urban areas to comprise \nMichigan's statewide work force development system. This array of \noptions is possible precisely because of the flexibility afforded \nStates in this legislation.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the most compelling reason I find for \nreforming our Federal job training system is the issue of our \ninternational economic competitiveness. To paraphrase the conclusion \ndrawn in the committee report: Faced with increasingly stiff global \ncompetition, corporate restructuring, and continuing Federal budget \ndeficits, our country cannot afford to support a job training system \nthat wastes precious resources, fails to help train people for the jobs \nof tomorrow, and does not assist employers by providing a work force \nwhich meets their labor needs.\n  One of the criticisms of this bill is that it does not mandate the \ncontinuation of local work force development boards. While that is \ntrue, States are still required to institute some form of State-local \npartnership to promote adequate consultation and cooperation. And if \nStates do establish local development boards, a majority of the members \nof these board must come from business and industry. Business must be a \nkey, if not dominant, feature in the decisionmaking process in order \nfor any work force development system to succeed. In Michigan, we are \nalready committed to having local development boards, and we are \ncommitted to ensuring that the private sector is the dominant force on \nthose panels.\n  Mr. President, to encourage States to establish local work force \ndevelopment boards, this bill offers such States an expanded array of \npermissible economic development activities for which they can utilize \nfunds from their so-called flex account. These economic development \nactivities represent the cutting edge of any truly innovative work \nforce development system. They include:\n  Customized assessments of the skills of workers and an analysis of \nthe skill needs of employers in the State;\n  Upgrading the skills of incumbent workers;\n  Productivity and quality improvement training programs for small- and \nmedium-sized employers;\n  Recognition and use of voluntary, industry developed skill standards;\n  Training activities in companies that are developing modernization \nplans in conjunction with State industrial extension service offices; \nand\n  Onsite, industry specific training programs supportive of industrial \nand economic development.\n  Mr. President, I believe activities such as these are instrumental to \nany successful statewide work force development system. They are also \nexactly the type of policies which will improve our ability as a Nation \nto prosper in an increasingly competitive modern global economy. With \nthe pace of advances made in technology and the increasing frequency \nwith which American workers change jobs, it is of paramount importance \nthat workers, businesses, and whole industries be able to adjust \nrapidly to such circumstances by bolstering existing training or \nlearning new skills. Mr. President, now is the time to lay the ground \nwork for such a capability and enhance our competitiveness heading into \nthe next century. This bill represents a golden opportunity to \naccomplish this important objective.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I support this legislation because it \naccomplishes three of the primary goals I had in coming to Washington \nas a U.S. Senator. It eliminates Federal Government waste by reducing \nineffective or duplicative programs--and the bureaucracy which oversees \nthem. It gives to States, localities, and the private sector much \nstronger control over matters such as education, job training, and \neconomic development. And last, I believe this legislation will produce \na vastly improved American work force development system and, in turn, \nincrease American competitiveness in the years to come.\n  It is for those reasons that I strongly support this legislation, and \nI sincerely hope that the vast majority of my colleagues will see fit \nto support it as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a brief description of \neight different training programs which are part of the Michigan Works! \nsystem be entered in the Record.\n  If my colleagues will look they will see that these programs are very \ninnovative and quite often address a particular constituency or a \nunique need. These are exactly the types of programs which I believe \nwill prosper and proliferate under the legislation we are considering \ntoday.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n          Examples of Michigan Work Force Development Programs\n\n\n        EARN WHILE YOU LEARN (Nominating Sponsor: The Job Force)\n\n       Provides opportunities for youth to develop modern \n     employment skills while instilling a spirit of community \n     service.\n       Students decide when, where, and how the project will \n     proceed.\n       Uniqueness: 1994 NaCO Award for Excellence recipient (one \n     of three nationally).\n       Results: 80 percent of the students suffered no learning \n     loss; 60 percent increased their scores on the Michigan \n     Assessment Test in either Math or Reading.\n\n\n             ACCELERATED TRAINING PROGRAMS (The Job Force)\n\n       Bay De Noc Community College, Michigan Works!, MESC, Delta/\n     Schoolcraft ISD, and local employers have collaborated their \n     strengths, talents and resources in a flexible, results-\n     oriented education and training system.\n       Program has integrated and coordinated various local, State \n     and Federal resources to offer accelerated training program \n     to local residents that meet the demands of the employer \n     community.\n       The first venture was for an accelerated machine tool \n     program.

Mr. President, I am interested in preserving the \ncurrent policy and practice in the Carl Perkins Act for Indian \npostsecondary vocational institutions. During each of the last 6 years \n$4 million has been authorized and $2.9 million has been appropriated \neach year to provide some stability and base operational support for \nthe nationally accredited tribal postsecondary vocational education \ninstitutions. Both the Crownpoint Institute of Technology in New Mexico \nand the United Tribes Technical College in North Dakota are currently \nsupported with these funds. My concern is that this support not be \nabandoned in the legislation under consideration. I understand that the \nsenior Senator from Arizona, who chairs the Committee of Indian \nAffairs, would also like to address this issue.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico. I \nsupport the provisions in Senate bill 143 and would oppose any effort \nthat would earmark funding for a specific Indian vocational \ninstitution, at the expense of all other Indian higher education \ninstitutions. I remind Senator Bingaman that the American Indian Higher \nEducation Consortium, in a September 8, 1995, letter to him, strongly \nopposed such a proposal. I agree with them. To the extent there is less \nfunding available for all 29 tribal postsecondary institutions \nthroughout Indian Country in the coming fiscal years, the reductions \nshould be shouldered by all of these schools in an equitable manner and \nin proportion to how the fiscal year 1995 funds were allocated. I know \nthat this is the intention of my colleague from New Mexico. And, in \nfact, that is the intention of provisions that were developed by the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs and that were incorporated into S. 143.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to join this discussion to \nclarify the intentions of The Workforce Development Act, S. 143, with \nregard to continued funding for Crownpoint Institute of Technology \n[CIT]. The fundamental concern we all have is that in replacing the \nCarl Perkins Act we are also potentially removing the only support CIT \nhas for its basic operating expenses, and we clearly want to avoid this \nkind of financial disaster for CIT. The problem arises because CIT is \nthe only tribally controlled community college or postsecondary \nvocational institute in Indian country that is not funded through the \nDepartment of the Interior. This odd situation is the result of the \nenabling legislation for Tribally Controlled Community Colleges that \nallows each tribe to have only one college. Since CIT and the Navajo \nCommunity College [NCC] are both on the Navajo Nation, only NCC \nqualifies for Interior funding under this act. CIT has relied on the \nCarl Perkins Act for its basic operating expenses, and receives no \nInterior Department funding. While fully supporting the block grant \nconcept in this legislation, we want to assure the continuation of CIT \nand affirm the intention of this legislation to do so.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senators. I have tried to maintain existing \nprotections for the Crownpoint institution because of the important \nwork it accomplishes. I do not want that to be at the expense of other \nfine tribal schools. And I thank the Senator from Arizona for \nclarifying that if there are funding reductions, they be applied \nproportionately to the tribal schools affected. I would ask the \nchairwoman of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, Senator \nKassebaum, whether she shares the views set forth by Senator McCain?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I thank the Senators for their comments. I wish to \nassociate myself with Senator McCain's remarks in this regard. In a \ncooperative effort of our two committees, Senator McCain and I \ndeveloped these provisions with the intention that funding be \nauthorized among the various tribal schools in proportion to the \nFederal allocations that they have received in prior years.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to additionally point out to \nthe Senator from New Mexico that the House and Senate Committee report \nlanguage reflects the intent that these funds should be distributed in \nthe manner we have set forth.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I do thank the Senators for their remarks. It is my \nunderstanding then that if overall funding levels are maintained, the \nequivalent of the level of base operational support provided in fiscal \nyear 1995 should be allocated to these Indian vocational education \ninstitutions. But if funding for these purposes is less than fiscal \nyear 1995 levels, a lesser amount would \n\n[[Page S 14988]]\nbe distributed based on each school's share of the overall amount it \nreceived in 1995.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate these clarifications and \nthe commitment shown by Senators McCain, Kassebaum, and Domenici.\n\n\n               Reforming the Federal Job Training System\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I intend to vote for this job training \nlegislation as an indication of my support for efforts to reform the \nFederal job training system into an integrated, comprehensive, State-\nbased work force development system that serves the real needs of \nunemployed and underemployed workers. I believe the current system does \nneed to be reformed, streamlined, and made more decentralized, and its \nperformance must be measured more accurately. Though there are parts of \nthis bill with which I still seriously disagree, I will vote today to \nmove the process forward and send the bill into conference with the \nHouse.\n  We started this process several years ago when Democrats developed \nour own proposal to streamline the job training system. The scores of \nFederal programs, which spend over $20 billion annually, must be made \nmore coordinated and more coherent, and must better meet the actual \nneeds of job-seekers. On that we are all agreed.\n  We have come a long way from the original version of this bill that \nwas put forth by Senator Kassebaum. The version we will vote on today, \nwhile still imperfect, is a more streamlined, more responsible piece of \nlegislation than the one that was considered by the full Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee some months ago.\n  The governance structure established by the original bill was \nunwieldy, unaccountable, and open to serious abuse, potentially giving \nquasi-private entities approval power over billions in Federal \nspending. It has been much improved, and now final authority and \naccountability rests with the Secretaries of Education and Labor, where \nit should be. There are still some refinements to be made in \nconference, including stronger accountability mechanisms and standards, \nto protect against potential abuses, but it is a marked improvement \nover the original proposal.\n  Since the House does not have such an unwieldy and convoluted \ngovernance structure, I hope the conferees will streamline and simplify \nit, making the lines of accountability clearer in the final bill. The \nprovisions that require states to develop Statewide work force \ndevelopment plans, in consultation with local authorities, and that \nrequire benchmarking of their performance, with specific penalties if \nthey have not performed well, have also been improved.\n  The amended version of the bill retains Job Corps as a national \nprogram, with strict national oversight standards, a zero-tolerance \ndrug policy, and other key reforms. For people in my State served by \nthe HHH Job Corps Center in the Twin Cities, which serves hard-to-serve \nyoung people who might otherwise be effectively shut out of our social \nand economic life together, retaining and strengthening Job Corps, \nwhile providing for new guidelines and performance benchmarks, was a \nkey step forward. We heard in the committee from young people who had \nbeen helped by the HHH Center's programs, and by others in Job Corps \nPrograms throughout the country. Though some Job Corps centers are in \nneed of reform, much of which is required by this bill, I believe \nstrongly in the program and will continue to support it.\n  We have also fixed the outrageous provision in the original bill that \nwould have repealed the Federal Trade Adjustment Assistance Program for \nworkers dislocated by U.S. trade policies--including NAFTA and GATT. I \nwas an original cosponsor of this amendment because those programs have \nserved thousands of people in my State, providing both job training and \nincome support assistance during interim periods while they looked for \nnew jobs, and I did not believe we could go back on our word to provide \nworkers with such aid. Even those who supported NAFTA made this \ncommitment to help these workers, and it would have been truly \noutrageous if our amendment had not been approved. Since the House \nversion of the bill does not repeal this program either, I am confident \nthe final version of the bill will preserve it.\n  There were several other key improvements to the bill that were made \nduring Senate consideration. The Senate's adoption of the amendment to \nset aside funds for a rapid response fund, administered by the \nSecretary of Labor, for workers dislocated by mass layoffs like plant \nclosures, disasters, or other similar contingencies, was critically \nimportant. In addition to this provision, there should also be a \nmandate that States must serve dislocated workers; that is not in the \ncurrent version of the bill, and should be included in conference. \nWhile some States, perhaps most, will likely serve these workers, there \nshould be a guarantee in the bill that they be served.\n  The bill provides for at least some assistance to migrant workers, \nthough as under current law far less than is actually needed for that \noften desperately poor and mobile population. It provides key job \nprotections for people in State employment service offices, and \nrequires health and safety, antidiscrimination, and other protections \nfor job training program participants.\n  It mandates that States provide at least some level of summer youth \njob training assistance, though I remain very concerned that efforts to \nvirtually gut the program's funding in the appropriations process may \nyet be successful, leaving hundreds of thousands of American youth \nwithout jobs during the summer in some of the most desperate inner-city \nneighborhoods of our Nation. But I have fought the first round of that \nfight on the rescissions bill, and the second round of that funding \nfight will come later this month.\n  The bill imposes a cap on the amount of job training funds that can \nbe used by States for economic development activities, to ensure \nagainst their being used as just an economic development honey-pot that \ndoes not serve the primary purposes for which these Federal funds are \nintended--job retraining and reemployment. It also includes key \nprovisions, which I insisted upon when the Labor Committee considered \nthe bill, which require that representatives of veterans be given a \nseat on work force development boards, and be consulted along with \nother community leaders as State job training plans are developed. I am \npleased that my efforts to include these provisions in the bill were \nsuccessful.\n  As I have said, there are still serious problems with this bill. \nOverall, it makes substantial cuts in job training program funding, at \nprecisely the time we should be maintaining adequate funding, investing \nin the character, skills and intellect of our people. While there may \nbe some modest administrative savings from consolidating programs, I \nthink that the huge savings estimated by some are wildly exaggerated, \nand are nowhere near the amounts cut in this bill. These reduced levels \nundermine our ability to provide American workers with the job \ntraining, education, and employment services they need to meet the \nneeds of the next century.\n  It also moves us a step away from a Federal system which targets \nresources to those who most need it--dislocated workers, economically \ndisadvantaged adults, and others--a trend which could prove disastrous \nif cash-strapped States decide they cannot afford to serve these \npopulations. I am worried about that, and believe we in Congress will \nhave to carefully monitor the program's implementation to ensure that \nthose who are most in need are served by the States.\n  In addition, I think including education programs in a job training \nconsolidation effort is a serious mistake. I worked hard at the \nbeginning of this legislative process to keep programs like Perkins \nVocational Education Program out of this bill. I believe that program \nin particular should maintain its focus as an education program instead \nof being swept into a job training bill.\n  Overall, this bill eliminates six separate education programs and \nturns them into a block grant to the States. The block grant funds are \nto be used for vocational education and adult education, but the bill \nsets no minimum level of funding for either function. We have worked \nhard to improve the Perkins program and to use it to help integrate \nvocational and academic education. By repealing Perkins we risk \n\n[[Page S 14989]]\ntaking several steps backward in those efforts.\n  This bill reduces funding for important education programs, including \nvocational education at the high school and college level. By reducing \nthe Federal dollars allocated to education programs, and creating a \nblock grant to serve both education and job training needs, we will \nlikely divert much-needed funds from key education programs. I am \nhopeful that the education provisions of the bill will be overhauled in \nconference, and that some of the job training changes I have urged will \nalso be addressed. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am reluctantly voting for final \npassage of the Workforce Development Act, as amended by the Senate.\n  I believe several of these amendments were key to making the bill \nmuch more favorable to California. I say I support the bill reluctantly \nbecause I believe the overall 15-percent reduction in job training \nfunding is unwise for this country and the cut in funding for \nCalifornia is unfair for my State still struggling out of an economic \nrecession, repeated, disproportionate base closings, and downsizings \nand dislocations in defense and other industries.\n  Nevertheless, I will vote for the bill because I support the \nunderlying program to consolidate our many separate job training \nprograms, just as I supported the similar Democratic version in the \nlast session of the Congress. As debate on this bill has shown, there \nis bipartisan interest in consolidating and reforming our job training \nprograms to provide more flexibility to deal with our changing economy.\n  But there were some programs eliminated in the committee bill that I \nwas pleased have been restored by the full Senate.\n  One of these was the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program. This \nprogram provides services to workers who lose their jobs as a result of \ncompetition from imported goods. It is a critical program to continue \nin the wake of the North American Free-Trade Agreement and the General \nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade. This program was restored to our job \ntraining program by the Moynihan amendment.\n  I also supported the amendment offered by Senator Simon and Senator \nSpecter, to keep the Job Corps Program a national program.\n  The committee bill would have turned the program over to the States \nas part of the block grant for job training. It would have been a State \noption to continue Job Corps.\n  Job Corps is one of the most successful programs to emerge from the \nefforts of Congress in the 1960's to attack the crisis in urban poverty \nand unemployment. Created in 1964, the Job Corps is the oldest, \nlargest, and most comprehensive residential training and education \nprogram for young, unemployed, and undereducated youths ages 16-24.\n  In 1982 Job Corps was incorporated into the Republican-sponsored Job \nTraining and Partnership Act, authored by then-Senator Dan Quayle. It \nwas a good idea in 1964, it was a good idea in 1982, and it is still a \ngood idea in 1995.\n  The Clinton administration has already addressed many of the problems \noften cited about the Job Corps. The Labor Department is imposing \ntougher performance standards, better screenings of participants and \ncontractors, and other steps. Many of these reforms would be made law \nunder the Specter-Simon Amendment.\n  This amendment would also weed out some of the weaker performing \ncenters over the next 5 years. It would not abruptly close 25 centers--\na quarter of the Job Corps, as the bill before us would do.\n  None of the six centers in California would be closed directly under \nthe committee bill. California centers have not had problems in \nbehavior and management that were targeted by the Inspector General.\n  However, two new centers for Long Beach and San Francisco were \nselected in 1994 to become operational in 1997. The Kassebaum bill \nwould not authorize funds to operate these two new centers. This would \nbe a particular blow for the Long Beach area, where the economy will \nsuffer from the planned closing of the naval shipyard.\n  Last program-year about 3,700 students participated in Job Corps at \nsix centers throughout California and more than 80 percent were placed \nin jobs, joined the military, or pursued further education--a rate \nhigher than the national average.\n  Even if California agrees to continue to operate these centers under \na State program--and that is not assured--the centers would still lose \nif the national program is eliminated. Job Corps trains students to get \njobs in the national market, not just the region. Enrollees can choose \ncenters across the country that best match their career plans. \nNationwide Job Corps provides vocational training in more than 100 \ntrades, including construction, marketing, mechanics, and agriculture.\n  Why replace one relatively small, cost-efficient bureaucracy to \nadminister the program nationally with 50 separate bureaucracies in the \nStates?\n  There are nearly 730,000 youth living in poverty in California, the \nmost of any State and about 200,000 higher than the next highest State, \nTexas. There are an estimated 151,000 youths in California in need of \nJob Corps. There are only 3 youths in California enrolled in Job Corps \nfor every 100 who need to be enrolled. Nationally, there are 18 \nenrolled for every 100 who need it.\n  In California, from 1980 to 1990 the unemployment among black \nteenagers rose from 26 to 31 percent, for Hispanic youth 16 to 21 \npercent and for white teenagers from 13 to 15 percent.\n  Mr. President, I have been acutely aware of the impact of the Job \nCorps in California since I was elected to the Senate.\n  The San Francisco Board of Supervisors in January 1993 passed a \nresolution on Job Corps which said in part:\n\n       . . . The unwillingness of society to invest in \n     disadvantaged young people results in high unemployment \n     rates, discouragement, a disinvestment in society, and \n     frustration, and the costs of the unwillingness to invest \n     results in incalculable discouragement, suffering and \n     violence throughout, in particular, the African-American, \n     Hispanic, and other disadvantaged communities, as well as \n     throughout the entire City of San Francisco . . .\n\n  The same can be said for Los Angeles, San Diego, San Bernardino, \nSacramento and San Jose--the other cities in my State with centers \nwhich have provided more than $2 million in community-related services \nsince 1989.\n  This is not a perfect bill, but the bipartisan action on the Senate \nfloor has made it a better bill. The final version will not be known \nuntil the Senate works out its differences with a similar bill in the \nHouse. I will be watching that process and will reserve my support \nuntil I can see the final version.\n  One of the areas ripe for improvement will be to require the use of \nlocal workforce development boards. The Senate bill allows but does not \nmandate this key element in an effective delivery of job training \nservices. These boards are essential to ensuring a meaningful \nleadership role for business and other private-sector representatives \nin the development and operation of employment and training programs. \nTheir role would be similar to that of the private industry councils \nwhich serve now under the Job Training Partnership Act.\n  I urge the Senate conferees to support local oversight of job \ntraining services by requiring the local work force development boards.\n\n\n                      federal governance structure\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the purposes of this \nlegislation but continue to have some real concerns about certain \nprovisions in the bill. I am particularly concerned about the Federal \ngovernance structure mandated in the bill, including: the ambiguous \nrelationships between the two secretaries; the unprecedented use of a \nboard structure to run an operating agency; the composition of the \nproposed Federal partnership; and the drastic Federal staffing cuts. \nEach of these issues gives me great pause. Taken together, I fear that \neffectiveness of job training consolidation may be jeopardized.\n  Proponents offer two key reasons for such significant organizational \nchange--the first is to save money, and the second is to provide better \nservice. I do not believe that we will achieve either under the current \nproposal.\n  My colleague from Ohio has been a leader in the area of Government \nreform, and I would be interested in his observations on this issue.\n  Mr. GLENN. I share the concerns expressed by the senior Senator from \n\n[[Page S 14990]]\n  Massachusetts. The legislation before us proposes a Federal governance \nstructure that is intended to maximize coordination between the \nDepartments of Labor and Education in the oversight of education and \ntraining block grant funds. And it is intended to increase the private \nsector's influence on education and training policy through a national \nboard. Although these are desirable goals, they would be achieved \nthrough a governance structure, including proposed staff reductions, \nthat would be virtually unworkable because it violates several basic \nprinciples of organizational reform.\n  First, it violates the principle of establishing clear lines of \nauthority, by creating a new ``Workforce Development Partnership'' \nwithin the Departments of Labor and Education under the direction of a \nnational board. The Workforce Development Partnership, as it stands, is \nso unwieldy that I fear it may be unworkable, and the resulting \ndisorder would undermine the promise of devolving greater \nresponsibilities to the States. When you have accountability dispersed \nacross two departments and one board, you really don't have \naccountability. Instead, you have confusion, ``passing the buck'' and a \nfailure to solve problems.\n  Second, it violates the principle of matching functions and \nstructures. Experience shows that boards are good at some things: \nventing a broad array of opinion; debating issues; formulating policy; \nand ensuring consensus for that policy. Boards are not good, however, \nat carrying out administrative and management responsibilities, in part \nbecause of the need to make quick decisions. This bill assigns various \nadministrative and management responsibilities to the national board \nthat it is least capable of carrying out. The board's failure to \neffectively carry out such administrative and management \nresponsibilities could undermine the ability of the States to implement \na new work force development system.\n\n  Third, it violates the principle that adequate resources should be \nprovided to carry out a task, by specifying an arbitrary and \nsignificant staffing cut that is likely to undermine the critical \nFederal role in making the transition to the new work force development \nsystem. The drastic change required by this legislation raises enormous \ntransition problems. Putting this into place will require considerable \nimagination, innovation, patience, and investment--of time and money.\n  This is very hard to do if one partner is crippled by arbitrary \nstaffing cuts at the beginning. This bill does not envision a handsoff \nrole for the Federal Government. It instead mandates a very important \nFederal role--particularly in the transition--with respect to assisting \nthe States in establishing new innovative, performance-based systems; \ncharting new work force development plans; creating one-stop shopping \nfor individuals and employers; measuring the success of the system and \nintegrating it with other efforts. A proper Federal role is the key to \npromoting accountability and efficiency and to ensuring that confusion \nat the Federal level will not undermine the ambitious goals of the work \nforce development system.\n  I would like to illustrate the challenges of transition by focusing \non grant closeout. Based on the Department of Labor's most recent major \nprogram closeout--the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act \n[CETA]--the closeout effort would likely take 2 to 3 years. Planning \nfor the CETA closeout began in early 1982. Although CETA ceased \noperations on October 13, 1983, most related closeout activity was not \ncompleted until the end of 1985. Considerable resources were involved \nin bringing to an end the 10-year program in 470 localities. The \nDepartment's Office of Inspector General was also heavily involved, and \nin its 1984 semiannual report noted ``* * * it was necessary to devote \ntremendous audit resources to ensure the fiscal integrity of the \ncloseout.''\n  This is not to say that some staffing cuts in the future may not be \nappropriate. Before specifying such cuts, however, we need to take heed \nof a simple lesson from the business world: successful reforms are \ngoal-oriented and carefully planned. The first step is to ask what you \nare trying to accomplish. Moving boxes around on an organizational \nchart looks impressive and satisfies our desire for action. But it does \nnot make for good policy. It would not achieve the desired results and \nwould certainly impose a period of transitional chaos.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for raising these important \nissues.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think the Senator from Ohio has made it clear that \nrestructuring, while desirable, has to be thoughtfully done. \nRestructuring in business and government shows that structure is \nsecondary to mission in successful reform efforts. Restructuring \nrequires careful planning. This bill puts the cart before the horse. \nThe Federal partnership would begin with a cut, without careful \nconsideration of what needs to be achieved at the Federal level and the \nstaffing level required to carry out such activities.\n  I look forward to the conference where I hope we will have an \nopportunity to fix some of these problems.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Senator \nAbraham be added as a cosponsor to S. 143.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I believe there are no further \namendments.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know of none on our side.\n\n\n                      federal governance structure\n\n  Although I support this legislation and am voting for it, I continue \nto have concerns about various provisions in it. I am particularly \nconcerned about the Federal governance structure mandated in the bill, \nincluding: The ambiguous relationship between the two Secretaries; the \nunprecedented use of a board structure to run an operating agency; the \ncomposition of the proposed Federal partnership; and the drastic \nFederal staffing cuts specified in the bill. Each of these issues is \nworthy of concern. Taken together, there is cause for this efforts to \nbe dead on arrival, simply unable to operate.\n  Proponents offer two key reasons for such significant organizational \nchange--the first is to save money, and the second is to provide better \nservice. I do not believe that we will achieve either under the current \nproposal.\n  I would be interested in the observations on this issue of my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Glenn, who has been a leader in the \narea of governmental reform.\n  Mr. GLENN. I share the concerns of the Senator from Massachusetts \n[Mr. Kennedy]. The legislation proposes a Federal governance structure \nthat is intended to maximize coordination between the Department of \nLabor and Education in the oversight of education and training block \ngrant funds, as well as increase the private sector's influence on \neducation and training policy through a national board. Although these \nare desirable goals, they would be achieved through a governance \nstructure, including proposed staff reductions, that would be virtually \nunworkable because it violates several basic principles of undertaking \nsuch organization reform.\n  First, it would violate the principle of establishing clear lines of \nauthority, by creating a new work force development partnership within \nthe Departments of Labor and Education under the direction of a \nnational board. The work force development partnership, as it stands, \nis so unwieldy as to be devolving greater responsibilities to the \nStates. You would have confusion, passing the buck, and a failure to \nsolve problems.\n\n  Second, it would violate the principle of matching functions and \nstructures. Experience shows that boards are good at some things: \nVenting a broad array of opinion; debating issues; making policy; and \nensuring consensus for that policy. Boards are not good, however, at \ncarrying out administrative and management responsibilities, in part \nbecause of the need to make quick decisions. This bill assigns various \nadministrative and management responsibilities to the national board \nthat it is least capable of carrying out. The Board's failure to carry \nout such administrative and management responsibilities effectively \ncould undermine the ability of the States to implement a new work force \ndevelopment system.\n  Third, it would violate the principle of providing resources adequate \nfor carrying out the task, by specifying an arbitrary one-third \nstaffing cut that is likely to undermine the critical Federal role in \nmaking the transition to \n\n[[Page S 14991]]\nthe new work force development system. The drastic change required by \nthis legislation raises enormous transition problems. It requires \nconsiderable imagination, innovation, patience, and investment--of time \nand money--to put in place.\n  This is very hard to do if one partner is crippled by arbitrary \nstaffing cuts at the beginning. This bill does not envision a hands-off \nrole for the Federal Government. It instead mandates a very important \nFederal role, particularly in the transition, with respect to assisting \nthe States in establishing new, innovative, performance-based systems, \ncharting new, work force development plans, creating one-stop shopping \nfor individuals and employers, measuring the success of the system, and \nintegrating it with other efforts. A proper Federal role is the key to \npromoting accountability and efficiency and to ensure that confusion at \nthe Federal level will not undermine the ambitious goals of the work \nforce development system.\n\n  I would like to illustrate the challenges of transition by focusing \non grant closeout. Based on the Department of Labor's most recent major \nprogram closeout--the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act [CETA], \nthe closeout effort would be likely to take 2 to 3 years. Planning for \nthe CETA closeout began in early 1982. Although CETA ceased operations \non October 13, 1983, most related closeout activity was not completed \nuntil the end of 1985. Considerable resources were involved in bringing \nto an end the 10-year program in 470 localities. The Department's \noffice of the inspector general also was heavily involved, and in its \n1994 semiannual report noted ``* * * it was necessary to devote \ntremendous audit resources to ensure the fiscal integrity of the \ncloseout.''\n  This is not to say that some Federal staffing cuts in the future may \nbe not appropriate. Before specifying such cuts, however, we need to \ntake heed of a simple lesson from the business world: Successful \nreforms are goal-oriented and carefully planned. The first step is to \nask what you are trying to accomplish. Moving boxes around on an \norganizational chart looks impressive and satisfies our desire for \naction. But it does not make for good policy. It would not achieve the \ndesired results and would certainly impose a period of transitional \nchaos.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think the Senator from Ohio has made it clear that \nrestructuring, while desirable, has to be thoughtfully done. \nRestructuring requires careful planning. This bill puts the cart before \nthe horse. The Federal partnership would begin with a cut, without \ncareful consideration of what needs to be achieved at the Federal level \nand the staffing level required to carry out such activities.\n  I look forward to the conference and an opportunity to begin fixing \nthese problems.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2885, as amended.\n  So the amendment (No. 2885), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further amendments to be \nproposed, the question is on the engrossment and third reading of the \nbill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, and was \nread the third time.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee be immediately discharged from further consideration of H.R. \n1617, the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration, that all after \nthe enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 143, as amended, be \ninserted in lieu thereof; further, that H.R. 1617 then be read for a \nthird time and the Senate immediately proceed to vote on passage of the \nbill.\n  I further ask consent that following passage of H.R. 1617, the Senate \ninsist on its amendment and request a conference with the House, and \nthe Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, \nand S. 143 be placed back on the calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1617) to consolidate and reform work force \n     development and literacy programs and for other purposes.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on final \npassage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the title to \nthe desk and ask unanimous consent that it be considered and agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The title was amended so as to read:\n\n       A bill to consolidate Federal employment training, \n     vocational education, and adult education programs and create \n     integrated statewide workforce development systems, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, in approving the Workforce Development \nAct, I believe the Senate has taken a great step forward in reforming \nFederal work force development efforts. It truly is a major and \ninnovative approach that I think will serve both our education and job \ntraining arenas with great success.\n  Arriving at this point has been a long and difficult endeavor. Wiping \nthe slate clean, so to speak, has meant convincing those who have \ninvested time in existing programs that there is a better way to \naccomplish their goals. Taking the next step in developing that better \nway has proven to be just as challenging.\n  Mr. President, I am convinced that the time and effort put into this \nlegislation has been worth it. We now have a blueprint for a system in \nwhich the needs of all who require a job, job training and job \ntraining-related education can be addressed. It is a system where the \nStates will have flexibility to fit their needs while being accountable \nto the public for the use of Federal funds. It is a system which \ncreates incentives for the involvement of a true partnership among job \ntraining advocates, educators, the business community, and State \ngovernments.\n  It has taken a couple of years, if not more, to put this proposal \ntogether and many hearings and consultations and many individuals have \nmade major contributions to this effort. It is not possible to name \nthem all. However, I do want to acknowledge several of them. \n\n[[Page S 14992]]\n\n  In particular, I express my appreciation to the members of my staff \nwho have worked on this legislation: Ted Verheggen, Carla Widener, \nWendy Cramer, Bob Stokes, and Susan Hattan. Other staff of committee \nmembers on both sides of the aisle have also made significant \ncontributions to this legislation. From the Republican staff, I would \ninclude Sherry Kaiman and Reg Jones with Senator Jeffords, Pat \nMorrissey and Carol Fox with Senator Frist, Dwayne Sattler with Senator \nDeWine, Rick Murphy with Senator Gregg, Don Trigg with Senator \nAshcroft, and Gregg Willhauck with Senator Abraham.\n  On the Democratic side of the aisle, I would like to express \nappreciation particularly to Ellen Guiney, Libby Street, Sarah Fox, and \nOmer Waddles with Senator Kennedy; David Evans and Kevin Wilson with \nSenator Pell; Suzanne Day with Senator Dodd; Charlie Barrone with \nSenator Simon; Bobby Silverstein and Bev Schroeder with Senator Harkin. \nI also want to recognize the efforts of Liz Aldridge and Mark Sigurski, \nwho produced the legislative language with many of the incarnations of \nthis legislation. In some ways this perhaps is the most trying and \ndifficult part of the bill.\n  A special thanks also goes to Rick Appling and Ann Lordaman, of the \nCongressional Research Service. The staff of the General Accounting \nOffice, the leadership of the Republican Governors Workforce \nDevelopment Task Force, and many individuals in the business and \neducation communities also lent valuable support to this effort.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to say a special word about \nSteve Spinner. Senator Kennedy gave an eloquent tribute to Steve \nSpinner in his opening remarks as we started the debate on the \nWorkforce Development Act. As a member of Senator Kennedy's staff, he \nworked very closely with me and my staff in developing the work force \ntraining provisions of this bill. He cared very deeply about bringing \nabout reform in this area and offered invaluable advice, assistance and \nsuggestions based on his experience in the field. His dedication and \nprofessionalism earned him great respect on both sides of the aisle. \nUnfortunately, Steve died of cancer a few weeks ago. We deeply regret \nhis loss and regret he was unable to see through an effort to which he \nhad devoted so much time and talent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the good chairman of our committee was \nspeaking with her heart and soul about the extraordinary work of Steve \nSpinner who spent an enormous amount of time and energy in the \ndeveloping and shaping of this legislation. He died just 2 weeks ago, \nat a young age, but made a remarkable contribution, which, through this \nlegislation, other good works will live on for a very considerable \nperiod of time. And because of his works, young and old will have a \nbetter opportunity to have a more hopeful life, a better chance to \nprovide for their families.\n  We are, I think, all extremely fortunate to have the help and \nassistance of extraordinary, dedicated men and women who help us with \nour legislative duties, but more than that are highly motivated and \nincredibly gifted and talented in their profession and whose work is \nabsolutely essential and invaluable in shaping legislation. Steve \nSpinner falls in that category, as well as so many others that Senator \nKassebaum mentioned and that I will include.\n  But Steve Spinner was a rare, uncommon individual. And I think those \nof us who serve on that committee are mindful at this moment with the \nsuccessful passage of the legislation, not just by the handful of votes \nwhich would have been sufficient to see its completion, but the \nextraordinary efforts to try to encompass the breadth of this body in \nterms of focusing and giving attention to the needs of those that will \nbenefit from this legislation was really extraordinary. And I think to \na great degree the fact that we have had such overwhelming support for \nthis legislation was a real tribute to Steve and his efforts and \nenergies over a long period of time. Others were certainly \nindispensable as that path went along, but I think Steve, all of us \nrecognized, was someone who was very, very gifted.\n  I also would mention Steve's wife, Claire and daughter Elisa at this \nmoment as well. Elisa is 4 years old, and Claire was a very lovely and \nwonderful, devoted companion.\n  Mr. President, the legislation which we voted on this afternoon is a \nculmination of a long, bipartisan effort to reexamine and refocus the \nFederal role in the education and training of America's workers. And \nthis complex effort involves many separate decisions and judgments \nabout the services that are most effective, the appropriate roles of \nthe Federal, State, and local governments in job training and how best \nto ensure that available resources are targeted to those who need them \nthe most.\n  Much of our debate over the last 2 days has been focused on those \nquestions, and appropriately so. But as we face the vote on the final \npassage of the legislation, it was important to consider how much is at \nstake in this bill and how important this issue is to our country and \nto its future.\n  The challenges of creating a world-class work force are central to \nAmerica's ability to compete successfully in the global economy. It is \nalso central to our standard of living and the quality of life for all \nof our people. The economic indicators are sending a message that none \nof us can ignore. Corporate profits are up, productivity is increasing, \nbut the wages of most Americans are not.\n  Since 1979, the national household income has increased, but almost \nall of that increase has gone to families in the top 20 percent. And 60 \npercent of American households have actually seen their family incomes \nin real dollars decrease. The gap in income between the most affluent \nand least affluent members of our society is greater today than at any \ntime since records began to be kept after World War II. It far exceeds \nthe gap in any other industrial nation in the world. And the gap is \nwidening, not decreasing.\n  Many different factors have contributed to this problem, but one \nelement in the picture stands out. Men and women who lack education and \njob skills are having the hardest time of all. Three-quarters of \nAmerican workers are without 4-year college degrees. They have suffered \nthe steepest drop in wages and benefits. At the start of the 1980's, a \nmale college graduate typically earned 49 percent more than a male high \nschool graduate. Today the differential is 85 percent. The evidence is \noverwhelming that one realistic way toward reversing that dangerous \ntrend is to improve the education and training available to workers.\n  For every year of additional education or job training after high \nschool, a worker's income increases by 6 to 12 percent. That is why the \nlegislation we are considering today is so important. The Federal \nGovernment has had a long history of involvement in job training, from \nthe manpower programs in the 1960's to CETA in the 1970's to the Job \nTraining Partnership Act of the 1980's, and many other training \nprograms administered by the Department of Labor or the Department of \nEducation.\n  The record of success is clearly mixed. And what we are attempting to \ndo at the Federal level today is a clear departure from what we have \ndone in the past and taking us into new territory. Our past job \ntraining policy was based on the assumption that the vast majority of \nworkers would acquire basic skills in schools and that these skills \nwould enable young men and women to attain good jobs with decent wages \nand benefits and work productively in those jobs for the rest of their \nlives.\n  On this basis, Federal training programs focused on particular groups \nfacing special barriers--the disadvantaged, the disabled, and in more \nrecent years the dislocated worker. There was a clear recognition that \nmembers of these groups needed special assistance. But at the same \ntime, it was assumed most workers were already in the mainstream and \ncould succeed effectively on their own.\n  We have had a rude awakening. In the highly competitive global \neconomy that has emerged in recent years, U.S. workers have been losing \nground. And in the painful process of analyzing that decline, we have \ncome to realize that on the issue of job training we have not been \ndoing the job.\n  It is not just the disadvantaged, disabled, and dislocated who suffer \nfrom \n\n[[Page S 14993]]\ninadequate education and training; it is a work-force-wide problem. \nCompared to other nations, we have clearly been underinvesting in the \neducation and training of the vast majority of our workers. And \nAmerican working families are paying a heavy price for that neglect.\n  Now for the first time we are looking at Federal training programs as \npart of a competitiveness strategy, central to the Nation's overall \neconomic future. And that, in turn, has required us to broaden our \noutlook, to start seeing these issues in terms of the need for the kind \nof broader bipartisan reform we are recommending today.\n  In a sense, this bipartisan movement for reform began with Senator \nDan Quayle's Job Training Partnership Act in 1982 and its effort to \ninvolve the private sector more closely in such reform.\n  The second major milestone on the road to reform was the 1990 reform \nreport of America's Choice Commission, cochaired by two distinguished \nformer Secretaries of Labor, Bill Brock and Ray Marshall, and their \nclear warning that unless we changed our ways, we were on the race to \nthe bottom in the global economy.\n  The next major landmark was the 1992 report by the congressional \nGeneral Accounting Office that so effectively blew the whistle on the \ncurrent confusing array of Federal programs, and the past two \nCongresses picked up the challenge. We held bipartisan hearings on all \nof these challenges, enacted initial important reforms, such as the \nschool-to-work legislation signed by President Clinton. And throughout \nthis process in recent years, Senator Kassebaum and I have worked \nclosely together to agree on the broad direction of reform. This \nlegislation is the result of both of our efforts, and I commend her for \nher leadership, for without her leadership, we would not be where we \nare today.\n  We have not always agreed on all of the details, but we have \ncertainly agreed on the major directions of the reforms we need. But we \nboth are well aware that there are no simple answers and no silver \nbullets. We have approached this challenge with a maximum of \nbipartisanship and minimum of ideology.\n  This legislation is, obviously, not a final answer to the serious \nchallenges that we face, but is a far better answer than we have had so \nfar. I am grateful that the Senate has passed it by an overwhelming \nmajority.\n  Mr. President, I want to join in mentioning very briefly our \ncolleagues who have participated in this so actively. I mentioned the \nsignificant and outstanding leadership of the chairperson of our \ncommittee, Senator Kassebaum, whose commitment in this area has been \nreally extraordinary. When we look over the broad range of debates and \ndiscussions that we have had over the period of this Congress, I think \nthis really stands out as an extraordinary effort to try and bring \ntogether the diverse viewpoints and ideas and do it in a way which \nreally represents the best in legislative effort in drawing the strong \nbipartisan support, and support from all the different elements of this \nbody:\n  Senator Jeffords, with his strong commitment in education and the \nAdult Education Program, with our colleague Senator Pell, who has done \nso much in chairing and being the ranking minority member of the \neducation committee for such a long period of time;\n  For Senators Specter and Simon, who were so committed on the issues \nof the Job Corps and who spent a great deal of time on that issue;\n  To my friend and colleague, Senator Dodd on the dislocated workers \nand the national priorities which will extend not only to the \nindustrial areas but also will include the national priorities for \nthose all over this Nation. It is an important program and we are \ngrateful for his leadership;\n  Senator Breaux and Senator Daschle for the work that they did in \ndevising a completely different concept in permitting the maximum \nflexibility for individuals to make choices and selections out of the \nwide, diverse numbers of training programs so that they would be able \nto maximize their own skills and talents and innovative programs which \nthey have pursued for some period of time and which has been included \nin this legislation;\n  Senator Moynihan on the trade adjustment.\n  Senator Mikulski, who was so much involved in the senior community \nemployment issue and which was not a part of this program, but she was \nso much involved in its continued success.\n  Senator Kassebaum has mentioned many of those who have been so \ninvolved. I want to particularly recognize Omer Waddles, who has done \nsuch extraordinary work, particularly in following up on the superb \nwork of Steve Spinner, Ellen Guiney, Libby Street, Ross Eisenbrey, Greg \nYoung, Sarah Fox, and Nick Littlefield, our general counsel, who is \ntireless in all of his endeavors and work on this legislation; Dave \nEvans, Mort Zuckerman for Senator Simon; Suzanne Day, Bev Schroeder, \nSenator Harkin; Bobby Silverstein, again, with Senator Harkin.\n  Even though Senator Kassebaum has mentioned some of those who have \nserved with her on the Republican side, we often find that their \ntalents are invaluable to all of us on this issue.\n  There are many others: Susan Hattan, Ted Verheggen, Carla Widener, \nand Wendy Cramer. To all of those and others, I am enormously grateful \nfor their support.\n  I want to thank the majority leader for scheduling this legislation \nand the minority leader as well for giving it a priority for us as \nwell.\n  I am glad we were able to move this process forward. We look forward \nto the conference with the House Members, and we hope that the spirit \nof comity and cooperation and bipartisanship, which has been reflected \nin this debate during the past few days, will be evident in the \nconference and when the conference report returns.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues Senator \nKassebaum and Senator Kennedy. This was a priority matter, and it was \ncompleted on schedule, on time. I thank both my colleagues for that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/11/senate-section/article/S14983-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CUBAN LIBERTY AND DEMOCRATIC SOLIDARITY [LIBERTAD] ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I will just say a word and then turn it over \nto the distinguished Senator of the committee, Senator Helms. Senator \nPell is here, Senator Dodd is here, and they will continue the debate.\n  I want to say just as I leave--not leave, but leave the floor, that \nis, not leave the Senate--I am not certain what the administration \npolicy is toward Cuba. President Clinton says he wants to tighten the \nembargo on Castro's Cuba, and then the White House issues veto threats \non the legislation which toughens sanctions. President Clinton says he \nwants to increase pressure on Castro, and then he cuts a secret deal \nwith him and changes the U.S. embargo and allows more money to flow to \nCastro.\n  But whatever the administration's policy is, the Senate will have a \nchance to speak on this legislation. We will have to speak for the \nCuban people who have been muzzled so long by Castro's tyranny.\n  The choice in this legislation is simple: Do you want to increase \npressure on the last dictatorship in the hemisphere, or let Castro off \nthe hook.\n  Many in the United States actually want to end the embargo, and in \nthe coming debate, they will argue about property rights, legal \ninterpretations, free trade, about many things. But let there be no \nmistake, passing this bill is about supporting democratic change in \nCuba and sending Fidel Castro the way of all other dictators of Latin \nAmerica.\n  Let me also indicate that they have had a very good debate on the \nHouse floor on this similar bill, the Burton bill, the Burton-\nTorricelli bill on the House side. Sixty-seven Democrats had strong \nbipartisan support on the measure. It passed with strong bipartisan \nsupport. I know we have bipartisan support here. I hope we will have \nenough support that we can obtain the 60 votes on cloture, pass this \nbill, go on to conference and send it to the President. I also hope \nthat we do not grant a visa, of course, to Castro to visit the United \nNations any time in the future. I assume that may be in the works.\n  This is an important bill, an important debate. It is about the last \ndictator in this hemisphere. I hope that we will tighten sanctions, \nwhich is precisely what the bill sponsored by Senator Helms, myself, \nand others does. There are a number of cosponsors, as the Record will \nreflect, Republicans and Democrats alike, cosponsoring this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I indicate to my colleagues that there will \nbe no more votes today. There is an agreement that there will be no \namendments offered today. There will be lengthy discussions on both \nsides, as I understand it. So there will not be any votes. I give my \ncolleagues advance notice of that.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, we were very proud to present to all of \nAmerica today Miss America, Shawntel Smith. She has requested that I \nsubmit her statement, which she made today on the lawn of the Capitol, \nfor the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent at this time to have printed in the Record \nthe statement by the new Miss America, and former Miss Oklahoma, \nShawntel Smith.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            School-to-Work: Reinventing America's Work Force\n\n       (Platform Statement of Shawntel Smith, Miss America 1996)\n\n       As global communications and technological propel us toward \n     the 21st century, we Americans are falling further and \n     further behind. Everyday, millions of men and women wake up \n     and go to work in jobs that fall short of their American \n     dream, while in some places as many as 50% of our high school \n     students simply drop out. Because many American workers and \n     students are neither motivated nor clear about their economic \n     future, they flounder.\n       As a nation, our competitive positions remains stagnant. \n     Lagging productivity growth rates, rising unemployment and \n     the absence of a skilled work force widen the gap between \n     America and its competitors. American business and industry \n     struggle to fill the jobs that exist because candidates lack \n     the skills and education to make the grade.\n       America's classrooms and America's workplace today are out \n     of sync. We're simply not preparing our nation's youth for \n     the high skill, high wage jobs of a technology-based economy, \n     and for that we all suffer. Students who cannot find the \n     relevance in what they're learning, adults who cannot replace \n     lost jobs, educators who cannot motivate their students, and \n     employers who cannot compete.\n       As Miss America and as a student, I advocate school-to-work \n     solutions that prepare today's students for tomorrow's \n     workplace, providing them with appropriate and clearly marked \n     paths from school to work or to continuing education. In \n     doing so, I will encourage partnerships among the educators, \n     employers, employee groups, students, parents, government and \n     community leaders that spawn local school-to-work \n     initiatives. Such initiatives not only offer ``first chance'' \n     opportunities to students entering the work force but \n     ``second chance'' opportunities to the unemployed and \n     underemployed as well.\n       My very first priority will be to generate awareness for \n     the school-to-work philosophy, reaching out to those who \n     deserve its benefits but as yet are unaware of its existence. \n     As I travel this country, I will seek out effective \n     partnerships between educators, employers and students, \n     sharing their stories with those who care to hear. I will \n     speak with a sense of urgency because, in this case, there is \n     no time to spare.\n       Among educators, I will encourage them to provide high-\n     standards academic and relevant education that prepares all \n     students for college, vocational or technical training, \n     career education or immediate entry into the work force. I \n     will ask them to take responsibility for ensuring that \n     America's students be ready to succeed in a high-technology \n     workplace.\n       Among employers, I will urge them to ensure the future \n     competitiveness of America by taking an active role in the \n     development of educational curricula and by providing work-\n     based learning opportunities for all students. I will also \n     ask them to examine the investments they make in human \n     capital and to provide job training and retraining to all \n     levels within the workplace.\n       Among students, I will motivate them to discover their \n     personal paths from the classroom to the workplace, showing \n     them that the American Dream is still attainable. I will \n     challenge them to stay in school, so they can take from the \n     education process what they'll need to succeed in the world \n     of work. and I will help them understand that the process of \n     lifelong learning is the key to their productivity and \n     happiness.\n       From America's classrooms to its tool rooms to its board \n     rooms, I will serve as a catalyst for change by shining the \n     Miss America spotlight on and bringing a forceful voice to \n     this new movement, a movement which seeks to put all \n     Americans to work and makes our country strong and \n     competitive once more.\n       These pledges I make today, the 11th day of October, 1995.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/11/senate-section/article/S14994-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14994-S15003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CUBAN LIBERTY AND DEMOCRATIC SOLIDARITY [LIBERTAD] ACT OF 1995\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, some of us have been waiting quite a while \nfor the pending legislation, known generally as the Helms-Burton bill. \nBut as the distinguished majority leader has \n\n[[Page S 14995]]\njust said, the pending bill has wide support in both parties and in \nboth Houses of Congress.\n  The water was muddied a bit last week by President Clinton, but I \nwill say for the President that, confusing as his actions are and have \nbeen with respect to Cuba, he did, in my judgment, reemphasize last \nweek that the embargo against Fidel Castro's Communist regime in Cuba \nis still an absolute necessity. On that, I certainly agree with the \nPresident.\n  I think most Americans, and certainly those who are still prisoners \nin Cuba and those who fled Cuba and are now in exile, unanimously agree \nthat the embargo against Fidel Castro must be continued.\n  For 36 years--and this covers a period when eight American Presidents \nwere in the Oval Office--the U.S. policy of isolating Castro has been \nconsistently bipartisan. And I do hope that consideration of this bill \ntoday, and for however long it takes beyond today, will continue to be \nbipartisan. It is called the Libertad bill, and it builds on and \nenhances that embargo policy, which I hope, as I say, will continue to \nbe bipartisan.\n  Why? That is a rhetorical question, and everybody knows the answer to \nit. Certainly, every Senator is old enough to remember Fidel Castro's \nentry into Cuba. I remember Herbert Mathews of the New York Times--that \nnewspaper that prints ``all the news that is fit to print,'' as they \nsay in boastful declarations--Mr. Mathews sent dispatch after dispatch \nto the New York Times from Havana reminding one and all that Fidel \nCastro was just a nice, little agrarian reformer. And then there was \nEdward R. Murrow, who broadcast nightly that Fidel Castro was a peace-\nloving agrarian reformer.\n  That is when Fidel Castro was in the boondocks and Mathews and Edward \nR. Murrow went out and sat at Castro's knee and trumpeted his \npropaganda via CBS and the New York Times.\n  Well, when Mr. Castro got to Havana, the bloodletting began. And \nanybody who is in this Senate is certainly old enough to remember what \nhappened. There was tyranny throughout Cuba. Mr. Castro, first of all, \ntook up all of the guns from his political enemies; and he lined up a \ngreat many of those political enemies before firing squads. As for the \ndeclarations by Herbert Mathews of the New York Times and Edward R. \nMurrow that Fidel Castro was not a Communist, the first declaration \nthat Mr. Castro made when he became the premier of Cuba was, ``I am a \nCommunist, I have always been a Communist, and I will always be a \nCommunist.''\n  So Fidel Castro became known worldwide as a cruel, bloody tyrant, \nwhose regime engaged in rampant human rights abuses, drug smuggling, \narms trafficking, and terrorism. Mr. Castro sits atop a structure that \nregularly and routinely abuses, detains, tortures, and executes its \ncitizens. He is a self-declared, committed Communist who stands against \nevery fundamental principle that the American people value.\n  In all--I saw some statistics on this the other day, Mr. President--\nmore than 10,000 Cubans have been killed by Castro and his regime, with \ntens of thousands more having fled their homeland to escape his \ntyranny. Currently, at least a thousand Cubans are, this very day, \nbeing held as political prisoners in Castro's jails. Yet, the United \nStates liberal community, including this Senate, so desperately desires \ngood news out of Cuba so that they can cast Castro in some favorable \nlight that they will seize on the flimsiest of evidence. I fear that \nthis is precisely what is going on down on Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  Let the record show that there has been no fundamental change in \nFidel Castro's policies. None whatever. If you doubt it, ask Mario de \nArmis who is acknowledged by the U.S. State Department as the Cuban \nprisoner who has served the longest sentence--30 years in a Castro \nprison--for his political beliefs. He committed no crime. He just did \nnot agree with Fidel Castro. He was not a Communist. So, to jail he was \nsent by Castro for 30 years.\n  Mr. de Armis supports the U.S. embargo. Let me quote exactly what he \nsaid recently:\n\n       Stand on the side of the oppressed against the dictator \n     Fidel Castro. It is not my opinion but the opinion of \n     everybody. I refer to the working people of Cuba, that the \n     embargo should be maintained, it should be kept in effect, it \n     should be strengthened.\n\n  Or you might want to ask Armando Valladares, who was locked up for 20 \nyears in a Castro prison. He said in a recent letter to me, ``I \nstrongly believe that the remaining days of Castro's tyranny will be \nshortened once your Libertad bill is passed.''\n  Now, Mr. President, it is not just those who have suffered under \nCastro who have been forced to flee. It is not these people alone who \nfavor continued isolation of Castro. It is those still inside Cuba, \nstill struggling for freedom, who also endorse a tightening of the \nembargo.\n  Recently, I received a letter signed by scores of Cubans inside Cuba \nwho courageously, at great risk to themselves and their personal \nsafety, endorsed the Libertad bill. Let me quote from their letter: \n``Because of a wicked turn of destiny, a history with contrasting \nelements is repeating itself in Cuba. In the early years of the \nrevolutionary triumph, the government headed by Castro confiscated all \nprivate property belonging to both Cuban and foreign capitalists to \nsave economically the fledgling revolution.''\n  ``In 1995,'' the letter continues, ``and in order to save the same \nrevolution, socialism and [its] alleged gains, the same properties are \nput on sale for other capitalists to buy although this represents no \nbenefit for the Cuban people.''\n  Now, Mr. President, the letter is long but let me refer to one more \nstatement: ``We support the alternative you propose.''\n  Now, Mr. President, he is referring to the pending legislation now \nbefore the U.S. Senate. He goes on to say ``Its approval will mean a \ndefinite turn in our favor. We thank you sincerely for what you are \ndoing.''\n  Now, these people, who are still in Cuba, and who ran a personal risk \nin writing their letter to me, said--referring to the impact of the \neconomic embargo--``The economic embargo maintained by subsequent \nadministrations has begun to have its effect, felt not against the \npeople, but against those who cling to power.''\n  Despite the risk of arrest and intimidation and forced exile, these \nletters of support coming to me and, I am sure, coming to Congressman \nBurton and other Members of the House and Senate of the United States \nin support of the pending bill, continue to make their way out of Cuba \nand on to our desks in the Senate and in the House of Representatives.\n  I must emphasize, for the sake of clarity, that these are the people \non the front line in Cuba. They know firsthand what kind of man Castro \nis and has been. They know what he represents. They are in a position \nto judge best what the impact of the pending bill, the Libertad bill, \nthe Helms-Burton bill, will have in Cuba.\n  Now, some opponents of the pending legislation have recently made \nclaims that it is time to normalize relations with Castro, that he has \nmade political and economic reforms, and that Cuba is open for business \nand that we are somehow missing out on golden opportunities.\n  Some prominent people in business circles contend that we are missing \nout on what they describe as golden opportunities.\n  They seem willing to overlook the thousands of people murdered by \nCastro, the thousands of people who have been locked up in Castro's \ndingy prisons. No problem, they say, in effect. Just do a little \nbusiness with Castro, make a little profit off of the misery of these \nCuban people.\n  Talk about callous nonsense--Castro has not implemented even one \nserious political move toward a free society in the last 36 years--not \nonce. His economic reforms have been designed more to alleviate \npressure on his regime than to permit the betterment of the Cuban \npeople.\n  The Cuban economy is in shambles. It is, in fact, in such dire \nstraits that Castro has laid off some 500,000 to 800,000 workers, more \nthan one-fifth of Cuba's work force.\n  Even Castro's new foreign investment law that has been trumpeted all \naround in big business circles, this foreign investment law continues \nto place economic decisionmaking in the hands not of free enterprise \nbut in the hands of the Cuban Communist Government.\n  It has nothing to do with economic freedom for the Cuban people. The \n\n[[Page S 14996]]\n  Cuban Communists, Mr. Castro's crowd, do you not know, will still \ndictate which Cubans get jobs and which Cubans will not. They will \ndetermine how much Cubans will be paid, and it is a pitiful sum that \nthey intend to be paid.\n  So, I think we ought to stop kidding ourselves. We are still dealing \nwith a tyrant, a tyrant who is determined to keep his grip on power. \nFidel Castro is not now interested, nor has he ever been interested, in \nbringing genuine economic and political freedom to Cuba. That is why 30 \nSenators introduced the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, \nthe Libertad Act or the Helms-Burton bill, however you want to identify \nit.\n  We are convinced that real political and economic change will come to \nCuba only by and when pressure is increased on the Castro regime and \nwhile we continue to make clear that we are supporting the Cuban \npeople.\n  This combination of pressure on Castro and support for the Cuban \npeople is central to the pending legislation, the Libertad bill.\n  What does this bill do? It certainly does more than stiffens \nsanctions. It has three separate and distinct objectives.\n  First, to bring an early end to the Castro regime by cutting off hard \ncurrency that keeps the Castro crowd afloat. Without hard currency from \nthe outside, Mr. Castro's days will certainly be numbered. If you want \nto keep Castro in power, let him get hard currency from outside. But I \nsay no, cut off the hard currency to Fidel.\n  Second, the bill stipulates that planning should start now for United \nStates support to a democratic transition in Cuba with full respect for \nthe self-determination of the Cuban people.\n  And third, of course, is to protect the property confiscated from \nUnited States citizens by Castro and his crowd, property that is being \nexploited this very day by Fidel Castro to subsidize his Communist \nregime, with foreign companies earning blood money at the expense of \nthe Cuban people. That is what this bill is all about.\n  The proactive strategy set forth in this legislation preserves United \nStates credibility with the Cuban people; it shows that the United \nStates is one of the few countries not willing to legitimize the \nbrutality of the Castro regime in exchange for some mythical market \nshare.\n  Here is the point, Mr. President: This legislation seeks to break the \nstatus quo by extending an offer of broad, U.S. support for a peaceful \ntransition, while providing disincentives to companies whose ventures \nprop up the Castro crowd, the Castro regime, the Communist regime in \nCuba, that is exploiting the labor of the Cuban people and the \nresources of the American property owners. That is what those who want \nto prop up Castro are willing to do. They are willing to forget all of \nthe murders, all of the decades in which people have suffered in jails \nsince Castro took power.\n  Since this bill was introduced, there has been an unprecedented hue \nand cry from Mr. Castro's crowd in Havana and, to be honest about it, \nfrom certain quarters in the United States.\n  All sorts of dire consequences have been forecast about this bill's \nprobable impact on United States relations with the Europeans and the \nCanadians. Well, la de da, the Canadians, after all, have been \ntransshipping sugar from Cuba all along, in violation of United States \nlaw. I could catalog a lot of other things that ought to be stopped, \nwhich the U.S. Government ought to get about the business of stopping.\n  In any case, many of the same predictions that Congress heard in 1992 \nduring the debate on the Cuban Democracy Act are being said today. \nNothing came of those predictions about ruptured relations; but the \npredictions that did materialize were felt by Castro, who was and is \nthe target of the Cuban Democracy Act.\n  The only dire consequences of the Libertad bill's enactment are dire \nfor Mr. Castro. And I do not mind telling you I want to set his tail \nfeathers afire, which is long overdue. He has tormented his own people \nlong enough. I do not have much sympathy for the view held by Americans \nwho do not feel that the United States ought to come to the aid of the \nCuban people. We should have done it a long time ago.\n  The pending bill will hurt Mr. Castro at his most vulnerable point--\nhis pocketbook. It makes clear that only a democratic Cuba, a free \nCuba, will receive the benefits of American trade and recognition.\n  Cuba is the last Communist nation in this hemisphere. There once was \na bunch of them. Castro is losing his grip on power. He knows it. We \nknow it. And anybody with average vision ought to be able to see it. \nWhy else has Castro launched such an aggressive campaign against this \nLibertad bill and in favor of lifting the embargo? Everybody knows \nthat. Castro wants an influx of American hard currency. That is what he \nneeds most. That is the only thing that will keep him afloat in the \ncrisis that is growing over his head.\n  What Mr. Castro does not want is for the pending legislation to \nbecome law. For those who genuinely support freedom for the Cuban \npeople, that, it seems to me, is the best reason for this United States \nSenate to follow the lead of the United States House of Representatives \nin approving the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the letters from the \nprodemocracy activists in Cuba and Armando Valladares be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Partido Solidaridad Democratica,\n\n                                 Havana, Cuba, September 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Jessie Helms,\n     Chairman of the U.S. Senate, Committee on Foreign \n         Regulations.\n       Because of a wicked turn of destiny, a history with \n     contrasting elements is repeating itself in Cuba. In the \n     early years of the revolutionary triumph, the government \n     headed by Castro confiscated all private property belonging \n     to both cuban and foreign capitalists to ``save'' \n     economically the fledgeling revolution. In 1995 and in order \n     to ``save'' the same revolution socialism, and alleged gains, \n     the same properties are put on sale for other capitalists to \n     buy although this represents no benefit for the cuban people.\n       The economic embargo maintained by subsequent American \n     Administrations has begun to make its influence, felt not \n     against the people, but against those who cling to power. \n     These effects are felt after the downfall of the socialist \n     camp. Which forced the Havana regime to improvise economic \n     moves, waiting for a miracle to pull them out of a very \n     difficult situation.\n       Against these efforts by the last totalitarian dictatorship \n     in the continent, the Act of Freedom and Democratic \n     Solidarity with Cuba sponsored by you is the most positive \n     option.

In those jails I saw many of my best friends die due \n     to horrible tortures and inhumane treatment.\n       I strongly believe that the remaining days of Castro's \n     tyranny will be shortened once your ``Libertad'' bill, now up \n     for a vote, is passed. The endorsement of your legislation by \n     the most influential dissident leaders inside Cuba proves \n     that they are convinced, as I am, that this law is an \n     important contribution towards our goal, a ``Free and \n     Democratic Cuba.''\n       I commend you for your relentless effort and leadership. \n     While the rest of the world seems to be content and sits idle \n     watching the destruction of a country and its people, \n     individuals like yourself come forward to fulfill a duty. \n     That is eliminating injustices and abuses wherever they \n     occur.\n           Que Viva Cuba Libre,\n\n                                           Armando Valladares,\n\n                                           Former U.S. Ambassador,\n                                     U.N. Human Rights Commission.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from North Carolina withhold? \nI believe the Senator from Rhode Island seeks recognition. Will the \nSenator withhold?\n  Mr. HELMS. Of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I have a couple of points to make. One of \nthem is, it seems to me unwise to support tacitly the practice of \nsubmitting a cloture motion at the same time as a bill or amendment is \nsubmitted. I think if this becomes a precedent, it could lead to abuse.\n  Second, I would like to make the observation that I think I am \nprobably the only Member of this body who has lived under communism for \na year or two, a couple of years, and been exposed to it.\n  I have been to Castro's Cuba four times since being in the Senate and \ntwice to Guantanamo. My view is that the best medicine we can give the \nCubans is to submit them to exposure to freedom and fresh air and clear \nlight, that this is what gets rid of communism. I think back to when I \nlived under the Iron Curtain. We used to say the same thing, that \ncommunism would die of its own evil, which it did; of its own \nineptitude, which it did. And this is what we should admit to having \nwith Cuba. And, I submit, the legislation before us does not do that.\n  I believe all my colleagues agree on the goals of American policy \ntoward Cuba--promoting a peaceful transition to democracy, economic \nliberalization and greater respect for human rights while \nsimultaneously controlling immigration from Cuba. What is clearly \ndifferent is how we get there. In my view, the legislation before us \ntoday is going to take us further away from achieving these goals and \nis contrary to U.S. national interests.\n  Rather than ratcheting up the pressure even further in order to \nisolate Cuba, as this bill would do, we should be expanding contact \nwith the Cuban people. In that regard, I believe the measures announced \nby President Clinton last week are a step in the right direction. These \nmeasures include the reciprocal opening of news bureaus in the United \nStates and Cuba in order to improve the accuracy of the bilateral flow \nof information; support for the development of independent, \nnongovernmental organizations in Cuba in order to strengthen civil \nsociety; clarification of standards for travel for purposes of news \ngathering, research, cultural, educational, religious and human rights \nactivities; simplification of regulations that govern travel to Cuba by \nthe Cuban-Americans for extreme humanitarian emergencies such as death \nor illness of family members; and, finally, authorization for Western \nUnion to open offices in Cuba to facilitate the transfer of funds that \nare currently permissible for purposes of paying legal immigration fees \nand for case-by-case humanitarian needs.\n  Of course, I would like to see the administration go even further in \norder to permit the full, free flow of information and people between \nour two countries because I believe this would best facilitate the \ntransition to democracy.\n  Under appropriate circumstances, too, I would support lifting the \nembargo. I say this not because I believe the Cuban Government should \nbe rewarded. In fact, I am amongst those who are disappointed that the \nCuban Government has failed to make truly meaningful steps toward \npolitical reform and improved human rights. Nor do I believe that \nshould be done as a quid pro quo. We should undertake policy measures \nto enhance--not decrease--to enhance contact with the Cuban people, \nbecause that will serve American national interests; namely, the \nfostering of the peaceful transition to democracy on that island.\n  In my view, greater contact with the Cuban people will plant the \nseeds of change and advance the cause of democracy just as greater \nexchange with the West helped hasten the fall of communism in Eastern \nEurope. In his posthumously published book, former President Nixon \nwrote that ``we should drop the economic embargo and open the way to \ntrade, investment and economic interaction * * *'' Nixon believed we \nwould better help the Cuban people by building ``pressure from within \nby actively stimulating Cuba's economic contacts with the free world.''\n  The Cuban Government has been expanding political and economic ties \nwith the rest of the world. These economic relations in and of \nthemselves are no substitute for the economic benefits that would \naccrue from more normal relations with the United States, but they do \nprovide sufficient space for Castro to refuse to give in to U.S. \ndemands.\n  I think it is naive to think that the measure before us today is \ngoing to succeed in forcing Castro to step aside, where all other \npressures have not. However, the measures proposed in this bill do have \nthe serious potential of further worsening the living conditions of the \nCuban people and once again making a mass exodus for Miami an \nattractive option. Taken to its most extreme, this bill could even \nprovoke serious violence on the island.\n  This legislation is even more problematic than earlier efforts to \ntighten the screws on Castro. I say this because its implications go \nwell beyond United States-Cuban relations. Not only does it alienate \nour allies and tie the administration's foreign policy hands, it also \nseriously injures certain Americans in order to benefit a class of \nindividuals in the Cuban-American community. In the process, it throws \nout the window more than 40 years of international law and practice, in \nthe area of expropriation.\n  Finally, it will make more difficult the transformation of the Cuban \neconomy to a market based on economy, because of the complex property \nissues associated with these pending court judgments.\n  Contact and dialog between Havana and Washington will bring about \ndemocracy on the Island of Cuba, not isolation and impoverishment. \nPerhaps if we took that approach, our allies \n\n[[Page S 14998]]\nwould seek a similar course, and realize that they might compromise \nsome of their approaches with us.\n\n  I only ask my colleagues to observe the lessons of what happened with \nthe removal of communism in Eastern Europe when it was forced out--when \nthe light, free air, and freshness of democracy swept it out. But if \nyou build walls and isolate that will not occur.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Mr. President, this legislation presents the Senate with an \nopportunity to remind the people of Cuba that we have not forgotten \nthem. Nor have we forgotten the decades of suffering and oppression \ninflicted on them by the brutal Castro dictatorship which began in \n1958. With freedom on the march throughout the Americas, Communist Cuba \nis desperately fighting to preserve its experiment in government \nthrough enslavement. Now more than ever we must redouble our resolve \nand our efforts to rid our hemisphere of thugs like Fidel Castro and \nthose who support him. I am proud to cosponsor this legislation which \nspecifically stiffens sanctions against the Communist elite of Cuba who \nare exploiting confiscated property in a last ditch effort to preserve \ntheir privileged status.\n  The most important element of this legislation is contained in title \nIII. It creates a new right of action that allows U.S. nationals to sue \nthose who are exploiting their confiscated property in Cuba. This \nprovision is necessary to protect the rights of United States nationals \nwhose property has been confiscated by the Cuban Government without \njust and adequate compensation--in fact, without any compensation. This \nnew civil remedy will also discourage persons and companies from \nengaging in commercial transactions involving confiscated property, and \nin so doing deprive Cuba's Communist elite of the capital--the cash \nmoney--which they need to perpetuate their exploitation of the people \nof Cuba.\n  This legislation does not compromise existing foreign claims \nsettlement procedures, nor does it dilute the claims of the original \ncertified claimants. It simply provides an additional remedy made \navailable to all U.S. nationals whose claims are not covered under \nexisting settlement mechanisms. In fact, we are making the recovery \nprocess less complicated because it will protect additional properties \nuntil claimed by their rightful owners under the laws of a democratic \nCuba which I hope will come soon.\n  In the recent past, the United States expended significant effort to \nliberate the people of Haiti from a military dictatorship. Today the \nClinton administration continues to spend enormous sums of taxpayers' \ndollars on Haiti. Every day I grow less certain of the administration's \nresolve to ensure that Haiti's present government is committed to \ndemocracy and liberty.\n  Recent White House policies toward Cuba also cause me to question \nwhether President Clinton has the resolve necessary to maintain United \nStates pressure on the Castro regime. Regardless, there should be no \ndoubt about congressional resolve to stay the course toward liberation \nfor the people of Cuba. This bill is an essential step toward achieving \nthat goal. I strongly support it and encourage colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is that this piece of \nlegislation comes to the Senate floor without having been through a \nmarkup in the committee so that members of the committee could debate \nand potentially amend the legislation.\n  It, like so many other pieces of legislation these days, is cobbled \ntogether quickly--the Lord only knows where--and it is moved to the \nfloor. And we are told, here is the issue. You go ahead and debate it. \nThe regular order, of course, would be to have some hearings on \nsomething that represents a national problem, and, as a result of the \nhearings, understand the dimension of the problem and then to try to \nconstruct some appropriate, sensible, reasonable conclusion that \naddresses the problem, move it through a markup in the committee, and \nthen bring it to the floor and debate it.\n  That is the way you would do something, if you are really interested \nin doing it the right way. But we see, unfortunately, a Senate and a \nCongress that these days seems intent on hour by hour and day by day \nchanging the itinerary and the schedule and cobbling together some \nhalf-notion of what is in the press yesterday and how we might \nlegislate responding to it tomorrow.\n  Well, I came to the floor today not so much to talk about Castro and \nCuba. I know this bill is about Castro and Cuba. And I know that Castro \nand Cuba are a presence in our lives and around, and that we have to \nrespond to and deal with them.\n  Frankly, Fidel Castro and Cuba are not the most important things in \nthe lives of people I represent.\n  We have a Senate that is in session today. Very few Members are here \nfor debate. And we have in the Chamber on the agenda the need to \ndiscuss Cuba and Castro.\n  We have had hearings during this Congress on all kinds of issues. We \nhave had 11 days of hearings on Waco. We have had 10 days of hearings \non Ruby Ridge. We have had 24 days of hearings on Whitewater. But I \nrepresent a part of the country that has a fairly high percentage of \nthe population of the elderly who are concerned about Medicare and \nMedicaid, policies dealing with nursing homes, hospitals, and doctors.\n  We are seeing a proposal for a substantial change in the Medicare \nProgram, and there were not any hearings on the specific plan that was \nlaid down about a week and a half, 2 weeks ago, none. Some might say, \nwell, we held a bunch of hearings beforehand so we thought through it \nthen. Now we have put together this proposal.\n  My question is, well, if you have a proposal that you held close to \nyour vest here for some long while, then unveiled it at the last \nmoment, why did we not have a day or a week or 2 weeks of hearings \nabout what is proposed to be done with Medicare? What about the \nspecific plan? What does it do? What is the impact? What will it mean \nto the future of Medicare? What will it mean for senior citizens who \nrely on Medicare, for rural hospitals?\n  There are a lot of things that are important. Castro and Cuba rank \nwell below, in my judgment, the question of what are the priorities \nthat this Congress is establishing for the future of this country.\n  One thing is certain. We are not certain about a lot of things, but \none thing is certain. One hundred years from now no one here will be \nalive--no one. But 100 years from now those who choose to wonder what \nwe were about, what kind of value system we had, what we cared about, \nwhat we thought was important and dear to us, they will be able to look \nat how we spent our resources in this country. They will be able to \nlook at the Federal budget and say, here is how that group of Americans \nat that point in time decided to spend its public resources. And they \nwill be able to tell a little something about what we felt was \nimportant, how we felt we would advance the interests of the country.\n  I sat in the Chamber of the House of Representatives this morning, as \ndid some of my colleagues, and heard a wonderful tribute to the \nveterans of the Second World War on the 50th anniversary of the end of \nthe Second World War. And it was remarkable to see the number of people \nwho stood up in that Chamber when asked, all the Medal of Honor \nwinners, to stand up. And you looked around with a tear in your eye and \nseen those people who won this country's highest honor, who exhibited \nuncommon bravery, risked their lives, were wounded, and did \nextraordinary things to save the lives of others. And you realize what \npeople have sacrificed for this country, what this country has done for \nitself and for others around the world.\n  One of the speakers this morning was Strom Thurmond, a wonderful \nSenator in this Chamber, in his nineties. I assume he would not mind if \nwe mentioned his age. It is probably published all over--a vibrant and \ninteresting Senator who has been here some long while, and when he \nspoke this morning I was remembering a conversation I had with him. \n\n[[Page S 14999]]\n\n  He, as I recall, enlisted in the Second World War when he was over \nthe age of 40 and went overseas and then volunteered to get up in a \nglider, to be pulled aloft at night with some volunteers to crash land \nbehind enemy lines in Normandy. This was not an 18- or 20-year-old kid; \nthis was a fellow in his forties who volunteered to risk his life to do \nthat. And I had a talk with him one day about what was going through \nhis mind: Was he scared? Was he frightened?\n  I will never forget the discussion I had with Senator Thurmond--a \nwonderful discussion. I just thought to myself, what some people have \ndone, gone through in this country is quite remarkable.\n  There was then a spirit of unity that was extraordinary in this \ncountry. We came together to do things, do things to preserve freedom \nand liberty. There is a kind of a shattering of the spirit, some say, \nthese days. I do not know that that is true, but I know that there is \nsome discord because it is so much easier for people to focus on what \nis wrong rather than what is right, to focus on the negative rather \nthan the positive. And I understand all of that. I understand the \ntendency people have to hold something up to the light and say, ``Gee, \nlook at that imperfection; isn't that ugly? Isn't that awful?''\n  Sure. But it is not the whole story. Part of the story of this \ncountry is not just the celebration of what we have done in the Second \nWorld War to keep this world free and beat back the oppression of \nNazism. Part of the story of this country is what a lot of those in \nthis Chamber who came before us decided to stand up and do for our \ncountry. I was not here when they decided we ought to have the Social \nSecurity system, but, boy, I cannot express enough gratitude to those \nwho had enough courage to stand up in the face of cries of socialism by \nothers, saying, how could you possibly propose a program like this?\n  Well, I am glad there were enough builders, enough people who decided \nthere are positive things to do that benefit this country, I am glad \nthere were enough of them around to stand up and have their vote \ncounted, which meant we now have a Social Security system in our \ncountry. It probably was not very easy for them. It was not more than \n30 years ago Medicare was proposed, and the easiest thing in the world \nis to be opposed to everything. The old story goes it takes more skill \nto build a building than it does to wreck a building. It takes no skill \nto tear something down. We all understand that.\n  I was not here in the early 1960's, but the first people who brought \nMedicare to the floor of the Senate, recognizing that half of the \nsenior citizens of this country had no health care coverage, were \nwilling to stand here and make the case for the need for some dignity \nand some protection and some security for the elderly in this country. \nI regret to say 97 percent of the folks on the other side of the aisle \nsaid, we are sorry; we do not believe in this; we are going to vote \nagainst it; Medicare ought not happen.\n  Well, we persisted, those who were here before us persisted, and we \ndeveloped a Medicare Program. And it has been a wonderful program. \nPerfect? No. Are there some blemishes? Yes. Does it need some \nadjustment? Sure. Has it been a positive thing for the senior citizens \nof this country? You bet it has. Ninety nine percent of the senior \ncitizens of this country now have health care coverage and do not in \ntheir declining years, do not in their older years sit in abject fear \nof getting sick. That is a wonderful thing and a wonderful story as a \npart of the progress in our country.\n  Some will say, well, you can talk all you want about Medicare and \nSocial Security, but the fact is those things do not work; this country \nis coming apart. And they will cite as evidence some of the enormous \nchallenges we face. And I understand some of those challenges. We have \nracial tensions in our country. We are racially divided and we must \naddress that. Mr. President, 23,000 murders. We have a crime epidemic, \nand we have to find a way to solve that; nearly 10 million people who \nare out of work and looking for a job; 25 million people on food \nstamps; 40 million people living in poverty; slightly over a million \nbabies this year will be born out of wedlock with no father; 8,000 to \n9,000 of them will never in their lifetime learn the identity of their \nfather.\n  Challenges? Troubles? Absolutely. Absolutely. But you do not solve \nthose problems and you do not address challenges by running away and \npretending they do not exist. The question is, how do we meet these \nchallenges? Where do all of us meet these challenges? What kind of \nthings do we do first individually in our homes, then in our \ncommunities, and then, yes, in our elected Government, in the Congress? \nHow do we come together with approaches and plans that address these \nvexing problems that confront our country?\n  If I did not think the future of this country is brighter than the \npast, I would hardly have the energy and strength to do this job. I am \nconvinced that if you look at all of these problems together, you will \nconclude that a country that survived a major depression, that beat \nback the oppressive forces of tyranny and Nazism in the Second World \nWar, a country that has met challenge after challenge, will meet these \nchallenges. But we will not do it by turning our backs on the past and \nby deciding that those things that we have done together that make this \na better country we should now take apart.\n\n  Most especially we are now in this Chamber involved in the process of \nmaking choices, choices about what we think will advance the interests \nof this country. It is not so much, in my judgment, choices between \nconservatives and liberals because, frankly, I think you have appetites \nin every chair in this Chamber to spend public money.\n  I recall when the defense bill came to the floor of the Senate, as \nwill my colleagues. I was astounded to find that the bill for this \ncountry's defense, to appropriate money for America's defense, \nrecommended by the Secretary of Defense and the four branches of our \narmed services, came to the floor of the Senate having had $7 billion \nadded to it to buy ships, planes, submarines no one asked for, to buy \nB-2 bombers--20 of them are $30 billion--to start a Star Wars program \nand say; ``By the way, we not only want to start it, we want you to \ndeploy it in the field by 1999 on an accelerated basis.''\n  The same people who come here and order B-2 bombers, whose cost for a \nnose wheel and a fuel gauge would pay for all the Head Start programs \nin our country with 55,000 kids, they also want to kick off Head Start, \nsay to us: ``Well, what is really important in our country is to have \nthe B-2's. Do not talk to us about Head Start,'' they say.\n  This is all about choices. What choices do we make that advance this \ncountry's interests? The same people who came to this floor and said, \n``We want $7 billion more for defense. We want B-2's and star wars and \nso on''--and, incidentally, they also, I think page 167 of the defense \nauthorization bill said they want $60 million for blimps. The hood \nornament of goofiness is to buy 60 million dollars' worth of blimps. \nLord knows what the Hindenburg strategy for buying blimps is. I \nsearched far and wide in this Chamber to find out who wrote in $60 \nmillion to have blimps and failed to find out who it was. I concluded \nit is an immaculate conception in this bill with no discernible author.\n  Having said all that, the same people who wrote all of this into the \ndefense bill said, when it came time to deal with the other side of \nAmerica's needs: ``We're sorry. We're out of money.'' We had plenty of \nmoney for this defense need well above what the Secretary asked for. \n``We insist you buy planes you did not ask for and ships you did not \norder, the two amphibious ships.'' Two of them--we chose one for $3.9 \nbillion and one for $900 million. ``Why be misers? We want to build \nboth of them,'' they said. I will not even talk about submarines.\n  But the point is this: They said we can afford everything in defense, \neven what the Secretary of Defense did not ask for. We insist on \nwanting to give a tax cut, over half the benefit of which will go to \nAmericans with over $100,000 in income.\n  So I brought an amendment to the floor and said if we are going to \nhave to choose and we are going to set priorities, please let us do \nthis, let us decide that the tax cut will go to working families and we \nwill limit the benefits of the tax cut at least to those families \nearning below $100,000 in income and \n\n[[Page S 15000]]\nuse the savings from that limitation of who gets the tax cut to below \n$100,000 in income to reduce the heavy cut they are going to make in \nMedicare. At least let us do that, limit the tax cut to those under \n$100,000 in income, and use that to try to at least eliminate some of \nthe heavy hit on Medicare.\n  No, they did not want to go for that. All of them voted against it. \nWell, I want to give them another chance. I am going to offer another \namendment this week, maybe $500,000. Would you agree at least to limit \nthe tax cut to people who make less than $500,000 a year and use the \nsavings in order to reduce the hit on Medicare? I mean, it seems to me \nthis is all about choices and priorities.\n  A question we asked with respect to this budget is, do family farmers \nmatter? Do kids matter? Is nutrition important? Does education advance \nthis country's interests? All of those are questions we are asking. And \nwe are answering those questions by what we decide to spend the \npublic's money on.\n  Now, as I said earlier, I do not despair about the answers to these \nquestions because I think one way or the other, one day the American \npeople will come to the right conclusions. We want to get to the same \nlocation. All of us want to move this country ahead. We want this \ncountry to have more economic opportunity, more growth, better educated \nkids. We all want the same things but we have very different views on \nhow we get there.\n  The new ideas these days, incidentally, are the ideas of block grants \nand flat taxes. I am thinking about the words ``block'' and ``flat.'' \nIt is really hard, it seems to me, to build a political movement using \nthe words ``block'' and ``flat.'' Block grants are, you just take all \nthis money that comes into the Federal coffers and send it all back \nsomeplace else and say, ``By the way, you spend it back someplace else, \nand no strings attached.''\n  I say, why put 3,000 miles on a dollar? Why send money from North \nDakota to Washington, only to send it back and say, you spend it, spend \nit as you wish? Why not cut down on the travel? You want to do that? \nYou think nutrition is not a national need? Then why do you not just \ntell the Governors, You handle nutrition issues. You raise the money \nback home and you spend it? Personally, I would not support that. But \nthat would be a more honest approach, probably a more responsible use \nof the taxpayers' dollar.\n  Flat taxes. That is an old, old idea dressed in new clothes that \nsays, Let's have the wealthiest Americans pay less taxes and families \npay a little more. I mean, it is part of the same philosophy that the \nproblem in this country is the rich have too little and the poor have \ntoo much. And we must, some feel, come to this floor and make choices \nthat remedy that by giving the rich more and taking from the poor.\n  Well, Medicare, Medicaid, education, family farming--these are the \npriorities, the issues that we need to discuss.\n  What about Medicare? Some say what are you talking about is cutting \nMedicare. No one is proposing cutting Medicare. No one. We are simply \nreducing the rate of growth. Let us analyze that just for a moment.\n  We know what it will cost to fund the Medicare program over the next \n7 years. Two hundred thousand new Americans every month become eligible \nfor Medicare. That is how America is graying. We know what Medicare \nwill cost with the new people becoming eligible and also with the \nincreased cost of health care each year. That being the case, if you \ncut $270 billion from what is needed to fund the Medicare program, the \nfact is you are cutting Medicare. Yes, you are cutting the rate of \ngrowth, but you are also cutting Medicare in terms of what is needed.\n  Medicaid, well, if you cut 20, 25, 30 percent out of what a State \nneeds--and North Dakota is cut 22 percent from what we need to fund \nMedicaid--then you say, By the way, there will be no national standards \nany longer for nursing homes. Do you think you have advanced the \ninterests of this country, the interests of the poor, the interests of \npeople who need help? I do not think so.\n  Education. Somebody wore a T-shirt once that said: ``If you're \ninterested in the next year, plant rice; interested in the next 10 \nyears, plant trees; interested in the next century, educate kids.'' \nEducation must also be our priority. The stamp of choice these days \napplied in this Chamber is that does not matter as much as B-2 bombers, \nprobably does not even matter as much as Cuba to some.\n  Mr. President, we do not have much opportunity to debate these issues \nin lengthy hearings, in lengthy analysis of what it all means to \npeople, to people who rely on Medicare and Medicaid, rely on guaranteed \nstudent loans or rely on the safety net for family farmers.\n  So we must take this time on the floor of the Senate to discuss what \nall this means and where it moves America. I hope that no one will \ndecide that these debates are unworthy or for one reason or another \nthese debates do not matter. It is not a sign of weakness that we \ncannot agree and have debates. That is the way a democracy works. My \nhope is that these debates as they unfold will inform the American \npeople about these policies and what they mean for the future.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I wanted to ask the Senator a few questions.\n  First of all, Mr. President, I want to ask the Senator from North \nDakota--I mean, I try to spend time in cafes in Minnesota, have coffee, \nunfortunately too much pie, with the people and just ask people what \nthey are thinking about.\n  Has the Senator found in North Dakota that, when you go into a cafe, \non the list of people's priorities, the Senate right now should be \ndebating Cuba?\n  I have a whole series of questions. Does it come up at all?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I was in North Dakota all last week because the Senate \nhad no votes last week. I did not hear one North Dakotan talk to me \nabout Cuba. It does not mean Cuba is not interesting or important; it \nis that they are interested in the issues that affect their daily \nlives--farm programs, Medicare, and so on.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The second question I want to ask the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is, I said on the floor last week--and actually sometimes \nwords come to you, but I actually now believe that this is exactly what \nis happening--that what I see going on here is a rush to recklessness, \na fast track to foolishness.\n  Is there, on the part of people in North Dakota--let us start off \njust talking about Medicare recipients. I want to ask you about medical \nassistance and some other programs as well. I mean, do you find both \nwith the beneficiaries and with the caregivers, whether it be in the \nrural parts of the State--North Dakota is mainly rural--or some of your \nlarger cities--that would be our metro area--do you find a tremendous \nconcern about what is going on in Washington where people feel like we \ndo not have the information of what is going on?\n  It is not even that people necessarily reached a conclusion yet, but \nthat they really want to know. They yearn for information. And they \nwant to know exactly what is happening and how it is going to affect \ntheir view.\n  How it is going to affect them? Do you sense that in your State, and \nwhat are the concerns that you hear the most from people?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I think people are worried about a lot of things. They \nare worried about the fact that we do not have a balanced budget. \nPeople want us to put our books in order, to balance our budget.\n  I agree with that, and most Members agree with that. This is not a \ndebate about whether the budget should be balanced. A number of us \nsupported a balanced budget plan that was offered during the budget \ndebate on the floor of the Senate that does have cuts in all these \nareas but does not single out for unfair cuts or does not propose cuts \nthat unravel programs that a lot of Americans rely on, and certainly \ndid not say to people at the upper-income scale of our country, ``You \nhave a million bucks, $2 million, $5 million. Guess what? Start \nsmiling, we're going to give you a big tax cut.'' That was not in our \nbudget, because we think there is a right way to balance the Federal \nbudget. Do the hard work, balance the budget, make the tough choices \nand then later talk about the tax system.\n  I would like to find tax relief for working families. But at the \nmoment, \n\n[[Page S 15001]]\nlet us figure out how you balance the budget, and there are different \nways of doing it.\n  You do not have to balance the budget by saying, ``By the way, we \nwant a $245 billion tax cut, on the one hand, and then we want a $270 \nbillion cut in Medicare, on the other hand.''\n  Someone asked me in North Dakota, ``Why don't you just decide not to \ndo the tax cut and that would provide most of the money for the \nMedicare problem.''\n  I said, ``Some people feel very strongly that this country will only \ngrow if you give the Wall Street crowd more money in the form of tax \nbreaks.''\n  I do not happen to share that. If we are going to give tax breaks, we \nought to give it to working families. We ought not talk about tax \nbreaks, even if it is popular at the moment, until we solve the deficit \nproblem. And I want to solve it the right way, not the wrong way.\n  The wrong way is to decide, for example, on Medicare and Medicaid--\nMedicaid is a good example--that we will send that problem back to the \nStates by sending bulk money in the form of block grants. We will send \nto North Dakota 22 percent less than what is needed for Medicaid, and \nthen at the same time say, ``Oh, by the way, there are no national \nstandards for nursing homes anymore.''\n  You know the consequence of that. We have been through this. We have \nseen nursing homes. We have seen nursing homes where they put some old \nperson in a restraint system so they cannot move their arms, and they \nsit in a chair for hour after hour after hour. They cannot scratch \ntheir cheek, they cannot wipe a tear from their eye, they cannot move, \nand often are not attended.\n  We have seen circumstances like that in this country, and we decided \nthere ought to be some basic standards for nursing home care. I have \nbeen in nursing homes plenty, plenty. I am pleased to say, at least the \nones I have been in, especially the one with my father for a long, long \nwhile, I am pleased to say he got good care. But I do not want to go \nback to the old days when we say, ``By the way, you don't care. If \nyou're poor and old, that's your tough luck.''\n  I think we ought to have circumstances where we say that national \nstandards for nursing homes make sense. They were worthwhile, they are \nstill necessary, and we ought to say that we are willing to take care \nof the needs of poor people who need long-term care in nursing homes. \nIf we can take care of the needs of a millionaire to say, ``By the way, \nyou deserve a tax cut today,'' is it reasonable to say now we cannot \nafford to take care of someone who has reached 70, 80 years old who has \nAlzheimer's and no money? That does not square with the priorities I \nlearned when I grew up in a small town in North Dakota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If the Senator will yield for another question, and I \nknow the Senator from Arkansas has done a lot of work in this area of \nnursing homes and may want to ask some questions, but I would like to \nask another question of the Senator. I have a few more, and I will not \nspeak so much. I will put it in the form of a question.\n  Last week I spent a lot of time, and I will not even talk about the \neducation front of it right now, with the people in the State and also \nat a hearing at the State capital. I, too, visited a number of \ndifferent nursing homes.\n  In my own case, both my parents had Parkinson's disease, so it is a \nvery personal issue with me. I think when people can stay at home, that \nis the way you should do it, live at home with dignity. Sometimes \npeople describe to me a nursing home as a home away from home.\n  A number of the caregivers said to me that they do not know--with the \nmedical assistance, in Minnesota about 60 percent of our medical \nassistance funding is for nursing homes and about two-thirds of the \npeople in the homes receive medical assistance--they said they do not \nknow exactly how they are going to absorb these cuts. We have been \nhearing a lot about Medicare, but they are really frightened about \nthese cuts and they do not know whether it means they change \neligibility or whether they reduce standards. I did not hear anyone, \nand I want to ask you this, I did not hear any one of the \nadministrators----\n  Mr. HELMS. Point of order. Point of order. This is not a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I did not----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Point of order. Point of order. The Senator is not asking \na question, he is making a speech.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes, I want to know whether or not in North Dakota you \nheard any cry for removing standards for nursing homes. That is my \nquestion.\n  Mr. HELMS. I will call the hand of any Senator who makes a speech \nwhile asking a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my question was based upon--I started \nout by saying this is what I found in Minnesota.\n  Mr. HELMS. It is not a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Did you have the same experience in North Dakota? That \nis my question, Mr. President. I want to know whether or not you found \nadministrators in North Dakota who want to remove national standards \nand go back to the days of restraining belts?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will respond to the Senator from Minnesota by saying I \nhad a meeting in North Dakota with virtually all the nursing home \nadministrators and hospital administrators, because I am trying to find \nwhat are the consequences. While nursing home administrators would like \nvery much to see some loosening of regulations here and there, I do not \nknow that there is a population of nursing home administrators who \nbelieve that you ought to eliminate Federal standards. None of them \ncame to me and said, ``Look, let's get rid of all Federal standards.''\n  That was not what was described to me by nursing home administrators. \nThey clearly would like fewer regulations, I understand that. I think \neven nursing home administrators were surprised by the proposal that we \nwould have no Federal standards with respect to nursing homes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Does the Senator agree if we do not have those \nstandards, we will go back to the days of indiscriminate use of \nrestraining belts and the drugging of people, and that when children \nvisit nursing homes, will the Senator agree, that when children visit \nnursing homes, they want to make sure their parents are receiving \ncompassionate care?\n  Mr. HELMS. The Senator is making a speech again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator can only yield for \na question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is the question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I think, Mr. President, my point about nursing home \nstandards is that the desire by some and the proposal now by the \nmajority party to decide there shall be no national nursing home \nstandards of any consequence is, I think, an extreme position, and I \nhope on reevaluation they will decide this goes way beyond the pale; \nthat developing sensible standards was necessary and protects a lot of \npeople in our country who deserve that protection. I hope that they \nwill rethink that position.\n  Again, let me reiterate, we are talking about a series of issues--\nMedicare, Medicaid, education, family farming. This is not--this is \nnot--an issue between conservatives and liberals, because I find it \ninteresting that some of those who claim to be the most conservative \nMembers of the Senate--I do not know who they are--but the most \nconservative Members of the Senate would, when the defense \nappropriations bill comes to the floor, say, ``Heck, just spend the \nfarm, spend it all. There is no proposal that is too grandiose for me. \nWhatever it is you want to buy, let me buy it. In fact, let's not buy \n`it,' let's buy 10 of them. Let's order a dozen of them. Let's have a \nfew of them made in my State.''\n  That is sort of the attitude when that bill comes to the floor.\n  And I am thinking to myself, I am pretty confused about who is \nliberal and who is conservative. I thought these folks were people \npretty close with the dollar, did not want to spend much, and all of a \nsudden it is like they are on shore leave. It is spend, spend, spend \nwhen those bills come to the floor. Then when a piece of legislation \ncomes to the floor that deals with someone else's needs, they say, \n``Well, gee, we are out of money.''\n  Well, this requires, it seems to me, a compromise and choices. It is \nall about \n\n[[Page S 15002]]\npriorities. We might radically disagree about priorities that advance \nthis country's interests. But, in the end, I hope that we will finally \nget together and believe education, and the right investment in \neducation, advances America's interests. End of story. I hope we can \nagree on that.\n  I hope we can all agree that there are ways to make certain that \nthose who reach the retirement years of their lives and suffer health \nconsequences and need long-term care really ought to receive the \nprotection that a Medicaid program and Federal nursing home standards \noffer. I hope that we can come to those kinds of understandings between \nthe most divergent positions here in the U.S. Senate. I hope that by \nthe end of November all of us with differing positions, including the \nPresident, Republicans and Democrats, can find a way to sift through \nall of these differing positions and figure out a direction that makes \nsense for the country.\n  We will have to cut some spending in Medicare. I am saying that on \nthe floor of the Senate. We need to do that. There needs to be an \nadjustment. It does not need to be $270 billion and should not be $270 \nbillion. That is there because they need that to accommodate a tax cut.\n  So we do need to adjust Medicare, I agree. We need to make \nadjustments in a range of these areas. The question is, Which \nadjustments and how do we make them to advance the interests of this \ncountry? That is the important debate for us to have, I think, in the \ncoming weeks. And often there has not been enough time for hearings so \nthat we can make the case at hearings about the impact of these \nproposals.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator from North \nDakota if he would allow me to, through the Chair, address a question \nto my good friend from North Carolina and if he would yield to me for \nthat purpose.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I will address this question. I am \nwondering if my good friend from North Carolina would allow the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, say, at a time certain, to make a statement on what I \nconsider to be the most important issue that is coming before this \nCongress through the balance of this session, which is the \nreconciliation bill. We will not, I remind my good friend--and I know \nhe knows this--we will not have an ample opportunity--10 hours on a \nside--to properly debate perhaps one of the most monumental issues ever \nbefore the U.S. Senate, which is the tax cut and tax increase----\n  Mr. HELMS. If the Senator will yield for a moment, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota has not yielded the floor, has he?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is correct. I have yielded to the Senator from \nArkansas for a question.\n  Mr. HELMS. I cannot, under the circumstances, when an obvious \nfilibuster is taking away the subject at hand--to answer the question \nof the Senator, I will be glad on a time certain to have the floor \nyielded to anybody who wants to make a speech. But our side wants to \ntalk about the pending business.\n  I recall that when the reorganization of the State Department \nlegislation came up, the first speaker that trotted out over there was \nthat great statesman from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, who did not speak \non the State Department. He spoke for 2 hours, 25 minutes on the \nminimum wage, a subject that he never brought up once when he was \nchairman of the relevant committee in the previous 2 years.\n  So if we could have an understanding that we will have a little bit \nof time on this side to discuss the pending legislation while you folks \nare making the speeches that you want to make, sure, I will make a deal \nwith you. What does the Senator have in mind?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Well, Mr. President, I am not controlling time.\n  Mr. HELMS. I did not say the Senator was.\n  Mr. PRYOR. The Senator from North Dakota is controlling time on our \nside at this point.\n  Mr. HELMS. I established that, I think, with my question to the \nChair.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I respect the Senator's wishes. This is \nnot a filibuster. I wanted to take the floor----\n  Mr. HELMS. Oh, yes, it is. I know one when I see it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have watched filibusters and I have seen \nthe good Senator filibuster. I can recognize one when I see one and \nhave recognized them before with the good Senator. But this is not a \nfilibuster. In fact, compared to some of the missives on the floor of \nthe Senate, this has been relatively brief.\n  My intention was to come this afternoon, when I had an opportunity, \nto seek the floor and talk about some priorities and choices. I know \nothers are interested in Castro and Cuba because that is the bill that \nwas brought here. My understanding is there was no markup on the bill \nand no amendments offered. Anyway, it showed up on the floor of the \nSenate. I did not have anything to do with that. But I would like to \ntalk about the priorities and some things that are important to me. I \nam pretty well done talking. It is not my intention to keep the floor. \nI know others wanted to do the same.\n  In deference to the Senator from North Carolina, it is not my \nintention to hold up the Senate.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, I will point out there was a \ncloture petition filed immediately when the bill was brought up. Under \nthe rules of the Senate, it requires there is a cloture vote within a \nfixed amount of time. Even if we wanted to start a filibuster, that \noption has been pretty much precluded by the action taken by the \nmajority leader.\n  We all know that they have at least six of our colleagues--four that \nare running for President--that are going to be in New Hampshire \ntonight. The majority leader has announced no more votes today. This is \nnot a filibuster. We are accommodating those who could not be here. \nThey have gone up to debate.\n  We are debating Cuba. But my colleagues are raising, I think, a \nlegitimate issue. This bill has come to the floor without any markup by \nthe Foreign Relations Committee. They are pointing out that this is \nanother example of a piece of legislation that has not gone through the \nnormal process.\n  We are having a major transfer of wealth occurring in a few days in \nthis country from a cut in Medicare, Medicaid, a tax break of $240 \nbillion, and we had zero hearings on that issue. Frankly, I think \npeople do want--and I ask my friend whether or not he agrees with \nthis--here we are going to spend a couple of days on Cuba, which has \nrelevancy to some people. But ask the American people if they would \nrather see debate on Medicaid, Medicare, and a tax break, or some \npolicy on Cuba. The effects of this legislation do not go into law \nuntil there is democracy in Cuba. I ask my colleague that.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, he cannot make a speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is correct. I think everyone here knows this \nis not the issue of the day in the country--Cuba policy. It is the \nissue of the day on the Senate agenda, brought to us with relatively \nlittle notice, without going through a markup, which is fine. The fact \nis that the majority party has the right to do that.\n  Also, as the Senator from North Carolina knows, I have the right to \ncome to the floor and seek recognition to speak about issues that are \nimportant to me. I would observe that no one in this Chamber is better \non the issue of procedure on the Senate floor than the Senator from \nNorth Carolina. He knows that and I know that.\n  He also knows that, as a result of that, we are going to come to a \ntime here in the matter of a couple of weeks in which the majority \nparty is going to see this giant truck called reconciliation, with an \nempty box in the back, and they are going to throw everything in this \nreconciliation basket. They are going to throw Medicare, Medicaid, tax \ncuts, the farm bill, you name it, in that truck coming by. And what \nhappens to folks on this side of the aisle?\n  The Senator from North Carolina knows what happens to us. We are \nlimited in debate, limited in amendments. The fact is that we have a \nlimited opportunity to get at these issues. That is what requires us to \nbe here now and start talking about these issues, because we need that \ntime to explore exactly what these policies are going to mean to this \ncountry.\n  I do not intend to prevent the Senator from having the floor. He has \nevery right to seek the floor. He is \n\n[[Page S 15003]]\nmanaging the bill. I understand his frustration.\n  Mr. HELMS. I am not frustrated.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I simply sought the floor because there are things I want \nto say in the next couple of weeks, and every opportunity I get, I am \ngoing to do that. I want to talk about choices and priorities in this \ncountry. You and I want the same thing for the future of this country. \nMany in this Chamber share a different view, not about the destination \nbut about how you get there. These are things I want all Americans to \nunderstand, the choices that are being made, and what it will mean to \nthem.\n  Let me close as I began today. I began today talking about the \nceremony--a quite wonderful ceremony in the Chambers on the 50-year \nanniversary of the end of the Second World War. It is remarkable when \nyou think of what people gave for this country. Many gave their lives. \nThere was a spirit of unity and a spirit of national purpose in this \ncountry at that time.\n\n  I had hoped, somehow, for us again in this country to rekindle that \nspirit of unity and national purpose, to build a better country, \naddress this country's problems, fix what is wrong, and move on to a \nbetter and brighter future.\n  I think you want that, I want that. Part of achieving that is for us \nto have a healthy, aggressive debate about a whole range of choices in \nterms of how you get there, what you do to make this a better country. \nThat is all my purpose is. With that I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor] be recognized for 15 \nminutes, at which time I regain 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/11/senate-section/article/S14994-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15003-S15005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NURSING HOME STANDARDS\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for recognizing me. I \nalso thank my friend from North Carolina for making it possible under \nthese parliamentary procedures to allow me to speak for a few moments \nabout what I consider to be, Mr. President, one of the more critical \nissues that is before the U.S. Senate in the next coming weeks with \nregard to 2 million nursing home patients who live in thousands of \nnursing homes across America.\n  I do not know, Mr. President, if people are aware of what is \nhappening, what has happened in the Senate Finance Committee and the \nWays and Means Committee, what will be happening on the Senate and \nHouse floors with regard to the Federal standards which were \nestablished in 1987 in a bipartisan effort that protects residents of \nnursing homes from abuse and neglect.\n  Mr. President, what is happening to these standards is they are about \nto be abolished. They are about to be annihilated. Mr. President, there \nare about to be no Federal standards--no Federal standards to protect 2 \nmillion elderly and infirm individuals who live in America's nursing \nhomes.\n  I think that we ought to look, Mr. President, for just a moment at \nthese 2 million people who are now residents of America's nursing homes \nto see if these protective standards should actually be eliminated as \nproposed by the Republican majorities in the Senate Finance Committee \nand the Ways and Means Committee.\n  Back in 1987, as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, the \nCongress put into place a set of standards known as Nursing Home \nReform. Senator George Mitchell actually led in that effort, and I am \npleased to say that I played a very small part in drafting these \nimportant standards.\n  In fact, it was a bipartisan effort. Republicans and Democrats came \ntogether, because nursing home standards should not be political. Now, \neven though these standards have led to improved care in our Nation's \nnursing homes--we are about to consider a so-called Medicaid reform \nbill, Mr. President, which would totally wipe these standards out.\n  Two weeks ago in the Senate Finance Committee meeting I offered an \namendment to restore these protections during a Finance Committee \nmarkup and debate on Medicaid and Medicare.\n  My amendment was defeated on an 10-10 vote because, according to the \nleadership of the committee, it is ``contrary'' to the philosophy of \nthe reforms being proposed, and we don't want to sacrifice flexibility.\n  Mr. President, just for a moment, I will draw a picture. I will draw \na picture, a composite if I might, of the people who are living in the \nnursing homes in America. First, there are 2 million citizens, elderly \nand young and middle aged. People who reside in the nursing homes today \nare of all ages. Most of them are over 60.\n  In 25 years, we will no longer have 2 million people in the nursing \nhomes, Mr. President, we will have 3.6 million people in nursing homes. \nThat is going to come about two decades from now and it will be here \nbefore we know it.\n  We also find in these nursing homes, 80 percent of the residents \ndepend on Medicaid to help them pay for their care; 77 percent of this \nnursing home population need help with their daily dressing; 63 percent \nneed help with toileting; 91 percent need help with bathing; 66 percent \nhave a mental disorder, and one-half of these residents have no living \nrelative to serve as their advocate.\n  Let me repeat that, Mr. President: One-half of the residents of \nnursing homes, or approximately 1 million of these individuals, have no \nliving relative as their advocate to come to their rescue and to take \ntheir case to the nursing home administrator or to the inspectors who \ninspect the nursing homes. One-half of this nursing home population of \nour country who reach the age of 65 are going to require nursing home \ncare.\n  That means that one-half of all the people in this Chamber, one-half \nof all the people in the galleries in this great Capitol of ours, when \nthey reach the age of 65, half of these folks, including me--I assume \nif I am around here that long--are going to require nursing home care.\n  Mr. President, that is basically a composite of who we are looking at \nand who we are trying to protect by restoring the Federal nursing home \nstandards.\n  I find it very hard to believe that any meaningful reform that we \nmight propose would be inconsistent with quality care in nursing homes. \nThe very essence of reform is to get rid of what does not work, keep \nwhat does work and to make the whole program better.\n  Mr. President, we are committing an enormous mistake, an enormous \nmistake in even considering the elimination of our quality standards. \nThe very reason that we have these standards to begin with, let us go \nback, the very reason the Federal Government stepped in is because the \nStates would not. The Federal Government had to protect these people in \nthese nursing homes because the State regulations were inadequate.\n  Mr. President, I know that we in Congress are very hard at work \nexamining every program to find ways in which to increase flexibility \nto the States. I am for flexibility. I am a former Governor. I believe \nin flexibility. I believe we ought to eliminate what we call big \ngovernment at every opportunity we can, that we need to return more \npower to the States, local decisionmakers, and I think my record \nindicates that I have supported that with my vote.\n  Mr. President, I want to say, though, I have a very difficult time \nbelieving that when people in America think of big government, they are \nthinking of the laws that provide for the most basic and minimum \nstandard of care for the most frail and the most vulnerable among us.\n  I want to pose a question that I will be posing when we actually get \nto the debate on reconciliation, and I am going to ask this question to \nmy good friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  Now that we have finally, since 1987, finally come to the place in \nthis country where we have just the bare minimum of standards to \nprotect these 2 million individual residents of nursing homes, I would \nlike to ask my colleagues, and I will pose this question at \n\n[[Page S 15004]]\nthe appropriate times: Which rights that belong to these individuals \nnow would you like to eliminate? What about the right to choose your \nown doctor? I wonder if our Republican friends are going to want to \neliminate that right, which is today a right given by the full force \nand effect of the statutes of the United States of America?\n  I am going to ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would \nthey like to eliminate the right not to be tied to a bed or a chair, or \nrestrained? Are they willing to eliminate that right? I am going to ask \nthat question to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, just as \nI asked that question to my colleagues in the Senate Finance Committee \non the other side of the aisle 2 weeks ago. I did not get a response to \nthat question.\n  I am going to ask a third question, Mr. President, when we get to \nreconciliation and we start debating these statutes and these standards \nthey are attempting to repeal now. What about the right of privacy, to \nhave private medical records protected? Do our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle want to eliminate that right? I am going to ask that \nquestion. What about the right of privacy in communications and the \nright to open your own mail and to read your own mail without someone \nreading it before you get it? What about that right, that is today \nguaranteed under the 1987 regulations that we enacted, I must say, \nthrough a bipartisan effort? These are some of the rights, some of the \nmost basic rights that our friends on the other side of the aisle are \nattempting to annihilate.\n  There is a great deal of irony here, Mr. President, and that irony is \nthat no one outside of the Congress has come to us and said we want you \nto repeal the nursing home reform law. At first, when I heard our \ncolleagues, the Republicans, were going to repeal these Federal \nguidelines, these Federal standards that we worked so hard to achieve \nthrough a bipartisan effort with President Bush helping us to put these \nstandards into effect, I said: OK, here comes the nursing home lobby, \nthe nursing home administrators, the nursing home owners. They have \ncome to Washington and they have gone over here and they have gotten \nthem to try to repeal and annihilate these particular regulations.\n  Mr. President, the odd thing is, I talked yesterday to one of the \nlargest chain operators in America of nursing homes. He said,\n\n       We think the standards are good. We think the standards are \n     working. We think the standards help us treat our residents \n     better and we do not want to see those standards taken away. \n     In fact, we think they are more efficient.\n\n  But, just last Saturday, in the New York Times, the executive vice \npresident of the American Health Care Association, Mr. Paul Willging, \nsaid, ``We never took a position that the 1987 law should be \nrepealed.'' The New York Times reporter was unable to find anyone at \nthis nursing home owners convention representing the industry who would \nsay they wanted the law repealed.\n  I would like to point out that not only were these standards enacted \nwith broad bipartisan consensus, there is also scientific evidence that \nthey are working. They are improving nursing home care. They are making \nlife better for those among us who live in nursing homes.\n  For example, we have here what is not a very pretty chart, I might \nsay. I hope I will have some others in the next week or so. In the area \nof physical restraints, since this particular law has been passed, \nsince we finally have minimum standards for nursing homes, we have \ndecreased the need for physical restraints from 38 percent of the \nnursing home population down, now, to 20 percent. That is an amazing \nstatistic for us to look at, and to show and demonstrate beyond doubt \nthat this particular set of goals is working.\n  We also see another startling fact. Since we enacted these nursing \nhome standards, we see now that when a nursing home patient becomes a \nhospital patient, he or she only has to spend, today, 5.3 days in that \nhospital as compared to 7.2 days before. The reason is because you have \nfewer bedsores, you have nursing home patients who are healthier, who \nare stronger, and whose quality of life has been better.\n  Also, let us look at another small chart here: The decrease in \nproblematic care. There is a dramatic decrease in indicators or poor \nquality care--use of physical restraints, use of urinary catheters. It \ndemonstrates without question we are seeing a very rapid decline in the \nneed for these particular restraints to ever be used in nursing homes \nagain.\n  Last Saturday, a Republican spokesman for the House Commerce \nCommittee was quoted in the Washington Post as saying that the proposal \nto strip away the safety standards in nursing homes is ``the ending of \na 8-year experiment.'' This individual went on to say, and here again I \nam quoting, that the standards are ``confining, expensive, and \ncounterproductive.'' Last Friday, at a hearing on the Medicaid Program \nin the Senate caucus room, we were presented with the results of a \nscientific study by the independent, well-respected Research Triangle \nInstitute. Rather than being confining, expensive, and \ncounterproductive, as the Commerce staff member had claimed, this very, \nvery distinguished study showed that the standards are in fact \nliberating, that they are cost effective, and result in improved \noutcomes. I say liberating because the standards have decreased the \nunnecessary use of physical and chemical restraints in nursing homes.\n  According to the Research Triangle Institute, since the nursing home \nreform standards were implemented in 1990, the use of restraints has \ndropped by 50 percent. So it does not sound to me like these standards \nhave been confining for nursing home patients.\n  Mr. President, I would like to address an issue in the Medicaid \ndebate which is of great concern to me--the issue of whether or not we \nshould repeal the law which protects residents of nursing homes from \nabuse and neglect.\n  Back in 1987, as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, the \nCongress put into place a set of standards known as nursing home \nreform. Senator Mitchell led that effort, and I am pleased to say I \nhelped draft these important standards. Now, even though the standards \nhave led to improved care in our Nation's nursing homes, we are about \nto consider a so-called Medicaid reform bill which would wipe them out. \nI offered an amendment to restore these protections during the Finance \nCommittee debate on Medicaid and Medicare. My amendment was defeated on \na tie vote because, according to the leadership of the committee, it \nis--quote--``contrary''--to the philosophy of the reforms being \nproposed.\n  Well, I find it hard to believe that any meaningful reform we would \npropose would be inconsistent with quality care in nursing homes. The \npurpose of reform is to get rid of what does not work, keep what does \nwork, and make the whole program better. I think we are making a big \nmistake in even considering eliminating our quality standards. I, for \none, hope we do not enact this dangerous change. We should not turn our \nbacks on our frail elderly nursing home patients.\n  Mr. President, I know that we in the Congress are hard at work \nexamining every program to find ways in which to increase flexibility \nfor the States. There is a general mood in the Nation that we want to \ndo away with Big Government and return more power to State and local \ndecision makers. However, Mr. President, I have a hard time believing \nthat when people in America think of Big Government, that they are \nthinking of the laws which provide a minimum standard of care for the \nmost frail and vulnerable among us.\n  Mr. President, it is well known that as a former Governor, I am a \nstrong supporter of States' rights. I have devoted much of my career to \ndoing away with Big Government in the negative sense. I support ending \nFederal mandates which make unreasonable demands on our citizens. \nHowever, I do not feel that the nursing home reform law makes \nunreasonable demands. It is simply not unreasonable to ask nursing \nhomes not to tie up residents, or administer mind-altering drugs to \nthem, simply to quiet them down for the convenience of staff. It is not \nunreasonable to ask nursing homes to allow residents and their families \nto participate in decisions about their care. Mr. President, it is \nabove all not unreasonable to ask nursing homes to ensure \n\n[[Page S 15005]]\nthat care is provided to these vulnerable residents by an adequate \nstaff that is well trained.\n  When we talk about ending Federal mandates, it is often because an \nindustry or some other interest group has asked for the repeal of a \nparticular law or regulation. The irony of this instance, Mr. \nPresident, is that no one outside of the Congress has asked that we \nrepeal the nursing home reform law. Not only was this law accompanied \nby unprecedented consensus when it was first enacted, it still enjoys \nthe support of the industry being regulated. Mr. President, if anyone \nwere clamoring to repeal this law, we would expect it to be the nursing \nhome industry. But just last Saturday, in the New York Times, the \nexecutive vice president of the American Health Care Association, Mr. \nPaul Willging, said--and I quote--``We never took a position that the \n1987 law should be repealed.'' The New York Times reporter was unable \nto find anyone representing the industry who would say they wanted the \nlaw repealed.\n  Mr. President, I would like to point out that not only were these \nstandards enacted with broad bipartisan consensus, there is scientific \nevidence that they are working. These standards are improving care. \nThey are making life better for those among us who live in nursing \nhomes.\n  Last Saturday, a Republican spokesman for the House Commerce \nCommittee was quoted in the Washington Post as saying that the proposal \nto strip away the safety standards is ``ending an 8-year experiment.'' \nHe went on to say--and here again I am quoting--that the standards are \n``confining, expensive, and counterproductive.''\n  Mr. President, the data we have so far lays waste to those unfounded \nassertions. Last Friday, at a hearing on the Medicaid Program, we were \npresented with the results of a scientific study by the independent, \nwell-respected Research Triangle Institute. Rather than being \nconfining, expensive, and counterproductive, as the Commerce Committee \nstaffer claimed, this research indicates that the standards are \nliberating, cost-effective, and result in improved outcomes.\n  I say liberating because the standards have decreased the unnecessary \nuse of physical and chemical restraints in nursing homes. According to \nthe Research Triangle Institute, since the nursing home reform \nstandards were implemented in 1990, the use of restraints has dropped \nby 50 percent. And the Republicans claim that the standards are \nconfining? It does not sound to me like they have been confining for \nnursing home patients.\n  And lest you think that unrestrained patients are more difficult to \ncare for, let me get to the second point--the standards are cost-\neffective. This study indicated that less staff time is needed to care \nfor patients who are unrestrained. In addition, because patients are \nreceiving better care and staying relatively healthier, they are being \nhospitalized less often. According to RTI, nursing home patients are \nsuffering from fewer injuries and conditions caused by poor care--this \ntranslates to a 25-percent decrease in hospital days--resulting in a $2 \nbillion per year savings in Medicare and Medicaid combined. So how can \nit be said that these standards are expensive?\n  The RTI study also points to improved patient outcomes--and I know of \nno better measure of nursing home productivity. There has been a 50-\npercent reduction in dehydration, a 4-percent reduction in the number \nof patients developing nutrition problems, and we see 30,000 fewer \npatients suffering from bedsores. We are also seeing significant \ndeclines in the use of indwelling urinary catheters, a reduction in the \nuse of physical restraints, and far fewer patients who are not involved \nin activities. This contributes greatly to quality of life. The RTI \ndata also show that since nursing home reform was implemented, patients \nare suffering less decline in functional and cognitive status. So I ask \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle, how can it be said that \nthese standards are counterproductive?\n  Mr. President, I pointed out earlier that the nursing home industry \nhas not asked for a repeal of these standards. The industry is \nconcerned, however, about the depth of the cuts being considered with \nrespect to the Medicaid Program. Although nursing homes support the \nquality standards, they are understandably concerned about their \nability to maintain these standards in the face of deep cuts in \nfunding. This is a serious issue which we must address, Mr. President. \nBut when we address these concerns about funding, we should start with \nthe assumption that standards must be maintained. We should start with \nthe assumption that we will not repeal a law which no one has asked us \nto repeal. Instead, what I fear my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle would rather do is throw standards out the window, cut the \nfunding indiscriminately, and then hope for the best. Mr. President, I \nam not willing to take such a chance with our frail elderly. I hope my \ncolleagues in the Senate will join their voices with mine in this call \nto protect our vulnerable nursing home residents.\n  Mr. President, I would like to close by saying, during this debate on \nreconciliation, in which there will be very little time, we are going \nto look at this particular issue and a lot of other issues that relate \nto it. We are going to look at the need to continue, for example, the \nreimbursement, the rebate for the States that have Medicaid \nprescription drug programs. This is something the drug industry is \nfighting, but it is something we have to maintain so the States can get \nthe best possible price for the drugs that they provide for poorest of \nthe poor population.\n  There are going to be many other areas that we are going to look at. \nBut we thought today would be a good day to start the debate on \nreconciliation, because we know the time will be short once that debate \nis actually, technically and literally begun.\n  Mr. President, I again thank my good friend from North Carolina who \nhas been most cooperative.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/11/senate-section/article/S15003-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15005-S15023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CUBAN LIBERTY AND DEMOCRATIC SOLIDARITY [LIBERTAD] ACT OF 1995\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I believe the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia is seeking recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor in support of the \nmeasure which is before the Senate, somewhat different than the \nprevious speakers we have heard, to rise on behalf of the Cuban Liberty \nand Democratic Solidarity Act, otherwise called Libertad.\n  I hope the good chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee will let \nme embrace an issue of international consequence, as a prelude to my \ncomments here.\n  A distinguished Member of this body, my good colleague from Georgia, \nSenator Nunn, as everybody knows now, has announced that he will depart \nthe Senate after the conclusion of his term. Of course, this has an \nenormous impact in our home State of Georgia and the Nation as well. I \ntold the Senator when we visited just before his announcement that he \nleft a very rich legacy for himself, for his family, for our State, and \nfor the Nation. We are all indebted to the service of the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Georgia. It has been long, it has been arduous, \nstatesmanlike, and it has been civil. And the Senator from Georgia has \nmade a significant contribution to his era in the history of the U.S. \nSenate and our country.\n  I first met the Senator from Georgia when he was in the House of \nRepresentatives and just before I became a member of the Georgia \nSenate. And he was equally held in high regard in our home State as he \nwas here on the national scene.\n  A lot of people have asked me what the effect would be of his \ndeparture. And I said, of course, there will be an interim effect, but \nI also pointed out that in our vast democracy filled with talent, \ncapacity, one of the rich treasures of it which we have seen throughout \nour history is that we regroup and move on.\n  But another point I would like to make is the Senator in his closing \nstatement in the House Chamber pointed out that he is not leaving \npublic life, that he will continue to be an activist in public policy \nand a resource not only to us in the Senate but to the Nation as well. \n\n[[Page S 15006]]\n\n  So I wish the Senator every goodwill, and Godspeed to him and his \nfamily as they pursue a new adventure. He will be missed here. He will \nbe appreciated. And as a fellow Georgian I think I speak for all of \nthose in our State, we hold him in the highest regard and wish him the \nvery best in his future.\n  Of course, the Senator from Georgia has been on the international \nscene for a long time. He has watched the effects in Cuba of an avowed \nenemy of the United States in one Fidel Castro. Fidel Castro has \nthroughout his history been an arch enemy of the United States and its \npeople. And to this day he has not disavowed any of his intentions nor \nhis hostility to this country and its people. He has been the exporter \nof terrorism. He has been the exporter of revolution. He has been the \nexporter of turmoil. And its effect in our hemisphere has been \nsignificant, and its effect here in the United States has been \nsignificant.\n  There are those among us who think that this is the time to open \nrelations with Cuba and that it will, through communication and \ninteraction, cause Fidel Castro, this archenemy of the last three \ndecades, to somehow soften his stance.\n  That reminds me of the Soviet policy. This Nation's capital was \nfilled with Soviet apologists who felt that the definition of the \nSoviet Union as an ``evil empire''--like former President Reagan--was \nthe inappropriate approach to dealing with the Soviets. He felt that \npower and the force of power was what it was going to take to cause the \nSoviet Union to implode, and he was correct. Many of these apologists \nhave become awfully silent. But there can be no doubt that the firm, \nforceful, aggressive policy of the United States toward the avowed \nenemy, the Soviet Union, had an impact and effect.\n  Mr. President, no one is suggesting that Fidel Castro is near the \nnational concern as the Soviet Union was, but certainly anything that \nis 90 miles off the coast of the United States that is an avowed enemy \nneeds to be watched very, very closely.\n  And I think the Cuban apologists are wrong, too. I believe that the \npolicies of the last 30 years by Republican and Democrat \nadministrations--by the vast majority of the Congress to impose tough \nsanctions, embargoes, and to hold firm that we are going to keep the \npressure on this government of Fidel Castro until there is liberty, \nuntil there is democracy, until there is freedom--are absolutely \ncorrect.\n  This legislation is nothing more than an extension of U.S. policy as \nit has been shaped in a bipartisan way, as I said, by Republican and \nDemocrat administrations alike.\n  Mr. President, this is absolutely no time for us to rewrite that \npolicy. We are succeeding. Now that the Soviet Union cannot spoon-feed \nCastro, the sanctions are imposed and they are feeling the pressure of \nthis United States power, it should be continued. It should not be \nmodified. It should not be nullified. It should not be weakened. It \nshould be toughened.\n  When you look at the nature of life in Cuba today, we still have a \nlitany of human rights violations, personal rights and freedoms being \ntramped on. This is not a leader with which the United States should \nput its credibility on the line, nor ratify and certify, nor give \nstrength by the suggestions that we should begin negotiating in good \nfaith with a man who has such a history of totalitarian oppression.\n  Mr. President, one of the provisions which is somewhat controversial, \nbut I think one of the more important pieces of debate with regard to \nthe legislation, is title III, which has two parts. It denies entry \ninto the United States to anyone who confiscates property or traffics \nin confiscated property; and, No. 2, it gives the U.S citizens valid \nproperty claims and a private right of action in Federal court.\n  I have been very concerned about property rights of U.S. citizens in \nforeign countries in our hemisphere for some period of time. Cuba is \nnot the only country with which we have difficulties in regard to the \ninterests of United States property owners in other countries. It has \nbeen at the center of a long debate--I see my colleague from \nConnecticut--with regard to Nicaragua and other countries. And \nconsiderable progress has been made in the aftermath of President \nChamorro's new democracy for about a year. We were thrashing through \nthis issue, and over and over making the point that U.S. citizens who \nown property there needed appropriate dispensation of that property. I \nthink that discussion bore fruit, and many of those properties are now \nbeing settled. And I give much credit to the Chamorro government for \nthe good faith in which they came to the table and tried to deal with \nthose legitimate property rights. I think that will no longer be an \nissue in the not-too-distant future.\n  In the case of Cuba, however, we have 5,911 American property claims \nvalued at $1.8 billion in 1960 value. This is an enormous issue. No one \ndenies the confiscation. The Cuban Government has shown absolutely zero \nrespect for this property and has indicated no intention of addressing \nthe issue. And, to complicate it even further, they are using the \nproperty to produce currency in their hard-pressed economy.\n  What this involves is taking the property that was lawfully owned by \npeople who are now U.S. citizens, or were U.S. citizens at the time, \nconfiscating the property and actually entering into a world market on \nthe property. We have a situation now where citizens of other countries \nin our hemisphere are negotiating with the Cuban Government and \npurchasing these properties for which there are claims by U.S. citizens \nand selling them to foreign nationals of other countries.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield on this point? I do not want to \ninterrupt his time, but it is an interesting conversation. I wonder if \nhe might just yield.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. DODD. I am going to raise this in my own time. But my colleague \nbrings up probably the most controversial part of the bill. He properly \nidentified it as a controversial one. He is absolutely correct in \nidentifying the number of certified U.S. claims as 5,911, that were the \nresult of actions taken by the Castro government after 1959. Control of \nthe country.\n  My concern here is not that issue at all. That is going to be \ndifficult enough to deal with. Nonetheless, I feel confident we can \nultimately address those claims. What I think we do here is add a new \nelement to the problem which he has already alluded to, and that is \nwhat has heretofore been international and U.S. law with respect to the \nresolution of confiscation of property of a U.S. citizen. We are now \ngoing to expand the definition to include the property of Cuban \nnationals who left the country and became U.S. citizens subsequent to \ntheir property being taken.\n  We are talking about roughly a million people who have left Cuba. The \nestimates are that perhaps as many as hundreds of thousands of these \nindividuals left behind property--no one suggests that everyone of the \nmillion people who left will have claims against Cuba, but several \nhundreds of thousands well may. So we add to the 5,911 claimants \nalready certified, potentially, as many as 300,000 to 400,000 \nadditional potential claims.\n  Those of us who are concerned about that provision naturally ask the \nquestion why we are prepared to provide special legal rights for this \ncategory of individuals. After all we have Polish-Americans, people who \nhave left the former Soviet Union, people who fled China, as well as \nother countries of repression and left behind or had taken their \nproperty by former regimes. I think, any one of these groups can \nlegitimately come forward and ask for similar treatment if we change \nthe law.\n  There is a reason for current international law and practice in this \narea. Under existing law, the U.S. Government is responsible for \nespousing the claims of persons who were U.S. citizens at the time the \nconfiscation occurred. For those individuals who were sovereign \nnationals of the country in question, the issue is with acts of their \ngovernment. If we change domestic law in this one case, I think we can \nfully expect individuals who may have also lived under a Communist \ngovernment to say why not us; we left; you have changed the law to for \none group of people; we would like a similar application of the law in \nour case.\n  I just raise this with my colleague, and I am going to address it at \ngreater length here, but it is one of the major concerns I have with \nthis bill. I see it \n\n[[Page S 15007]]\nsubjecting our Federal court system to substantial increased costs in \norder to process these new claims. In addition I am concerned that \nthese new claims will probably make it very difficult to resolve the \n5,911 certified U.S. claimants who have a right under longstanding law \nto have their claims addressed. These claimants have expressed that \nvery concern. There are some strong letters from them--worried about \nexactly what happens to them as a result of this explosion of claims \nthat may come before the court as a result of this legislation.\n  I raise that just as an issue. I know my colleague has been involved \nwith the issue of expropriation generically, as have others. \nExpropriations have occurred in many countries--Panama, El Salvador, \nNicaragua, a whole host of countries.\n  With respect to the issue you raise about companies from other \ncountries doing business in Cuba. By my count 58 countries have some \nform of business interest in Cuba today. Great Britain has a number of \ninterests--France, Germany. It is not just Latin American countries. \nSome of the most conservative democratic countries in Europe have major \neconomic enterprises there. And we will virtually be precluding \nentrance into this country citizens of our allies in Europe who may \nhave business interests there. Do we really want to alienate our \nclosest trading partners in this way? It seems to me that we may be \nraising a tremendously complicated problem for ourselves down the road. \nI raise that for my colleague's comments.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I appreciate that. As the Senator noted, I singled \nthis out as one of the more controversial provisions.\n  Mr. DODD. He is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. And my colleague would also acknowledge that this \nissue does not confine itself to Cuba alone. In fact, one of the \ncountries in which we both maintain a rather high interest is \nNicaragua, and that very question is preeminent in the struggle to \nresolve property rights of individuals who were Nicaraguan citizens at \nthe time, came to the United States, became U.S. citizens and are now \nclaiming property rights in Nicaragua.\n  So my response to my colleague from Connecticut is I believe that it \nis time for this to be elevated in debate and search such as we are \ndoing today and will continue through the process of dealing with this \nlegislation.\n  Frankly, I believe we need to obtain the interest and attention of \nthe countries that the Senator pointed to, and I might also point out \nthey are on both sides of our northern and southern border, too, with \nCanada and Mexico dealing with properties that were, in the Senator's \ndefinition, without question property confiscated by the Castro \ngovernment, acknowledged property owned by U.S. citizens at that time.\n  Those properties--forget for a moment the question the Senator raised \nabout expansion, which I think is a legitimate question. Those \nproperties are being bartered by the government with full knowledge. We \nare not having a situation here where over the years the title is \nconfused, a citizen acquired it or got it and somehow has sold it to a \nforeign national of another country. This is a program on the part of \nthe Cuban Government to deal with its currency problems, which are \nimmense. And I think the United States is morally required to confront \nthat issue, I think not only with Cuba but we need to be making a \nstatement, we need to be searching for resolution with our allies in \nterms of our respect for U.S.-owned property.\n  On a broader scale, I would say to the Senator from Connecticut, I \nthink this is an issue that has not received enough attention, whether \nit is in Cuba or Nicaragua or some of the former Communist governments \neven in Europe. And I believe it is an issue of law.\n  I am not a lawyer, as is my distinguished colleague. But it is a \nquestion that requires more definition in this era of international \nhistory. We are talking about a period where we have an interdependent \neconomy, far more open economy. We all acknowledge that. This question \nis basically in law 30 years or more old.\n  I think it deserves attention, and I am glad the Senator from North \nCarolina put it in the bill because I think it is going to force all of \nus to confront the issue more effectively than we have in the past. \nThat would be my response to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Just one more piece on that. The fact that the business interests in \nour immediate hemisphere, in our immediate sphere of influence, feel \nfree enough to engage in transactions that affect these known \nproperties, I think is very serious.\n  I hope the discussion--in fact, I would take it even further. I think \nthat we may come to the point where we need to be entering into direct \ndiscussions with these governments with regard to these particular \nproperties. I am talking about the 5,911 claims. There is a rather--I \nwill not get into detail, but there is a rather elaborate circumstance \nof a company in Canada today that, with full knowledge of the \nsituation, is pursuing and developing one of these pieces of property.\n  So, Mr. President, the point I want to make here is that this \nlegislation is a direct extension of contemporary policy with Cuba that \nhas been shaped by Republican Presidents and Democrat Presidents since \nCuba was taken over by Fidel Castro. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, I believe this entire question of property deserves and \nrequires far more attention than it has received. And I think this is a \nvalid attempt to deal with that. I am absolutely comfortable that the \ndebate will modify this language before the end of the day, but I think \nit is appropriate that we are being drawn to this debate.\n  No. 3, the conditions in Cuba continue to be extensive human rights \nviolations, extensive oppression, and imprisonment. It is an arbitrary, \ntotalitarian government with its leadership showing no signs of any \nlegitimate movement to democracy. And, Mr. President, I think it must \nbe noted that Fidel Castro, exporter of terrorism, exporter of \nrevolution, has made no--zero, none--accord to a movement to democracy \nor to renounce his adversarial, hostile attitude toward the people and \nGovernment of the United States of America.\n  And that is why I stand in support of the thrust of the legislation \nthat is before this Senate today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I think the Senator from \nConnecticut is seeking recognition.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I appreciate my \ncolleague's yielding to me in the middle of his remarks. And I just \nwish to make the point, I urge my colleagues here in the coming 2 \ndays--I know that they have a lot of other things on their mind--to \ntake a good, hard, close look at this bill. Because in the \nconsideration of any matter like this, we ought to all ask ourselves \nseveral basic questions, the first being: Is what is being proposed in \nthe best interests of our own country? That is the first question.\n  Put aside for a second what it may do to the targeted country where \nwe are focusing the legislation. But what does it do to our foreign \npolicy? And then, second, the obvious question: Is the legislation \ngoing to achieve the desired results? Those are two pretty basic \nquestions we ought to ask ourselves.\n  Mr. President, when it comes to the issue of Cuba, unlike even North \nKorea apparently, but Vietnam, the People's Republic of China, the \nEastern bloc countries--when still under the control of the Soviet \nUnion--the Soviet Union itself, despite all of our difficulties, we \nmanaged to, at least for the most part, try to conduct our foreign \npolicy in a way that made sense for us. That entailed having relations \nwith them. And, in many of those cases that I have just mentioned, \nachieved the desired results such that today we find ourselves in a \nsituation that is far beyond the imagination of most of us. The Eastern \nbloc countries that were under the control and the thumb of the Soviet \nUnion today are struggling with their own form of democracy, but the \nworld has changed.\n  I would make a case there were several reasons for that success. \nCertainly, on the one hand was the fact that their economies ended up \nbeing bankrupt because they spent such a tremendous percentage of their \ngross domestic product on arms.\n  One can argue that buildup had a desired effect economically. But I \nwould also suggest, Mr. President, that it was the clever, clear idea \nthat exposing the peoples of those countries to the fraud that was \nbeing perpetuated on them by \n\n[[Page S 15008]]\nthe controllers, as well as the options that existed elsewhere, also \ncontributed to the change that occurred.\n  I want to get to that argument as we look at Cuba. But Cuba is \nunique. This is almost a domestic political debate rather than a \nforeign policy debate, I would say. If we could step back and say to \nourselves, what is in our best interest and how do we collectively, in \na wise and thoughtful way, try to propose ideas that are going to \nachieve, as soon as possible, the desired results. Those results are to \nbring democracy to Cuba. We all agree on that.\n  However, if you disagree with all of the tactics of how to achieve \nthat, then you are immediately suspect and usually the victim of a lot \nof name calling about where your political leanings are. God forbid you \ndisagree with how we might achieve the desired results.\n  And so my objection to the bill being offered by the Senator from \nNorth Carolina is not what the Senator from North Carolina or others \ndesire. I do not believe there is probably any debate about that or any \ndivision here. I think every one of us would like to see democracy come \nto Cuba. I will not say restored to Cuba, because the notion somehow \nthat prior to 1959 we were looking at a democratic government is \nspecious. But let us bring democracy to Cuba.\n  How do we best achieve that? What steps should we take? How do we \nwork collectively with our allies, in this hemisphere and elsewhere, to \nproduce those results? If we can step back and do that without worrying \nwhether we are going to offend various factions or groups in this \ncountry that have, at least as far as I am concerned, a certain amount \nof right to be red-hot angry over the situation because they are the \nones who were victimized or their families, then I think we might \nactually make some significant steps forward.\n  I mentioned briefly a moment ago that my concern with title III of \nthis bill is because it potentially exposes our country to a tremendous \nnumber of similar problems in other places where there will be claims \nof an equal degree of legitimacy. There are 38 countries in the world \nwhere we presently have, Mr. President, outstanding claims by U.S. \ncitizens against those governments because properties have been \nexpropriated and there has been no compensation. I have now become a \nU.S. citizen, and I'm going to go to U.S. courts and try and get paid \nfor it.''\n\n  (Mr. ABRAHAM assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, that will cause an explosion of demands on \nour U.S. court system. So the first test is, what is the impact of this \nlegislation on us, put aside for a minute on Cuba, on us? And if my \ncolleagues will merely look at just what it does if we only take the \nCuban case and given the average court costs associated with such \nclaims and multiply it by the number of claimants, it is a tremendous \namount of money the United States taxpayers will be asked to come up \nwith so that our courts can handle this.\n  I would also argue that it is going to be rather difficult for us to \nturn down other claimants who lived in other countries at the time \nthere was an expropriation without compensation. They are going to want \nthe law changed for them as well.\n  So I urge my colleagues over this next day or so to please examine \nthis provision of the law and understand that while you are trying, and \nI think all of us are, to effectuate some change in Cuba, that in doing \nso, we may be doing more injury to ourselves, adding more of a \nfinancial burden on ourselves, complicating things for ourselves \nwithout necessarily doing anything to Cuba.\n  I hope people will pay some attention to this, step back a little \nbit: ``If I don't vote for this I will look like I am not for democracy \nin Cuba,'' or ``I am in favor of Fidel Castro if I vote against the \nbill.'' That is not the case at all. Look at the provisions and what we \nare doing.\n  There are several basic questions we ought to be asking, and I will \ntry over these next several minutes to address each of the questions \nthat I think ought to be raised, aside from the basic questions about \nwhether or not the bill before us is going to help or hurt the United \nStates and, second, whether or not it is going to have the desired \neffects on the country in question, in this case Cuba, to effectuate \nthe desired results, and that is a change to democracy.\n  Are we more likely as well to impose additional hardships on the \npeople of Cuba, not the Government, but the people of Cuba? That is a \nlegitimate question, it seems to me. Are we going to make the \ntransition to democracy more difficult or less difficult if this \nlegislation is adopted and signed into law? Finally, will this \nlegislation place added strains on our relations with other \ngovernments?\n  I am not suggesting that this final question in and of itself ought \nto be the sole criteria, because if what you are doing is right, if it \nis good for us, if it produces the desired results, I am willing to \naccept the fact that some other governments may be uncomfortable.\n  I recall during the debate on whether or not to impose sanctions on \nthe Government of South Africa, there were many of our allies that were \nuncomfortable. My reaction then, as it would be now, is so what, in \nsome ways. We have to be a leader in the world, and if that is what it \ntakes from time to time, then you ought to be willing to sacrifice \nthat. But consider what you are doing. Make a very careful calculation \nas to whether you are going to produce results that you are seeking.\n  Lastly, as I said earlier, whether or not we are going to overwhelm \nour Federal court system, which I think is a very important question \npeople ought to look at.\n  So, Mr. President, today we begin this debate. By the way, let me say \nto my colleagues, I think the raising of the issue of the Medicare and \nMedicaid debate and long-term care issues of nursing homes, while \nobviously not the subject of the bill before us, I think does raise a \nlegitimate question, and that is, here we are now going to consume 2\\1/\n2\\ days of the Senate's time on this one bill. A cloture motion was \nfiled immediately. So we are now going to take up 2 days. We did not \nhave 1 day of hearings on Medicare or Medicaid with regard to the \nproposal that is now being considered by the Finance Committee.\n  I think Members of this body raise a legitimate issue when they \nquestion whether or not the priorities of the American public, if given \nthe choice to express themselves, would have this body spend 2 days \ndebating Medicare, Medicaid and long-term health care conditions or \nCuba. I do not have any doubt in my mind what their priorities would \nbe.\n  So we are going to end up next week or the week after with 20 hours \nequally divided, 10 hours on a side, to discuss all of Medicare, all of \nMedicaid, all of the tax breaks, all of the earned income tax credit \nprovisions, and yet I am going to have 2\\1/2\\ days, apparently, to talk \nabout one bill affecting Cuba.\n  Maybe somebody else thinks that is the priority of the country. I do \nnot think so. Yet, that is the position we are in, because the majority \nhas decided that is what the order of business will be.\n  I would have urged we spend 2 days with a good healthy debate on \nMedicare and Medicaid and long-term health care without necessarily \nhaving a bill in front of us, but a good solid discussion of what we \nare going to do in the next several weeks to millions of Americans and \ntheir families, and yet we are going to spend 2\\1/2\\ days on an issue \nthat has not even had a vote in the Foreign Relations Committee. We had \nsome hearings at least on the Cuba bill. No hearings on Medicare, \nMedicaid or long-term nursing home care and, as the Senator from \nArkansas pointed out a moment ago, we are now going to strip \nregulations from legislation we adopted in a bipartisan fashion only a \nfew years ago.\n  Mr. President, I want to turn, if I can, in this debate about Cuba to \nthe decisions reached by President Clinton just a few days ago. Those \ndecisions have now been highly criticized, a moral outrage has been \nexpressed over changes in regulations affecting the Government of Cuba \nand related matters. I have seen press reports that the majority leader \ntook strong exception to the Executive order and others have been \ntrying to one-up each other as to who can come up with the most \noutrageous statement to describe the decisions taken by President \nClinton.\n  I am not sure every report accurately reflects the feelings of my \ncolleagues, but nonetheless some rather extreme statements have been \nmade. \n\n[[Page S 15009]]\n\n  As I understand it, the President's policy initiatives are, in large \nmeasure, perfectly consistent with related provisions contained in the \nHouse-passed bill and the most recent version of the Senate substitute \nwhich is before us. So I am somewhat surprised that there is such a \nvehement attack on President Clinton and his proposals, where a mere \nsimple reading of the bill before us includes many of the things the \nPresident did by Executive order.\n  Section 712 of the version of the amendment available to me \nspecifically authorizes the President of the United States, and I \nquote:\n\n       To furnish assistance to nongovernmental organizations to \n     support democracy building efforts in Cuba.\n\n  That was a key element of the President's announcement last Friday. \nSection 722 of that same measure authorized the President to, and I \nquote:\n\n       Establish and implement an exchange of news bureaus between \n     the United States and Cuba.\n\n  That is another key element of the President's actions. Surely, the \nsupporters of this legislation do not object to the implementation of \nthese measures that they themselves have recommended in the context of \nthe legislation before us.\n  What about the other elements of last Friday's announcement? Do my \ncolleagues object to provisions which seek to put an end to the \nprofiteering associated with legal transfers of funds--legal transfers \nof funds--by Cuban-American families in this country to their family \nmembers in Cuba seeking to emigrate to the United States under \nprovisions of the United States-Cuban immigration agreement?\n  That is why the President has authorized Western Union to open \noffices in Cuba to make legal transfers of this nature easier and \ncheaper. Today, the families in this country trying to provide \nassistance to their families in Cuba, in many cases, get held up. It is \na mugging, in effect, the prices they have to pay.\n  So here we are setting up Western Union offices in that country to \nhelp families, Cuban-American families, legally transfer funds to \nassist them. That is part of what the President did. Is that not what \nwe ought to be trying to do in these particular cases? Or do our \ncolleagues take issue with the enhanced enforcement measures announced \nby the President? These measures would step up enforcement of sanctions \nregulations, as well as compliance with the Neutrality Act. The \nPresident has also instructed that the Office of Foreign Assets \nControl, the embargo enforcement agency, be strengthened in Washington \nand in Miami.\n  I am hard pressed to understand the moral outrage over the \nPresident's decisions when virtually every one of them are at least de \nfacto or de jure included in the bill we are now considering in part, \nand yet that is exactly--exactly--the case.\n  Now I would like to turn to the bill before us. Many stated purposes \nof the legislation are laudable and, again, let me emphasize, every \nsingle Member in this body I know, if they could will it, tonight would \nwill that there be change in Cuba. That is not the issue. Every one of \nus would like to see democracy come to that country.\n\n  Secondly, Mr. President, I recall being offended when people would \ntalk about my ethnicity in ways in which all of us who happened to be \nof one particular group are of a particular mindset--that they could \nspeak for everybody who was an Irish-American. Today, to suggest \nsomehow that every Cuban-American thinks exactly alike is insulting.\n  There is a great diversity of thought within the Cuban-American \ncommunity as to how we ought to address the problem of Cuba. None that \nI know of disagree with the bottom line; that is, that we should seek \nto bring democracy to that country. But there is an honest division of \nthought among Cuban-Americans who believe there might be better ways of \nachieving those results.\n  It is offensive to many, some of whom even disagree with their fellow \nCuban-Americans, that somehow they ought to be maligned because they \nthink there may be a better way of achieving the desired results. \nCertainly, we ought to take that into consideration as we look at the \nlegislation before us.\n  None of us argue about the goals. But the measures that we take have \nto be examined and examined carefully. All of us, I hope, would like to \nsee that the transition from the present government in Cuba to \ndemocracy would happen without bloodshed. I hope it is not a point of \ncontention that, ideally, we ought to try to achieve the same kind of \npeaceful transformation we saw happen in Poland, Hungary, \nCzechoslovakia, and other of the New Independent States. Many thought \nit would come to a war one day. I thought so, too. But I think all of \nus are grateful today for the fact that the transition--occurred \nwithout a shot being fired at least in recent times.\n  I think it would be in all of our interests to get a peaceful, \nbloodless transfer of power in Cuba and to figure out ways in which \nthat could be advanced.\n  Certainly, I think we could have serious and negative implications on \nour Federal courts. I mentioned this at the outset of my remarks, but I \nwant to spend some time on it because this is a critical piece of this \nbill.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues, or their staffs who may be listening, to \nlook at these sections and understand the implications, because I think \nthey could have profound results if we are not careful. It could have \nimplications on some of our closest trading partners and run the risk \nof subjecting our country to reciprocal kinds of actions in the coming \nyears.\n  I happen to believe it is imperative that our colleagues have a \nbetter understanding of the true impact of the legislation on the \nconduct of U.S. foreign policy and on international trade and commerce. \nClearly, I think additional hearings and committee consideration of the \nbill would be the best way to achieve that outcome. That is, \napparently, not going to happen.\n  I have to hand it to the authors of the legislation. They have \ntinkered with the language in this bill in an effort to conceal and \nobscure some of its fundamental problems. Unfortunately, none of the \nchanges remove the inherent flaws.\n  The Helms-Dole substitute is 40 pages in length. It has gone through \nsignificant changes since being first introduced back in February. As I \nmentioned earlier, no hearings have been held in the Senate on later \nversions of the bill, including the one before us. Again, I doubt that \nis going to occur. My colleagues ought to look carefully at the bill \nand analyze what is in it.\n  This legislation breaks significant new legal ground in reversing \nmore than 40 years of international and domestic law in the practice \nand treatment of confiscated property. Nor, I point out, is there \nuniversal support for the bill among those whose property was \nexpropriated.\n  I hope my colleagues will pay attention to this. This is important. \nSome of the very individuals who have the most interest in this \nlegislation--the certified American claimants--have gone on record in \nopposition, Mr. President, to the centerpiece of this legislation.\n  David Wallace, chairman and chief executive officer of Lone Star \nIndustries, one of the major corporate claimants in Cuba, has made it \nclear where he stands on the central provisions of this bill. He is \nopposed to them, Mr. President. Let me state for the record that Mr. \nWallace is a resident of my State of Connecticut and the headquarters \nof Lone Star is located in Stamford, CT.\n  Mr. Wallace speaks not only for Lone Star, but for a number of other \nimportant claimants, who are members of the Joint Corporate Committee \non Cuban Claims, which he chairs. That organization represents 30 of \nthe major corporate claimants holding more than half of the total value \nof certified claims.\n  He has written to me and other Members several times on this issue, \nmost recently on October 10. He raised some very critical issues that I \nwant to bring to the attention of my colleagues.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have his letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Joint Corporate Committee\n\n\n                                              on Cuban Claims,\n\n                                   Stamford, CT, October 10, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: I recently wrote to urge you to oppose Title \n     III of legislation, the ``Cuban Liberty and Democratic \n     Solidarity Act,'' that purports to protect the property \n     rights of U.S. nationals against the confiscatory takings by \n     the Castro regime. At that \n\n[[Page S 15010]]\n     time, Senator Helms was planning to attach this legislation as an \n     amendment to the then-pending Foreign Operations \n     Appropriations Bill. It is my understanding that this \n     legislation now may be brought to the Senate floor as a free-\n     standing bill as early as Wednesday of this week. I am \n     writing once again to urge you to oppose this legislation \n     insofar as it contains Title III in its present form because \n     it poses the most serious threat to the property rights of \n     U.S. certified claimants since the Castro regime's unlawful \n     expropriations more than three decades ago.\n       In the rush to pass this legislation and thereby \n     demonstrate our firm resolve against Fidel Castro, the far-\n     reaching domestic consequences of this legislation have \n     received far too little attention. In my letter of September \n     20th, I wrote of the irreparable harm certified claimants \n     would suffer if Title III of this legislation is passed. For \n     the first time ever and contrary to international law, this \n     legislation would permit a specified national origin group, \n     Cuban-Americans, who were not U.S. citizens at the time their \n     property was confiscated, to file Title III lawsuits against \n     the Government of Cuba for the property losses they suffered \n     as Cuban nationals. Indeed, this legislation even permits \n     Cuban exiles abroad to file lawsuits in U.S. federal courts \n     if they establish a corporation in the United States for the \n     purpose of pursuing any claim they may have against Cuba. The \n     creation of a new right to sue is never an inconsequential \n     matter yet the careful scrutiny such a provision deserves has \n     been disturbingly lacking to date.\n       We can reasonably expect plaintiffs' attorneys to exploit \n     this newly created lawsuit right to the fullest extent \n     possible, creating a tide of litigation that will all but \n     sweep away the value of the claims currently held by U.S. \n     certified claimants. Each time one of those lawsuits is \n     reduced to a final judgment against Cuba, the injury to U.S. \n     certified claimants increases. Ultimately, the cumulative \n     weight of those judgments will extinguish any possibility the \n     certified claimants ever had of being compensated. A \n     virtually bankrupt Cuba cannot be expected to compensate the \n     U.S. certified claimants, who hold claims valued today at \n     nearly $6 billion, when it is also facing the prospect of \n     satisfying potentially tens of billions of dollars in federal \n     court judgments held by Cuban-Americans, whose claims have \n     been valued as high as $94 billion.\n       Our already overburdened federal courts will have to deal \n     with the daunting task of adjudicating some 300,000 to \n     430,000 lawsuits, according to one estimate that has never \n     been refuted. (And that does not even take into account the \n     number of additional claims that we can anticipate will be \n     brought on equal protection grounds by Vietnamese-Americans, \n     Polish-Americans, Chinese-Americans and other national origin \n     groups.) Indeed, a litigation explosion appears to be exactly \n     what the bill's sponsors intend: They hope to enlist an army \n     of lawyers to launch a barrage of federal court lawsuits \n     against Cuba in order to hopelessly entangle the island in \n     lawsuits. In so doing, title to property in Cuba will be \n     clouded for years to come, thus ensuring that every effort at \n     privatization or market-oriented economic reform will be \n     doomed to failure. In a classic case of overkill, however, \n     this endless litigation will not only encumber the current \n     regime, but will impose an onerous burden on a future \n     democratic government that will make normalization of \n     relations with the United States virtually impossible.\n       Faced with this prospect, the president, as an exercise of \n     executive prerogative in the conduct of foreign affairs, may \n     elect to dismiss those federal court judgments pending \n     against a friendly government in Cuba. However, dismissing \n     those lawsuits may not turn out to be such a simple matter \n     because the U.S. Government may very well find itself liable \n     for tens of billions of dollars in property takings claims to \n     this large class of citizens who were non-U.S. nationals at \n     the time they lost properties in Cuba. In short, if Title III \n     is enacted, we will be left either with the prospect of \n     protracted litigation against Cuba, which will indefinitely \n     delay normalization of relations with a post-Castro Cuban \n     government, or enormous liability to possibly hundreds of \n     thousands of Cuban-Americans should those federal court \n     judgments be dismissed as an incident of normalization.\n       Amazingly, the Senate is poised to vote on this legislation \n     without the benefit of the Judiciary Committee's views on \n     these and other critical issues that fall within its purview. \n     The Judiciary Committee has held no hearings on Title III, \n     has not reviewed it, nor has it, or the Foreign Relations \n     Committee for that matter, issued any reports on it. It is \n     astonishing that we may be so casually headed toward putting \n     our government, and ultimately U.S. taxpayers, on the line \n     for tens of billions of dollars worth of Cuban-American \n     claims in a foreign land. The only conclusion that can be \n     drawn is that this legislation is being rushed to a vote \n     before these serious issues can be thoroughly considered by \n     the Senate through its normal procedures. Given the profound \n     domestic implications of this legislation beyond the obvious \n     and immediate injury to U.S. certified claimants, I urge you \n     to oppose Title III of this legislation if for no other \n     reason than to ensure that these concerns receive the careful \n     deliberation they warrant.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 David W. Wallace,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me quote, if I can here, part of what he \nsays in this letter:\n\n       Amazingly, the Senate is poised to vote on this legislation \n     without the benefit of the Judiciary Committee's views on \n     these and other critical issues that fall within its purview. \n     The Judiciary Committee has held no hearings of Title III, \n     has not reviewed it, nor has it, or the Foreign Relations \n     Committee for that matter, issued any reports on it. It is \n     astonishing that we may be so casually headed toward putting \n     our government, and ultimately U.S. taxpayers, on the line \n     for tens of billions of dollars worth of Cuban-American \n     claims in a foreign land. The only conclusion that can be \n     drawn is that this legislation is being rushed to a vote \n     before these serious issues can be thoroughly considered by \n     the Senate through its normal procedures. Given the profound \n     domestic implications of this legislation beyond the obvious \n     and immediate injury to U.S. certified claimants, I urge you \n     to oppose Title III of this legislation if for no other \n     reason than to ensure that these concerns receive the careful \n     deliberation they warrant.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a letter from a claimant. This is one of the \npeople who was injured by what happened, seriously, when the Castro \nGovernment took over. Do not believe me; listen to them. They are the \nones urging that some prudence be followed before we rush to judgment \nwith this bill in order to satisfy the domestic concerns of some \nconstituency groups, who, I might add, I do not think are necessarily \nall being represented when they are spoken of collectively.\n  I agree with Mr. Wallace when he concludes that ``We can reasonably \nexpect plaintiffs' attorneys to exploit this newly created lawsuit \nright to the fullest extent possible, creating a tide of litigation \nthat will all but sweep away the value of the claims currently held by \nthe certified claimants.''\n  Mr. Wallace also submitted detailed written testimony to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations in which he explained the joint \ncommittee's opposition to this bill. These are the U.S. citizens that \nare the injured parties. They are the ones telling us that this bill is \nwrong and will cause real problems. We ought to be listening to them.\n  Among the arguments I found most compelling was that this legislation \nwould produce a dramatic expansion of existing claims pool seeking \ncompensation from Cuba. The vastly larger pool ``would serve as a \nsignificant disincentive for a post-Castro Cuban Government to enter \ninto meaningful settlements of negotiations with the United States, \ngiven the sheer enormity of the outstanding claims and the practical \nimpossibility of satisfying all those claims.''\n  Mr. Wallace goes on to state that ``We, the joint committee, believe \nthat a second tier of claimants will delay and complicate the \nsettlement of certified claims and may undermine the prospects for \nserious settlement negotiations with the new Cuban Government that will \ncome into power at some point.''\n  He concluded as follows: ``It is our view, based upon well-\nestablished principles of international law, that individuals and \nentities who were Cuban nationals at the time their property was \nconfiscated must seek resolution of their claims in Cuban courts, under \nCuban law.''\n  Obviously, that is not going to happen now, Mr. President. We are \ntalking about this taking effect when there is a transition government \nin place--hopefully and ideally, one that will respond. But Cuban \nnationals can then go back to that court in Cuba and satisfy them. To \nallow it, all of a sudden, to come to our courts raises very serious \nproblems. In future Cuban governments, claims of former Cuban nationals \nmay be fairly determined.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to take the time to review Mr. \nWallace's correspondence and statement in their entirety. Taken \ntogether, they provide a very careful, reasoned analysis of why giving \nformer Cuban nationals the private right of action to sue in United \nStates courts will be detrimental to the interests of United States \nclaimants.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent Mr. President at this juncture to have \nprinted in the Record all of the correspondence and testimony from Mr. \nWallace which he has sent to most offices, but for those who may not \nhave seen them.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n \n[[Page S 15011]]\n\n                                         Joint Corporate Committee\n\n\n                                              on Cuban Claims,\n\n                                   Stamford, CT, October 10, 1995.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: I recently wrote to urge you to oppose \n     Title III of legislation, the ``Cuban Liberty and Democratic \n     Solidarity Act,'' that purports to protect the property \n     rights of U.S. nationals against the confiscatory takings by \n     the Castro regime. At that time, Senator Helms was planning \n     to attach this legislation as an amendment to the then-\n     pending Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill. It is my \n     understanding that this legislation now may be brought to the \n     Senate floor as a free-standing bill as early as Wednesday of \n     this week. I am writing once again to urge you to oppose this \n     legislation insofar as it contains Title III in its present \n     form because it poses the most serious threat to the property \n     rights of U.S. certified claimants since the Castro regime's \n     unlawful expropriations more than three decades ago.\n       In the rush to pass this legislation and thereby \n     demonstrate our firm resolve against Fidel Castro, the far-\n     reaching domestic consequences of this legislation have \n     received far too little attention. In my letter of September \n     20th, I wrote of the irreparable harm certified claimants \n     would suffer if Title III of this legislation is passed. For \n     the first time ever and contrary to international law, this \n     legislation would permit a specified national origin group, \n     Cuban-Americans, who were not U.S. citizens at the time their \n     property was confiscated, to file Title III lawsuits against \n     the Government of Cuba for the property losses they suffered \n     as Cuban nationals. Indeed, this legislation even permits \n     Cuban exiles abroad to file lawsuits in U.S. federal courts \n     if they establish a corporation in the United States for the \n     purpose of pursuing any claim they may have against Cuba. The \n     creation of a new right to sue is never an inconsequential \n     matter yet the careful scrutiny such a provision deserves has \n     been disturbingly lacking to date.\n       We can reasonably expect plaintiffs' attorneys to exploit \n     this newly created lawsuit right to the fullest extent \n     possible, creating a tide of litigation that will all but \n     sweep away the value of the claims currently held by U.S. \n     certified claimants. Each time one of those lawsuits is \n     reduced to a final judgment against Cuba, the injury to U.S. \n     certified claimants increases. Ultimately, the cumulative \n     weight of those judgments will extinguish any possibility the \n     certified claimants ever had of being compensated. A \n     virtually bankrupt Cuba cannot be expected to compensate the \n     U.S. certified claimants, who hold claims valued today at \n     nearly $6 billion, when it is also facing the prospect of \n     satisfying potentially tens of billions of dollars in federal \n     court judgments held by Cuban-Americans, whose claims have \n     been valued as high as $94 billion.\n       Our already overburdened federal courts will have to deal \n     with the daunting task of adjudicating some 300,000 to \n     430,000 lawsuits, according to one estimate that has never \n     been refuted. (And that does not even take into account the \n     number of additional claims that we can anticipate will be \n     brought on equal protection grounds by Vietnamese-Americans, \n     Polish-Americans, Chinese-Americans and other national origin \n     groups.) Indeed, a litigation explosion appears to be exactly \n     what the bill's sponsors intend: They hope to enlist an army \n     of lawyers to launch a barrage of federal court lawsuits \n     against Cuba in order to hopelessly entangle the island in \n     lawsuits. In so doing, title to property in Cuba will be \n     clouded for years to come, thus ensuring that every effort at \n     privatization or market-oriented economic reform will be \n     doomed to failure. In a classic case of overkill, however, \n     this endless litigation will not only encumber the current \n     regime, but will impose an onerous burden on a future \n     democratic government that will make normalization of \n     relations with the United States virtually impossible.\n       Faced with this prospect, the president, as an exercise of \n     executive prerogative in the conduct of foreign affairs, may \n     elect to dismiss those federal court judgments pending \n     against a friendly government in Cuba. However, dismissing \n     those lawsuits may not turn out to be such a simple matter \n     because the U.S. Government may very well find itself liable \n     for tens of billions of dollars in property takings claims to \n     this large class of citizens who were non-U.S. nationals at \n     the time they lost properties in Cuba. In short, if Title III \n     is enacted, we will be left either with the prospect of \n     protracted litigation against Cuba, which will indefinitely \n     delay normalization of relations with a post-Castro Cuban \n     government, or enormous liability to possibly hundreds of \n     thousands of Cuban-Americans should those federal court \n     judgments be dismissed as an incident of normalization.\n       Amazingly, the Senate is poised to vote on this legislation \n     without the benefit of the Judiciary Committee's views on \n     these and other critical issues that fall within its purview. \n     The Judiciary Committee has held no hearings on Title III, \n     has not reviewed it, nor has it, or the Foreign Relations \n     Committee for that matter, issued any reports on it. It is \n     astonishing that we may be so casually headed toward putting \n     our government, and ultimately U.S. taxpayers, on the line \n     for tens of billions of dollars worth of Cuban-American \n     claims in a foreign land. The only conclusion that can be \n     drawn is that this legislation is being rushed to a vote \n     before these serious issues can be thoroughly considered by \n     the Senate through its normal procedures. Given the profound \n     domestic implications of this legislation beyond the obvious \n     and immediate injury to U.S. certified claimants, I urge you \n     to oppose Title III of this legislation if for no other \n     reason than to ensure that these concerns receive the careful \n     deliberation they warrant.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 David W. Wallace,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                   Lone Star Industries, Inc.,\n\n                                      Stamford, CT, July 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: On behalf of the Joint Corporate \n     Committee on Cuban Claims, of which I serve as Chairman, and \n     as your constituent, I am writing to express my appreciation \n     for your support on the property claims issue. In particular, \n     I want to commend you for your thoughtful views on S. 381, \n     the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, and to offer \n     the assistance of the Committee as this legislation is \n     considered by the Senate.\n       The Joint Corporate Committee represents more than thirty \n     U.S. corporations with certified claims against the \n     Government of Cuba. Collectively, our members hold more than \n     one-half of the $1.6 billion in outstanding certified \n     corporate claims. As you know, the Joint Corporate Committee \n     opposes the provisions of the Helms legislation dealing with \n     property claims, and we have detailed our objections in \n     testimony we submitted for the record to the Foreign \n     Relations Committee.\n       We understand that Senator Helms is contemplating a \n     strategy of attaching his legislation to the State Department \n     Authorization Bill or the Foreign Aid Bill that will be \n     before the Senate shortly. Please know that we stand ready to \n     support your efforts in opposing this legislation, and have \n     asked the Committee's Washington, D.C. counsel, Kirk \n     O'Donnell of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, to work with \n     you in that regard.\n       I also have asked our counsel to arrange a meeting with you \n     in the near future in order that we might further explore how \n     our Committee can best be of assistance in this effort. I \n     look forward to meeting you and working with you on a more \n     constructive legislative approach.\n           Sincerely,\n     David W. Wallace.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Statement of David W. Wallace, Chairman Joint Corporate Committee on \nCuban Claims on S. 381, the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act \nof 1995--Submitted to the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere and Peace \n Corps Affairs, the Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate--June \n                                14, 1995\n\n       Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, I appreciate \n     the opportunity to submit this statement expressing the views \n     of the Joint Corporate Committee on Cuban Claims with respect \n     to S. 381, the ``Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity \n     (LIBERTAD) Act of 1995.''\n       The Joint Corporate Committee on Cuban Claims, of which I \n     serve as Chairman, represents more than thirty U.S. \n     corporations with certified claims against the Government of \n     Cuba stemming from the Castro regime's unlawful confiscation \n     of U.S. property without just compensation. Our member \n     corporations hold more than one-half of the $1.6 billion in \n     outstanding certified corporate claims. Since its formation \n     in 1975, the Committee has vigorously supported the \n     proposition that before our government takes any steps to \n     resume normal trade and diplomatic relations with Cuba, the \n     Government of Cuba must provide adequate compensation for the \n     U.S. properties it unlawfully seized.\n       Although I am submitting this statement in my capacity as \n     Chairman of the Joint Corporate Committee, I would like to \n     note parenthetically that I also serve as Chairman and Chief \n     Executive Officer of Lone Star Industries, Inc. Lone Star is \n     a certified claim holder whose cement plant at Mariel was \n     seized by the Cuban Government in 1960. Lone Star's claim is \n     valued at $24.9 million plus 6% interest since the date of \n     seizure.\n       On behalf of our Committee, I want to commend the \n     significant contribution you have made to the debate on U.S.-\n     Cuban policy by focusing renewed attention on the Castro \n     regime's unlawful expropriation of U.S. property--an issue \n     that all too often gets lost in the debate over the wisdom of \n     the embargo policy. Recognizing the important role that trade \n     and investment by U.S. businesses will have in Cuba's \n     economic reconstruction and its eventual return to the \n     international community, evidence of concrete steps by the \n     Government of Cuba towards the satisfactory resolution of the \n     property clams issue must be an essential condition for the \n     resumption of economic and diplomatic ties between our \n     nations.\n       I think it is important to recall the essential reason for \n     which the U.S. Government first imposed a partial trade \n     embargo against Cuba in 1960, following by the suspension of \n     diplomatic relations in 1961 and the imposition of a total \n     trade embargo in 1962. These actions were taken in direct \n     response to the Castro regime's expropriation of properties \n     held by American citizens and companies without payment of \n     prompt, adequate and effective compensation as required under \n     U.S. and international law. This illegal confiscation of \n     private assets was the \n\n[[Page S 15012]]\n     largest uncompensated taking of American property in the history of our \n     country, affecting scores of individual companies and \n     investors in Cuban enterprises.\n       These citizens and companies whose property was confiscated \n     have a legal right recognized in long-established \n     international law to receive adequate compensation or the \n     return of their property. Indeed, Cuba's Constitution of 1940 \n     and even the decrees issued by the Castro regime since it \n     came to power in 1959 recognized the principle of \n     compensation for confiscated properties. Pursuant to Title V \n     of the International Claims Settlement Act, the claims of \n     U.S. citizens and corporations against the Cuban Government \n     have been adjudicated and certified by the Foreign Claims \n     Settlement Commission of the United States. Yet to this day, \n     these certified claims remain unsatisfied.\n       It is our position that lifting the embargo prior to \n     resolution of the claims issue would be unwise of a matter of \n     policy and damaging to our settlement negotiations posture. \n     First, it would set a bad precedent by signaling a \n     willingness on the part of our nations to tolerate Cuba's \n     failure to abide by precepts of international law. Other \n     foreign nations, consequently, may draw the conclusion that \n     unlawful seizures of property can occur without consequence, \n     thereby leading to future unlawful confiscations of American \n     properties without compensation. Second, lifting the embargo \n     would remove the best leverage we have in compelling the \n     Cuban Government to address the claims of U.S. nationals and \n     would place our negotiators at a terrible disadvantage in \n     seeking just compensation and restitution. We depend on our \n     government to protect the rights of its citizens when they \n     are harmed by the unlawful actions of a foreign agent. The \n     Joint Corporate Committee greatly appreciates the steadfast \n     support our State Department has provided over the years on \n     the claims issue. However, we recognize that the powerful \n     tool of sanctions will be crucial to the Department's ability \n     ultimately to effect a just resolution of this issue.\n       Apart from the need to redress the legitimate grievances of \n     U.S. claimants, we also should not overlook the contribution \n     these citizens and companies made to the economy of pre-\n     revolutionary Cuba, helping to make it one of the top ranking \n     Latin American countries in terms of living standards and \n     economic growth. Many of these companies and individuals look \n     forward to returning to Cuba to work with its people to help \n     rebuild the nation and invest in its future. As was the case \n     in pre-revolutionary Cuba, the ability of the Cuban \n     Government to attract foreign investment once again will be \n     the key to the success of any national policy of economic \n     revitalization.\n       However, unless and until potential investors can be \n     assured of their right to own property free from the threat \n     of confiscation without compensation, many U.S. companies \n     simply will not be willing to take the risk of doing business \n     with Cuba. It is only by fairly and reasonably addressing the \n     claims issue that the Cuban Government can demonstrate to the \n     satisfaction of the business community its recognition of and \n     respect for property rights.\n       We are pleased that S. 381 does not waver from the core \n     principle, firmly embodied in U.S. law, which requires the \n     adequate resolution of the certified claims before trade and \n     diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuban Governments \n     are normalized. However, we are concerned with provisions of \n     Section 207 of the revised bill that condition the resumption \n     of U.S. assistance to Cuba on the adoption of steps leading \n     to the satisfaction of claims of both the certified claimants \n     and Cuan-American citizens who were not U.S. nationals at the \n     time their property was confiscated. Notwithstanding the \n     modifying provisions which accord priority to the settlement \n     of the certified claims and give the President authority to \n     resume aid upon a showing that the Cuban Government has taken \n     sufficient steps to satisfy the certified claims, this \n     dramatic expansion of the claimant pool, as a practical \n     matter, would necessarily impinge upon the property interests \n     of the certified claimants.\n       Even though the claimants who were not U.S. nationals at \n     the time of the property loss would not enjoy the espousal \n     rights that the certified claimants enjoy, the recognition of \n     a second tier of claimants by the U.S. Government at a \n     minimum would necessarily color, and likely make more \n     complicated, any settlement negotiations with Cuba to the \n     detriment of the certified claimants.\n       Moreover, the fact that the legislation gives priority for \n     the settlement of certified property claims is of little \n     consequence within the context of such a vastly expanded pool \n     of claimants that seemingly defies a prompt, adequate and \n     effective settlement of claims. In addition, once this second \n     tier of claimants is recognized, it would be exceedingly \n     difficult politically for the President to exercise his \n     waiver authority. Finally, this dramatic expansion of the \n     claimant pool would serve as a significant disincentive for a \n     port-Castro Cuban Government to enter into meaningful \n     settlement negotiations with the United States given the \n     sheer enormity of the outstanding claims and the practical \n     impossibility of satisfying all those claims.\n       In short, while we are sympathetic to the position of those \n     individuals and entities who were not U.S. nationals at the \n     time their property was seized, we believe that U.S. \n     Government recognition and representation of this group of \n     claimants--even falling short of espousal of their claims \n     with a post-Castro government in Cuba--would harm the \n     interests of the already certified claimants. We believe that \n     the recognition of a second tier of claimants will delay and \n     complicate the settlement of certified claims, and may \n     undermine the prospects for serious settlement negotiations \n     with the Cuban Government.\n       It is our view, based on well-established principles of \n     international law, that individuals and entities who were \n     Cuban nationals at the time their property was confiscated \n     must seek resolution of their claims in Cuban courts under \n     Cuban law under a future Cuban Government whereby the \n     respective property rights of former and current Cuban \n     nationals may be fairly determined. In taking that position, \n     we categorically reject any notion that a naturalized \n     American has any lesser degree of right than a native-born \n     American. That objectionale and irrelevant notion serves only \n     to cloud the real issue here, and that is simply the question \n     of what rights are pertinent to a non-national as of the date \n     of injury. Simply put, international law does not confer \n     retroactive rights upon naturalized citizens.\n       Many of the same objections noted above also apply to \n     Section 302 of the revised bill, which allows U.S. nationals, \n     including hundreds of thousands of naturalized Cuban-\n     Americans, to file suit in U.S. courts against persons or \n     entities that traffic in expropriated property. We believe \n     this unrestricted provision also will adversely affect the \n     rights of certified claimants. By effectively moving claims \n     settlement out of the venture of the Foreign Claims \n     Settlement Commission and into the federal judiciary, this \n     provision can be expected to invite hundreds of thousands of \n     commercial and residential property lawsuits. Apart from the \n     enormous, if not overwhelming, burden these lawsuits will \n     place on our courts, this provision raises serious \n     implications with respect to the Cuban Government's ability \n     to satisfy certified claims.\n       First, allowing Cuba to become liable by way of federal \n     court judgments for monetary damages on a non-dismissible \n     basis necessarily will reduce whatever monetary means Cuba \n     might have to satisfy the certified claims. Second, this \n     expected multiplicity of lawsuits undoubtedly will cloud \n     title to property in Cuba for years, thereby lessening the \n     prospects for restitutionary approaches in satisfaction of \n     some of these claims. Moreover, under this provision, the \n     President would have no power to dismiss these suits as an \n     incident of normalizing relations with a democratically \n     elected government in Cuba once they are commenced. \n     Consequently, the foreign investment will be crucial to \n     Cuba's successful implementation of market-oriented reforms \n     will be all but precluded by these unresolved legal \n     proceedings.\n       In conclusion, we want to commend you for your efforts in \n     raising the profile of the property claims issue and focusing \n     attention on the importance of resolving these claims to the \n     full restoration of democracy and free enterprise in Cuba. We \n     also recognize and appreciate the efforts you have made to \n     modify this legislation in response to the concerns expressed \n     by the certified claimant community; however, we hope that \n     you will further consider our continuing concerns regarding \n     the implications of this legislation for the legal rights of \n     certified claimants, an already overburdened court system, \n     the claims settlement process and the orderly disposition of \n     claims, and the post-Castro investment environment.\n\n  Mr. DODD. This legislation calls into question the fundamental \nconcept, I might point out, of equal protection under our Constitution \nby granting a kind of judicial relief to one category of individuals \nthat no other group has ever been granted.\n  This legislation is not proposed to give similar rights, as I pointed \nout earlier, to the former nationals--now U.S. citizens--of 37 other \ncountries in the world where there are outstanding claims: Polish-\nAmericans, Chinese-Americans, German-Americans, Vietnamese-Americans.\n  Are we to say to these same people who have been injured by Marxist \ngovernments, Communist governments, who have had their property taken \nwithout compensation, ``Sorry, this law does not apply to you. It only \napplies to Cuban-Americans.'' I think we will have a hard time making \nthat case to other people who come forward and seek equal treatment.\n  I urge my colleagues to just examine whether or not the enormity of \nthat problem can be handled by our court systems. Is that the right way \nto go?\n  This legislation would vastly expand the traditional definition of \nwho is a United States claimant for purposes of United States law, to \ninclude any Cuban national who is presently a United States citizen, \nregardless of the citizenship at the time of the expropriation, as well \nas any person who incorporates himself or herself as a business entity \nunder United States law prior to this bill becoming law. \n\n[[Page S 15013]]\n\n  The introduction of this legislation has served as an open invitation \nto Cuban-Americans and other foreign nationals around the globe who may \nhave had property taken in Cuba to come to the United States to seek \nredress. I am not arguing about the illegitimacy of it, the horror of \nit, the wrongness of it at all. That is not my point. That is not the \nissue here.\n  If Cubans have left Cuba and gone someplace else, this bill says to \nthem, ``come here and incorporate yourself before this bill is signed \ninto law and you have access to the United States courts.''\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to look at this bill. Whatever your \nfeelings are about Fidel Castro and Cuba, you are about to sign on to \nsomething here that could have profound and incredible implications for \nour court system.\n  It is not clear, Mr. President, how the courts are going to attest to \nthe validity of such claims, nor do we have any firm estimate of the \ncosts associated with the legal mandate.\n  Initially, CBO concluded that it does not have ``sufficient \ninformation for estimating the number of such filings and the total \ncost that would be incurred by the Judiciary,'' although it did \nindicate that the costs to the U.S. Federal court system per case filed \nwould be $4,500.\n  Now assuming the 5,911 claims that are filed, between $4,500 and \n$5,000 a claim, if, in fact, you expand the universe here, consider the \nimplications. The math is not that hard if you are going to have \nseveral hundred thousand people seeking access to these courts.\n  Now, I point out to my colleagues that CBO later reversed its earlier \nconclusion that they could not determine how much the costs would be. \nThey came back and said the costs may be $7 million.\n  The key assumption CBO made, Mr. President, in arriving at this \nnumber was that very few suits would be filed at all. That assumption \nhas been challenged, I might add, by a number of experts on the issue.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Pell, and I wrote to the \nCongressional Budget Office raising questions about this estimate as \nwell. And, Mr. President, I point out we have not had any response to \nour latest inquiries, going back some time, about a new estimate.\n  One should be mindful, Mr. President, of the fact that an estimated 1 \nmillion Cuban emigres currently live in the United States, many of whom \nleft behind business and other property when they fled the Castro \nregime, and has been expropriated without compensation.\n  The State Department has estimated there are approximately $94 \nbillion in outstanding Cuban-American claims. That is in addition to \nthe $6 billion in certified United States claims. A very detailed \nanalysis has been done to give some rough estimates as to the number of \nclaims that may be outstanding if this bill becomes law.\n  I urge my colleagues to review the August 25 letter sent to the \nDirector of CBO by attorney Robert Muse, an attorney for one of the \nmajor U.S. certified claimants. In that letter he sets forth in some \ndetail the various categories of property claims that could be \ngenerated, and estimates that the total number of lawsuits could reach \n430,000. The costs could end up--just the court costs--in excess of $2 \nbillion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that those documents be printed in the Record \nat this juncture.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Mansfield & Muse,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 25, 1995.\n     Ms. June E. O'Neill,\n     Director, Congressional Budget Office, U.S. Congress, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Re CBO Letter of July 31, 1995 Concerning Senator Helms' \n         Proposed ``Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity \n         (LIBERTAD) Act of 1995.''\n       Dear Ms. O'Neill: As you know, Title III of Senator Helm's \n     proposed legislation creates a cause of action in U.S. \n     federal courts against agencies or instrumentalities of \n     Cuba--as well as foreign and Cuban individuals or companies--\n     that in the words of the bill ``traffic'' in properties \n     ``confiscated'' by the government of Cuba. It makes no \n     difference under Title III whether the owners of those \n     properties were U.S. or Cuban nationals at the time of their \n     property losses. So long as the potential litigant is a U.S. \n     citizen at date of filing, he or she (or ``it'' in the case \n     of a company) is free to institute a Title III lawsuit \n     asserting, in the language of the statute, ownership or a \n     ``claim'' to property confiscated in Cuba at any time after \n     January 1, 1959. With these things in mind, CBO was asked how \n     many such lawsuits might be expected if the LIBERTAD bill is \n     enacted? It is the response to that question, given in your \n     July 31 letter to Senator Helms, which concerns my client, \n     Amstar Property Rights Holdings, Inc., and other holders of \n     claims certified against Cuba by the Foreign Claims \n     Settlement Commission.\n       In your first letter (of July 24) on this subject, written \n     to Chairman Gilman of the House International Relations \n     Committee, you said with respect to Title III that, in \n     addition to nearly 6,000 claims on file with the Foreign \n     Claims Settlement Commission, ``. . . about 15,000 U.S. \n     nationals who have not filed claims with the Commission [i.e. \n     the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission] may also have had \n     commercial property confiscated in Cuba.'' I gather from \n     talking with Ms. Susanne Mehlman of your Office that the \n     figure of 15,000 ``who have not filed claims'' was meant to \n     describe naturalized Cuban Americans and Cuban companies that \n     did not qualify to file claims with the Commission in the \n     1960's (because they were not U.S. citizens when their \n     properties were taken), but, that your Office thought would \n     qualify to file lawsuits with respect to those properties if \n     Title III of the LIBERTAD bill is enacted.\n       In your July 31 letter to Senator Helms you refrain from \n     stating any figure as to the number of Cuban Americans that \n     may be expected to file Title III lawsuits. However, based \n     upon a recent revision to the LIBERTAD bill restricting \n     lawsuits to those in which the ``amount in controversy'' \n     exceeds $50,000, you offer the opinion that, ``. . . the \n     number of [Cuban American] claims would be quite small.''\n       The number of potential Title III litigants is a matter of \n     understandable concern to individuals and companies, such as \n     my client, that hold certified claims against Cuba. The \n     prospects of these claimants receiving a favorable \n     disposition of their long-held claims are very much dependent \n     upon those claims not being diluted in a sea of newly-created \n     Title III causes of action conferred on companies and \n     individuals that did not meet the U.S. nationality \n     requirement of the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission's \n     Cuba program.\\1\\ The reasoning of the certified claimants in \n     opposing Title III of the LIBERTAD bill is straightforward. \n     Each federal court judgment entered against Cuba on behalf of \n     a Cuban national at date of property loss constitutes an \n     additional claim on the limited resources of that country, \n     thereby diluting the value of those claims certified by the \n     Foreign Claims Settlement Commission.\\2\\ It is blindingly \n     obvious what Title III is meant to do, that is, to bypass the \n     adjudicatory process of the Foreign Claims Settlement \n     Commission--that Cuban Americans did not qualify for on \n     prerequisite citizenship grounds--and create an unprecedented \n     claims program in the federal courts on behalf of that \n     specific national-origin group.\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       With the foregoing concerns of certified claimants in mind, \n     I offer the following observations: First, I believe that \n     your July 24 letter's figure of a maximum of 15,000 lawsuits \n     to be expected from Cuban American individuals and companies \n     if the LIBERTAD bill is enacted constitutes a serious \n     understatement of the real number of such lawsuits. Second, \n     your Office's subsequent failure to provide any estimate of \n     potential lawsuits in your July 31 letter--except to say that \n     the number will be ``quite small''--warrants, I respectfully \n     submit, at least some explanation. Third, your descriptions \n     of Title III as only creating a right for U.S. nationals to \n     ``take civil action against persons or companies that traffic \n     in confiscated properties,'' obscures a key provision of the \n     LIBERTAD bill; that is, that it allows direct suits against \n     the nation of Cuba itself--via its various agencies and \n     instrumentalities--for ``trafficking'' in confiscated \n     property.\\3\\ Certain proponents of the LIBERTAD bill have \n     created the entirely misleading impression that it is aimed \n     only at what they describe as ``third party [i.e. corporate] \n     ``traffickers,'' and, because there are comparatively few \n     such corporate ``traffickers'', few lawsuits are to be \n     expected if Title III is enacted. Unfortunately, I believe \n     you have fallen into their trap by excluding from \n     consideration in your estimate of potential lawsuits what \n     will be the overwhelmingly most frequently named defendant--\n     Cuba itself.\\4\\ Fourth, the newly-added $50,000 ``amount in \n     controversy'' requirement of Title III will not greatly \n     restrict Section 302 lawsuits, as your letter suggests it \n     will.\n       To elaborate on my last point first, the figure of $50,000 \n     in controversy requirement of Title III relates to the value \n     of the property that is being ``trafficked'' in; e.g., that \n     is being, among other things, ``used . . . or profited from . \n     . .'' Under Title III each trafficker must pay, in damages, \n     the ``fair market value'' of the property being trafficked in \n     to anyone who ``owns a claim'' to that property. (See, \n     Section 302(a)(i)). A property--as will be demonstrated in a \n     moment--that was worth as little as $3,500 in 1960 will today \n     meet the bill's requirement of $50,000 in controversy. This \n     is the case because, in calculating whether a given property \n     has a value of $50,000 or more for the purposes of Title III, \n     the following things are included: (1) Interest is added from \n     the time of property loss and compounded annually. (See, \n\n[[Page S 15014]]\n     Section 302(a)(1)(B)). If only 6% interest is applied to Title III \n     court judgments (as was the case in Foreign Claims Settlement \n     Commission decisions relating to Cuba) the compounded \n     interest component alone, over a period of 35 years, \n     increases the value of the property by 500%. Therefore a \n     property with a value of $3,500 in 1960 equals an ``amount in \n     controversy'' of $17,500 today. (2) Title III allows for the \n     virtually automatic trebling of the value of any previously \n     determined ``sum'' (to reiterate, interest is specifically \n     included in determining the ``sum'' to be trebled). For such \n     trebling to occur Section 302(a)(3) merely requires that a \n     ``trafficker'' be given notice twice of an ``intention to \n     institute suit'' before that trafficker becomes liable for \n     ``triple the amount determined'' under 302(a)(ii). In filing \n     suit a plaintiff will allege in his complaint that requisite \n     notices were given and ignored and, therefore, that the \n     amount of damages sought (i.e. the ``amount in controversy'') \n     is the value of the property trebled. All of this means that \n     a property with a 1960 value of $3,500 has, with compounded \n     annual interest at 6%, become worth $17,500; when that figure \n     is trebled it becomes $52,500 and comfortably meets Section \n     302(b)'s requirement of a ``matter in controversy [that] \n     exceeds the sum or value of $50,000.'' \\5\\\n       To return to the issue of the actual number of lawsuits the \n     LIBERTAD bill is likely to engender if it becomes law, a \n     Department of the Army publication reports that some 800,000 \n     Cubans settled in the United States between January 1, 1959 \n     and September 30, 1980. (See, ``Cuba, A Country Study'' \n     (1985) at pg. 69-70, citing a National Research Council \n     study). If we assume that a further 10,000-12,000 Cubans have \n     entered the U.S. annually in the past 15 years, a total of 1 \n     million Cubans have taken up residence in the U.S. since \n     Fidel Castro came to power. The question put to CBO was, in \n     essence: How many of these Cuban Americans may be expected to \n     file suit with respect to ``claimed'' properties in Cuba if \n     Section 302 is enacted? To further distill the question, it \n     may be restated as: How many damage suits will be brought \n     with respect to Cuban properties that were worth at least \n     $3,500 in 1960?\n       In the first place, many of the hundreds of thousands of \n     Cubans who suffered property losses in Cuba have died in the \n     intervening 30-35 years.\\6\\ Accordingly, any ``claims'' \n     relative to properties located in Cuba that might be asserted \n     in a Section 302 lawsuit, as likely as not, will be filed by \n     the children and even grandchildren of the now deceased \n     former owners. The broad definition given the word \n     ``property'' (i.e. ``future or contingent right . . . or \n     other [property] interest'') at Section 4(11) of the bill \n     ensures such a result.\\7\\ This fact alone will greatly \n     increase the number of suits relative to any one Cuban \n     property that may be expected under Section 302 of the \n     LIBERTAD bill. (According to the same Department of the Army \n     study quoted in the preceding paragraph, in 1958 the Cuban \n     total fertility rate--i.e. the average number of children \n     born to each woman--was 3.8. This gives us a sense of the \n     number of descendants likely to assert a claim to any one \n     decedent's former properties in Cuba).\n       Second, many of the properties in Cuba that will be the \n     subject of Section 302 lawsuits had multiple ownership \n     interests. Again, Section 4(11)(A) defines ``property'' as \n     including any property ``. . . whether real, personal, or \n     mixed, or any present, future, or contingent right, security, \n     or other interest therein, including any leasehold \n     interest.'' Therefore, in the agricultural sector for example \n     we can expect claims to be filed by the descendants of not \n     only the owners of the property but also descendants of those \n     who produced commodities from the land under various colono \n     arrangements, or those who held leasehold, mortgage or other \n     interests in the confiscated property. The same is true of \n     the service and industrial sectors of the Cuban economy. This \n     greatly expands the number of suits to be expected if Title \n     III of the LIBERTAD bill becomes law. (By the way, your \n     letter of July 24 misstates the intent of Title III when your \n     projected figure of 15,000 possible litigants are described \n     in terms of having had ``commercial property confiscated in \n     Cuba''; thereby creating the erroneous impression that only \n     such properties are subject to suit. The requirement of the \n     statute is not that the property have been ``commercial''--\n     under Section 4(9)(A)'s definition it can have been real or \n     personal property, or any other type of property interest for \n     that matter. The test for commencing litigation is whether \n     the subject property is being used at the time of suit ``in \n     the conduct of a commercial activity.'' (See Section \n     302(a)(1). Therefore an originally non-commercial property (a \n     residence, for instance) that is now being used in whole or \n     perhaps even in part in a commercial vein such as, as a \n     bicycle repair shop, or a hairdressers, or as business or \n     professional offices, would be subject to suit under Section \n     302. In short, residential properties are exempt from suit \n     under the LIBERTAD bill only to the extent that they are \n     being, ``used for residential purposes.'' (See, Section \n     304(11)(B). I will return to the issue of residential \n     properties later in this letter).\n       In any event, even if we set aside for a moment the \n     multiplicity of litigants and property interests that will \n     assert themselves with respect to any one property, how many \n     actual properties in Cuba may be subject to suit if Title III \n     is enacted? The truth is, no one really knows for certain--\n     but some informed estimates can be made.\n       In 1959 when the first departures for the U.S. from Cuba \n     began, that country had a population of approximately 6.5 \n     million. We can begin our analysis of potential lawsuits to \n     be expected under Title III by first considering the number \n     of various service establishments that may have existed in \n     pre-revoluntionary Cuba to serve a population of that size. \n     (Examples of such service establishments would include \n     restaurants; hotels; clothing shops; bars; groceries; dry \n     goods stores; abattoirs and butchers; barbers and \n     hairdressers; automobile service stations, distributors and \n     parts suppliers; appliance shops; construction companies and \n     building materials suppliers; shoeshops; hardware and feed \n     stores; farm provisioners; laundries; touristic enterprises \n     ranging from marinas and casinos, to nightclubs and theaters; \n     department stores; bank branch offices; drugstores; clinics \n     and professional office buildings used by doctors, dentists, \n     accountants, architects, and lawyers--e.g., there were 7,858 \n     attorneys in Cuba according to the 1953 census). If we \n     arbitrarily--but certainly reasonably--assume that one of \n     each type of service establishment existed per each 500 head \n     of population, a total of approximately 12,000 such \n     enterprises existed in each service category. We will assume, \n     conservatively, that only 15 categories existed in pre-\n     revolutionary Cuba. More than 15 such categories of course \n     existed, but by limiting the number of categories we are able \n     to correct our overall figure to allow for some service \n     industries that had individual establishments (for example \n     bank branches) at a rate of less than one per 500 head of \n     population. When we multiply 12,000 service establishments \n     times 15 categories of such establishments, we reach a total \n     of 180,000. If as few as \\1/3\\ of the owners of those \n     establishments (again, a very conservative figure) settled in \n     the U.S., a total of 60,000 service industry properties are \n     likely to be the subject of lawsuits in federal courts if the \n     LIBERTAD bill is enacted.\\8\\ But, to reiterate an earlier \n     point, each of these properties is capable of having multiple \n     suites filed against it by the descendants of the original \n     owners. If only two such descendant suits are brought on \n     average with respect to each property, a total of 120,000 \n     suits can be expected. Finally, if only one additional claim, \n     on average, is brought by an individual alleging, for \n     example, a leasehold, mortgage or security interest in each \n     property, our total reaches a figure of 180,000 lawsuits to \n     be expected from the Cuban service sector alone.\n       Turning to the Cuban industrial, manufacturing and \n     transportation sectors, how many lawsuits might they \n     engender? Again, it is difficult to know with any certainty. \n     But, let us assume only 1,000 industrial, manufacturing and \n     transportation properties in such representative enterprises \n     as sugar production; tobacco manufacturing; fishing and \n     seafood processing; rum distilling; brewing; steel making; \n     cosmetic and toiletry manufacturing; mining; warehouses and \n     freight lines; construction materials manufacturing; oil \n     processing and distribution; meat packing; electronic goods \n     and other durables manufacturing; and, finally, railroads, \n     ferries and other modes of transportation. The lawsuits from \n     this sector of the Cuba economy, it should be noted, will not \n     be limited to the claims of the companies themselves. Section \n     4(11) of the LIBERTAD bill defines ``property'' to include \n     any ``security interest.'' Therefore, the shareholders in \n     these industrial, manufacturing and transportation sectors of \n     pre-revolutionary Cuba will be filing individual lawsuits if \n     Title III is enacted. How many such lawsuits will be filed is \n     really anyone's guess. But let us assume that each enterprise \n     had even 100 shareholders now naturalized in the U.S. whose \n     individual shareholdings were worth at least $3500 thirty-\n     five years ago. This means that a further 100,000 lawsuits \n     may be expected--with again the fact that descendants of the \n     original owners will be filing most of the suits ensuring \n     that the figure of 100,000 is considerably enlarged.\\9\\\n       Then there are the lawsuits to be expected from Cuba's \n     agricultural sector. Once again, it is difficult to quantify \n     the number of such lawsuits--particularly when most \n     agricultural properties had multiple interests encumbering \n     them, such as colono and various other tenure and leasing \n     arrangements. But if we pick a figure of at least 25,000 \n     rural properties (out of a total of over 150,000 such \n     properties\\10\\ ) whose owners emigrated to the U.S. and that \n     had a value in 1960 of at least $3,500, and if we then assume \n     two overlapping property interests asserted with respect to \n     each property (e.g., a fee simple and a colono interest) by \n     an average of two descendants claiming such interests, we \n     arrive at a figure of 100,000 lawsuits generated by Cuba's \n     agricultural sector.\n       Finally, there are the lawsuits that will be brought with \n     respect to properties that, although originally residential, \n     are now being used, in the language of Section 302(a)(1), in \n     ``the conduct of a commercial activity'' and therefore are \n     not exempt from suit under Section 4(11)(B)'s exception for \n     ``real property used for residential purposes.'' (Emphasis \n     added). Cuba has no modern office blocks to speak of and very \n     few purpose-built service premises of any kind. Therefore a \n     great many formerly residential buildings are now used as \n     commercial, professional or governmental premises. (It will \n     be recalled that agencies and instrumentalities of the \n     government of Cuba may be sued if they are \n\n[[Page S 15015]]\n     using property in the conduct of a commercial activity). In any of \n     those cases if the activity going on in the property is \n     commercial in nature--that property is subject to suit under \n     Title III. Given that whole sections of Havana that were \n     formerly residential, such as Vedado and Miramar, are now \n     being used in some form of commercial manner (even if only as \n     a workshop or small restaurant (paladare) under recently \n     liberalized self-employment laws) thousands of lawsuits may \n     be expected from this quarter. In virtually every one of \n     these cases the $3,500 threshold (in 1960 values) will be \n     comfortably met. We will very conservatively assume that only \n     25,000 residential properties will be the subject of suit if \n     Title III is enacted.\\11\\ If, as is predictable, an average \n     of as little as two lawsuits (by either descendants' \n     interests or mortgage, etc. interests) are brought with \n     respect to each property, our final figure from this sector \n     totals 50,000 federal court litigations.\n       To summarize, the number of lawsuits to be reasonably \n     expected if the LIBERTAD bill becomes law include: 180,000 in \n     the service sector, 100,000 in the industrial, manufacturing \n     and transportation sector, 100,000 from the agricultural \n     sector and 50,000 from residential properties that are now \n     being used ``in the conduct of a commercial activity''--for a \n     total of 430,000 lawsuits. Using your letter's figure of \n     $4,500 in processing costs per lawsuit, 430,000 litigations \n     will require the expenditure of $1,935,000,000 (or nearly $2 \n     billion) by the federal government in court costs alone if \n     Title III of the LIBERTAD bill is enacted.\n       As I have previously remarked, your letter says that, \n     because of the newly-added $50,000 amount in controversy \n     requirement of Title III, ``CBO expects that the number of \n     additional claims [i.e. from Cuban Americans] would be quite \n     small.'' I have tried to demonstrate that the figure of \n     $50,000 is illusory because the threshold amount can be met, \n     within the terms of the proposed statute, by demonstrating \n     that the property at issue was worth as little as $3,500 in \n     1960. But there is a second point I wish to make in this \n     regard, that is, I believe your letter reveals a misplaced \n     trust in the self-policing character of the American \n     litigation system. In the case of the $50,000 amount in \n     controversy requirement of Title III; (i) it will quickly \n     become known by potential plaintiffs that they need only show \n     a property value of $3,500 in 1960 in order to qualify to \n     file suit, and (ii) even if there is a doubt as to whether a \n     property interest was worth $3500, isn't it predictable that \n     many people will go ahead and aver that, at least upon \n     information and belief, the $50,000 amount in controversy \n     requirement has been met and let the court resolve whether or \n     not it really has? (Although upon what controverting evidence \n     a court would be able to dismiss a claim as monetarily \n     insufficient is unclear). In essence, I suppose I question \n     your basic assumption that an ``amount in controversy'' \n     requirement of a statute can ever realistically be expected \n     to dissuade potential litigants from commencing suit. This is \n     particularly so with Title III of the LIBERTAD bill, which is \n     overtly about an unprecedented use of the U.S. civil justice \n     system to promote certain foreign policy objectives with \n     respect to a particular country. Can we as a nation claim to \n     be surprised when hundreds of thousands of Cuban Americans \n     zealously (and quite patriotically in their view) file \n     lawsuits against Cuban properties? Is something like an \n     amount in controversy requirement of a U.S. statute really \n     going to much dampen the litigious excitement the LIBERTAD \n     bill will ignite in south Florida?\n       It is worth reiteration that all a plaintiff must show to \n     receive a judgment against Cuba and other ``traffickers'' \n     under Title III is, (i) ownership of a ``claim'' to property, \n     and (ii) that the property is being used in a commercial \n     manner by the government of Cuba or a private company or \n     individual. As far as establishing the value of properties \n     being ``trafficked'' in (in order that litigants may receive \n     that sum as ``damages''), we may trust that a body of experts \n     will develop in Florida to provide appraisal evidence as to \n     property values in pre-revolutionary Cuba. And, as is the \n     nature of most experts, they may be expected to assess the \n     value of properties in a way that is agreeable to the \n     plaintiffs' lawyers who seek and retain their services and \n     who are probably bringing the case on a not disinterested \n     contingency fee basis. In short, it will be a very rare \n     property that is not confidently asserted to have a value \n     well in excess of the amount in controversy requirement of \n     Title III.\n       For all of the reasons set out above, there can be little \n     doubt that if Congress passes Title III it will produce a \n     litigation explosion of a magnitude never before seen in this \n     country.\\12\\ I genuinely believe you could not be more wrong \n     in your July 31 opinion that the ``claims [of Cuban \n     Americans] will be quite small and that additional costs to \n     process these claims [will] not be significant.'' I have \n     tried in this letter to explain and demonstrate the basis of \n     my belief. No claim is made that the estimates appearing in \n     this letter are beyond reasoned dispute from either \n     direction. For example, it may be the case that service \n     establishments existed in Cuba, on average, at the rate of \n     one per 1,000 head of population rather one per 500, as \n     argued earlier in this letter. If so, that would reduce the \n     number of service sector lawsuits by half, to a total of \n     90,000. As a result, the final figure of lawsuits to be \n     expected would be 340,000 instead of 430,000. On the other \n     hand, we could probably easily double the estimate of 50,000 \n     lawsuits expected to arise from Cuba's residential property \n     sector--with more such suits to come with each liberalizing \n     economic step of the Cuban government that allows broader \n     scope for self-employment and small business formation. The \n     point is, thoughtful adjustments can and should be made to \n     the total number of lawsuits projected to be ultimately \n     engendered by Title III of the LIBERTAD bill. However, I \n     think it highly credible that the number of lawsuits to be \n     expected must be in the range of 300,000 to 450,000--as large \n     as these figures may seem, there is a logic to their \n     calculation.\n       On a final point, Section 303(a)(2) of the LIBERTAD bill \n     provides that ``. . . a court may appoint a Special Master, \n     including the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, to make \n     determinations regarding the amount and ownership of claims \n     to ownership (sic) of confiscated property by the Government \n     of Cuba.'' This provision of Title III leads you to remark in \n     your July 31 letter that: ``The Foreign Claims Settlement \n     Commission could incur additional costs because it could be \n     asked to assist the courts in reviewing cases. CBO estimates \n     that the Commission will require several new attorneys and \n     support personal (sic) to fulfill this responsibility, with \n     costs up to about $1 million each year.'' In assessing your \n     estimate that ``several new attorneys'' will be required by \n     the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission to determine \n     ownership and value of claims against Cuba it is instructive \n     to consider that that is precisely what the Commission did in \n     the Cuba claims program. In an approximately six-year period \n     between 1965 and 1972, 5,911 claims of U.S. nationals were \n     certified against Cuba--a further 2,905 were denied--making a \n     total of 8,816 claims actually decided, producing a rate of \n     decision of about 1,500 per year. Apparently there were ten \n     attorneys at the Commission who handled the claims against \n     Cuba. Their rate of decision was therefore approximately 150 \n     per year. If Title III produces 400,000 claims from Cuban \n     Americans, the Commission, if is to determine the ownership \n     and value of these claims over a four year period, will need \n     to employ 665 attorneys if a rate of determination equal to \n     that of the Cuban claims program is to be achieved.\\13\\ If \n     the costs of salarying, accommodating and otherwise \n     supporting these attorneys is as little as $100,000 each per \n     year, the cost to the federal government will reach nearly \n     $250 million over a four year period in simply readying cases \n     for further disposition by the federal courts.\n       Again, I make no claim of disputability for either my \n     methodology or its ultimate conclusions in this attempt to \n     estimate the number of lawsuits S. 381 may be expected to \n     engender. My purpose in writing has been achieved if the \n     various points raised in this letter prompt a reconsideration \n     by your Office of the litigation implications--and the \n     serious consequential harm to certified claimants such \n     litigation will cause--if Title III of the LIBERTAD bill is \n     enacted in its present form.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                   Robert L. Muse.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ The requirement that a claimant be a U.S. national at the \n     time of property loss appears at Section 503(a) of the Cuban \n     Claims Act (22 U.S.C. Section 1643(b)). This statutory \n     requirement bespeaks the adherence by the U.S. to a long-\n     settled principle of international law. See, e.g. Claim No. \n     IT-10,252, Decision No. IT-62, reprinted in 8 Department of \n     State, DIGEST OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, 1236: ``The principle of \n     international law that eligibility for compensation requires \n     American nationality at the time of loss is so widely \n     understood and universally accepted that citation of \n     authority is scarcely necessary . . .'' The proposed lawsuit \n     provisions of Title III of course would grossly violate that \n     principle of international law.\n     \\2\\ The Department of State has said that Cuban American \n     claims against Cuba could be worth nearly $95 billion. (See, \n     letter of April 28, 1995 from Wendy R. Sherman, Assistant \n     Secretary, Legislative Affairs, to Chairman Benjamin Gilman \n     of the House Committee on Foreign Relations). To put that \n     figure in perspective, according to a recent Economist \n     Intelligence Unit report on Cuba, that country's Gross \n     Domestic Product in 1994 was 12.8 billion pesos. The official \n     rate of exchange is one peso to one dollar, but the more \n     revealing black market rate has fluctuated between 100 to 25 \n     pesos per dollar over the past year.\n     \\3\\ Title III's definition of ``trafficking'' is sufficiently \n     expansive to cover any involvement whatever by the government \n     of Cuba in ``claimed'' properties. ``Traffics'' includes: \n     ``sells, transfers, distributes, dispenses, brokers, manages, \n     or otherwise disposes of confiscated property, or purchases, \n     leases, receives, possesses, obtains control of, manages, \n     uses, or otherwise acquires or holds an interest in \n     confiscated property [or] engages in a commercial activity \n     using or otherwise benefiting from a confiscated property . . \n     .''\n     \\4\\ Section 302(a)(1) provides that: ``. . . any person or \n     entity, including any agency or instrumentality of a foreign \n     state [i.e. Cuba] in the conduct of a commercial activity, \n     that . . . traffics in property which was confiscated by the \n     Government of Cuba on or after January 1, 1959 shall be \n     liable to the United States national who owns a claim to such \n     property for money damages . . .'' (Emphasis added). It has \n     been said that your Office is of the view that few suits will \n     be brought against Cuba ``because it doesn't have any assets \n     in this country.'' With all respect, the same reasoning \n     applied to the various Foreign Claims Settlement Commission \n     programs conducted over the years would mean that no one \n     would bother to file claims pursuant to those programs, \n     because rarely does an expropriating nation have significant \n     assets in the U.S. In fact claims are indeed filed under \n     these programs, as it attested to by the 5,911 claims \n     certified against Cuba. The reason those claims were filed \n     was not to recover Cuban assets in this country (there were \n     virtually none here by the time the program commenced), but \n     rather it was to enlist the support of the United States in \n     the bilateral resolution with Cuba of the matter \n\n[[Page S 15016]]\n     of the American claimants' property losses. Title III lawsuits, it \n     should be remembered, are specifically made nondismissile \n     under Section 302(g)(2). As a set of federal court judgments \n     these Title III suits will come to constitute a future \n     bilateral issue between the United States and Cuba of no less \n     significance than the claims certified against that country \n     by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission. Indeed, unlike a \n     certified claim, a court judgment carries with it rights of \n     execution and attachment against any assets of the debtor \n     nation that may be found now or in future within the United \n     States. Therefore a government-to-government resolution of \n     such outstanding judgments will prove a future practical \n     necessity. In sum, Cuban Americans would be silly not to file \n     individual Title III suits that they have every reason to \n     believe will force themselves onto the prospective bilateral \n     normalization agenda of the U.S. and Cuba.\n     \\5\\ When this letter addresses various sectors of the \n     prerevolutionary Cuban economy that are likely to engender \n     Title III property claims, I think it helpful to keep in mind \n     that Cuba was a comparatively affluent country in 1959. \n     Therefore, properties with a value of at least $3,500 were no \n     rarity. See, for example, the Blue Ribbon Commission Report \n     on the Economic Reconstruction of Cuba, 1991, prepared by the \n     Cuban American National Foundation, which says at pg. 9: \n     ``Before Castro's rise to power on 1 January, 1959, Cuba \n     ranked among the best credit risks and business partners in \n     the Western Hemisphere . . . Buttressed by Cuba's liberal \n     foreign investment laws . . . Cuba's national income doubled \n     between 1945 and 1958. Cuba's per capita Gross National \n     Product ranked third among Latin American nations in 1953, \n     behind Argentina and Venezuela.'' See also the testimony \n     given to the Trade Subcommittee of the Ways and Means \n     Committee on June 30, 1995 by Congresswoman Ilena Ros-\n     Lehtinen: ``Its fertile land, vast tracks of tourist beaches \n     and resorts, and its geographical location, led Cuba to \n     become one of the most developed countries in the \n     hemisphere.'' In any case, whatever the general level of \n     prosperity may have been in pre-revolutionary Cuba, those who \n     were of the Cuban upper economic echelons came to the United \n     States in highly disproportionate numbers, leaving, of \n     course, disproportionately valuable properties behind in \n     Cuba. This issue will be discussed in greater detail at a \n     later point in this letter.\n     \\6\\ The life expectancy of Cubans was 64 years in 1960, by \n     late 1984 it had increased to 73.5 years. Even if the latter \n     figure is used a Cuban who was as young as 38\\1/2\\ years old \n     in 1960 is, as a purely actuarial matter, dead today.\n     \\7\\ Ordinarily the laws of the place of death of the testor \n     (in most Title III cases this will be Florida) will determine \n     inheritance rights. For example, a Florida will provision \n     that says no more than the ``remainder of my property shall \n     be divided among my children'' would give each heir a cause \n     of action against Cuba under Section 302. Specific bequests \n     and intestacy would carry similar rights of action by \n     inheritance. Interestingly enough Section 303 of the LIBERTAD \n     bill provides that: ``In determining ownership, courts shall \n     not accept as conclusive evidence of ownership any findings, \n     orders, judgments, or decrees from administrative agencies or \n     courts of foreign countries [e.g., Cuba] . . .'' Therefore, a \n     decedent's actual ownership of a bequeathed Cuban property is \n     statutorily exempted from judicial inquiry.\n     \\8\\ Assuming that \\1/3\\ of the owners of service \n     establishments settled in the U.S. is not at all unreasonable \n     when it is recalled that those arriving in this country in \n     the aftermath of the Cuban revolution were of the middle and \n     upper strata of Cuban society, i.e., the property-owning \n     class of that country. Given the affluence of the Cubans who \n     settled in the U.S. it is also highly likely that the \n     properties they left behind were, in almost all cases, worth \n     at least $53,500 at the time of confiscation. Of Cuba's \n     population in 1958, 22% (or 1.3 million individuals) were of \n     the upper and middle economic strata. (See, Thomas, Cuba: The \n     Pursuit of Freedom (1971) at pg. 1110 where a UNESCO study to \n     that effect is cited). It was precisely that strata of Cuban \n     society that departed for the U.S. in the early 1960's and \n     may be expected to file Title III lawsuits. For example, \n     Cubans emigrating to the United States in the years 1959-62 \n     were four times more likely to have been of the professional, \n     semiprofessional and managerial classes than the general \n     Cuban population. (See, Perez, Cuba: Between Reform and \n     Revolution (1988), at pg. 344. The question is therefore not \n     what the value of the average property in Cuba was in 1960, \n     but, rather, what was the average value of the properties \n     left behind in the early 1960's by the highest socioeconomic \n     strata of that country's population.\n     \\9\\ Cuban corporate claims themselves present an interesting \n     picture under Title III by virtue of Section 4(14) of the \n     LIBERTAD bill which defines ``United States national'' as \n     ``an legal entity organized under the laws of the United \n     States, or of any state . . . and which has it principal \n     place of business in the United States.'' In short, there is \n     no requirement that the company actually be owned by U.S. \n     citizens. (In order to qualify as a U.S. national for the \n     purposes of the Cuban Claims Act a corporation had to be 50% \n     or more owned by U.S. citizens. Yet again, Title III departs \n     from international law and abandons the sensible and long-\n     established requirement that a company demonstrate some real \n     connection with the country of its purported nationality). \n     Section 4(14) quite simply means that Cuban exiles in such \n     places as Spain, Venezuela, Mexico, and Costa Rica (or Cubans \n     in the U.S., for that matter, who have not sought U.S. \n     citizenship) need only organize a ``legal entity''-i.e. form \n     a corporation in the U.S. and transfer any ``claim'' they may \n     have against Cuba to that corporation in order to file a \n     Section 302 lawsuit, the filing and prosecution of which will \n     constitute the principal business of the newly-formed U.S. \n     corporation. There is no way of estimating the number of \n     lawsuits this distinctly odd and suspect provision of Title \n     III will engender.\n     \\10\\ See Perez, Cuba: Between Reform and Revolution (1988) at \n     pg. 302, where the author refers to a 1946 study that gives \n     the total number of farms in Cuba at the time as 159,958, of \n     which over 95,000 were of at least 25 acres and, in most \n     cases, were considerably larger.\n     \\11\\ This figure of 25,000 is arbitrarily selected from the \n     total of over 150,000 housing units abandoned in Cuba when \n     their owners left for the U.S. (See Jorge Dominguez, Cuba \n     since 1959, at pg. 124 in CUBA, A SHORT HISTORY (1993) where \n     the author says that from 1959 to 1975 approximately 9,300 \n     housing units in Cuba were abandoned annually as a \n     consequence of emigration. Sociedad Economica of London gives \n     a figure of 139,256 housing units ``vacated by emigration \n     between 1960 and 1974,'' See, Private Property Rights in \n     Cuba: Housing (1991)\n     \\12\\ I am at a loss to recall any statute that upon enactment \n     was capable of immediately generating several hundred \n     thousand lawsuits. Even statutes with a potentially large \n     pool of plaintiffs--for example, various anti-discrimination \n     laws--are mitigated in their impact upon the courts by the \n     fact that they are not retroactive in application. Title III \n     is by contrast distinctly retroactive in its application, in \n     that it provides non-U.S. nationals at time of injury with an \n     ex post facto cause of action for injuries occurring, for the \n     most part, over 30 years ago.\n     \\13\\ In the case of Cuban American Title III claims it may be \n     unrealistic to assume a rate of determination as rapid as \n     that which occurred with respect U.S. nationals' claims. The \n     claims that will be filed by Cuban Americans can be expected \n     in many, if not most cases, to be thinly documented (if \n     documented at all) as a result of circumstances of the \n     claimants' departures from Cuba and the passage of time. See, \n     Edward D. Re, The Foreign Claims Settlement Commission and \n     Cuba Claims Program, 1 International Lawyer 81 at pg. 85 \n     (1966): ``Past programs have shown that long delays in the \n     initiation of claims programs increase the burden of \n     adjudication. Due to the destruction of records and the \n     unavailability of witnesses, many claims have found difficult \n     substantiate. This is particularly important since Commission \n     Regulation require that claimants `shall have the burden of \n     proof on all issues involved in the determination of his \n     claim.' The difficulties are increased where there has been \n     lack of cooperation or access in the foreign country''. It \n     may be assumed the Mr. Re, as a former Chairman of Foreign \n     claims Settlement Commission, knew what he was talking about. \n     In any event, much of the evidence of ownership and value \n     that Cuban Americans can be expected to present will, of \n     necessity, be testimonial in nature and based largely upon \n     memory and hearsay. It follows that the evaluation of such \n     claims by the Commission under Section 303(a)(2) will prove \n     an exceedingly laborious, time consuming and imperfect \n     process. Ironically, President Johnson remarked, when signing \n     the Cuban Claims Act in 1964 ``. . . the importance of making \n     a permanent record which evidence and witnesses are still \n     available.'' 51 Dept. State Bull. 674(1964). Section 303 \n     proposes, of course, to attempt to create such a record by \n     the Commission, for use in federal lawsuits by naturalized \n     Cuban Americans, fully thirty-one years after President \n     Johnson's remarks.\n  Mr. DODD. Interestingly, my colleagues and the authors of this bill \nwill say those estimates are way too high, and they will say there will \nnot be that many claimants.\n  I point out to my colleagues that in an earlier version of the Senate \nbill, section 301(5)(B)(ii) of that bill specifically makes the point, \n``Since Fidel Castro captured power in 1959, through his personal \ndespotism he has confiscated the properties of hundreds of thousands of \nCubans who claim asylum in the United States as refugees because of \npolitical persecution.''\n  I do not argue with that statement at all. I endorse it. The point is \nyou cannot on the one hand claim there will be very few people come \nforward and simultaneously point out about the hundreds of thousands of \npeople who have legitimate claims against the Cuban Government. I stand \nby the figure of some 400,000 claims that may result from this change \nin law.\n  However, my colleague from North Carolina and supporters now seem to \nhave had a change of heart, as I pointed out, and assert that the \nnumber of claims will be minuscule. Their message to us ``we did not \nmean it when we said the Cuban Government confiscated the properties of \nhundreds of thousands of Cuban immigrants. Do not worry about the \nlegislation burdening U.S. courts.''\n  I suggest that is a high-risk position to take in light of the \ntremendous costs we could be inflicting on ourselves as a result of \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, the way this measure is drafted, as I pointed out \nearlier, any potential claimants would be foolish not to file a claim \nin United States courts because once a democratic government has been \nestablished in Cuba the right to instigate new suits, will be \nterminated. So you have to do it quickly if this bill becomes law. I \nsuspect that many will step forward and seek to do just that.\n  It seems to me before we move ahead to impose a new mandate in our \ncourts we better understand the extent of the burden we are imposing \nand how we intend to pay for it. Otherwise we are simply imposing one \nmore unfunded mandate on our economy. This time, in our Federal courts.\n  As has been pointed out several times today, there are currently \n5,911 United States claims--that is claims of individuals who were \ncitizens of the United States at the time of the expropriation, with \ncertified claims against the Government of Cuba.\n  Under international law, Mr. President, as well as United States law \nand practice, the United States Government has an obligation to espouse \nthese claims with Cuban authorities. It will do so at the appropriate \ntime with a Government of Cuba that is prepared to accept its \nresponsibilities under international law.\n  This legislation provides for lawsuits not only against the \nGovernment of Cuba but also other governments, foreign nationals, and \ncorporations. I think it is terribly naive to think that other \ngovernments are going to sit back and do nothing while their citizens \nare being sued in U.S. courts for acts that are perfectly legal in \ntheir own country. \n\n[[Page S 15017]]\n\n  The World Trade Organization has already warned that provisions of \nthis bill may violate international trade rules. I submit, Mr. \nPresident, and ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an \narticle that that may be the case.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             WTO States Support Cuba over U.S. Embargo Plan\n\n       Geneva, July 11.--Cuba won support from other members of \n     the World Trade Organisation on Tuesday for a warning that \n     proposed U.S. legislation extending its embargo against \n     Havana would violate the rules of the new body.\n       Diplomats said the European Union as well as Mexico, \n     Washington's partner in the North American Free Trade \n     Association (NAFTA), and Colombia voiced concern over the \n     pending bill in the United States Congress.\n       A Cuban trade official, M. Marciota, told the WTO General \n     Council his government was raising the issue ``in an attempt \n     to prevent this latest violation of the rules of the \n     international trading system from being enacted.''\n       He called for a ``clear and vigorous statement'' from the \n     WTO warning both the U.S. administration and Congress ``of \n     the legal monstrosity which enactment of this bill would \n     represent.''\n       The measure, introduced by anti-communist Republican \n     senator Jesse Helms, would tighten the 35-year-old embargo by \n     banning the import into the United States of sugar, molasses \n     and syrup from countries which import these products from \n     Cuba.\n       It would also prohibit the granting of U.S. entry visas for \n     people who have invested in properties nationalised under the \n     communist administration of President Fidel Castro since it \n     came to power in 1959.\n       The EU has already told Washington it might take a case to \n     the WTO, launched on January 1 under the new world trade \n     treaty signed last year, to protect its rights if the bill \n     went through.\n       On Tuesday EU ambassador Jean-Pierre Leng told the General \n     Council, the WTO's ruling body, that Brussels had \n     considerable doubts on whether the measures envisaged by the \n     bill's backers were compatible with the trade watchdog's \n     rules.\n       The issue came to the WTO as other Latin American countries \n     are increasingly ignoring U.S. policies aimed at isolating \n     the communist island, suffering severe economic hardship \n     following the collapse of its long-time ally, the Soviet \n     Union.\n       Over the past three or four years, Cuba has built up new \n     trade links with most countries in Latin America and begun a \n     cautious switch to market economics including opening up its \n     industrial sector to foreign investment.\n       Under the rules of the WTO, and its predecessor the General \n     Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, members are allowed to \n     declare trade embargoes if they perceive a threat to their \n     national sovereignty.\n       The United States has justified its stance against Cuba on \n     these grounds, but many WTO members argue there can be no \n     serious grounds for insisting that Cuba presents such a \n     threat to the United States in the post-Cold War period.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Furthermore, I am sure all of my colleagues have received \nletters and phone calls from Canadian, British, European Union, Mexican \nGovernment officials and others, objecting to the legislation as an \ninfringement on their sovereignty and as interfering with their trade \nrelations. Canada and Mexico have both argued that the measure would \nviolate the NAFTA legislation.\n  This bill is bad for U.S. business. Again, I would not make that the \nsole criterion, but, please think about what we are doing before we \ncharge ahead here and have tremendous implications that will take some \ntime to undo.\n  It undercuts efforts by the current administration, and previous \nones, to ensure that U.S. investors can expect a stable and predictable \nenvironment when they seek to do business abroad. We can hardly insist \nthat our trading partners respect international laws in areas of trade \nand investment when we ourselves are violating them. You cannot do \nbusiness that way.\n  This legislation, if enacted, would disrupt international commercial \nrelations to a significant degree. Under provisions of this bill the \nUnited States, in effect, expands its own right to sue in an area of \nlaw where we have heretofore studiously defended international law and \npractice. Having done so, how are we then going to defend the interests \nof American businesses abroad when a particular government decides that \nit no longer finds it convenient to follow international law? That \nwould be a tragedy, a mistake.\n  If, in reaction to this legislation, other nations respond with \nspecial interest domestic legislation of their own, U.S. companies \ncould be open to lawsuits throughout the world. Under those \ncircumstances we would be in a very poor position, a very poor one \nindeed, having enacted this bill, to turn around and defend U.S. \ninterests against a foreign government simply reacting to their own \ndomestic, particular, special interest concerns.\n  Ironically, this legislation will also thwart the economic reform \nefforts that have slowly begun in Cuba--privatization, for example. I \nthink all of us believe that the more we can secure privatization in \nCuba, the better the results will be. Yet this measure would seriously \nundermine these efforts by targeting the very interests that are \nprivatizing in Cuba. In effect we say to them, if you continue to \nundertake certain business activities then we are going to come after \nyou.\n  You cannot, on the one hand, say we ought to encourage privatization, \nurge the international community to move in that direction, and then \npenalize the very elements that are doing it. Yet that is exactly what \nwe will be doing if we enact this bill into law. It does not make any \nsense, Mr. President.\n  In fact the House-passed bill would even thwart privatization of the \nagricultural sector. Cuban farmers, availing themselves of the newly \nlegalized private farmers markets, would be subject to suit in the \nUnited States because their produce or livestock may have been raised \non confiscated property.\n  While I believe this legislation damages U.S. interests in all the \nways I have just mentioned, I am also of the view it is unlikely to \npromote democratic or peaceful change in Cuba.\n  Do we get support in the United Nations for our Cuban policy? Only \none country, one, joined the United States recently in voting against a \nU.N. resolution condemning the U.S. embargo. The one country that voted \nwith us was Israel. Yet, business people from even Israel are doing \nbusiness in Cuba today. They vote with us in the United Nations, the \none vote we get, yet that country now is going to be the subject of the \nvery law we are passing because, if Israel continues to do business in \nCuba, Israelis are not going to be able to do business in this country, \nif their business activities in any way relate to confiscated \nproperties.\n  Please, read this bill. This is not sound legislation. This is \nemotion speaking here. It is anger, it is frustration over what has \nhappened in Cuba. But it is not sound thinking at all.\n  So, again I point out, one country joins us. The entire world votes \nagainst us on this issue. The one country that joins us, Israel, a good \nfriend and loyal ally that always supports us in these things, is doing \nits own business in Cuba. It is one of the 58 countries today doing \nbusiness in Cuba.\n  By the way, the countries doing business in Cuba are not all liberal, \ncommunist governments. The John Major government of Great Britain, is \nthat some liberal, left wing government? The Government of France today \nunder Chirac, the Government of Germany, are these all bad, rotten, no \ngood characters? Are we now going to subject them to the provisions of \nthis law? That does not make any sense. That is not the way to achieve \nthe desired results that we would all like to see here.\n  Does anyone seriously believe this bill, if adopted, is likely to \npersuade other governments to adopt a policy of tightening this embargo \nand isolating Cuba diplomatically? How long have we heard those \nspeeches? Non-U.S. trade and investment in Cuba have been expanding in \nrecent months, not contracting. Regrettably, I would say, in many ways. \nBut the facts of life are that is what is happening.\n  According to recent statistics released by the United States-Cuba \nTrade and Economic Council, businesses from 58 nations have formed more \nthan 200 joint ventures in order to exploit business opportunities in \nCuba. With the recent liberalization of Cuba's foreign investment laws, \nit will be even easier for foreign companies to set up shop in Havana.\n  Under the recent liberalization of Cuba's investment law, foreign \ninvestors will be able to wholly own their investments in most sectors \nof the Cuban economy.\n  Again, I am not suggesting in any way this ought to be some reason to \nstart applauding Fidel Castro. I do not at all. I am just stating a \nfact. That is \n\n[[Page S 15018]]\nwhat is happening. So the idea we are going to get others to join us in \nthese particular moves is not likely.

So, of course, as a result of the provisions in this bill \nand other regulations, we will be forced to sit on the sidelines here \nwhen the change begins to happen. And only after democracy comes to \nCuba will we be able to fully engage with the new government down \nthere. The requirements mandated by the House passed bill that must be \nmet by the post-Castro government for it to be considered in transition \nto democracy and eligible for emergency humanitarian assistance are \nvery stiff.\n  I ask unanimous consent that those requirements be printed at this \nparticular point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     SEC. 205. REQUIREMENTS FOR A TRANSITION GOVERNMENT.\n\n       For purposes of this Act, a transition government in Cuba \n     is a government in Cuba which--\n       (1) is demonstrably in transition from communist \n     totalitarian dictatorship to representative democracy;\n       (2) has recognized the right to independent political \n     activity and association;\n       (3) has released all political prisoners and allowed for \n     investigations of Cuban prisons by appropriate international \n     human rights organizations;\n       (4) has ceased any interference with Radio or Television \n     Marti broadcasts;\n       (5) makes public commitments to and is making demonstrable \n     progress in--\n       (A) establishing an independent judiciary;\n       (B) dissolving the present Department of State Security in \n     the Cuban Ministry of the Interior, including the Committees \n     for the Defense of the Revolution and the Rapid Response \n     Brigades;\n       (C) respecting internationally recognized human rights and \n     basic freedoms as set forth in the Universal Declaration of \n     Human Rights, to which Cuba is a signatory nation;\n       (D) effectively guaranteeing the rights of free speech and \n     freedom of the press;\n       (E) organizing free and fair elections for a new \n     government--\n       (i) to be held in a timely manner within a period not to \n     exceed 1 year after the transition government assumes power;\n       (ii) with the participation of multiple independent \n     political parties that have full access to the media on an \n     equal basis, including (in the case of radio, television, or \n     other telecommunications media) in terms of allotments of \n     time for such access and the times of day such allotments are \n     given; and\n       (iii) to be concluded under the supervision of \n     internationally recognized observers, such as the \n     Organization of American States, the United Nations, and \n     other elections monitors;\n       (F) assuring the right to private property;\n       (G) taking appropriate steps to return to United States \n     citizens (and entities which are 50 percent or more \n     beneficially owned by United States citizens) property taken \n     by the Cuban Government from such citizens and entities on or \n     after January 1, 1959, or to provide equitable compensation \n     to such citizens and entities for such property;\n       (H) granting permits to privately owned telecommunications \n     and media companies to operate in Cuba; and\n       (I) allowing the establishment of independent trade unions \n     as set forth in conventions 87 and 98 of the International \n     Labor Organization, and allowing the establishment of \n     independent social, economic, and political associations;\n       (6) does not include Fidel Castro or Raul Castro;\n       (7) has given adequate assurances that it will allow the \n     speedy and efficient distribution of assistance to the Cuban \n     people;\n       (8) permits the deployment throughout Cuba of independent \n     and unfettered international human rights monitors; and\n       (9) has extradited or otherwise rendered to the United \n     States all persons sought by the United States Department of \n     Justice for crimes committed in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 206. REQUIREMENTS FOR A DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED \n                   GOVERNMENT.\n\n       For purposes of this Act, a democratically elected \n     government in Cuba, in addition to continuing to comply with \n     the requirements of section 205, is a government in Cuba \n     which--\n       (1) results from free and fair elections conducted under \n     the supervision of internationally recognized observers;\n       (2) has permitted opposition parties ample time to organize \n     and campaign for such elections, and has permitted full \n     access to the media to all candidates in the elections;\n       (3) is showing respect for the basic civil liberties and \n     human rights of the citizens of Cuba;\n       (4) has made demonstrable progress in establishing an \n     independent judiciary;\n       (5) is substantially moving toward a market-oriented \n     economic system;\n       (6) is committed to making constitutional changes that \n     would ensure regular free and fair elections that meet the \n     requirements of paragraph (2); and\n       (7) has made demonstrable progress in returning to United \n     States citizens (and entities which are 50 percent or more \n     beneficially owned by United States citizens) property taken \n     by the Cuban Government from such citizens and entities on or \n     after January 1, 1959, or providing full compensation for \n     such property in accordance with international law standards \n     and practice.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I am not going to list all of these requirements now, but I \nask my colleagues to read section 205 of the House bill. It is hard to \ndisagree with any of these. But the idea that we specifically exclude \ncertain people from even being elected in their own country as a \nrequirement of that country being in transition to democracy seems to \nbe getting to deeply into the nitty gritty of another country's \naffairs. I do not think anyone can read these requirements and think \nthat they are realistic. To think that a country must meet absolutely \nmeet every one of these requirements before we can even do business \nwith the new government down there is preposterous.\n  Assuming we had a change in that country, any kind of change at all, \nI think we would want to engage that new government. But no, under \nprovisions in the House bill we have to wait until all these \nconditions--they go on for a page and a half here--are met. If we had \napplied those standards to the transitions that took place in the \nformer Soviet Union, in Poland, and elsewhere in Eastern and Central \nEurope, we might have missed real opportunities to make a difference \nfor democracy. In fact, many of these Newly Independent States have yet \nto meet all of the standards that we seek to impose on a post-Castro \nCuba. If you applied the specifics to them today, for example, we have \nsome people being elected in these countries that are former \nCommunists--that would violate these standards. That does not make any \nsense. It is unrealistic and it is not a good idea. I wonder what would \nhave happened in Poland, or in Russia, if we had applied the same kind \nof provisions of law.\n  Again, it is not just me speaking here. Last month the Inter-American \nDialog issued its second report on Cuba. A number of very distinguished \nindividuals were involved in crafting the report, Republicans as well \nas Democrats, and distinguished foreign policy experts. I will ask the \nlist of these members be printed in the Record. But let me just read \nsome. Among the participants were Elliot Richardson, Oscar Arias, \nformer President of Costa Rica, John Whitehead, former Deputy Secretary \nof State in the Reagan administration--we are not talking about some \nliberal Democrats here, who wrote the report. Listen to what they have \nto say. I ask unanimous consent that the full list of the members of \nthat group be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Members of the Inter-American Dialogue Task Force on Cuba\n\n       Elliot L. Richardson (Chair), Partner, Milbank, Tweed, \n     Hadley and McCloy, Former U.S. Attorney General and Secretary \n     of Defense.\n       Jorge I. Dominguez (Coordinator), Professor of Government, \n     Harvard University.\n       Raul Alfonsin, Former President of Argentina.\n       Oscar Arias, Former President of Costa Rica.\n       Peter D.

Vaky, Senior Fellow, Inter-American Dialogue, \n     Former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State.\n       John Whitehead, Chairman, AEA Investors, Inc., Former U.S. \n     Deputy Secretary of State.\n\n  Mr. DODD. The task force offered a number of recommendations to both \nthe Cuban and United States Governments, designed to enhance the \nprospects for peaceful democratic change in \n\n[[Page S 15020]]\nCuba. Among other things, and I am quoting:\n\n       [It] urges the defeat of the Cuban Liberty and Democracy \n     Solidarity Act.\n\n  I do not think John Whitehead, Elliot Richardson, or Oscar Arias, \nformer President of Costa Rica, and a leading opponent in Central \nAmerica against the Sandinista Government, are great friends or \nproponents of Fidel Castro. But they said this bill is a bad idea, a \nbad idea. Think twice before you do this.\n  Why is this bill bad? Because ``It would injure and alienate ordinary \nCubans, weaken Cuba's civil society--as threadbare as it may be--and \nretard Cuba's democratization. It would also reduce prospects for U.S. \ncooperation with other countries on Cuba.''\n  I ask my colleagues to take a look at these recommendations, by this \ngroup of distinguished panelists who are bipartisan in nature.\n  I ask unanimous consent the report of the Inter-American Dialog Task \nForce be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n [The Second Report of the Inter-American Dialogue Task Force on Cuba]\n\n           Cuba in the Americas: Breaking the Policy Deadlock\n\n\n                       summary of recommendations\n\n       The prospects for change in Cuba are today greater than at \n     any time since 1959. Yet, current U.S. policy neither \n     encourages change in Cuba nor advances U.S. national \n     interests. For their part, Cuban government policies continue \n     to poorly serve the interests of the Cuban people. The \n     unbending policies of the two countries--perpetuated by \n     national pride on both sides--have allowed a continuing \n     deterioration in Cuba's circumstances and increased the \n     dangers of violent conflict. Our recommendations have one \n     fundamental purpose: to enhance the prospects for peaceful, \n     democratic change in Cuba.\n\n                       To the Government of Cuba\n\n       We urge Cuba's leaders to put their claim of public support \n     to the test of free and fair elections that are \n     internationally monitored.\n       Political prisoners should be freed, and the laws that \n     repress dissent and prevent the operation of independent \n     organizations should be repealed.\n       Cuba should broaden its economic reform program and adopt \n     policies necessary to qualify for membership in the World \n     Bank and International Monetary Fund.\n\n                         To the U.S. Government\n\n       U.S. policy toward Cuba should be redirected to the \n     objectives put forth by the past two administrations--to \n     encourage a peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba. Cuba no \n     longer poses a security threat to the United States. The main \n     danger to U.S. national interest in Cuba is the prospect of \n     prolonged violence, which could provoke mass migration and \n     U.S. military action.\n       U.S. interests in Cuba would be most advanced by pursuing \n     three concrete goals:\n       To reduce hostility in U.S.-Cuban relations:\n       The United States should consistently make clear that it \n     has no intention of invading Cuba. It should condemn violent \n     actions by the exile groups, notify the Cuban government of \n     U.S. military exercises near Cuba, and encourage military \n     attaches throughout the world to communicate with Cuban \n     counterparts.\n       U.S. Cuba policy should give greater weight to humanitarian \n     concerns by allowing charities to engage in all necessary \n     financial transactions to advance their work, permitting \n     Cuban-Americans again to aid relatives in Cuba, and lifting \n     all restrictions on shipments of food and medicine.\n       Radio Marti should broadcast objective news, not \n     propaganda, and should be politically independent. TV Marti \n     should be canceled because it violates international \n     conventions.\n       To encourage private markets, the rule of law, and \n     independent organizations:\n       The U.S. government should exempt from its embargo all \n     transactions that foster communications between the peoples \n     of Cuba and the United States, specifically removing all \n     obstacles to travel to Cuba and encouraging cultural and \n     scientific exchanges between the two nations.\n       The United States should encourage the World Bank and IMF \n     to work with the Cuban government to establish a path toward \n     eventual membership. This may be the single best way to \n     encourage sustained economic reform in Cuba. Washington \n     should also support the efforts of Secretary-General Gaviria \n     to involve the OAS in reviewing Cuba's hemispheric relations.\n       To promote pragmatic exchange between the U.S. and Cuban \n     Governments:\n       The United States should make plain that economic and \n     political reforms by Cuba--such as releasing political \n     prisoners, accepting UN human rights monitors, allowing \n     political dissent, and legalizing the formation of small \n     businesses--would be met by parallel changes in U.S. policy \n     toward Cuba. Both the U.S. and Cuban governments should \n     undertake a controlled process of specific initiatives, \n     conditioned understandings, and convergent steps, all limited \n     in scope, but which together could cumulatively open the way \n     for more substantial changes.\n       The United States should indicate its readiness to \n     negotiate agreements with Cuba on issues in which both \n     countries have coinciding interests. The United States and \n     Cuba, for example, have both gained by recent agreements on \n     immigration, and negotiations in this area should continue. \n     Cuba and the United States would also benefit from \n     cooperation to interdict drug traffickers, reciprocally \n     inspect nuclear power plants, forecast weather-related \n     disasters, and protect the environment.\n\n                            The U.S. Embargo\n\n       We urge defeat of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic \n     Solidarity Act--better known as the Helms-Burton legislation. \n     It would injure and alienate ordinary Cubans, weaken Cuba's \n     civil society, and retard Cuba's democratization. It would \n     also reduce prospects for U.S. cooperation with other \n     countries on Cuba. We continue, however, to oppose fully \n     dismantling the trade embargo. The embargo can serve as a \n     practical element of policy, if it is used as a bargaining \n     chip in negotiations with Cuba of the kind we have \n     recommended. A permanent situation of crisis around Cuba is \n     unacceptable. Provoking an even more severe crisis is not a \n     solution. The U.S. government should be prepared, step by \n     step, to lift its trade embargo in response to specific \n     initiatives taken by the Cuban government. What is needed \n     from the United States is active bargaining, not passive \n     waiting or the tightening of pressure without regard to the \n     consequences.\n  Mr. DODD. I also think it behooves us to listen to the people who \nhave stayed in Cuba for the last 30 years, who also want to see Castro \ngo; who have experienced firsthand the impact of our policies. Speaking \nfor this group, the Cuban Conference of Catholic Bishops has said that \nthe passage of this legislation to tighten the embargo would contribute \nto ``an increase in the suffering of the people and risk of violence in \nthe face of desperation.'' Again, these are not supporters of Fidel \nCastro. These are the people who have been in the frontlines in Cuba, \nfighting for change.\n  Mr. President, former National Security Adviser to President Carter, \nZbigniew Brzezinski, had a very thoughtful article printed in the \nHouston Chronicle at the time of the refugee crisis last fall--again, \nsomeone whom I think all of us would agree was not soft on Castro, as \nsome people like to use those words with anyone who disagrees with \nthem. The title of this article is ``Soft Landing or a Crash Dive in \nStore for Cuba?'' Mr. Brzezinski laid out the alternative courses, and \nthere are some, that we could follow in relations to Cuba to achieve \nthe desired results. He concluded that it was in our interests for \nthere to be a peaceful transition to a non-Communist regime in that \ncountry, rather than promote a social explosion and the concomitant \ntidal wave of Cuban humanity toward our shores.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the article by Mr. Brzezinski \nbe printed in the Record at this point, as well.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Houston Chronicle, Sept. 8, 1994]\n\n            Soft Landing or a Crash Dive in Store for Cuba?\n\n                        (By Zbigniew Brzezinski)\n\n       The Cuban regime is in its terminal stage. The critical \n     issue at stake is whether its final gasp will be violent or \n     relatively benign. American policy must make the strategic \n     choice as to whether a ``crash landing'' scenario is \n     preferable to a ``soft landing.''\n       As things are now headed, a bloody crash landing for the \n     Castro regime is becoming more likely. U.S. sanctions are \n     intensifying social and political tensions on the island. An \n     explosion could occur before too much time has passed.\n       What then?\n       If an anti-Castro revolution succeeds quickly, the outcome \n     may be viewed as beneficial to the United States as well as \n     to the Cuban people themselves. The 35-year-old communist \n     experiment in the Western Hemisphere will have gone up in the \n     smoke of the final funeral pyre for the failed Marxist \n     Utopia. It would be a fitting ``Gotterdammerung'' for a \n     regime that was dedicated to violence and which ruled by \n     violence.\n       But the explosion may not succeed. Castro is not only the \n     Stalin of the Cuban revolution; he is also its Lenin. He does \n     have considerable residual loyalty, not only among the ruling \n     party-army elite, but within some sections of society.\n       It is also quite conceivable that Castro, faced with the \n     realization that U.S. sanctions are stimulating an uprising, \n     may use the current migration first to weaken the opposition \n     and then, quite deliberately, to provoke an explosion which \n     he can then more easily crush.\n\n[[Page S 15021]]\n\n       What then? Will the Clinton administration, which has made \n     so much of the idea of ``restoring'' democracy to Haiti, sit \n     back and do nothing while Cuban freedom fighters are crushed? \n     Or will the United States launch an invasion of Cuba to \n     finish the job?\n       The current policy of imposing intensifying social \n     hardships on Cuba while condemning its regime--thereby also \n     causing a greater outflow of migrants--only makes sense if \n     the U.S. goal is to precipitate the early fall of the \n     Castro regime. In that case, the United States must be \n     ready to follow through on the strategic logic involved, \n     while, indeed, rebuffing any Cuban proposals of wider \n     negotiations.\n       In effect, the strategy of precipitating a ``crash \n     landing'' also requires, as a last resort, clear-minded U.S. \n     determination to invade Cuba.\n       Since there is reason to doubt that the Clinton \n     administration is deliberately embarked on that course, and \n     even more that it would be willing to launch a supportive \n     invasion of Cuba, the U.S. rebuff to Cuba's overture for \n     wider negotiations on the ``true causes'' for the flood of \n     migrants makes little sense. A wiser and more effective \n     response would be to seize the opportunity of the Cuban offer \n     so that the United States can pursue a soft-landing strategy.\n       The Cubans have indicated that they would be prepared to \n     contain the migratory outflow upon a positive American \n     response to their proposal--and that would defuse the urgent \n     problem posed by the migration itself.\n       But the U.S.-Cuban talks should not be limited to the issue \n     of migration alone. Instead, they should be exploited to \n     advance the soft-landing strategy by setting in motion a more \n     deliberate, somewhat longer-term process designed to manage \n     in a more benign way the terminal phase of the Castro regime.\n       Accordingly, in the dialogue with Havana, the United States \n     should not be shy in offering its own diagnosis of the ``true \n     causes'' of that regime's failures. Its brutal political \n     dictatorship and its dogmatic economic management could be \n     subjected to a scathing critique.\n       At the same time, attractive political and economic \n     alternatives could also be put on the table. More \n     specifically, the United States could propose a schedule for \n     the staged introduction of democracy--perhaps on the model of \n     what happened in Poland in 1989--as well as a similarly \n     staged economic-aid program (including a step-by-step lifting \n     of the embargo), designed to alleviate the immediate \n     suffering of the population and then to stimulate the \n     economic recovery of the island.\n       Such an initiative would gain the support of much of Latin \n     American public opinion. It would also be likely to have \n     European backing, especially from Spain. These reactions \n     would be noted in Cuba, making a negative response by Castro \n     more costly for him.\n       Of course, given the dictatorial nature of the Cuban \n     regime, it would be up to Castro personally to decide whether \n     to accept or reject the initiative. Acceptance could make the \n     process of transition more peaceful and also increasingly \n     difficult to resist.\n       A refusal by Castro--which at this stage represents the \n     more likely reaction--might help to mobilize support for the \n     U.S. initiative even on the part of some Cubans who otherwise \n     would support Castro in a final showdown. That would further \n     weaken and isolate the old dictator, enhancing the prospects \n     of success for any eventual popular revolt against his \n     regime.\n       There is little to be risked by exploring the soft-landing \n     option. And much to be gained, especially by the Cuban \n     people.\n\n  Mr. DODD. At any rate, I apologize to my colleagues for taking this \namount of time, but my point here is I understand and appreciate the \nemotional levels that people feel when this issue comes up.\n  And I have great sympathy--not as a Cuban-American--but sympathy for \nhow Cuban-Americans feel who had to leave their country under the worst \nof circumstances, or watch their families be imprisoned and treated \nbrutally by their Government. But I think as we are examining how we \ndeal with that problem, how we try to create the transition, that we do \nso with an eye toward what is in the best interest of our country, and \nalso take steps that are not rooted and grounded in an emotional \nresponse but that are likely to produce the result which we can all \nsupport.\n  I strongly suggest to my colleagues that the legislation, no matter \nhow well intended, does none of those things. In fact, I think it is \nbad for our country. I do not think it produces the kind of results at \nall that the proponents claim it will. In fact, I think it does quite \nthe contrary. I do not think it is in the interest of this country. It \ndoes damage to our country, and I think it would make it that much more \ndifficult to achieve the kind of results we would like to see in Cuba, \nand to see promptly.\n  For those reasons, Mr. President, I strongly urge that my colleagues \nvote against invoking cloture when that vote comes up--and that will be \nthe first vote we will have on this measure --to send a message that \nthis bill ought to go back to committee and be reexamined thoroughly as \nto whether this legislation really makes sense. If that does not occur, \nthen vote against this legislation when that opportunity arises.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Cuban Liberty \nand Democratic Solidarity Act and encourage my colleagues to vote for \ncloture when that time arrives.\n  This is a bill which would seek increased international pressure on \nFidel Castro, hold out the promise of assistance to transition and \ndemocratic governments in Cuba, and provide a powerful disincentive to \nthose who would use illegally expropriated property belonging to United \nStates citizens to prop up the Castro regime and its instruments of \nrepression.\n  Despite the diligent efforts of the Clinton administration and \napologists for Castro to misrepresent this bill, this bill is an \neffective, and thoughtful program for maintaining economic pressure on \nCastro, supporting democratic forces inside Cuba, and planning for \nfuture transition and democratic governments.\n  Fidel Castro has been in power for 36 years. That is longer than Mao \nand Joseph Stalin. That is mindboggling.\n  As happened with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, \nmuch of the world has denied, ignored, and become inured to the litany \nof human rights abuses emanating from Cuba. Now, with the cold war \nover, there is even less interest.\n  Ramming tugs full of refugees, arbitrary arrests, made-up crimes and \nlengthy imprisonment in squalid prisons and psychiatric hospitals \napparently do not raise an eyebrow anymore.\n  The final step in the process of accommodation, normalization of \ncommercial and other ties, is taking place now as many countries look \nfor commercial opportunities in Cuba.\n  Before I go on to explain why foreign investment in Cuba will \nprolong, not end, the tyranny of Fidel Castro, let me address the state \nof human rights in Cuba today.\n  I would like to read an excerpt from the 1994-95 Freedom in the World \nReport, compiled by Freedom House.\n\n       With the possible exception of South Africa, Indonesia and \n     China, Cuba under Castro has had more political prisoners per \n     capita for longer periods than any other country.\n       Since 1992 Cuba's community of human rights activists and \n     dissidents has been subject to particularly severe \n     crackdowns. Hundreds of human rights activists have been \n     jailed or placed under house arrest.\n       In the extended crackdown that began in August 1994, over \n     thirty dissidents were detained and beaten while in custody.\n       Dissidents are frequently assaulted in the streets and in \n     their homes by plainclothes police and the `rapid action \n     brigades,' mobs organized by state security, often through \n     the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDRs).\n       There is continued evidence of torture and killings in \n     prisons and psychiatric institutions, where a number of the \n     dissidents arrested in recent years have been incarcerated.\n       Since 1990, the International Committee of the Red Cross \n     has been denied access to prisoners.\n       Freedom of movement and freedom to choose one's residence, \n     education or job are restricted. Attempting to leave the \n     island without permission is a punishable offense and \n     crackdowns have been severe since 1993, except during the \n     month-long exodus in 1994. The punishment for illegal exit--\n     --\n\n  I would like just to make a point here. The idea that you would live \nin a country that would have a law that would make it illegal for you \nto leave, and the punishment for that would be 3 years in prison is \nunconscionable. At the present time, there are some 1,000 individuals, \nit is estimated, in prison for that particular crime of wanting to \nleave the country.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. MACK. Certainly.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that John F. \nGuerra, a Pearson fellow on my staff, be granted the privilege of the \nfloor for the pendency of this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MACK. Unfortunately, the world has become so conditioned to \nCastro's \n\n[[Page S 15022]]\nabuses that the suffering of the Cuban people sometimes becomes a \nfootnote in debates over maintaining the embargo, or Castro's efforts \nto revive Cuba's nuclear and military capabilities.\n  Mr. President, I have had the opportunity over the years to have been \nsomewhat involved in the issues of human rights violations in Cuba \nhaving had the opportunity to talk with Cubans who have one way or \nanother left the island of Cuba. I have also been in Geneva during the \ndebate surrounding the issue of human rights violations in Cuba.\n  While I can understand how, over a period of time, people seem to be \nable to just brush aside the human aspects of this debate and focus on \nthe legal constitutional issues, the reality of what we are talking \nabout here today is not economics and it is not constitutional law. It \nis what is happening to individuals on a day-to-day basis.\n  I would say to you again that in my conversations with people who \nhave left Cuba and who have left recently, their reaction to our \nbacking away or backing down on the economic sanctions, or the embargo \nthat is in place, they say that would be the wrong thing to do even \nthough they are going through tremendous suffering. They say it would \nbe the wrong thing to do. It is the only message they hear from around \nthe world that says that someone is concerned about their future. It \nwould be a terrible mistake for the Senate to reject this legislation.\n  I would like to turn the debate briefly away from the human rights \naspect of it and talk a little bit about the embargo and maintaining \neconomic pressure on Castro.\n  Foreign investors in Cuba often purport to be responding to changes \nin the regime. In fact, there have been no significant economic \nchanges, let alone political ones.\n  Castro controls sectors of the economy that attract most foreign \ninvestment such as mining and petroleum, telecommunications, \nagriculture, and tourism.\n  An index of foreign investment in Cuba lists over a dozen \ndemocracies.\n  Foreign companies must make partnerships with the regime. \nIncreasingly this means Cuba's military, which like China's, is getting \nmore and more involved in the economy.\n  Tourism is the military's cash cow, especially foreigners-only \nrestaurants and resorts which have created what Cubans call tourism \napartheid.\n  The argument that foreign investment makes private citizens \nindependent of state control by enabling them to support a free press, \npolitical parties, religious groups and labor and professional \norganizations simply does not apply to Cuba where there is no such \nthing as a right to private property, let alone free speech, \nassociation or assembly.\n  European, Canadian, and Mexican investors have been providing crucial \nsupport to Castro for years yet there is no benefit to ordinary Cubans. \nThe constitution requires state ownership of the fundamental means of \nproduction. Foreign companies may not contract with workers.\n  Instead, companies pay the Government. Again, I want to stress this \npoint. If you do business in Cuba today, the impression is created that \nthese reforms are somehow or another dramatically changing what is \nhappening in Cuba. If you are doing business in Cuba today and you hire \na number of Cubans, you do not pay directly your work force.\n  You pay the money to the Cuban Government, say, 300 United States \ndollars a month for each employee. That employee receives $4 to $5 a \nmonth in pesos from the Cuban Government. The balance of that money \nstays with Fidel Castro's government. In fact, it enhances Fidel \nCastro's ability to control the island.\n  So this idea, this notion that somehow or other if we were to \nliberalize our approach in dealing with Fidel Castro that the people of \nCuba will benefit is just hogwash. The individual who will benefit will \nbe Fidel Castro. And anyone who has done any serious reading about \nFidel Castro knows that his only motive is his own private power, his \nability to remain in place as the leader. His interests are not, in \nfact, the Cuban people.\n  Decree Law No. 149 directs agents to search out and seize cash or \nproperty of Cubans deemed unduly wealthy. Deemed unduly wealthy, \ninteresting concept, is it not, that the government would define and \ndetermine who in the country is unduly wealthy.\n  Individuals discovered with a motorbike or extra clothes can be \ncharged with illegal enrichment and face lengthy prison terms. \nSometimes foreign investments involve the $1.8 billion in U.S. \nproperties seized in 1960 without compensation. Despite misleading \nrepresentations to prospective investors, Cuba has never settled a \nsingle claim for these properties.\n  Castro encourages and courts this investment, even inventing a \ncosmetic law that purports to protect the assets of foreign investors. \nOur State Department asks our allies to discourage their citizens from \ninvesting in such properties, with mixed success. Somehow transactions \nthat businessmen would not touch with a 10-foot pole in their own \ncountries seem all right in Cuba, where fraudulent transactions \ninvolving the government are above the law.\n  This bill provides a powerful disincentive to those who knowingly \ninvest in expropriated U.S. properties by providing another forum for \nlegal action by U.S. citizens. However, neither this bill nor \nlongstanding United States policy towards Cuba is inspired by the \neconomic injuries suffered by our citizens. We simply refuse to prop up \nthe Castro regime and its instruments of repression.\n  A recent report of the AFL-CIO's American Institute for Free Labor \nDevelopment explained Castro's strategy to substitute hard currency for \nreal change.\n  And I quote:\n\n       ``[r]eforms'' are not seen as ends in themselves but as \n     temporary mechanisms for gaining enough foreign currency and \n     trade to ensure the survival of the communist system. \n     ``Privatization'' is not an open-ended invitation to foreign \n     entrepreneurs, but a tightly controlled partnership between \n     investors and government agencies, for the purpose of \n     strengthening those very agencies.\n\n  The Clinton administration's changeable Cuba policy may have led our \nallies to believe sentiment in the United States is divided over Cuba. \nIt is not. Worse still, administration wavering may have caused Cubans \nto doubt United States resolve and take to rafts and innertubes in \nnumbers greater than any time since the Mariel exodus.\n  Some of our allies have criticized the bill on the grounds that the \nUnited States has no right to tell its allies not to do business in \nCuba. We are doing no such thing. This legislation is directed at Fidel \nCastro and his government. Insofar as this bill has a message for our \nallies, it is that we attach the greatest importance to ending the \ndecades-long nightmare of the Cuban people. Foreign investment on \nCastro's terms prolongs that nightmare.\n  Other provisions of this bill would deny Cuba the money and \nlegitimacy that comes from being a member of international financial \nand other institutions, like the Inter-American Development Bank and \nthe Organization of American States.\n  This bill tells the States of the former Soviet Union they may not \nblithely restart their predecessor's close relations with Fidel Castro \nand expect the United States not to care.\n  We will not subsidize Russia's assistance to Cuba so long as it \nsupports Castro's destabilizing ambitions in the hemisphere and keeps \nthe Cuban people under the thumb of corrupt and inefficient Socialist \neconomic policies.\n  We will however plan for the day, the moment, that the United States \ncan help the people of Cuba make a transition to democracy. This bill \nholds out the promise of aid to transition and democratic governments \nin Cuba and allows the President great flexibility in extending the \nhelp and support of the United States.\n  Americans right now are already the largest donors of humanitarian \naid to Cuba. We will do more. But we won't prolong the Castro nightmare \n1 minute longer than necessary by relaxing pressure on Castro or \nhelping him attract foreign investment.\n  Mr. President, not too long ago I saw a movie called ``Braveheart.'' \nIt is about the struggle for human freedom. And this movie was about \nthe effort on the part of the Scottish people to secure their freedom. \nThere was a scene in this movie in the midst of a battle in \n\n[[Page S 15023]]\nwhich the hero of the movie had spoken with the nobles in the country \nasking for their support. And at the crucial moment in the battle, I \nremember again the hero turning to someone for support from these \nnobles, and at this crucial moment, the nobles turned their backs on \nfreedom. They turned their backs on freedom for one reason: for their \nself-interest, for their need to continue the existing system because \nthey profited from it.\n  I know that the motivation, frankly, behind those who are in \ndisagreement with what we are trying to accomplish is the desire to \nprofit from the markets that will be available someday in Cuba. I \nunderstand that. I am disappointed that people react that way. We will \nnever change that attitude. It has been in existence as long as man has \nbeen on the surface of this Earth.\n  But I think we ought to recognize it for what it is. People want to \ndo business in China today for exactly the same reason. For a few brief \nmoments the Nation focused on Harry Wu. But now he is back, and \neveryone has forgotten. The same kind of thing is happening in Cuba. \nDay in and day out innocent people who want the same things out of life \nthat you and I enjoy, and those are the basic principles and the \nfreedoms that we enjoy--the freedom of assembly, the freedom of \nreligion, the freedom to pursue your own livelihood--and yet we are, in \nessence, not willing to stand up and fight for those individuals \nbecause of the commercial interest that exists throughout the world. I \nunderstand it. I reject it. I wish it was not there. But I think we \nought to recognize it because that is what is driving a lot of this \ndebate.\n  I would hope that just occasionally there would be an opportunity for \nthe nobles of the world to say just once in this one case, ``I am \nwilling to give up the opportunity for profit, the opportunity for \ngrowth in my company, give up those opportunities so that other \nindividuals that we do not know, never will meet, but who have \nstruggled for the same kinds of freedom and liberty that we enjoy \ntoday.'' And I certainly would hope that this Congress will pass this \nlegislation so that we can provide a message of hope to the people of \nCuba.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Cuban Liberty and \nDemocratic Solidarity Act of 1995. I believe this legislation will \nencourage the holding of free and fair democratic elections in Cuba. It \nwill provide a policy framework for United States support to the Cuban \npeople in response to the formation of a transition government or a \ndemocratically elected government in Cuba. This bill will also protect \nthe rights of U.S. persons who own claims to confiscated property \nabroad.\n  I believe this legislation will expedite the transition to a \ndemocratic government in Cuba. Whether you are for or against this \nbill, no one disagrees that this should be the policy of our \ngovernment. Denying United States visas to those who trade with Cuba \nand discouraging International Financial Institutions assistance to \nCuba are necessary steps that will strengthen the embargo and bring \nabout the downfall of the Castro regime.\n  One of the significant provisions of this bill is the section dealing \nwith property. It is difficult to accept the argument that Fidel \nCastro's confiscation of property belonging to naturalized citizens \nshould not be subject to a remedy under the domestic laws of the United \nStates. Confiscations of property belonging to U.S. nationals at the \ntime of the taking clearly violated international law. These takings \nwere done to retaliate against U.S. nationals for acts of the U.S. \nGovernment, and the takings were without the payment of adequate and \neffective compensation.\n  While courts have generally not recognized actions of foreign \ngovernments against its own citizens, international human rights law \ndoes recognize that in certain circumstances a state violates \ninternational law when it confiscates the property of either its own \ncitizens or aliens based on some invidious category such a race, \nnationality, or political opinion. Some legal scholars have noted that \nthe international community may be moving toward recognition of claims \nwhen confiscations or expropriations are the result of such \ndiscrimination.\n  The stories of property confiscation in Cuba are repugnant. The \nconfiscations of Cuban-owned property were based on such obscene \ngrounds as an owner's having committed ``offenses defined by law as \ncounter-revolutionary.''\n  I believe this legislation establishes the framework by which Cuba \nwill become a democratic nation. I have heard from many in the Cuban-\nAmerican community who spend the majority of their time working to \nrealize this objective. This legislation honors the hard work of these \nfighters of freedom and I encourage my colleagues to support final \npassage. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO SAM NUNN\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise not to speak on this bill but \nto do two things. First, to say a few words and share my respect and \nadmiration for the senior Senator from Georgia. And, second to share \nsome of my reflections of the past year and where I think we seem to be \nheading with the reconciliation bill.\n  Mr. President, I do not serve on a committee with the senior Senator \nfrom Georgia, but I do try to listen to the floor when I am in the \noffice. I have a very simple test, I either turn the sound up or down \nor off depending on the merit I find in the discussion. I have always \nturned the sound up to listen to Senator Sam Nunn. And, what I have \nheard is an intelligent, a reasoned, and a very informed person who has \nbrought a great deal to bear in the debates on the Senate floor. He has \nbeen a strong and tireless advocate for a national defense policy that \nis well thought out, for foreign policy that explores each issue as \npart of a whole policy situation and not a separate stand-alone issue.\n  His ability, I think, to see individual defense programs or foreign \npolicy actions as part of the total debate has given him the ability to \nthink independently of party and the daily public opinion poll and put \nforth a policy that is really important.\n  I will miss him greatly. I very much regret his decision to retire \nfrom the U.S. Senate. I think it is to the Senate's loss when we lose \none of our great minds.\n  The distinguished Senator has been an advocate for a strong national \ndefense, especially pushing for a well-trained and modern force. He has \nconstantly lent his support to support programs which would better \nprepare our men and women in uniform for war, but moreover for \noperations-other-than-war including humanitarian missions.\n  His leadership in foreign policy is marked, as well. He has been the \nsingle strongest voice for lessening the threat of nuclear \nproliferation from the States of the former Soviet Union with the \npolicies advanced under the Nunn-Lugar program. And, he has helped our \nrelationship with the new Russia and the nations of Eastern Europe \nthrough his ideas on NATO expansion and the Partnership for Peace \nProgram.\n  Senator Nunn will continue to remain a voice of moderation and \nindependent thought throughout the remainder of his term. I will miss \nhis contributions to some of the most important issues of our day and \nthis body will miss his leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/11/senate-section/article/S15005-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15023-S15025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE RECONCILIATION BILL\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, over the past 200 years, almost 2,000 \nmen and women have stood in this Chamber charged with the task of \ngoverning the greatest democracy in the world. They were, like us, men \nand women of ideals and principle. This Chamber is also no stranger to \nrevolutionary winds and radical ideas.\n  Some ideas dissipate quickly; others stand like pillars in our \nNation's history. One thing has held true over time, most ideals will \nnot withstand the rigors of the democratic process if they do not hold \ntrue to the democratic promise: The promise of opportunity for those \nwilling to earn it, the promise of freedom for those willing to protect \nit, and the promise of security for those who play by the rules and \ngive their fair share. \n\n[[Page S 15024]]\n\n  And these ideals, once implemented, must also withstand the test of \ntime, which brings us to where we are today: Reexamining institutions \nand programs, cutting or streamlining where possible, eliminating where \nnecessary. We have done some important work this year, and I commend \nthe party in power for that. But I am deeply troubled by the direction \nof some of these changes and the extremes to which this Congress seems \nto be headed.\n  The American people voted for change in 1992 and in 1994. They \nclearly wanted a smaller, more efficient Government. They wanted a \nbetter use of their tax dollars. But they did not vote for the \nwholesale dismantling of Government. Laws that protect public safety, \neducation, and access to basic health care are all critically needed \nand supported by the public we serve.\n  Some of the proposals being put forth in this Congress seem less like \nneeded reform and more like revolution for revolution's sake. They go \nbeyond reason and, I believe, beyond the wishes of the American people.\n  If moderation does not prevail, this level of extremism will \nultimately take our country backward, not forward, and the damage will \nbe felt not by us, but by generations to come.\n  Examples of the kind of extremism which seems to have gripped some in \nthis Congress are littered throughout major bills we have dealt with \nthis year, from regulatory reform to appropriations bills, to obscure \nlanguage added to defense authorization bills, and to the upcoming \nreconciliation bill. But some of the most onerous and most blatant \nextremism is reserved for the upcoming Medicaid and Medicare plans. Let \nme give you examples of my concerns.\n  Medicaid is the safety net, a true safety net, for 36 million \nAmericans. Does Medicaid need to be reformed? Yes, but you do not get \nthere by simply cutting off the most vulnerable people from access to \nfundamental health care.\n  Six million Americans who are disabled rely on Medicaid for their \nhealth care. Because they have long-term, complex and expensive health \nconditions, they cannot buy private insurance. Medicaid is often the \nonly health insurance available for this population. Yet, both the \nSenate and the House bills could jeopardize coverage for the disabled.\n  Nationally, 15 percent of Medicare beneficiaries rely on help from \nMedicaid to cover the required copayments. The Senate bill would allow \nStates to remove such coverage, leaving millions of the poorest seniors \nquite possibly unable to pay their share of Medicare costs.\n  The House bill would also eliminate guaranteed coverage for children \nwhose health insurance is Medicaid. Twenty percent of the Nation's \nchildren rely on Medicaid for basic health needs--immunizations, \nemergency care, regular checkups. This makes no sense to me, fiscal or \nmoral.\n  What is revolutionary about regressing on quality and safety \nstandards in nursing homes? Twenty years ago, Congress reacted to the \nappalling state of our country's seniors who resided in nursing homes: \nelderly patients strapped to their beds against their will, patients \nbeing fed dog food and drugs, lice-infested bed sheets. These pictures \nare not even old enough to fade from memory yet.\n  I well remember conditions in the early seventies that my sisters and \nI found when we went to look at some 40 San Francisco Bay Area nursing \nhomes for my mother who had chronic brain syndrome--a deterioration of \nthe brain that covers memory, reason, and judgment.\n  I remember the stench of urine, seniors strapped to wheelchairs, poor \nfood, and on and on. We were lucky then to find 1 home out of 40 that \nwe visited that had a level of care that was appropriate for my mother, \nand she lived there for 7 years.\n  The call for national standards then was loud, clear and bipartisan. \nIn fact, the standards now in place were supported by both parties and \nsigned into law by then-President Ronald Reagan.\n  Have we really so soon forgotten these lessons? In our extreme zeal \nto get Government off our backs, are we really willing to subject the \nnext generation of seniors to the same degradations all over again?\n  Another aspect of the House Republican Medicaid plan that I believe \ngoes beyond the bounds of reason is the repeal of protections against \nspousal impoverishment. A woman today who cannot afford the cost of \nnursing home care for her husband with Alzheimer's already must spend \ndown her own resources to low levels in order to qualify for Medicaid.\n  Current law allows her to retain up to $14,961 in income to remain \nliving independently, and prohibits States from imposing liens on homes \nof nursing home residents. The House bill eliminates these protections, \nprotections which allow her to keep her car, her home, and enough money \nto pay her heating bills while paying for her husband's nursing home \ncare with Medicaid assistance.\n  Over 10.5 million Californians, nearly one-third of my State's \nresidents, have incomes less than 200 percent of the poverty line. \nThese families are one tragedy, one major illness, one job loss away \nfrom not making it. Removing the only thing that stands between these \nfamilies and bankruptcy is not reform, it is extreme, and it is \nunconscionable.\n  The Republican proposal cuts Medicare by $270 billion. That is not \njust extreme, I think it is disingenuous. The $270 billion in cuts is \nnot going to the deficit. It is not being used to save Medicare. It is \ngoing to give tax breaks to the wealthy, and it is going to raise taxes \nfor the poor.\n  Only $89 billion is needed to make the part A trust fund of Medicare \nsolvent. That is what becomes insolvent in the year 2002. But cuts are \nalso made in part B, which has nothing to do with the trust fund, and \nthe reason for this is, in part, it would seem, to give a capital gains \ntax cut.\n  A capital gains tax cut largely benefits people who earn incomes of \nover $100,000 a year, and I can see reasons for a capital gains tax \ncut--but not by cutting Medicare. That is simply not moral.\n  The cuts to hospitals in part A will have a devastating impact, \nparticularly on public hospitals and teaching hospitals. In my State, \nfor example, the University of California maintains five big teaching \nhospitals. According to them last week, under this plan, they would \nface a net loss of $116.4 million over 7 years. Other California \nhospitals, already facing strapped budgets, would lose an additional $7 \nbillion.\n  The Senate Medicare plan also includes arbitrary cuts in provider \nservices if spending does not meet targeted levels--indiscriminate cuts \nin home health, hospital care, doctor visits and diagnostic tests.\n  Providers have already borne the brunt of congressional budget cuts \nover the last 10 years, and we all know what indiscriminate cuts mean; \nit means fewer doctors serving Medicare patients, and cutbacks in \nservices for those who do.\n  This is not reform, it is a kind of politics, but these politics will \nhurt America's seniors and America's indigent. We can do better than \nthat if moderate heads prevail.\n  I am not one that says only $89 billion should be cut. I recognize \nthat we have to look at other things to balance the budget. I recognize \nthat Medicare and Medicaid are culprits in budget balancing. But let us \ndo it in a way that sees the light of day, that has full discussion, \nthat takes into consideration many views, not just the views of one \npolitical party and, in fact, one branch of that political party.\n  Some of the extremism that I have seen this past year is not just an \nisolated case. Much of the legislation we have worked on takes this \ncountry back. Let me just throw out some of the areas: environmental \nprotection, safety regulations, abortion rights, education.\n  We are not talking about Federal micro-management that can be done \nbetter by States. We are talking about things like clean air, clean \nwater, hazardous waste cleanup, and airline safety.\n  For example, provisions in appropriations bills for the EPA and \nproposed budget cuts would hinder the enforcement of safe drinking \nwater standards for contaminants like cryptosporidium and arsenic in \nwater. Do the American people want this? No. It would prevent EPA from \ntesting for groundwater contamination at underground storage tanks. Do \nthe American people want this? No. It would reduce hazardous waste \ncompliance inspections at Federal facilities, such as Edwards and \n\n[[Page S 15025]]\nVandenberg Air Force Bases, the Department of Energy's Livermore \nLaboratories, San Diego Naval Station, and Sacramento Army Depot. Do \nCalifornians want this? No.\n  It would further delay the cleanup of 230 Superfund sites across this \nNation, including a dozen or more in my State. One of them that would \nbe delayed is called Iron Mountain Mine, located in Redding. It is \ninteresting. It is a mountain that used to be an old copper mine. It \nhas holes in it the height of a 30-story office building because the \nmountain was drilled. When it rains, the water mixes with the chemical \nand it produces sulfuric acid, which drains out into the Trinity River \nand metalizes the river bed. There are a couple of ways of controlling \nit, but they are very expensive. It is a big Superfund site. Is it \nimportant to do it? Of course. This river eventually becomes part of \nthe drinking water for two-thirds of the people in the State of \nCalifornia.\n  But balancing the budget is not all that this agenda is about, \nbecause at the same time many are proposing cutbacks in funds to \nenforce environmental and safety standards, they want to give away \nbillions of dollars in gold and mineral resources owned by American \ntaxpayers to mining companies at a fraction of what they are worth. \nThey want to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil \ndevelopment companies and permit logging on public lands, while waiving \nenvironmental laws that protect those lands.\n  This is not budget cutting; it is ``set-back'' political agenda. \nThese proposals place cost above safety in regulatory reform. To me, \nthis means many safety standards can be challenged because they do not \nmeet the least-cost alternative test, including shoulder belts and rear \nseat belts in cars, airbags in cars, and black boxes on airplanes. It \nmeans critical delays in safety regulations for things like commuter \nairlines and meat inspections. This is not reform; this is an \nabdication of responsibility.\n  This agenda is not about reducing taxes--at least not for everyone. \nWhile some plan to cut Medicare to give a capital gains tax break, they \nalso want to increase taxes for 7.4 million lower income Americans. \nRepublican proposals would reduce the earned-income tax credit for low-\nincome workers and their families, and eliminate it entirely for low-\nincome workers without children.\n  While the Senate proposals would also make cuts in capital gains \ntaxes, a House plan would eliminate $3.5 billion in tax credits for \ndevelopers investing in housing for low and moderate-income families.\n  Education, without an education and skilled work force this country \nwill be nowhere. We cannot compete in a global marketplace. We all \nagree with that, regardless of party. Yet, there are efforts to cut the \nnumber of students receiving Pell Grants, to eliminate the direct \nstudent loan program, to tax colleges for every student that receives a \nFederal loan, to eliminate the AmeriCorps Program, which provides money \nfor college to more than 4 million youngsters who serve their \ncommunities over the next 7 years.\n  This is not about getting Government off of our backs. We see attacks \non a woman's right to choose everywhere in these bills--from preventing \nwomen in the military from using their own funds to pay for an abortion \nat military hospitals overseas, to preventing the District of Columbia \nfrom using its own locally-raised tax dollars to provide abortions for \npoor women, to denying Federal employees access to abortion services in \ntheir health benefits--an option available to all nongovernment \nemployees--to the most insidious of all: House measures, and an \nexpected Senate measure, to make Medicaid funding of abortion optional \nfor States even in cases of rape and incest.\n  This is not reform, it is a step backward in time to the days we all \nremember well, where desperate women were forced to seek medical \ntreatment in back allies. I remember it. I remember college dormitory \nstudents passing the plate so an 18 year old woman could go to Mexico \nfor an abortion. There is no other way of describing this, except \nextremism.\n  The irony of the reconciliation bill is that it will contain many of \nthese things. And our process, theoretically, is designed on big issues \nto have full discussion and debate. That is what this Senate is \nsupposed to be all about. Some of these issues will have little public \nhearing. They will be limited to 20 hours of debate. These extreme \nproposals can set back our Nation, and they most certainly will impact \nthe future of tens of millions of Americans.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/11/senate-section/article/S15023-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CUBAN LIBERTY AND DEMOCRATIC SOLIDARITY (LIBERTAD) ACT OF 1995\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. HELMS.

In general, the CAA applies the rights and \n     protections of eleven federal labor and employment law \n     statutes to covered employees and employing offices within \n     the legislative branch. Section 203(a) of the CAA applies the \n     rights and protections of subsections (a)(1) and (d) of \n     section 6, section 7, and section 12(c) of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1) and (d), 207, \n     212(c) to covered employees and employing offices. Section \n     203(c) of the CAA directs the Board of Directors of the \n     Office of Compliance established under the CAA to issue \n     regulations to implement the section. Section 203(c)(2) \n     further states that such regulations, with the exception of \n     certain irregular work schedule regulations to be issued \n     under section 203(a)(3), ``shall be the same as substantive \n     regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) except \n     insofar as the Board may determine, for good cause shown and \n     stated together with the regulation, that a modification of \n     such regulations would be more effective for the \n     implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section.'' Section 203(a)(2) of the CAA provides that ``the \n     term `covered employee' [for the purpose of FLSA rights and \n     protections] does not include an intern as defined in \n     regulations * * *'' issued by the Board pursuant to section \n     203(c).\n       Background: Part A--Interns: Part A of the proposed \n     regulations defines the term ``intern.''\n       While there appears to be no definitive interpretation of \n     the term ``intern'' for FLSA purposes in current House usage, \n     the Board has consulted several House sources in formulating \n     the proposed definition set forth herein. For example, the \n     House Ethics Manual gives the following definition of the \n     term ``intern'':\n       ``An intern means an individual performing services in a \n     House office on a temporary basis incidental to the pursuit \n     of the individual's educational objectives. Some interns \n     receive no compensation from any source, while some receive \n     compensation or other assistance from an educational \n     institution or other sponsoring entity.''\n\n     House Comm. on Standards of Official Conduct, House Ethics \n     Manual, a p. 196 (1992)(``Ethics Manual''). See also \n     ``Guidance on Intern, Volunteer and Fellow Programs,'' dated \n     June 29, 1990, reprinted at Ethics Manual, p. 206 (utilizing \n     identical definition). It is from these background materials \n     that the proposed definition has been drawn. The proposed \n     regulation is not intended to cover other similar job \n     positions such as volunteers or fellows, nor does it cover \n     pages.\n       Part A--Interns: Section 1. An intern is an individual who:\n       (a) is performing services in an employing office as part \n     of the pursuit of the individual's educational objectives, \n     and\n       (b) is appointed on a temporary basis for a period not to \n     exceed one academic semester (including the period between \n     semesters); provided that an intern may be reappointed for \n     one succeeding temporary period.\n       Background: Part B--Irregular Work Schedules: Section \n     203(c)(3) of the Act directs the Board to issue regulations \n     for employees ``whose work schedules directly depend on the \n     schedule of the House of Representatives or the Senate that \n     shall be comparable to the provisions of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938 that apply to employees who have \n     irregular work schedules.''\n       Section 7(f) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. \n     207(f)) provides that ``No employer shall be deemed to have \n     violated subsection (a) [requiring overtime pay after an \n     employee has worked 40 hours in a workweek] by employing any \n     employee in a workweek in excess of the maximum workweek \n     applicable [currently 40 hours] if such employee is employed \n     pursuant to a bona fide individual contract, or pursuant to \n     an agreement made as a result of collective bargaining by \n     representatives of employees, if the duties of such employee \n     necessitate irregular hours of work and the contract or \n     agreement (1) specifies a regular rate of pay not less than \n     the minimum provided in * * * section 6 [currently set at \n     $4.25 per hour] * * * and compensation at not less than one \n     and one-half times that rate for all hours worked in excess \n     of such maximum workweek and (2) provides a weekly guarantee \n     of pay for not more than sixty hours based on the rates so \n     specified.'' Part B of the proposed regulations implements \n     the provisions of section 203(a)(3) of the CAA by developing \n     FLSA overtime pay requirements for employees of covered \n     employing offices whose schedules directly depend on the \n     schedule of the House of Representatives.\n       The proposed regulation develops a standard for determining \n     whether an individual's work schedule ``directly depends'' on \n     the schedule of the House of Representatives. In setting the \n     remaining requirements for such employees, the proposed \n     regulations adopt almost verbatim the requirements of \n     sections 7(f) and 7(o) of the FLSA, (29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 207(f) and (o)).\n       Section 203(a)(3) directs the Board to adopt regulations \n     ``comparable'' to the irregular work provisions of the FLSA. \n     Section 2 of the proposed regulation incorporates the \n     provisions of section 7(f) of the FLSA. The Board has not \n     proposed to vary the requirements of section 7(f) because the \n     Board is not currently aware of any working conditions which \n     would require modification of the requirements for covered \n     employees who work irregular hours, as compared to employees \n     who work irregular hours in the private sector. However, \n     there may be aspects to the House of Representatives' \n     operations, such as very wide variations in weekly hours of \n     work of some covered employees whose schedules directly \n     depend on the schedule of the House of Representatives or \n     times when such employees may work a large number of overtime \n     hours for extended periods, which commentors may believe \n     would require a modification of the proposed regulation. \n     Accordingly, the Board invites comments on whether the \n     contracts or agreements referenced in Section 2 of the \n     proposed regulation can or should be permitted to provide for \n     a guaranty of pay for more than 60 hours and whether the \n     terms and use of such contracts or agreements should differ \n     in some other manner from those permitted in the private \n     sector. The Board further invites comment on whether and to \n     what extent the regulations in this subpart may and should \n     vary in any other respect from the provisions of section 7(f) \n     of the FLSA.\n       The Board also invites comment on whether this proposed \n     regulation should be considered the sole irregular work \n     schedule provision applicable to covered employees or \n     whether, in addition, section 203 of the CAA applies the \n     irregular hours provision of section 7(f) of the FLSA with \n     respect to covered employees whose work schedules do not \n     directly depend on the schedule of the House or Senate.\n       Pursuant to section 203(a)(3) of the CAA, the proposed \n     regulation also authorizes employing offices to compensate \n     covered employees with compensatory time off in lieu of \n     overtime compensation where such employees' work schedules \n     meet the irregular schedule definition of Section 1 of the \n     proposed regulation. The Secretary of Labor has not \n     promulgated regulations regarding the receipt of compensatory \n     time in lieu of overtime compensation by employees who work \n     irregular work schedules and no comparable authority exists \n     for employees covered by the FLSA in the private sector to \n     accrue compensatory time in lieu of paid overtime. The \n     proposed regulation's terms regarding compensatory time are \n     derived from the provisions of section 7(o) of the FLSA which \n     permits public employers to continue the practice of \n     providing compensatory time in lieu of monetary payment for \n     overtime worked. The Board is not currently aware of any \n     working conditions in the House of Representatives which \n     would require a different approach to the accrual and use of \n     compensatory time than that applied to public employers and \n     employees under the FLSA. However, there may be aspects of \n     the House's operations which commentors may believe warrant a \n     different approach.\n       Section 7(o) was incorporated into the FLSA as part of the \n     Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1985. The legislative \n     history of those amendments reflects that the amendments \n     ``respond[ed] to [concerns of state and local governments] by \n     adjusting certain FLSA principles with respect to employees \n     of states and their political subdivisions.''

In this regard there was a recognition \n     that ``the financial costs of coming into compliance with the \n     FLSA--particularly the overtime provisions of section 7--\n     [were] a matter of grave concern'' and that ``many state and \n     local government employers and their employees voluntarily \n     [had] worked out arrangements providing for compensatory time \n     off in lieu of pay for hours worked beyond the normally \n     scheduled work week.

To the extent practicable, [Congress \n     sought] to accommodate such arrangements''. Id. at 8-9. In \n     arriving at the maximum number of hours that could be \n     accrued, the original Senate bill provided for a cap of 480 \n     hours of compensatory time for all employees. The House \n     proposed a cap of 180 hours for all employees except public \n     safety employees, who would be permitted to accrual 480 \n     hours. The current provisions of section 7(o) were agreed to \n     in conference. See H.R. CONF. Rep. No. 357, 99th Cong., 1st \n     Sess. 8 (1985), reprinted in 1985 U.S.C.C.A.N. 669.\n       The Board invites comment on whether and to what extent \n     Section 7(o) is an appropriate model for the Board's \n     regulations. The Board also invites comment, if Section 7(o) \n     does provide an appropriate model, on whether and to what \n     extent the regulations, including the accrual and use of \n     compensatory time off and the limits on the maximum number of \n     hours that can be accrued, should vary from the provisions of \n     section 7(o) of the FLSA.\n       Part B--Irregular Work Schedules: Section 1. For the \n     purposes of this Part, a covered employee's work schedule \n     ``directly depends'' on the schedule of the House of \n     Representatives only if the employee's normal workweek \n     arrangement requires that the employee be scheduled to work \n     during the hours that the House is in session and the \n     employee may not schedule vacation, personal or other leave \n     or time off during those hours, absent emergencies and leaves \n     mandated by law. A covered employee's schedule ``directly \n     depends'' on the schedule of the House of Representatives \n     under the above definition regardless of the employee's \n     schedule on days when the House is not in session. \n\n[[Page S 15027]]\n\n       Section 2. No employing office shall be deemed to have \n     violated section 203(a)(1) of the CAA, which applies the \n     protections of section 7(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards \n     Act (``FLSA'') to covered employees and employing offices, by \n     employing any employee for a workweek in excess of the \n     maximum workweek applicable to such employee under section \n     7(a) of the FLSA if such employee is employed pursuant to a \n     bona fide individual contract, or pursuant to an agreement \n     made as a result of collective bargaining by representatives \n     of employees, if the employee's work schedule directly \n     depends on the schedule of the House of Representatives \n     within the meaning of Section 1, and the contract or \n     agreement (1) specifies a regular rate of pay of not less \n     than the minimum hourly rate provided in subsection (a) of \n     section 6 of the FLSA and compensation at not less than one \n     and one-half times such rate for all hours worked in excess \n     of such maximum workweek [currently 40 hours], and (2) \n     provides a weekly guaranty of pay for not more than sixty \n     hours based on the rates of pay so specified.\n       Section 3. Covered employees whose work schedules directly \n     depend on the schedule of the House of Representatives within \n     the meaning of Section 1 must be compensated for all hours \n     worked in excess of the maximum workweek applicable to such \n     employees at time-and-a-half either in pay or in time off, \n     pursuant to the relevant collective bargaining agreement, \n     employment agreement or understanding arrived at before the \n     performance of the work. However, those employees employed \n     under a contract or agreement under Section 2 may be \n     compensated in time off only for hours worked in excess of \n     the weekly guaranty. In the case of a covered employee hired \n     prior to the effective date of this regulation, the regular \n     practice in effect immediately prior to the effective date \n     with respect to the grant of compensatory time off in lieu of \n     the receipt of overtime compensation shall constitute an \n     agreement or understanding for purposes of this section. A \n     covered employee under this section may not accrue \n     compensatory time in excess of 240 hours of compensatory time \n     for hours worked, except that if the work of such employee \n     for which compensatory time may be provided includes work in \n     a public safety activity, an emergency response activity or \n     seasonal activity, the employee may accrue not more than 480 \n     hours of compensatory time. Any employee who has accrued the \n     maximum hours of compensatory time off shall, for additional \n     overtime hours of work, be paid overtime compensation. If \n     compensation is paid to an employee for accrued compensatory \n     time, such compensation shall be paid at the regular rate \n     earned by the employee at the time the employee receives such \n     payment. The employee shall be permitted by the employing \n     office to use compensatory time within a reasonable period \n     after making the request if the use of such time does not \n     unduly disrupt the operations of the employing office.\n       An employee who has accrued compensatory time authorized by \n     this Section shall, upon termination of employment, be paid \n     for the unused compensatory time at a rate of compensation \n     not less than (A) the average regular rate received by such \n     employee during the last 3 years of the employee's \n     employment, or (B) the final regular rate received by such \n     employee, whichever is higher.\n       Method of Approval:\n       The Board recommends that these regulations be approved by \n     resolution of the House of Representatives.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C., on this 10th day of October, \n     1995.\n\n                                                Glen D.

Mr. President, pursuant to section 304(b) of the \nCongressional Accountability Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. sec. 1384(b)), a \nnotice of proposed rulemaking was submitted by the Office of \nCompliance, U.S. Congress. The notice relates to the Congressional \nAccountability Act and the Extension of Rights and Protections under \nthe Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as applied to interns and \nirregular work schedules in all employing offices except the Senate and \nthe House of Representatives.\n  Section 304(b) requires this notice to be printed in the \nCongressional Record, therefore I ask unanimous consent that the notice \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the notice was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995: Extension of Rights and \n   Protections Under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (Interns; \n                       Irregular Work Schedules)\n\n\n                     NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING\n\n       Summary: The Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance \n     is publishing proposed rules to implement section 203(a)(2) \n     and 203(c)(3) of the Congressional Accountability Act (P.L. \n     104-1). The proposed regulations, which are to be applied to \n     all covered employees and employing offices except the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives and employees of the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives, set forth the \n     recommendations of the Executive Director, Office of \n     Compliance, as approved by the Board of Directors, Office of \n     Compliance.\n       Dates: Comments are due within 30 days after publication of \n     this notice in the Congressional Record.\n       Addresses: Submit written comments to the Chair of the \n     Board of Directors, Office of Compliance, Room LA 200, \n     Library of Congress, Washington, DC 20540-1999.

Comments may \n     also be transmitted by facsimile (``FAX'') machine to (202) \n     252-3115. This is not a toll-free call. Copies of comments \n     submitted by the public will be available for review at the \n     Law Library Reading Room, Room LM-201, Law Library of \n     Congress, James Madison Memorial Building, Washington, DC, \n     Monday through Friday, between the hours of 9:30 a.m. and \n     4:00 p.m.\n       For Further Information Contact: Executive Director, Office \n     of Compliance at (202) 252-3100. This notice is also \n     available in the following formats: large print, braille, \n     audio tape, and electronic file on computer disk. Requests \n     for this notice in an alternative format should be made to \n     Mr. Russell Jackson, Director, Service Department, Office of \n     the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate, (202) 244-\n     2705.\n       Supplementary Information: Background--General: The \n     Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA''), PL 104-1, \n     was enacted into law on January 23, 1995. In general, the CAA \n     applies the rights and protections of eleven federal labor \n     and employment law statutes to covered employees and \n     employing offices within the legislative branch. Section \n     203(a) of the CAA applies the rights and protections of \n     subsections (a)(1) and (d) of section 6, section 7, and \n     section 12(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 \n     U.S.C. 206(a)(1) and (d), 207, 212(c), to covered employees \n     and employing offices. Section 203(c) of the CAA directs the \n     Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance established \n     under the CAA to issue regulations to implement the section. \n     Section 203(c)(2) further states that such regulations, with \n     the exception of certain irregular work schedule regulations \n     to be issued under section 203(a)(3), ``shall be the same as \n     substantive regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor to \n     implement the statutory provisions referred to in subsection \n     (a) except insofar as the Board may determine, for good cause \n     shown and stated together with the regulation, that a \n     modification of such regulations would be more effective for \n     the implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section.'' Section 203(a)(2) of the CAA provides that ``the \n     term `covered employee' [for the purpose of FLSA rights and \n     protections] does not include an intern as defined in \n     regulations. . .'' issued by the Board pursuant to section \n     203(c).\n       Background: Part A--Interns: Part A of the proposed \n     regulations defines the term ``intern.''\n       While there appears to be no definitive interpretation of \n     the term ``intern'' for FLSA purposes in current House usage, \n     the Board has consulted several sources in formulating the \n     proposed definition set forth herein. For example, the House \n     Ethics Manual gives the following definition of the term \n     ``intern'':\n       ``An intern means an individual performing services in a \n     House office on a temporary basis incidental to the pursuit \n     of the individual's educational objectives. Some interns \n     receive no compensation from any source, while some receive \n     compensation or other assistance from an educational \n     institution or other sponsoring entity.''\n\n     House Comm. on Standards of Official Conduct, House Ethics \n     Manual, a p. 196 (1992)(``Ethics Manual''). See also \n     ``Guidance on Intern, Volunteer and Fellow Programs,'' dated \n     June 29, 1990, reprinted at Ethics Manual, p. 206 (utilizing \n     identical definition).\n       Interpretive Ruling No. 442 issued by the Senate Select \n     Committee on Ethics on April 15, 1992, states that intern \n     programs designed for the educational benefit of the \n     participants are deemed to be '`officially connected'' \n     expenses that are related to the performance of a Senator's \n     official responsibilities and that the supervising Senator is \n     responsible for determining if such program ``is primarily \n     for the benefit of the intern.'' Similarly, the Senate \n     Edition of the Congressional Handbook (1994) (``Senate \n     Handbook'') states that ``Interns may be employed on a \n     temporary basis for a few weeks to several months...''. \n     (Senate Handbook at p. I-10)\n       The proposed definition has drawn upon these sources. This \n     proposed regulation is not intended to cover other similar \n     job positions such as volunteers or fellows, nor does it \n     cover pages.\n       Part A--Interns: Section 1. An intern is an individual who:\n       (a) is performing services in an employing office as part \n     of the pursuit of the individual's educational objectives, \n     and\n       (b) is appointed on a temporary basis for a period not to \n     exceed one academic semester (including the period between \n     semesters); provided that an intern may be reappointed for \n     one succeeding temporary period.\n       Background: Part B--Irregular Work Schedules: \n\n[[Page S 15028]]\n\n       Section 203(c)(3) of the Act directs the Board to issue \n     regulations for employees ``whose work schedules directly \n     depend on the schedule of the House of Representatives or the \n     Senate that shall be comparable to the provisions of the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act of 1938 that apply to employees who have \n     irregular work schedules.''\n       Section 7(f) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. \n     207(f)) provides that ``No employer shall be deemed to have \n     violated subsection (a) [requiring overtime pay after an \n     employee has worked 40 hours in a workweek] by employing any \n     employee in a workweek in excess of the maximum workweek \n     applicable [currently 40 hours] if such employee is employed \n     pursuant to a bona fide individual contract, or pursuant to \n     an agreement made as a result of collective bargaining by \n     representatives of employees, if the duties of such employee \n     necessitate irregular hours of work and the contract or \n     agreement (1) specifies a regular rate of pay not less than \n     the minimum provided in . . . section 6 [currently set at \n     $4.25 per hour] . . . and compensation at not less than one \n     and one-half times that rate for all hours worked in excess \n     of such maximum workweek and (2) provides a weekly guarantee \n     of pay for not more than sixty hours based on the rates so \n     specified.'' Part B of the proposed regulations implements \n     the provisions of section 203(a)(3) of the CAA by developing \n     FLSA overtime pay requirements for employees of covered \n     employing offices whose schedules directly depend on the \n     schedule of the House of Representatives or the Senate.\n       The proposed regulation develops a standard for determining \n     whether an individual's work schedule ``directly depends'' on \n     the schedule of the House of Representatives or the Senate. \n     In setting the remaining requirements for such employees, the \n     proposed regulations adopt almost verbatim the requirements \n     of sections 7(f) and 7(o) of the FLSA, (29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 207(f) and (o)).\n       Section 203(a)(3) directs the Board to adopt regulations \n     ``comparable'' to the irregular work provisions of the FLSA. \n     Section 2 of the proposed regulation incorporates the \n     provisions of section 7(f) of the FLSA. The Board has not \n     proposed to vary the requirements of section 7(f) because the \n     Board is not currently aware of any working conditions which \n     would require modification of the requirements for covered \n     employees who work irregular hours, as compared to employees \n     who work irregular hours in the private sector. However, \n     there may be aspects to the House of Representatives' or the \n     Senate's operations, such as very wide variations in weekly \n     hours of work of some covered employees whose schedules \n     directly depend on the schedule of the House or Senate or \n     times when such employees may work a large number of overtime \n     hours for extended periods, which commentors may believe \n     would require a modification of the proposed regulation. \n     Accordingly, the Board invites comments on whether the \n     contracts or agreements referenced in Section 2 of the \n     proposed regulation can or should be permitted to provide for \n     a guaranty of pay for more than 60 hours and whether the \n     terms and use of such contracts or agreements should differ \n     in some other manner from those permitted in the private \n     sector. The Board further invites comment on whether and to \n     what extent the regulations in this subpart may and should \n     vary in any other respect from the provisions of section 7(f) \n     of the FLSA.\n       The Board also invites comment on whether this proposed \n     regulation should be considered the sole irregular work \n     schedule provision applicable to covered employees or \n     whether, in addition, section 203 of the CAA applies the \n     irregular hours provision of section 7(f) of the FLSA with \n     respect to covered employees whose work schedules do not \n     directly depend on the schedule of the House or Senate.\n       Pursuant to section 203(a)(3) of the CAA, the proposed \n     regulation also authorizes employing offices to compensate \n     covered employees with compensatory time off in lieu of \n     overtime compensation where such employees' work schedules \n     meet the irregular schedule definition of Section 1 of the \n     proposed regulation. The Secretary of Labor has not \n     promulgated regulations regarding the receipt of compensatory \n     time in lieu of overtime compensation by employees who work \n     irregular work schedules and no comparable authority exists \n     for employees covered by the FLSA in the private sector to \n     accrue compensatory time in lieu of paid overtime. The \n     proposed regulation's terms regarding compensatory time are \n     derived from the provisions of section 7(o) of the FLSA which \n     permits public employers to continue the practice of \n     providing compensatory time in lieu of monetary payment for \n     overtime worked. The Board is not currently aware of any \n     working conditions in the House of Representatives or the \n     Senate which would require a different approach to the \n     accrual and use of compensatory time than that applied to \n     public employers and employees under the FLSA. However, there \n     may be aspects of House or Senate operations which commentors \n     may believe warrant a different approach.\n       Section 7(o) was incorporated into the FLSA as part of the \n     Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1985. The legislative \n     history of those amendments reflects that the amendments \n     ``respond[ed] to [concerns of state and local governments] by \n     adjusting certain FLSA principles with respect to employees \n     of states and their political subdivisions.''

In this regard there was a recognition \n     that ``the financial costs of coming into compliance with the \n     FLSA--particularly the overtime provisions of section 7--\n     [were] a matter of grave concern'' and that ``many state and \n     local government employers and their employees voluntarily \n     [had] worked out arrangements providing for compensatory time \n     off in lieu of pay for hours worked beyond the normally \n     scheduled work week.

The House \n     proposed a cap of 180 hours for all employees except public \n     safety employees, who would be permitted to accrual of 480 \n     hours. The current provisions of section 7(o) were agreed to \n     in conference. See H.R. CONF. Rep. No. 357, 99th Cong., 1st \n     Sess. 8 (1985), reprinted in 1985 U.S.C.C.A.N. 669.\n       The Board invites comment on whether and to what extent \n     Section 7(o) is an appropriate model for the Board's \n     regulations. The Board also invites comment, if Section 7(o) \n     does provide an appropriate model, on whether and to what \n     extent the regulations, including the accrual and use of \n     compensatory time off and the limits on the maximum number of \n     hours that can be accrued, should vary from the provisions of \n     section 7(o) of the FLSA.\n       Part B--Irregular Work Schedules: Section 1. For the \n     purposes of this Part, a covered employee's work schedule \n     ``directly depends'' on the schedule of the House of \n     Representatives only if the employee's normal workweek \n     arrangement requires that the employee be scheduled to work \n     during the hours that the House or Senate is in session and \n     the employee may not schedule vacation, personal or other \n     leave or time off during those hours, absent emergencies and \n     leaves mandated by law. A covered employee's schedule \n     ``directly depends'' on the schedule of the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate under the above definition \n     regardless of the employee's schedule on days when the House \n     or Senate is not in session.\n       Section 2. No employing office shall be deemed to have \n     violated section 203(a)(1) of the CAA, which applies the \n     protections of section 7(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards \n     Act (``FLSA'') to covered employees and employing offices, by \n     employing any employee for a workweek in excess of the \n     maximum workweek applicable to such employee under section \n     7(a) of the FLSA if such employee is employed pursuant to a \n     bona fide individual contract, or pursuant to an agreement \n     made as a result of collective bargaining by representatives \n     of employees, if the employee's work schedule directly \n     depends on the schedule of the House of Representatives or \n     the Senate within the meaning of Section 1, and the contract \n     or agreement (1) specifies a regular rate of pay of not less \n     than the minimum hourly rate provided in subsection (a) of \n     section 6 of the FLSA and compensation at not less than one \n     and one-half times such rate for all hours worked in excess \n     of such maximum workweek [currently 40 hours], and (2) \n     provides a weekly guaranty of pay for not more than sixty \n     hours based on the rates of pay so specified.\n       Section 3. Covered employees whose work schedules directly \n     depend on the schedule of the House of Representatives or the \n     Senate within the meaning of Section 1 must be compensated \n     for all hours worked in excess of the maximum workweek \n     applicable to such employees at time-and-a-half either in pay \n     or in time off, pursuant to the relevant collective \n     bargaining agreement, employment agreement or understanding \n     arrived at before the performance of the work. However, those \n     employees employed under a contract or agreement under \n     Section 2 may be compensated in time off only for hours \n     worked in excess of the weekly guaranty. In the case of a \n     covered employee hired prior to the effective date of this \n     regulation, the regular practice in effect immediately prior \n     to the effective date with respect to the grant of \n     compensatory time off in lieu of the receipt of overtime \n     compensation shall constitute an agreement or understanding \n     for purposes of this section. A covered employee under this \n     section may not accrue compensatory time in excess of 240 \n     hours of compensatory time for hours worked, except that if \n     the work of such employee for which compensatory time may be \n     provided includes work in a public safety activity, an \n     emergency response activity or seasonal activity, the \n     employee may accrue not more than 480 hours of compensatory \n     time. Any employee who has accrued the maximum hours of \n     compensatory time off shall, for additional overtime hours of \n     work, be paid overtime compensation. If compensation is paid \n     to an employee for accrued compensatory time, such \n     compensation shall be paid at the regular rate earned by the \n     employee at the time the employee receives such payment. The \n     employee shall be permitted by the employing office to use \n     compensatory time within a reasonable period after making the \n     request if the use of such time does not unduly disrupt the \n     operations of the employing office.\n       An employee who has accrued compensatory time authorized by \n     this Section shall, upon termination of employment, be paid \n     for the unused compensatory time at a rate of compensation \n     not less than (A) the average \n\n[[Page S 15029]]\n     regular rate received by such employee during the last 3 years of the \n     employee's employment, or (B) the final regular rate received \n     by such employee, whichever is higher.\n       Method of Approval:\n       The Board recommends that these regulations be approved by \n     concurrent resolution as neither the House of Representatives \n     nor the Senate has exclusive responsibility for the employing \n     offices covered by these regulations.\n       Signed at Washington, DC, on this 10th day of October, \n     1995.\n                                                Glen D.

This \n     notice is also available in the following formats: large \n     print, braille, audio tape, and electronic file on computer \n     disk. Requests for this notice in an alternative format \n     should be made to Mr. Russell Jackson, Director, Service \n     Department, Office of the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of \n     the Senate, (202) 244-2705.\n       Supplementary Information:\n       Background--General: The Congressional Accountability Act \n     of 1995 (``CAA''), PL 104-1, was enacted into law on January \n     23, 1995. In general, the CAA applies the rights and \n     protections of eleven federal labor and employment law \n     statutes to covered employees and employing offices within \n     the legislative branch. Section 203(a) of the CAA applies the \n     rights and protections of subsections (a)(1) and (d) of \n     section 6, section 7, and section 12(c) of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1) and (d), 207, \n     212(c) to covered employees and employing offices. Section \n     203(c) of the CAA directs the Board of Directors of the \n     Office of Compliance established under the CAA to issue \n     regulations to implement the section. Section 203(c)(2) \n     further states that such regulations, with the exception of \n     certain irregular work schedule regulations to be issued \n     under section 203(a)(3), ``shall be the same as substantive \n     regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) except \n     insofar as the Board may determine, for good cause shown and \n     stated together with the regulation, that a modification of \n     such regulations would be more effective for the \n     implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section.'' Section 203(a)(2) of the CAA provides that ``the \n     term `covered employee' [for the purpose of FLSA rights and \n     protections] does not include an intern as defined in \n     regulations. . .'' issued by the Board pursuant to section \n     203(c).\n       Background: Part A--Interns: Part A of the proposed \n     regulations defines the term ``intern.''\n       While there appears to be no definitive interpretation of \n     the term ``intern'' for FLSA purposes in current Senate \n     usage, in formulating its definition, the Board has consulted \n     several Senate sources that use and define the term. For \n     example, Interpretive Ruling No. 442 issued by the Senate \n     Select Committee on Ethics on April 15, 1992, states that \n     intern programs designed for the educational benefit of the \n     participants are deemed to be ``officially connected'' \n     expenses that are related to the performance of a Senator's \n     official responsibilities and that the supervising Senator is \n     responsible for determining if such program ``is primarily \n     for the benefit of the intern.'' Similarly, the Senate \n     Edition of the Congressional Handbook (1994) (``Senate \n     Handbook'') states that ``Interns may be employed on a \n     temporary basis for a few weeks to several months. . .''. \n     (Senate Handbook at p. I-10) The proposed definition has \n     drawn upon these sources. This proposed regulation is not \n     intended to cover other similar job positions such as \n     volunteers or fellows, nor does it cover pages.\n       Part A--Interns: Section 1. An intern is an individual who:\n       (a) is performing services in an employing office as part \n     of the pursuit of the individual's educational objectives, \n     and\n       (b) is appointed on a temporary basis for a period not to \n     exceed one academic semester (including the period between \n     semesters); provided that an intern may be reappointed for \n     one succeeding temporary period.\n       Section 2. An intern for the purposes of section 203(a)(2) \n     of the Act also includes an individual who is a senior \n     citizen intern appointed under S.Res. 219 (May 5, 1978, as \n     amended by S.Res. 96, April 9, 1991).\n       Background: Part B--Irregular Work Schedules: Section \n     203(c)(3) of the Act directs the Board to issue regulations \n     for employees ``whose work schedules directly depend on the \n     schedule of the House of Representatives or the Senate that \n     shall be comparable to the provisions of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938 that apply to employees who have \n     irregular work schedules.''\n       Section 7(f) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. \n     207(f)) provides that ``No employer shall be deemed to have \n     violated subsection (a) [requiring overtime pay after an \n     employee has worked 40 hours in a workweek] by employing any \n     employee in a workweek in excess of the maximum workweek \n     applicable [currently 40 hours] if such employee is employed \n     pursuant to a bona fide individual contract, or pursuant to \n     an agreement made as a result of collective bargaining by \n     representatives of employees, if the duties of such employee \n     necessitate irregular hours of work and the contract or \n     agreement (1) specifies a regular rate of pay not less than \n     the minimum provided in . . . section 6 [currently set at \n     $4.25 per hour] . . . and compensation at not less than one \n     and one-half times that rate for all hours worked in excess \n     of such maximum workweek and (2) provides a weekly guarantee \n     of pay for not more than sixty hours based on the rates so \n     specified.'' Part B of the proposed regulations implements \n     the provisions of section 203(a)(3) of the CAA by developing \n     FLSA overtime pay requirements for employees of covered \n     employing offices whose schedules directly depend on the \n     schedule of the Senate.\n       The proposed regulation develops a standard for determining \n     whether an individual's work schedule ``directly depends'' on \n     the schedule of the Senate. In setting the remaining \n     requirements for such employees, the proposed regulations \n     adopt almost verbatim the requirements of sections 7(f) and \n     7(o) of the FLSA, (29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 207(f) and (o)).\n       Section 203(a)(3) directs the Board to adopt regulations \n     ``comparable'' to the irregular work provisions of the FLSA. \n     Section 2 of the proposed regulation incorporates the \n     provisions of section 7(f) of the FLSA. The Board has not \n     proposed to vary the requirements of section 7(f) because the \n     Board is not currently aware of any working conditions which \n     would require modification of the requirements for covered \n     employees who work irregular hours, as compared to employees \n     who work irregular hours in the private sector. However, \n     there may be aspects to the Senate's operations, such as very \n     wide variations in weekly hours of work of some covered \n     employees whose schedules directly depend on the schedule of \n     the Senate or times when such employees may work a large \n     number of overtime hours for extended periods, which \n     commentors may believe would require a modification of the \n     proposed regulation. Accordingly, the Board invites comments \n     on whether the contracts or agreements referenced in Section \n     2 of the proposed regulation can or should be permitted to \n     provide for a guaranty of pay for more than 60 hours and \n     whether the terms and use of such contracts or agreements \n     should differ in some other manner from those permitted in \n     the private sector. The Board further invites comment on \n     whether and to what extent the regulations in this subpart \n     may and should vary in any other respect from the provisions \n     of section 7(f) of the FLSA.\n       The Board also invites comment on whether this proposed \n     regulation should be considered the sole irregular work \n     schedule provision applicable to covered employees or \n     whether, in addition, section 203 of the CAA applies the \n     irregular hours provision of section 7(f) of the FLSA with \n     respect to covered employees whose work schedules do not \n     directly depend on the schedule of the House or Senate.\n       Pursuant to section 203(a)(3) of the CAA, the proposed \n     regulation also authorizes employing offices to compensate \n     covered employees with compensatory time off in lieu \n\n[[Page S 15030]]\n     of overtime compensation where such employees' work schedules meet the \n     irregular schedule definition of Section 1 of the proposed \n     regulation. The Secretary of Labor has not promulgated \n     regulations regarding the receipt of compensatory time in \n     lieu of overtime compensation by employees who work irregular \n     work schedules and no comparable authority exists for \n     employees covered by the FLSA in the private sector to accrue \n     compensatory time in lieu of paid overtime. The proposed \n     regulation's terms regarding compensatory time are derived \n     from the provisions of section 7(o) of the FLSA which permits \n     public employers to continue the practice of providing \n     compensatory time in lieu of monetary payment for overtime \n     worked. The Board is not currently aware of any working \n     conditions in the Senate which would require a different \n     approach to the accrual and use of compensatory time than \n     that applied to public employers and employees under the \n     FLSA. However, there may be aspects of the Senate's \n     operations which commentors may believe warrant a different \n     approach.\n       Section 7(o) was incorporated into the FLSA as part of the \n     Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1985. The legislative \n     history of those amendments reflects that the amendments \n     ``respond[ed] to [concerns of state and local governments] by \n     adjusting certain FLSA principles with respect to employees \n     of states and their political subdivisions.'' S. Rep. No. \n     159, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 4 (1985), reprinted in 1985 \n     U.S.C.C.A.N. 651, 655. In this regard there was a recognition \n     that ``the financial costs of coming into compliance with the \n     FLSA--particularly the overtime provisions of section 7--\n     [were] a matter of grave concern `` and that ``many state and \n     local government employers and their employees voluntarily \n     [had] worked out arrangements providing for compensatory time \n     off in lieu of pay for hours worked beyond the normally \n     scheduled work week. These arrangements . . . reflect[ed] \n     mutually satisfactory solutions that [were] both fiscally and \n     socially responsible. To the extent practicable, [Congress \n     sought] to accommodate such arrangements''. Id. at 8-9. In \n     arriving at the maximum number of hours that could be \n     accrued, the original Senate bill provided for a cap of 480 \n     hours of compensatory time for all employees. The House \n     proposed a cap of 180 hours for all employees except public \n     safety employees, who would be permitted to accrual 480 \n     hours. The current provisions of section 7(o) were agreed to \n     in conference. See H.R. CONF. Rep. No. 357, 99th Cong., 1st \n     Sess. 8 (1985), reprinted in 1985 U.S.C.C.A.N. 669.\n       The Board invites comment on whether and to what extent \n     Section 7(o) is an appropriate model for the Board's \n     regulations. The Board also invites comment, if Section 7(o) \n     does provide an appropriate model, on whether and to what \n     extent the regulations, including the accrual and use of \n     compensatory time off and the limits on the maximum number of \n     hours that can be accrued, should vary from the provisions of \n     section 7(o) of the FLSA.\n       Part B--Irregular Work Schedules: Section 1. For the \n     purposes of this Part, a covered employee's work schedule \n     ``directly depends'' on the schedule of the Senate only if \n     the employee's normal workweek arrangement requires that the \n     employee be scheduled to work during the hours that the \n     Senate is in session and the employee may not schedule \n     vacation, personal or other leave or time off during those \n     hours, absent emergencies and leaves mandated by law. A \n     covered employee's schedule ``directly depends'' on the \n     schedule of the Senate under the above definition regardless \n     of the employee's schedule on days when the Senate is not in \n     session.\n       Section 2. No employing office shall be deemed to have \n     violated section 203(a)(1) of the CAA, which applies the \n     protections of section 7(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards \n     Act (``FLSA'') to covered employees and employing offices, by \n     employing any employee for a workweek in excess of the \n     maximum workweek applicable to such employee under section \n     7(a) of the FLSA if such employee is employed pursuant to a \n     bona fide individual contract, or pursuant to an agreement \n     made as a result of collective bargaining by representatives \n     of employees, if the employee's work schedule directly \n     depends on the schedule of the Senate within the meaning of \n     Section 1, and the contract or agreement (1) specifies a \n     regular rate of pay of not less than the minimum hourly rate \n     provided in subsection (a) of section 6 of the FLSA and \n     compensation at not less than one and one-half times such \n     rate for all hours worked in excess of such maximum workweek \n     [currently 40 hours], and (2) provides a weekly guaranty of \n     pay for not more than sixty hours based on the rates of pay \n     so specified.\n       Section 3. Covered employees whose work schedules directly \n     depend on the schedule of the Senate within the meaning of \n     Section 1 must be compensated for all hours worked in excess \n     of the maximum workweek applicable to such employees at time-\n     and-a-half either in pay or in time off, pursuant to the \n     relevant collective bargaining agreement, employment \n     agreement or understanding arrived at before the performance \n     of the work. However, those employees employed under a \n     contract or agreement under Section 2 may be compensated in \n     time off only for hours worked in excess of the weekly \n     guaranty. In the case of a covered employee hired prior to \n     the effective date of this regulation, the regular practice \n     in effect immediately prior to the effective date with \n     respect to the grant of compensatory time off in lieu of the \n     receipt of overtime compensation shall constitute an \n     agreement or understanding for purposes of this section. A \n     covered employee under this section may not accrue \n     compensatory time in excess of 240 hours of compensatory time \n     for hours worked, except that if the work of such employee \n     for which compensatory time may be provided includes work in \n     a public safety activity, an emergency response activity or \n     seasonal activity, the employee may accrue not more than 480 \n     hours of compensatory time. Any employee who has accrued the \n     maximum hours of compensatory time off shall, for additional \n     overtime hours of work, be paid overtime compensation.

and\n       ``Whereas, this amendment did not provide adequate \n     resources to carry out its provisions and targeted only a few \n     of the major types of sources of the pollution affecting \n     visibility; and\n       ``Whereas, as a result, the Federal Government and the \n     individual states were extremely slow in developing an \n     effective program to reduce air pollution in these areas; and\n       ``Whereas, the two emission control programs specifically \n     concerned with visibility in national parks and wilderness \n     areas include the program for Prevention of Significant \n     Deterioration of Air Quality, which is directed mainly at new \n     sources of pollution and a program visibility protection \n     which is primarily aimed at existing sources of pollution; \n     and\n       ``Whereas, the program for Prevention of Significant \n     Deterioration of Air Quality requires that each new or \n     enlarged ``major emitting facility'' locating near large \n     national parks or wilderness areas install the ``best \n     available control technology,'' establish increments \n     (allowable increases) that limit cumulative increase in \n     levels of pollution in clear air areas and to some extent, \n     have protected visibility by reducing the growth of emissions \n     that contribute to regional haze; and\n       ``Whereas, in 1990, the United States General Accounting \n     Office issued a report which discussed some of the \n     shortcomings of the program for Prevention of Significant \n     Deterioration of Air Quality; and\n       ``Whereas, this report indicated that federal land managers \n     had failed to meet their responsibilities because of a lack \n     of allocated time, personnel and data, and because the United \n     States Environmental Protection Agency had failed to forward \n     applications for permits; and\n       ``Whereas, the report indicated that many sources of air \n     pollution in national parks and wilderness areas are exempt \n     from the requirements of the program for Prevention of \n     Significant Deterioration of Air Quality because they are \n     considered minor sources or because they existed before the \n     program for Prevention of Significant Deterioration of Air \n     Quality took effect; and\n       ``Whereas, the other program for visibility protection, \n     established by the amendments to the Clean Air Act of 1977, \n     directs states to establish measures to achieve ``reasonable \n     progress'' toward the national visibility goal and to require \n     the installation of the ``best available retrofit \n     technology'' on large source contributing to air pollution at \n     major national parks and wildlife areas; and\n       ``Whereas, in 1980, the Environmental Protection Agency \n     issued rules to control air pollution caused by visible \n     plumes from nearby individual sources and express its \n     intention to regulate regional haze to some future \n     date ``when improvement in monitoring techniques provides \n     more data on source-specific levels of visibility \n     impairment, regional scale-models become more refined, and \n     scientific knowledge about the relationships between air \n     pollutants and visibility improves''; and\n       ``Whereas, to date, the Environmental Protection Agency has \n     not proposed rules for the regulation of regional haze, but \n     has required only regulation of air pollution that is \n     attributable to individual sources through the use of simple \n     techniques, and in the past 14 years only one source of \n     pollution has been required to control its emissions pursuant \n     to this program; and\n       ``Whereas, it is evident that the Environmental protection \n     Agency has not been required to enforce the visibility \n     provisions of the federal law and this failure should be \n     addressed before any new legislation is passed which \n     penalizes a regional area; and\n       ``Whereas, in 1990, the Clean Air Act was once again \n     amended to include numerous new statutes and amendments to \n     existing statutes which called for more regulation of air \n     quality for the purpose of providing continued and expanded \n     efforts to improve air quality; and\n       ``Whereas, the amendment added Section 169B which provided \n     the mechanism for the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency to establish visibility transport regions \n     and visibility transport commissions; and\n       ``Whereas, that section specifically created The Grand \n     Canyon Visibility Transport Commission which is required to \n     prepare and submit to the Administrator of the Environmental \n     protection Agency by November 15, 1995, a report recommending \n     what measures, if any, should be taken pursuant to the Clean \n     Air Act to address adverse impacts on visibility from \n     potential or projected growth in emissions in the region; and\n       ``Whereas, the report will also discuss the establishment \n     of clean air corridors in which additional restrictions in \n     emissions may be appropriate to protect visibility in \n     affected areas, the imposition of the requirements of the \n     program for Prevention of Significant Deterioration of Air \n     Quality which affect the construction of new or modified \n     major stationary sources in those clean air corridors, the \n     alternative siting analysis provisions as provided in the \n     Clean Air Act, the imposition of nonattainment status \n     requirements within clean air corridors and the adoption of \n     regulations to provide long-range strategies for addressing \n     regional haze which impairs visibility in affected areas; and\n       ``Whereas, a total of $8,000,000 per year for 5 years was \n     authorized for appropriation to the Environmental Protection \n     Agency and other federal agencies to conduct research to \n     identify and evaluate sources and source regions of air \n     pollution as well as regions that provide predominantly clean \n     air to national parks and wilderness areas, but it does not \n     appear that the Environmental Protection Agency has requested \n     or received such an appropriation; and\n       ``Whereas, with the exception of minor federal funding, the \n     Grand Canyon Visibility Transport Commission is an unfunded \n     mandate, and to date, most of the work which has been done \n     pursuant to the mandate is the result of efforts made by \n     state governments, industries and conservation groups; and\n       ``Whereas, for these reasons, the amendments to the Clean \n     Air Act adopted in 1990, including Section 169B, have not \n     been fully implemented and allowed sufficient time to produce \n     their desired effect; and\n       ``Whereas, certain scientific studies, assessments and \n     inventories have shown that air quality in the Intermountain \n     West Region continues to improve even though the amendments \n     adopted in 1990 have not been fully implemented;

A bill to amend chapter 73 of title 31, United States Code, \nto provide for performance standards for block grant programs, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n               THE BLOCK GRANT PERFORMANCE STANDARDS ACT\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I introduce the Block Grant Performance \nStandards Act of 1995. This legislation is intended to provide a \nminimum set of performance standards for all block grants allocating \nFederal funds to States, localities, and other recipients.\n  In the 104th Congress, we have seen a movement toward block grants. \nThe idea behind this movement is that we have too many programs \nproviding funding to other levels of government, and that these \nprograms involve too much paperwork. This reasoning leads to the \nconclusion that if we bundle these programs into broader block grants, \nwe will release other levels of government to better allocate these \nresources without wasting time and money filling out paperwork bound \nfor bureaucrats in Washington.\n  Mr. President, I agree that in many cases some of this reasoning is \ncorrect. To the extent possible, we should try to reduce paperwork and \nincrease flexibility for State and local governments receiving Federal \nfunds. I believe, however, that in creating block grants we must be \nresponsible to taxpayers and resist the temptation to simply turn over \nblank checks to other levels of government. As the elected officials at \nthe Federal level, I believe that we must set up minimal performance \nstandards for the block grants we provide.\n  I am pleased that some of the block grants we are creating do have \naccountability built in. The Chair of the Senate Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources, Senator Kassebaum, for example, has done an admirable \njob of including planning and performance standards for the States' \nadministration of the job training block grants anticipated by S. 143, \nnow before the Senate. I was successful in attaching an amendment to \nthe welfare reform bill approved by the Senate that will provide \nsimilar accountability.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is intended to provide \naccountability standards for all block grant programs. It requires \nentities receiving block grants to submit a plan to the agency \nadministrating the grant program that outlines the goals of the entity \nfor the use of the Federal funds, a description of how the goals will \nbe achieved, and a discussion of performance indicators that will be \nused to measure progress toward those goals. It also ensures public \nparticipation in the development of this plan through the creation of \nappropriate community advisory committees. Finally, it provides for the \nprovision of penalties for entities receiving block grants who \nconsistently do not meet the goals they set for themselves in their \nblock grant plans over a period of 2 years.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this legislation strikes the right \nbalance in ensuring that we meet our fiduciary responsibilities to \nFederal taxpayers and our desire to provide maximum flexibility to \nentities receiving block grants. It builds on the work of others, \nincluding Senator Roth, the sponsor of the Government Performance and \nResults Act of 1993, Public Law 103-62, which set similar performance \nstandards for the Federal Government; and David Osborne, who has \nwritten on the need to develop performance standards for government. It \nalso draws on the work of Senator Hatfield and his legislation to \nimplement flexibility within current programs: S. 88, the Local \nEmpowerment and Flexibility Act of 1995.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nan article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1308\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

And heaven knows, they're superior to narrow \n     categorical grants. But as the time for decisions draws near, \n     it's worth stopping for a moment to ask: Are block grants the \n     best we can do?\n       There is one simple idea missing from the block grant \n     debate of 1995. It's called accountability for results. In \n     their heat to downsize the federal government, the \n     Republicans may miss the best opportunity in a generation to \n     create a federalism that works.\n       We all know that the current federal system, with its 550-\n     plus categorical grant programs, is a mess. We also know from \n     every poll on the issue that the public supports devotion of \n     responsibilities to state and local governments.\n       What we don't know is that block grants are the best \n     solution.\n       Congress's inability to resist creating new categorical \n     grant programs--they sprout up almost like weeds in a \n     garden--has been a problem since the 1960s. By 1991 Congress \n     funded almost 100 social service grant programs, more than 80 \n     health care grant programs and close to 30 grant programs \n     that dealt with housing or development in poor communities.\n       Many of these were for absurdly small amounts--$3 million \n     or $4 million nationally. More than half of the Education \n     Department's 90-odd programs were for less than $15 million.\n       When one department administers so many tiny grant \n     programs, something is wrong. Thousands of public employees, \n     in Washington and in state and local governments, spend \n     countless hours publicizing programs, writing and reviewing \n     grant applications, reporting on how money was spent and \n     audited. Billions of dollars go to the professionals and \n     bureaucrats who do this, rather than the intended recipients: \n     students, poor people, urban residents and the unemployed.\n       For 25 years, the knee-jerk response has been the block \n     grant, which consolidates many categorical grant programs \n     into one grant with--at least theoretically--few strings \n     attached.\n       There is just one problem with this. Block grants are blind \n     to performance. They shower as much money on wasteful, \n     ineffective programs as they do on innovative, cost-effective \n     approaches.\n       We need a third way: block grants in which state and local \n     governments compete in part based on the results they \n     achieve. This kind of model has become common at the state \n     level. Pennsylvania's highly regarded Ben Franklin \n     Partnership, for instance, invented what it calls ``challenge \n     grants'' to fund local economic development centers.\n       The concept is simple, and Congress would be wise to adopt \n     it. Consider the idea of a community development challenge \n     grant, administered by the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development. Under this approach, the federal government \n     would establish broad guidelines, objectives and performance \n     measures. State and/or local governments would then compete \n     for challenge grants based on three criteria:\n       Need: This could be determined by a community's \n     unemployment rate, poverty rate and median income.\n       Quality of strategy: Does the proposed strategy leverage \n     private sector involvement? Does it empower communities to \n     solve more of their own problems? Does it encourage \n     competition and choice? Does it measure and reward results?\n       Results: The federal government would measure the number of \n     jobs created, changes in the poverty and unemployment rates, \n     job placement rates, private investment leveraged, changes in \n     indicators of family health, incidence of graft or corruption \n     and so on.\n       The higher a government ranked on these criteria, the more \n     funding it would receive. Eventually, only two criteria would \n     be necessary: need and results. Until data on results build \n     up, however, HUD could use quality criteria to drive state \n     and local governments toward strategies that have proven more \n     effective than traditional service delivery by public \n     bureaucracies.\n       This approach would cause states and localities to attack \n     the problems federal programs are designed to solve, without \n     dictating the approaches they use. It would tap state and \n     local ingenuity without abandoning federal responsibility.\n       By setting goals, measuring outcomes and rewarding success, \n     challenged grants would push lower levels of governments to \n     come up with strategies that worked. Local entities could \n     focus on their own areas of greatest need and craft their own \n     initiatives, without micromanagement from above. They could \n     not, however, continue to collect their full grants without \n     producing results.\n       The Clinton administration is already testing a version of \n     this model through its ``Oregon Option''--a performance-based \n     contract between the state and several federal departments, \n     first proposed last year by the Alliance for Redesigning \n     Government. HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros has also proposed \n     three performance-based block grants. Yet few Republicans in \n     Congress are listening.\n       The Republicans' impulse to hand money to the states \n     regardless of their performance is particularly ironic given \n     the public's intense demand for more efficient and effective \n     government. Remember, this is federal money, raised through \n     federal taxes to attack national problems that state and \n     local governments will never solve on their own.\n       It is easy to wax poetic about the virtues of state \n     government. But as the author of a book on the subject, \n     ``Laboratories of Democracy,'' I feel compelled to inject \n     some reality.\n       State and local romantics often forget one fact: States, \n     cities and counties must compete to keep their taxes low, \n     lest they drive businesses and wealthy residents away. This \n     is why no state has ever made a sustained investment in \n     combating poverty of crating a viable training system. It is \n     also why no state save Hawaii--separated by thousands of \n     miles of ocean from its neighbors--has ever funded universal \n     health insurance.\n       It is equally ironic that Congress wants to give block \n     grants only to the states. The fact that current proposals \n     ignore local governments is perhaps the most obvious sign of \n     how little thinking their authors have done.\n       Again, a dose of reality: The typical state bureaucracy \n     performs a little better than the typical federal \n     bureaucracy--but not much. Most of the real improvement in \n     performance over the past two decades has come at the local \n     level. In addition, most public services are provided by \n     local governments, not state governments. And the level of \n     government Americans trust most is--you guessed it--local \n     government.\n       If Congress wants to make government work better and cost \n     less, it will control its jerking knee and craft challenge \n     grants aimed at both state and local governments. If it \n     simply wants to make the federal government smaller, it will \n     create block grants for the states. The choice will be \n     revealing.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KERRY\n  S. 1310. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe availability of individual retirement accounts, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            the savings and investment incentive act of 1995\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in these difficult budgetary times \nwe not only \n\n[[Page S 15036]]\nhave a fiscal deficit that we must address, but we also have a savings \ndeficit in this country that requires creative and innovative \napproaches to helping people save and plan for their retirements.\n  That is why I am offering the Savings and Investment Incentive Act of \n1995 which will expand deductible IRA's, create a special nondeductible \nIRA program, allow penalty-free withdrawals for specific reasons; and \nit appeals to our sense of fairness by targeting the middle class.\n  What does this mean? It means that any individual who is not an \nactive participant in a an employee-sponsored plan would be eligible \nfor a deductible IRA, regardless of income.\n  It means that income levels for participants in the IRA program would \nbe doubled for those who participate in employer-provided pension \nplans.\n  It means that all middle-income Americans who earn up to $50,000, and \ncouples who earn up to $80,000, indexed for inflation, could fully \ndeduct IRA contributions.\n  It means that people eligible for traditional IRAs could now set up a \nspecial IRA that would provide a new saving vehicle that encourages \nmiddle-income Americans to save by allowing an incentive tax-free \nwithdrawal without draining the Treasury.\n  I did cosponsor, along with 60 of my colleagues, a more ambitious \nproposal authored by my friend from Delaware, Senator Roth, and my \nfriend from Louisiana, Senator Breaux, but, given our budgetary \nconstraints, I respectfully suggest that this bill is, perhaps, more \nrealistic.\n\n  While contributions to the new special IRA's, under this proposal, \nwould not be deductible, if funds remain in the account for at least 5 \nyears withdrawals would be tax free. Individuals in the upper end of \nthe new income brackets would be able to convert balances in their \ntraditional deductible IRA accounts to the ``Special IRA'' accounts \nwithout being subject to penalty.\n  The amount transferred from the existing contribution-deductible IRA \nto the special IRA would be subject to ordinary income tax in the year \nof the transfer.\n  But, this legislation recognizes people's real needs in the real \nworld. Under this plan withdrawals of earnings for the ``Special \nIRA's'' within 5 years would be subject to ordinary income tax and a \n10-percent penalty unless the withdrawals are for education expenses, a \nfirst-time home purchase, unemployment, or medical care.\n  Mr. President, we need to invest more. We need to save more. We need \nto be fair and recognize the difficult economic times that middle-class \nAmericans are suffering. We need to help them save for their future and \nfind innovative creative ways to do it.\n  This bill has the approval of the Treasury Department and does \neverything the Roth-Breaux ``Super-IRA'' proposal does in a way that \ndoes not inflate the deficit.\n  I believe, Mr. President, that the Savings and Investment Incentive \nAct of 1995 is a moderate, fair, common-sense approach that doubles the \nincome levels for participation; allows non penalty deductions for a \nvariety of real life situations; and it will work for working Americans \nwithout busting the Treasury.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill appear in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1310\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a National Fitness and Sports Foundation \nto carry out activities to support and supplement the mission of the \nPresident's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n        the national physical fitness and sports foundation act\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I introduce the National Physical \nFitness and Sports Foundation Act. This legislation serves the growing \nneed of the President's Council on Physical Fitness to expand and \nbecome more self-sufficient.\n  Mr. President, the foundation created by this bill simply allows the \nCouncil to expand its scope and activities without burdening the \nFederal Government with this expense. As it stands today, the \nPresident's Council operates under a severely limited budget. This \nlegislation will empower the Council to become more self-reliant, and \nless dependent on Federal funding, by creating opportunities to \ngenerate and solicit independent sources of funding for the \norganization.\n  At a time where we are operating under fiscal restraints, I want to \nassure my colleagues that this bill does not create a quasi-federal \nagency to add to the already burdensome system. The foundation created \nby this bill will be established in collaboration with the Department \nof Health and Human Services. It would be a nonprofit, private \ncorporation that would encourage the participation by, and support of \nprivate organizations for the activities of the Council.\n  For my colleagues that may not be familiar with the Council, I would \nlike to provide some background on its mission and intent. The \nPresident's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports was originally \nestablished by President Eisenhower in 1956 to promote physical fitness \nfor our Nation's youth. Since that time, the Council has undergone \nsignificant changes, expanding its services to include opportunities \nwith physical fitness, sports, and sports medicine for people of all \nages. Today, the Council serves an important role with other national \nphysical fitness and sports organizations and several \n\n[[Page S 15039]]\nFederal agencies, collaborating on important issues and campaigns to \nimprove the health of the citizens of this country.\n  The President's Council on Physical Fitness is of personal interest \nto me. As many of my colleagues know, sports, specifically judo, played \na critical role in my life. I was hardly a role model as a young man; I \nhung out with a tough crowd and got into plenty of trouble. The \ndiscipline and commitment that judo taught me, literally turned my life \naround. After many years of dedicated training, I was honored with a \ngold medal in the 1963 Pan Am Games for judo, and then was selected a \nyear later as captain of the 1964 U.S. Olympic Judo Team. I personally \nknow what a difference sports can make in a person's life. That is why \nI am encouraging any and all efforts to promote sports and physical \nfitness in our country.\n  The Council is the only Federal office that is solely devoted to \nprograms involving physical activity, fitness, and sports. Because of \nthe invaluable role these activities play in the lives of nearly all \nAmericans, it is critical that we support this organization in its \nvital efforts to continue to promote high standards of health and \nfitness for the citizens of this Country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1311\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permit \nIndia tribal governments to maintain section 401(k) plans for their \nemployees; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                       401(k) PROGRAM LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today, I introduce a bill that \nwill statutorily permit tribal governments, and enterprises owned by \ntribal governments, to offer salary reduction pension plans to their \nemployees under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n  Under current law, tribal governments are not allowed to offer tax \ndeferred, salary reduction pension plans because tax exempt \norganization are generally prohibited from doing so. Further \nexacerbating the dilemma confronting tribal governments is the fact \nthat they are not eligible to participate in other tax deferred, salary \nreduction pension plans.\n  For example, since 1982 a dozen or more Indian tribal governments \nhave adopted section 403(b) salary reduction pension arrangements only \nto have the Internal Revenue Service determine these arrangements are \nnot properly qualified. In addition, Indian tribal governments are not \neligible to offer section 457 salary reduction pension arrangements \nbecause they are not ``eligible employers'', as defined in section 457.\n  It is apparent that Indian tribal governments seem to be one of only \na few categories of employers who do not have these kinds of pension \narrangements available to them. I believe that Indian tribal \ngovernments, like most all employers, should have opportunity to offer \ncompetitive salary reduction pension arrangements, such as a 401(k).\n  Mr. President, the 401(k) plan was formally authorized in 1978 as a \nsalary reduction arrangement for employees of profit making firms. The \nauthority was subsequently expanded to tax exempt organization and \nState and local government. In 1986, however, State and local \ngovernments and nonprofit organizations, including Indian tribes, were \nprohibited from offering 401(k)'s. At this time, only rural electric \ncooperatives are exempted from the prohibition.\n  Mr. President, this bill simply adds Indian tribal governments to the \nlist of qualified offerors.\n  A 401(k) plan permits employees to elect a contribution of part of \ntheir wages on a tax-deferred basis to a plan that may offer several \ninvestment options. Employers usually make contributions, which are \nalso tax-deferred. In the same way, investment earnings are also tax \ndeferred. This means that taxes aren't paid on the amount saved until \nit is withdrawn, thereby earning greater interest. Essentially, this \nexpands the amount of money invested, and allows participants to put \nmore money to work for them.\n  Without question, Indian tribal governments should be allowed to \noffer some kind of tax deferred salary reduction plan. Almost all \nsectors of society, including the Federal Government, Congress, State \nand local governments, and private employees are allowed to enroll in \nsalary reduction pension plans. In 1990, according to Department of \nLabor statistics, about 19.5 million Americans were enrolled in 401(k) \nplans.\n  Tribal governments should be allowed to offer 401(k) pension plans \nbecause they will give tribal employees an incentive to save money for \nretirement. It's no secret that Indian tribes have a history of \neconomic hardship. Under this plan, workers who otherwise might not \nsave money, and workers who otherwise might not be offered a pension \nplan, will be allowed to participate. In addition, the portability of \nbenefits will encourage tribal employees to enroll in pension plans. If \nan employee terminates employment with the tribe, that person is \nallowed to put the accumulated savings into an individual retirement \naccount [IRA]. A 401(k) plan also must be offered to all employees on a \nnondiscriminatory basis, ensuring that both higher and lower wage \nemployees must be able to access pension benefits.\n  As tribal governments are successful in their business ventures, it \nis critically important that tribal employees are encouraged to save \nmoney for retirement. In the past, only a few tribal governments had \nthe resources to offer employees salary reduction pension plans. Today, \nhowever, with the growth of tribal enterprises, there is more money to \ninvest in the future and there are more tribal employees. In my home \nState, the largest employer in Montezuma County is now the Ute Mountain \nUte Tribe. It's time that Congress recognize the economic gains being \nmade by tribes and to allow them to offer \n\n[[Page S 15041]]\nthese broad based, elective deferral arrangements for their employees.\n  There is danger that if Congress fails to act now, tribes will \nmistakenly offer their employees 401(k) pension plans. Current law is \nconfusing, leading some tribes to think that they are already qualified \nto offer 401(k) plans. Investment companies are trying to sell 401(k) \npension plans to tribes, even though it's not legal. Unfortunately, we \nknow from the past that this can lead to the loss of tribal funds. This \nproposal explicitly allows tribal governments to offer these plans, \nthereby clearing up any confusion.\n  Recognizing the advantages of section 401(k) salary reduction pension \narrangements, the House Ways and Means Committee included in its budget \nreconciliation mark a provision to again expand the authority to a \nbroader range of organizations that include nonprofit organizations and \nState and local governments.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that in the coming days this proposal \nwill be favorably considered by my colleagues on the Finance Committee. \nIn closing I would ask unanimous consent that a revenue estimate from \nthe Joint Tax Committee also be included in the Record to accompany the \ntext of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1313\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ELIGIBILITY OF INDIAN TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS TO \n                   MAINTAIN SECTION 401(k) PLANS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The last sentence of section 401(k)(4)(B) \n     of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to \n     ineligibility of certain governments and exempt \n     organizations) is amended to read as follows: ``This \n     subparagraph shall not apply to a rural cooperative plan or a \n     plan maintained by an Indian tribal government (within the \n     meaning of section 7871).''\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to plans established after December 31, 1994.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 9, 1995.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: This is in response to your request \n     dated July 17, 1995, for a revenue estimate of a proposal \n     that would modify present law to permit Indian tribal \n     governments to maintain qualified cash or deferred \n     arrangements (sec. 401(k) plans).\n       For the purpose of the revenue estimate, we have assumed \n     that employees of tribal governments would include employees \n     of gambling casinos owned and operated by Indian tribal \n     governments.\n       The proposal would be effective with respect to plans \n     established after December 31, 1994. We estimated that this \n     proposal would reduce Federal fiscal year budget receipts as \n     follows:\n\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n\nFiscal years:\n  1996...............................................................-1\n  1997...............................................................-2\n  1998...............................................................-2\n  1999...............................................................-2\n  2000...............................................................-3\n  2001...............................................................-3\n  2002...............................................................-3\n                                                               ________\n\n    1996-2002.......................................................-16\n\nNote: Details do not add to total due to rounding.\n\n       I hope this information is helpful to you.

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SENATE RESOLUTION 180--TO PROCLAIM ``WEEK WITHOUT VIOLENCE''\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \nSpecter, Mrs. Murray, and Mrs. Feinstein) submitted the following \nresolution, which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 180\n\n       Whereas the Week Without Violence, a public-awareness \n     campaign designed to inspire alternatives to the problem of \n     violence in our society, falls on October 15, 1995, through \n     October 21, 1995;\n       Whereas the prevalence of violence in our society has \n     become increasingly disturbing, as reflected by the fact that \n     2,000,000 people are injured each year as a result of violent \n     crime, with a staggering 24,500 reported murders in 1993 and \n     with losses from medical expenses, lost pay, property, and \n     other crime-related costs totaling billions of dollars each \n     year;\n       Whereas studies show that violence against women in their \n     own homes causes more total injuries to women than rape, \n     muggings, and car accidents combined and that \\1/2\\ of all \n     women who are murdered in the United States are killed by \n     their male partners;\n       Whereas violence has invaded our homes and communities and \n     is exacting a terrible toll on our country's youth;\n       Whereas children below the age of 12 are the victims of 1 \n     in 4 violent juvenile victimizations reported to law \n     enforcement, adding up to roughly 600,000 violent incidents \n     involving children under the age of 12 each year;\n       Whereas studies show that childhood abuse and neglect \n     increases a child's odds of future delinquency and adult \n     criminality and that today's juvenile victims are tomorrow's \n     repeat offenders;\n       Whereas the risk of violent victimization of children and \n     young adults has increased in recent years;\n       Whereas according to FBI statistics, on a typical day in \n     1992, 7 juveniles were murdered;\n       Whereas from 1985 to 1992, nearly 17,000 persons under the \n     age of 18 were murdered;\n       Whereas the YWCA, as the oldest women's membership movement \n     in the United States, continues its long history as an \n     advocate for women's rights, racial justice, and nonviolent \n     approaches to resolving many of society's most troubling \n     problems;\n       Whereas the chapters of the YWCA provide a wide range of \n     valuable programs for women all across the country, including \n     job training programs, child care, battered women's shelters, \n     support programs for victims of rape and sexual assault, and \n     legal advocacy;\n       Whereas the YWCA Week Without Violence campaign will take \n     an active approach to confront the problem of violence head-\n     on, with a grassroots effort to prevent violence from making \n     further inroads into our schools, community organizations, \n     workplaces, neighborhoods, and homes;\n       Whereas the Week Without Violence will provide a forum for \n     examining viable solutions for keeping violence against \n     women, men, and children out of our homes and communities;\n       Whereas national and local groups will inspire and educate \n     our communities about effective alternatives to violence; and\n       Whereas the YWCA Week Without Violence is both a challenge \n     and a clarion call to all Americans: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate encourages all Americans to spend \n     7 days without committing, condoning, or contributing to \n     violence and proclaims the week of October 15, 1995, through \n     October 21, 1995, as the ``Week Without Violence''.\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nHatch as well as Senator Cohen, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Specter, \nSenator Murray, and Senator Feinstein to submit a resolution to declare \nthe week of October 15 the ``Week Without Violence.''\n  Mr. President, just look at yesterday's papers. Dateline Washington: \nA D.C. police officer dies after being shot while on duty. Dateline \nArizona: One person dies and many more are hurt after suspected \nsabotage derails an Amtrak train. Dateline Philadelphia: A man is \narrested for allegedly committing two sexual assaults. And the list \ncontinues.\n  All of these stories are from yesterday's newspapers, where tales of \ndeath and violence fill page after page of newsprint. Unfortunately, \nthere was nothing unusual about yesterday. It was just a typical day in \nAmerica--where the headlines of today are torn from the nightmares of \ndays past.\n  These stories, and the hundreds like them across the country, focus a \ndisturbing spotlight on the prevalence of violence in our society.\n  The statistics are alarming. Every year, 2 million people are injured \neach year as a result of violent crime. There were a staggering 24,500 \nmurders reported in 1993; losses from medical expenses, lost pay, \nproperty, and other crime-related costs total billions of dollars a \nyear.\n  But it does not stop there. Violence against women in their own homes \ncauses more total injuries to women than rape, muggings, and car \naccidents combined. And half of all the women murdered in the United \nStates are killed by their male partners.\n  It continues. Instead of buying books and computers, our schools are \nbuying the latest metal detectors and are hiring teams of armed guards. \nSchools have had to choose between education and safety. And still, 15 \npercent of suburban teenagers and 17 percent of urban teenagers say \nthey have carried a gun within the last month. It is nearly \ninconceivable to think that parents have to send their children off to \nschool each day worrying that they might be gunned down, but in many \nareas, that's a fact of life.\n  These stories and statistics may be unbelievable, but they are true. \nViolence in our society touches the inner city and the small town, rich \nand poor, black and white. Violence does not discriminate.\n  But what can we do? Do we lock ourselves in our homes, shut out from \nsociety? Do we arm ourselves with latest automatic weapons? Do we try \nto strike first, to keep the harm away from us?\n  Or do we identify practical alternatives to this violence? Do we try \nto make a difference? And do we try to leave a safer society for our \nchildren?\n  The choice here is clear. In order to combat the rise of violence, we \nmust be proactive. We need to provide real choices for our children. \nThey do not have to resort to guns, violence, and hate.\n  Toward that end, the YWCA is sponsoring a nationwide Week Without \nViolence campaign. Beginning this Sunday, the YWCA will provide a forum \nfor identifying real solutions to the problem of violence.\n  Through education and discussion, we can provide our children with \nreal change. By working to fight violence in our communities, schools \ncan again become centers for learning and homes can again be rid of the \nfear that has permeated their walls.\n  Through the work of organizations like the YWCA, our communities can \nchoose actions other than violence. In bringing its message to the \nschools, community centers, workplaces, and houses of worship, the \nYWCA's Week Without Violence can provide resistance to this rising \ntide.\n  Violence against women does not have to continue. Assault and murder \nrates do not have to rise. Hate words do not have to dominate public \ndiscourse. There are alternatives. And the Week Without Violence will \naid our communities in identifying them.\n  In concurrence with, and in support of, the YWCA's Week Without \nViolence campaign, I urge all of my colleagues to support this \nresolution.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am proud to join so many of my \ncolleagues \n\n[[Page S 15043]]\nin submitting this important resolution, to proclaim the week of \nOctober 15, 1995 through October 21, 1995 as the ``Week Without \nViolence.''\n  As a mother and as a woman, I am deeply troubled about the epidemic \nof violence in our Nation. And I have devoted myself to doing all I \ncan, as a Senator, to make our streets, our neighborhoods, and our \nhomes safe for our children and families.\n  The numbers are shocking. But, often the real story gets lost in the \nstatistics. Let us take a moment to reflect about what we mean when we \nsay that violence is ever-present in our society. We are referring to \nsenseless crimes committed among strangers; husbands physically and \nemotionally battering their wives; parents at the end of their ropes \ndriven to abuse and neglect their own children; and young people with \nguns on the playground who have lost hope about their futures.\n  I believe that education and public awareness are some of our best \ntools in bringing about an end to violence in our country. And that is \nwhy this ``Week Without Violence'' is so important. We must lead by \nexample, and send a message to all Americans that we are committed to \nending the cycle of pain, hurt, and fear destroying America's families \nand society as a whole. We need to work together with our neighbors, \nand local and national groups to communicate loud and clear the message \nthat ``violence is unacceptable, abuse is wrong, and it's got to \nstop.''\n  But, education is not enough. We must maintain the Federal \nGovernment's commitment to preventing and reducing violent crimes. I am \npleased the Senate recently restored funding for the Violence Against \nWomen Act, and I encourage my colleagues to continue to support \nimportant programs like VAWA which are critical to ensuring the safety \nof our citizens.\n  I also would like to commend the YWCA, the oldest womens' membership \nmovement in the United States, for its ongoing efforts to resolve \nsocietal ills through nonviolent means, and for helping to reduce \nviolence through prevention and education initiatives. And I also would \nlike to recognize the invaluable services the YWCA provides to \nsurvivors of violence through job training programs, shelters, child \ncare, and support groups for rape and assault victims.\n  Together, we can make our country a safer place to live and raise our \nfamilies. This ``Week Without Violence'' is an important step in that \ndirection, and I am proud of our commitment to creating a safer \ntomorrow for all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/11/senate-section/article/S15042-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15043-S15055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                 THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                SPECTER (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2894\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Simon, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Johnston, Mr. \nPell, and Mr. Harkin) proposed an amendment to amendment No. 2885 \nproposed by Mrs. Kassebaum to the bill (S. 143) to consolidate Federal \nemployment training programs and create a new process and structure for \nfunding the programs, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       In subtitle B of title I, strike chapters 1 and 2 and \n     insert the following:\n\n                     CHAPTER 1--GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 131.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The economy of Cuba has experienced a decline of \n     approximately 60 percent in the last 5 years as a result of--\n       (A) the reduction in subsidies from the former Soviet \n     Union;\n       (B) 36 years of Communist tyranny and economic \n     mismanagement by the Castro government;\n       (C) the precipitous decline in trade between Cuba and the \n     countries of the former Soviet bloc; and\n       (D) the policy of the Russian Government and the countries \n     of the former Soviet bloc to conduct economic relations with \n     Cuba predominantly on commercial terms.\n       (2) At the same time, the welfare and health of the Cuban \n     people have substantially deteriorated as a result of Cuba's \n     economic decline and the refusal of the Castro regime to \n     permit free and fair democratic elections in Cuba or to adopt \n     any economic or political reforms that would lead to \n     democracy, a market economy, or an economic recovery.\n       (3) The repression of the Cuban people, including a ban on \n     free and fair democratic elections and the continuing \n     violation of fundamental human rights, has isolated the Cuban \n     regime as the only nondemocratic government in the Western \n     Hemisphere.\n       (4) As long as no such economic or political reforms are \n     adopted by the Cuban government, the economic condition of \n     the country and the welfare of the Cuban people will not \n     improve in any significant way.\n       (5) Fidel Castro has defined democratic pluralism as \n     ``pluralistic garbage'' and has made clear that he has no \n     intention of permitting free and fair democratic elections in \n     Cuba or otherwise tolerating the democratization of Cuban \n     society.\n       (6) The Castro government, in an attempt to retain absolute \n     political power, continues to utilize, as it has from its \n     inception, torture in various forms (including psychiatric \n     abuse), execution, exile, confiscation, political \n     imprisonment, and other forms of terror and repression as \n     most recently demonstrated by the massacre of more than 40 \n     Cuban men, women, and children attempting to flee Cuba.\n       (7) The Castro government holds hostage in Cuba innocent \n     Cubans whose relatives have escaped the country.\n       (8) The Castro government has threatened international \n     peace and security by engaging in acts of armed subversion \n     and terrorism, such as the training and supplying of groups \n     dedicated to international violence.\n       (9) Over the past 36 years, the Cuban government has posed \n     a national security threat to the United States.\n       (10) The completion and any operation of a nuclear-powered \n     facility in Cuba, for energy generation or otherwise, poses \n     an unacceptable threat to the national security of the United \n     States.\n       (11) The unleashing on United States shores of thousands of \n     Cuban refugees fleeing Cuban oppression will be considered an \n     act of aggression.\n       (12) The Government of Cuba engages in illegal \n     international narcotics trade and harbors fugitives from \n     justice in the United States.\n       (13) The totalitarian nature of the Castro regime has \n     deprived the Cuban people of any peaceful means to improve \n     their condition and has led thousands of Cuban citizens to \n     risk or lose their lives in dangerous attempts to escape from \n     Cuba to freedom.\n\n[[Page S 15056]]\n\n       (14) Attempts to escape from Cuba and courageous acts of \n     defiance of the Castro regime by Cuban pro-democracy and \n     human rights groups have ensured the international \n     community's continued awareness of, and concern for, the \n     plight of Cuba.\n       (15) The Cuban people deserve to be assisted in a decisive \n     manner in order to end the tyranny that has oppressed them \n     for 36 years.\n       (16) Radio Marti and Television Marti have been effective \n     vehicles for providing the people of Cuba with news and \n     information and have helped to bolster the morale of the \n     Cubans living under tyranny.\n       (17) The consistent policy of the United States towards \n     Cuba since the beginning of the Castro regime, carried out by \n     both Democratic and Republican administrations, has sought to \n     keep faith with the people of Cuba, and has been effective in \n     isolating the totalitarian Castro regime.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to assist the Cuban people in regaining their freedom \n     and prosperity, as well as in joining the community of \n     democratic countries that are flourishing in the Western \n     Hemisphere;\n       (2) to strengthen international sanctions against the \n     Castro government;\n       (3) to provide for the continued national security of the \n     United States in the face of continuing threats from the \n     Castro government of terrorism, theft of property from United \n     States nationals, and the political manipulation of the \n     desire of Cubans to escape that results in mass migration to \n     the United States;\n       (4) to encourage the holding of free and fair democratic \n     elections in Cuba, conducted under the supervision of \n     internationally recognized observers;\n       (5) to provide a policy framework for United States support \n     to the Cuban people in response to the formation of a \n     transition government or a democratically elected government \n     in Cuba; and\n       (6) to protect American nationals against confiscatory \n     takings and the wrongful trafficking in property confiscated \n     by the Castro regime.\n\n     SEC. 4.

STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Individuals enjoy a fundamental right to own and enjoy \n     property which is enshrined in the United States \n     Constitution.\n       (2) The wrongful confiscation or taking of property \n     belonging to United States nationals by the Cuban government, \n     and the subsequent exploitation of this property at the \n     expense of the rightful owner, undermines the comity of \n     nations, the free flow of commerce, and economic development.\n       (3) Since Fidel Castro seized power in Cuba in 1959--\n       (A) he has trampled on the fundamental rights of the Cuban \n     people, and\n       (B) through his personal despotism, he has confiscated the \n     property of--\n       (i) millions of his own citizens,\n       (ii) thousands of United States nationals, and\n       (iii) thousands more Cubans who claimed asylum in the \n     United States as refugees because of persecution and later \n     became naturalized citizens of the United States.\n       (4) It is in the interest of the Cuban people that the \n     government of Cuba respect equally the property rights of \n     Cuban and foreign nationals.\n       (5) The Cuban government is offering foreign investors the \n     opportunity to purchase an equity interest in, manage, or \n     enter into joint ventures with property and assets some of \n     which were confiscated from United States nationals.\n       (6) This ``trafficking'' in confiscated property provides \n     badly needed financial benefit, including hard currency, oil \n     and productive investment and expertise, to the current \n     government of Cuba and thus undermines the foreign policy of \n     the United States--\n       (A) to bring democratic institutions to Cuba through the \n     pressure of a general economic embargo at a time when the \n     Castro regime has proven to be vulnerable to international \n     economic pressure, and\n       (B) to protect the claims of United States nationals who \n     had property wrongfully confiscated by the Cuban government.\n       (7) The U.S. State Department has notified other \n     governments that the transfer of properties confiscated by \n     the Cuban government to third parties ``would complicate any \n     attempt to return them to their original owners.''\n       (8) The international judicial system, as currently \n     structured, lacks fully effective remedies for the wrongful \n     confiscation of property and for unjust enrichment from the \n     use of wrongfully confiscated property by governments and \n     private entities at the expense of the rightful owners of the \n     property.\n       (9) International law recognizes that a nation has the \n     ability to provide for rules of law with respect to ``conduct \n     outside its territory that has or is intended to have \n     substantial effect within its territory''.\n       (10) The United States Government has an obligation to its \n     citizens to provide protection against wrongful confiscations \n     by foreign nations and their citizens, including the \n     provision of private remedies.\n       (11) To deter trafficking in wrongfully confiscated \n     property, United States nationals who were the victims of \n     these confiscations \n\n[[Page S 15062]]\n     should be endowed with a judicial remedy in the courts of the United \n     States that would deny traffickers any profits from \n     economically exploiting Castro's wrongful seizures.\n\n     SEC. 302. LIABILITY FOR TRAFFICKING IN CONFISCATED PROPERTY \n                   CLAIMED BY UNITED STATES NATIONALS.\n\n       (a) Civil Remedy.--(1) Liability of Traffickers.--(A) \n     Except as otherwise provided in this section, any person or \n     entity, including any agency or instrumentality of a foreign \n     state in the conduct of a commercial activity, that after the \n     end of the 6-month period beginning on the date of enactment \n     of this Act traffics in property which was confiscated by the \n     Government of Cuba on or after January 1, 1959, shall be \n     liable to the United States national who owns the claim to \n     such property for money damages in an amount equal to the sum \n     of--\n       (i) the amount which is the greater of--\n       (I) the amount, if any, certified to the claimant by the \n     Foreign Claims Settlement Commission under the International \n     Claims Settlement Act of 1949, plus interest;\n       (II) the amount determined under section 303(a)(2), plus \n     interest; or\n       (III) the fair market value of that property, calculated as \n     being the then current value of the property, or the value of \n     the property when confiscated plus interest, whichever is \n     greater; and\n       (ii) reasonable court costs and attorneys' fees.\n       (B) Interest under subparagraph (A)(I) shall be at the rate \n     set forth in section 1961 of title 28, United States Code, \n     computed by the court from the date of confiscation of the \n     property involved to the date on which the action is brought \n     under this subsection.\n       (2) Presumption in Favor of the Certified Claims.--There \n     shall be a presumption that the amount for which a person or \n     entity, including any agency or instrumentality of a foreign \n     state in the conduct of a commercial activity, is liable \n     under clause (i) of paragraph (1)(A) is the amount that is \n     certified under subclause (I) of that clause. The presumption \n     shall be rebuttable by clear and convincing evidence that the \n     amount described in subclause (II) or (III) of that clause is \n     the appropriate amount of liability under that clause.\n       (3) Requirement for Prior Notice and Increased Liability \n     for Subsequent Additional Notice.--(A) Following the \n     conclusion of 180 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act but at least 30 days prior to instituting suit hereunder, \n     notice of intention to institute a suit pursuant to this \n     section must be served on each intended party or, in the case \n     of ongoing intention to add any party to ongoing litigation \n     hereunder, to each such additional party.\n       (B) Except as provided in this section, any person or \n     entity, including any agency or instrumentality of a foreign \n     state in the conduct of commercial activity, that traffics in \n     confiscated property after having received--\n       (i) a subsequent additional notice of a claim to ownership \n     of the property by the United States national who owns the \n     claim to the confiscated property, and\n       (ii) notice of the provisions of this section,\n\n     shall be liable to that United States national for money \n     damages in an amount which is the sum of the amount equal to \n     the amount determined under paragraph (1)(A)(ii), plus triple \n     the amount determined applicable under subclause (I), (II), \n     or (III) of paragraph (1)(A)(i).\n       (4) Applicability.--(A) Except as otherwise provided in \n     this paragraph, actions may be brought under paragraph (1) \n     with respect to property confiscated before, on, or after the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n       (B) In the case of property confiscated by the Government \n     of Cuba before the date of enactment of this title, no United \n     States national may bring an action under this section unless \n     such national acquired ownership of the claim to the \n     confiscated property before such date of enactment.\n       (C) In the case of property confiscated on or after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, no United States national \n     who acquired ownership of a claim to confiscated property by \n     assignment for value after such date of enactment may bring \n     an action on the claim under this section.\n       (5) Treatment of Certain Actions.--(A) In the case of any \n     action brought under this section by a Untied States national \n     who was eligible to file the underlying claim in the action \n     with the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission under title V \n     of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 but did \n     not so file the claim, the court may hear the case only if \n     the court determines that the United States national had good \n     cause for not filing the claim.\n       (B) In the case of any action brought under this section by \n     a United States national whose claim in the action was timely \n     filed with the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission under \n     title V of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 \n     but was denied by the Commission, the court may assess the \n     basis for the denial and may accept the findings of the \n     Commission on the claim as conclusive in the action under \n     this section unless good cause justifies another result.\n       (6) Inapplicability of Act of State Doctrine.--No court of \n     the United States shall decline, based upon the act of state \n     doctrine, to make a determination on the merits in an action \n     brought under paragraph (1).\n       (7) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an action \n     under this section may be brought and may be settled, and a \n     judgment rendered in such action may be enforced, without the \n     necessity of obtaining any license or other permission from \n     any agency of the United States, except that this subsection \n     shall not apply to the execution of a judgment against or the \n     settlement of actions involving property blocked under the \n     authority of the Trading with the Enemy Act (Appendix to \n     title 50, United States Code, sections 1 through 44).\n       (8) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any claim \n     against the Government of Cuba shall not be deemed an \n     interest in property the transfer of which required or \n     requires a license or permission of any agency of the United \n     States.\n       (b) Amount in Controversy.--An action may be brought under \n     this section by a United States national only where the \n     matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $50,000, \n     exclusive of costs.\n       (c) Service of Process.--(1) Service of process shall be \n     effected against an agency of instrumentality of a foreign \n     state in the conduct of a commercial activity, or against \n     individuals acting under color of law in conformity with \n     section 1608 of title 28, United States Code, except as \n     provided by paragraph (3) of this subsection.\n       (2) Service of process shall be effected against all \n     parties not included under the terms of paragraph (1) in \n     conformity with section 1331 of title 28, United States Code.\n       (3) For all actions brought under section 302 of the Cuban \n     Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1995, no \n     judgment by default shall be entered by a court of the United \n     States against the government of Cuba, its political \n     subdivision, or its agencies or instrumentalities, unless a \n     government recognized by the United States in Cuba and with \n     which it has diplomatic relations is given the opportunity to \n     cure and be heard thereon and the claimant establishes his \n     claim or right to relief by evidence satisfactory to the \n     court.\n       (d) Certain Property Immune From Execution.--Section 1611 \n     of title 28, United States Code, is amended by adding at the \n     end of the following:\n       ``(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1610 of \n     this chapter, the property of a foreign state shall be immune \n     from attachment and from execution in an action brought under \n     section 1605(7) to the extent the property is a facility or \n     installation used by an accredited diplomatic mission for \n     official purposes.''.\n       (e) Election of Remedies.--\n       (1) Election.--Subject to paragraph (2), and except for an \n     action or proceeding commenced prior to enactment of this \n     Act--\n       (A) any United States national that brings an action under \n     this section may not bring any other civil action or \n     proceeding under the common law, Federal law, or the law of \n     any of the several states, the District of Columbia, or any \n     territory or possession of the United States that seeks \n     monetary or nonmonetary compensation by reason of the same \n     subject matter; and\n       (B) any person who brings, under the

otherwise be \n     cognizable under this section may not bring an action under \n     this section on that claim.\n       (2) Treatment of certified claimants.--In the case of any \n     United States national that brings an action under this \n     section based on a claim certified under title V of the \n     International Claims Settlement Act of 1949--\n       (A) if the recovery in the action is equal to or greater \n     than the amount of the certified claim, the United States \n     national may not receive payment on the claim under any \n     agreement entered into between the United States and Cuba \n     settling claims covered by such title, and such national \n     shall be deemed to have discharged the United States from any \n     further responsibility to represent the United States \n     national with respect to that claim;\n       (B) if the recovery in the action is less than the amount \n     of the certified claim, the United States national may \n     receive payment under a claims agreement described in \n     subparagraph (A) but only to the extent of the difference \n     between the amount of the recovery and the amount of the \n     certified claim; and\n       (C) If there is no recovery in the action, the United \n     States national may receive payment on the certified claim \n     under a claims agreement described in subparagraph (A) to the \n     same extent as any certified claimant who does not bring an \n     action under this section.\n       (f) Deposit of Excess Payments by Cuba Under Claims \n     Agreement.--Any amounts paid by Cuba under any agreement \n     entered into between the United States and Cuba settling \n     certified claims under title V of the International Claims \n     Settlement Act of 1949 that are in excess of the payments \n     made on such certified claims after the application of \n     subsection (e) shall be deposited into the United States \n     Treasury.\n       (g) Termination of Rights.--(1) All rights created under \n     this section to bring an action for money damages with \n     respect to property confiscated by the Government of Cuba \n     before the date of enactment of this Act shall cease upon \n     transmittal to the Congress of a determination of the \n     President under section 203(c).\n       (2) The termination of rights under paragraph (1) shall not \n     affect suits commenced before the data of such termination, \n     and in all such suits, proceedings shall be had, appeals \n     taken, and judgments rendered in the \n\n[[Page S 15063]]\n     same manner and with the same effect as if this subsection had not been \n     enacted.\n\n     SEC. 303. PROOF OF OWNERSHIP OF CLAIMS TO CONFISCATED \n                   PROPERTY.\n\n       (a) Evidence of Ownership.--(1) In any action brought under \n     this Act, the courts shall accept as conclusive proof of \n     ownership a certification of a claim to ownership that has \n     been made by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission \n     pursuant to title V of the International Claims Settlement \n     Act of 1949 (22 U.S.C. 1643 and following).\n       (2) In the case of a claim that has not been certified by \n     the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission before the enactment \n     of this Act, a court may appoint a Special Master, including \n     the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, to make \n     determinations regarding the amount and ownership of claims \n     to ownership of confiscated property by the Government of \n     Cuba. Such determinations are only for evidentiary purposes \n     in civil actions brought under this Act and do not constitute \n     certifications pursuant to title V of the International \n     Claims Settlement Act of 1949.\n       (3) In determining ownership, courts shall not accept as \n     conclusive evidence of ownership any findings, orders, \n     judgments, or decrees from administrative agencies or courts \n     of foreign countries or international organizations that \n     invalidate the claim held by a United States national, unless \n     the invalidation was found pursuant to binding international \n     arbitration to which the United States submitted the claim.\n       (b) Amendment of the International Claims Settlement Act of \n     1949.--Title V of the International Claims Settlement Act of \n     1949 (22 U.S.C. 1643 and following) is amended by adding at \n     the end of the following new section:\n\n\n``determination of ownership claims referred by district courts of the \n                             united states\n\n       ``Sec. 514.

Mr. President, the Senate received from the House \ntoday H.R. 436, the Edible Oil Regulatory Reform Act. The bill would \namend the Oil Production Act of 1990, or OPA-90. As chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, which has exclusive \njurisdiction over OPA-90, I support the Senate's passage of H.R. 436 by \nunanimous consent without delay.\n  As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee at the time \nthe committee reported the bill that became OPA-90, I am well \nacquainted with the statute. As many of us will recall, the Congress \nenacted OPA-90 in the aftermath of the catastrophic Exxon Valdez \noilspill in Prince William Sound, AK.\n  One of the key elements of OPA-90 requires all vessels to demonstrate \na certain minimum level of financial responsibility to cover the costs \nof cleanup and damages in the event of an oilspill. The intent behind \nthis requirement is to ensure that an entity that discharges oil into \nour natural environment pay for the costs and damages arising from the \nspill--not the U.S. taxpayer. This intent remains sound and should \ncontinue to inform the application of the statute.\n  In passing OPA-90, however, Congress did not intend to abandon the \nuse of common sense. As the act currently stands, there is no \ndistinction made in the financial responsibility requirements for oil-\ncarrying vessels, regardless of the kind of oil being carried. \nTherefore, a vessel carrying sunflower oil is held to the same \nrequirements under OPA-90 as a carrier of deep crude.\n  H.R. 436 simply recognizes that vegetable oils and animal fats are \ndifferent from petroleum oils. Most important, they are different in \nways that make it less likely that a spill of vegetable oil or animal \nfat will cause the same kind of environmental damage as would a \npetroleum oil spill. For example, vegetable oils and animal fats \ncontain none of the toxic components of petroleum oil.\n  This is not to suggest that a spill of vegetable oil or animal fat \nwill have no adverse environmental impacts. Experience has shown to the \ncontrary, especially in the case of the Blue Earth River spill in \nMinnesota in the mid-1960's. Here it is important to note that H.R. 436 \nwould not provide an exemption for carriers of vegetable oil or animal \nfats. They still would be subject to a mandatory minimum financial \nresponsibility requirement under OPA-90.\n  Thus, H.R. 436 will lend more rationality to the application of OPA-\n90 while maintaining the fundamental integrity of the act's purpose and \napproach. I commend my colleagues in the House for recognizing an \nopportunity to improve the implementation of an environmental statute.\n  Finally, as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nlet me say that I appreciate the willingness of all Senators to \nexpedite action on this bill. Without unanimous consent, H.R. 436 would \nhave been referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. My \nreview of the bill has convinced me that it is a straightforward, \ncommonsense piece of legislation on which committee hearings are \nunnecessary and to which I can lend my support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/11/senate-section/article/S15063-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15063-S15064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL FIRE PREVENTION WEEK\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this week is National Fire \nPrevention \n\n[[Page S 15064]]\n\nWeek, a time for us to look back on the year's efforts to prevent fire-\nrelated deaths, injuries, and property damage, and an occasion to \nreflect on the important role of the brave men and women who comprise \nour national fire service.\n  Mr. President, as you know, fire is a serious problem in the United \nStates--an average of 4,000 Americans die from fire annually and nearly \n30,000 Americans sustain fire-related injuries every year.\n  Fire Prevention Week falls on the anniversary of the Great Chicago \nFire of 1871 which tragically killed 250 people, burned 17,000 \nbuildings, and rendered over 100,000 people homeless. As a Nation, we \nhave made significant progress in our efforts to improve firefighting \nand prevention methods since then, but we still have a long way to go. \nMore recently, the Happy Land Social Club fire of 1990 in New York City \nwhich claimed the lives of 87 people reminds us of the massive \ndestruction that can be caused by fire.\n  Increasingly, however, the efforts of our fire service and \norganizations such as the National Fire Protection Association, the \nannual sponsor of National Fire Prevention Week, are making a \ndifference. Due to a thoughtful, multipronged attack, in which battles \nare won by not having them fought in the first place, fire-related \ndeaths are at an alltime low--reduced to 4,275 last year from 8,900 \ndeaths in 1913 when standardized recordkeeping began.\n  No one is immune to the dangers of fire. On February 26, 1994, nine \nMarylanders were killed in a single family home simply because a candle \nwas placed too close to a sofa bed. In order to avoid tragedies like \nthese, members of the fire service, the National Fire Protection \nAssociation, and others use National Fire Prevention Week each year to \nrenew and strengthen their commitment to fire-related education \nprograms, construction and engineering improvements, and more effective \nfire regulations. In line with a recent escalation in efforts to \nminimize fires caused by carelessness or neglect, the theme of this \nyear's Fire Prevention Week is ``Watch What You Heat.''\n  I salute the American Fire Service on the occasion of National Fire \nPrevention Week and I join in their call to make our country as fire \nsafe as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/11/senate-section/article/S15063-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ETHEL STAATS CELEBRATES 100TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I invite my colleagues to join me \nin congratulating Mrs. Ethel Staats from my hometown, Greenbrae, CA, on \nthe very special occasion of her upcoming 100th birthday on October 22, \n1995.\n  Mrs. Statts has, throughout her 100 years, been a devoted mother, \ngrandmother, and great-grandmother. She had 3 children, 14 \ngrandchildren, and 17 great-grandchildren. She has been the foundation \nof a very strong and close family.\n  In addition, she has dedicated herself to the care and support of \nothers in the community. In her youth, she was a respected nurse, \ncaring for others, and now, in her later years, she has been spending \nmuch of her time babysitting and caring for the children of our \nneighborhood. When my grown children were babies, Mrs. Staats was \nalways there to lend a hand.\n  She continues to enjoy baseball and football on the radio, with a \nparticular interest in the San Francisco Giants and the Cincinnati \nReds.\n  She happily resides at Rafael Convalescent Hospital in San Rafael, \nCA. As she says, ``If I have to be some place other than home, this \nplace is great.''\n  Ethel Staats is a special woman, one of those senior citizens whom we \ncan all look to with admiration, and who deserves mentioning on her \nvery special day. I wish her the best for her future years and happiest \nof birthdays.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/11/senate-section/article/S15064-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ROBERT J. LEWIS\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, one of the greatest pleasures of our \nservice in the Senate, is that we have the opportunity to call the \nNation's attention to acts of extraordinary service and sacrifice by \nour citizens, and to record those acts as a part of our proud and \nuniquely American history of leadership by the People.\n  On more occasions than any of us can count, Mr. President, our praise \nand thanks have been earned by members of a group who truly embody the \nhighest ideals of citizenship and service--our Nation's firefighters. \nDuring this National Fire Prevention Week, I am especially proud to pay \ntribute to a firefighter from my State, Capt. Robert J. Lewis of the \nTalleyville Fire Company.\n  On June 30 of this year, the Talleyville Fire Company was dispatched \nto help battle a house fire in Brandywood, a community just north of \nWilmington, DE. There was heavy smoke coming from the attic, and the \nfirefighters immediately went to work with handlines directed to the \nupper floor of the house.\n  An engine crew from the nearby Claymont Fire Company was assigned to \nsearch the main attic. In the course of that search, Claymont \nFirefighter Greg Denston was caught when fire broke through the wall, \nengulfing the attic in flames and leaving little chance of escape by \nway of the staircase.\n  In the course of working his way to the attic, Firefighter Denston \nhad lost his helmet, and his protective mask had become dislodged when \nthe flames broke through the wall. He alertly activated his personal \nsafety signal device, hoping that someone would hear his call for help.\n  Rescue Capt. Robert J. Lewis did hear, Mr. President, and he \nresponded.\n  Captain Lewis found a Claymont Fire Company helmet at the bottom of \nthe attic staircase. He fought his way through heavy smoke and intense \nheat, and managed to get to the attic by way of the kind of fold-down \nstairs that can be hard to navigate under the best of circumstances. \nAnd these were surely the worst of circumstances.\n  The attic was literally under siege by the fire. But Captain Lewis \nmanaged to locate Firefighter Denston and to pull him down the stairs, \nwhere several other firefighters helped get their injured comrade out \nof the house and on his way to medical treatment. Firefighter Denston \nwas hospitalized for 7 days, and has continued his recovery at home.\n  The hope of that recovery is only possible, Mr. President, because \nRobert Lewis answered the call for help, as firefighters do every day \nin cities and towns across America.\n  Captain Lewis' professional instincts--and all firefighters are \nprofessionals--his professional instincts were perfect; he acted \nprecisely as his training had taught him.\n  But training can only teach you how to save a life. It cannot make \nyou do it.\n  The personal instinct that led Captain Lewis to act quickly and \ndecisively--automatically, without pausing to weigh the pros and cons, \nputting his concern for another above his concern for his own safety--\nthat instinct comes from deep within. It is something hard to define, \nbut it makes ordinary citizens into heroes every day.\n  One American writer described it this way: ``There is a certain blend \nof courage, integrity, character and principle which has no \nsatisfactory dictionary name but has been called different things at \ndifferent times, in different countries. Our American name for it is \n`guts.' '' Training makes a professional; guts, Mr. President, make a \nhero.\n  Capt. Robert J. Lewis of the Talleyville Fire Company did not become \na hero on June 30, 1995. He was already a hero, as were his fellow \nfirefighters, because they know that every time they answer the call \nthey may be putting their lives at risk. And still they answer--without \npausing to weigh the pros and cons, putting their concern for others \nabove their concern for their own safety--each and every time.\n  In recognizing Captain Lewis for his extraordinary service, we \nrecognize all firefighters. They represent and summon the best in us--\nthe best of the American character--and we are grateful to them \nall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/11/senate-section/article/S15064-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15064-S15065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, OCTOBER 12, 1995\n\n  Mr. HELMS.
