Mr. President, last week the Bosnian town of \nSrebrenica, a so-called U.N. protected area, fell to Bosnian Serbs. In \nscenes reminiscent of the genocide of World War II, Serb troops rounded \nup Bosnian Moslems and forcibly expelled thousands of women, children, \nand the elderly from their homes. Military-age men were held captive, \nand there are reports that some have been murdered. Rapes and other \natrocities are reported as well.\n  This week Zepa, another U.N. protected area in eastern Bosnia, is \nabout to fall to the Serbs. The U.N. protected area of Gorazde is under \nattack. Serbs inside the U.N. exclusion zone around Sarajevo are \nshelling the city and killing innocent civilians in that U.N. protected \narea. In the northeast, the U.N. safe haven of Bihac remains cut off \nand threatened.\n  Throughout Bosnia today, we see the triumph of Serbian aggression, \naided and abetted by confusion and inaction on the part of the United \nNations and the Western democracies.\n  Mr. President, what is the response of the Western democracies to the \natrocities and brutal aggression of the Serbs? The response is another \nU.N. Security Council resolution, calling on the Secretary General to \nrestore the safe haven of Srebrenica. In Bosnia, the United Nations \nspokesmen issue more empty threats, hollow denunciations, and vain \ndemands. It would be better to say nothing at all than to engage in \nsuch futile bluster, which only invites the contempt of the world.\n  One definition of stupidity is to do the same thing over and over \nagain and expect a different result. This certainly characterizes the \npolicy of the administration and our Western allies. Its failure is \napparent for anyone to see, \n\n[[Page S 10178]]\nand yet we persist in following the same discredited course.\n  UNPROFOR has been emasculated and cannot protect its own forces, much \nless the U.N. protected areas, which are becoming traps for desperate \nBosnians who relied upon U.N. promises. Humanitarian aid is being \nblocked. It is clear that the Bosnian Serbs are in control of the \nsituation, and the United Nations is allowed to carry out its mission \nonly when the Bosnian Serbs allow it. In short, UNPROFOR cannot carry \nout the U.N. Security Council mandates that justify its presence. \nDespite good intentions and valiant efforts, UNPROFOR has failed--\nfailed on its own terms. Now humiliation and disgrace are compounding \nthe failure.\n  What does it take, Mr. President? When will the U.N., the United \nStates, and our allies accept the reality that the Bosnian crisis has \ndeteriorated beyond our ability to salvage it?\n  Britain, France, and Holland have pinned their hopes on the new rapid \nreaction force. They are sending in 12,000 more troops to support \nUNPROFOR. Out of solidarity with our allies, the United States is \nproviding sealift, airlift, and military equipment. But in my view, the \nrapid reaction force is not going to prevent the situation from \ndeteriorating further, or stop the Serbs from overrunning of the safe \nhavens. The rapid reaction force has been rendered ineffective before \nit ever got off the ground. As long as it remains under U.N. \noperational control it will not be rapid, nor reactive, nor even a \nforce.\n  I do not understand why the administration persists in supporting the \nstatus quo no matter how discredited the current policy becomes. \nAdministration officials have testified numerous times that the United \nStates does not have sufficient national interests at stake in Bosnia \nto justify sending American ground troops and becoming a combatant in \nthe conflict. I agree completely, and so do the American people. \nAdministration officials have also testified that the best way to serve \nthe national interests of the United States is to keep UNPROFOR in \nBosnia so that it can work to limit the suffering of the innocent, and \nto keep the conflict from spreading while the contact group seeks a \ndiplomatic solution.\n  I wholeheartedly support the goals of relieving the suffering and \ncontaining the conflict. What I can no longer support is the \nproposition that the status quo, which relies upon an ineffectual U.N. \npeacekeeping mission and more diplomatic efforts, is the best way to \nachieve these goals. I am forced to ask: How many more diplomatic \ndiscussions have to take place? Intense diplomacy has been going on for \nyears without any resolution.\n  The Administration appears to believe that the responsibility for any \nresulting disaster will fall on the United States if UNPROFOR \nwithdraws. I do not agree. The world community placed the fate of \nBosnia in the hands of the United Nations, but the United Nations has \nbeen unable to keep a nonexistent peace. That is no more the fault of \nthe United States than of any other U.N. member. In any case, the world \ncannot be blamed for trying a collective approach. But there is plenty \nof blame to go around if the United States and our allies persist in \nfollowing a course that has clearly failed. Increasing the number of \nU.N. peacekeepers or keeping UNPROFOR in Bosnia will only prolong the \nagony, complicate matters further, and block the possibility of other \nsolutions.\n  Mr. President, the situation in Bosnia is terribly complex, and there \nare no easy answers. Any course of action has potential pitfalls. But \nthere is also a penalty for doing nothing, or for remaining mired in \nthe status quo.\n  In my view, the administration has failed to properly evaluate the \ndamage to U.S. leadership and credibility, and to the Western alliance, \nfrom supporting the status quo. The credibility of NATO as well as of \nthe United Nations have been severely undermined. It is a serious \nmistake to continue subordinating NATO to the United Nations out of a \nmisguided desire to restore the United Nations lost credibility. The \nlonger the present situation continues, the greater the damage to the \nhealth and solidarity of the Western alliance. We cannot afford to let \nNATO to become a casualty of the Bosnian tragedy.\n  The fall of Srebrenica and the imminent fall of Zepa make it quite \nclear--UNPROFOR has become impotent and must withdraw. There is no \nexcuse for leaving U.N. troops in such a dangerous and untenable \nposition any longer. There is no excuse for continuing to incur the \nhuge expense of the failed U.N. mission. We can no longer tolerate a \npolicy based on denial and avoidance of reality.\n  I believe it is past time for the Congress to focus its attention on \ngetting the U.N. out of Bosnia. If the administration is reluctant to \nsupport a U.N. withdrawal because it fears a negative political \nreaction, then now is the time for Congress to show leadership, and to \nmake it clear that the United States will assist in extricating our \nallies from the Bosnian quagmire. But we must work together--the \nexecutive branch and Congress--and reach a consensus as soon as \npossible. Further delays in getting ready to execute the NATO \nwithdrawal plan will push the plan's execution into the winter months, \nmaking it far more difficult and dangerous for United States and NATO \ntroops to carry out.\n  Mr. President, Congress needs to send a clear signal now to the \nPresident that we will support the participation of U.S. troops in a \nU.N. withdrawal operation. Of course, as the President has agreed, it \nmust be totally under NATO command. Once our troops are committed, \nthere can no longer be any dual-key arrangement between the United \nNations and NATO. There must also be robust rules of engagement, \nallowing the use of overwhelming force for any attacks on NATO or on \nUNPROFOR. The scope and duration of the withdrawal mission must be \nlimited. I do not advocate a date certain for ending it, but it must \nend promptly when all UNPROFOR and NATO troops are safely out. It must \nnot be transformed at some point into a peace enforcement mission.\n  Mr. President, the United States cannot stand idly by while U.N. \ntroops from allied nations are in mortal danger. The damage to U.S. \nleadership, honor, prestige, and credibility would be beyond \ncalculation. These are not mere words. Credibility, prestige, and \nnational honor are essential components of national security, as they \nhave always been. They are especially important if we are to exercise \nthe moral leadership expected of the world's only superpower.\n  If Americans want to remain secure in today's violent and chaotic \nworld, we must never permit doubts to exist in the minds of friends or \nenemies that our word is good, or that we can be relied upon to stand \nwith our allies, or that we will keep our commitments. The credibility \nthat comes from demonstrated steadfastness of purpose is a key aspect \nof deterrence. It is an essential though intangible element of global \npower, and of the necessary relations between states. A great nation \ncannot remain great very long without it.\n  That is why we must end the charade of the U.N. presence in Bosnia, \nstand with our allies by assisting them to disengage, and then turn our \nattention to longer term solutions that will stop the agony in that \ntroubled land.\n  I thank the Chair, and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nGeorgia, Senator Nunn, is recognized to speak for up to 30 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/18/senate-section/article/S10177-6", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10178-S10182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INEFFECTUAL U.N. PROTECTION FORCES IN BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I too want to discuss the subject which the \nSenator from South Carolina has just addressed.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the continued presence of the \nineffectual U.N. Protection Forces in Bosnia is eroding the credibility \nof the United Nations, of NATO, and of the United States.\n  I agree with the points that Senator Thurmond just made. In \nparticular, I agree that the executive branch and the Congress must \nwork together and reach a consensus as soon as possible. This situation \nis bad enough without the President and the Congress being in a big \nfight here. So we need to find a way to work together.\n  The second point that I agree with that Senator Thurmond made is that \nnow is the time for the Congress to show leadership and to make it \nclear \n\n[[Page S 10179]]\nthat the United States will assist in extracting our allies from \nBosnia. Congress cannot duck this question.\n  The third point that he made that I specifically agree with: The \nwithdrawal operation must be totally under NATO command. There can be \nno ``dual-key'' arrangement. There must be robust rules of engagement. \nAnd the scope and the duration of the mission must be limited.\n  And, finally, I think the key point he made related to what the \nUnited States' role must be in the withdrawal; that is, the honor and \ncredibility of our Nation are essential components, not only to our \nnational security, not only to Bosnia, but to deterrence throughout the \nworld. That is essential. Honor and credibility are essential parts of \nnational security, and of deterrence. I completely agree with the \nSenator from South Carolina on that excellent point.\n  Mr. President, I will leave to another day the discussion of mistakes \nleading to the current human tragedy in Bosnia. The Bosnian-Serbs have \noverrun the U.N.-declared safe area of Srebenica, and they can take \nZepa at any time of their choosing.\n  The United Nations Security Council has passed another meaningless \nresolution calling upon Secretary General Boutros Ghali to restore \nSrebrenica to its safe area status. Of course, none of the Security \nCouncil members has told the beleaguered Secretary General how to \nperform that task.\n  The French have declared their readiness to fight for Gorazde if the \nBritish will join them and if the Americans will supply tactical \nairlift. The French are clearly paving the way for their withdrawal \nfrom Bosnia unless there is a determined U.N. stand with British and \nAmerican assistance.\n  The British have raised serious reservations about the French \nproposals and the French approach, both publicly and privately.\n  General Shalikashvili has met with his counterparts from Britain and \nFrance for the purpose of preparing immediate options for the national \nleaders to consider, and I assume that consideration will be made in \nthe next few days.\n  Secretary Perry and Secretary Christopher will be meeting with their \ncounterparts later this week.\n  The Clinton administration is urging our allies to remain in Bosnia, \nrefusing to commit United States forces on the ground, continuing to \ndistance itself from any ``unjust settlement'' and pledging to help \nextract our allies from Bosnia if they withdraw.\n  This week the Senate will plunge into this morass by legislating on \nBosnia. I believe that Congress has an important role to play in \nforeign policy matters. I always have felt that. At the same time, I do \nnot believe Congress as a rule should attempt to legislate the details \nof United States foreign policy. But if we do choose to legislate on \nBosnia:\n  We must not remove the President's flexibility to react to \nunpredictable situations in which American lives are at stake;\n  We should not force our allies and our other U.N. forces to \nwithdraw--advocating withdrawal is one thing, forcing it by legislation \nis another thing entirely. We need to distinguish between speeches and \nlegislation; and\n  We should not and must not avoid the hard questions which will \ninevitably flow from congressional actions. There are hard questions \nthat have not yet fully been considered by either the House or the \nSenate in my view.\n  Mr. President, many of our colleagues want to--I use these terms in \nshorthand--``lift and leave.'' By that I mean lift the embargo and \nleave the Bosnians to fend for themselves. The House of Representatives \npassed this type of legislation. We in the Senate debated this type \nlegislation and passed it on one occasion last year.\n  This school of thought seems to believe that a simple repeal of the \nAmerican export prohibition will automatically equalize the conflict. \nIt glosses over the questions of who will pay for the weapons; who will \ndeliver them; how will they be delivered; and who will help train the \nBosnian troops.\n  To be fair, there are those, including the majority leader, Senator \nDole, Senator Lieberman, Senator Biden, and others, who have advocated \nunilaterally lifting the arms embargo but who would also support the \nsupply of United States equipment and United States training to Bosnian \nGovernment forces. But many of those whose votes are needed to pass the \nDole-Lieberman bill are unwilling to make such a commitment, and the \nDole-Lieberman approach leaves these questions unanswered. This is a \nlarge gap.\n  Mr. President, another view in the Senate which heretofore has been a \nminority view--and this has been a view that I have had--is that the \nembargo should be lifted but only after U.N. forces have left Bosnia.\n  There are also those in the Senate who have a third view, who agree \nwith the administration that the U.N. forces should remain in Bosnia. \nIn my view, this is a distinctly minority view.\n  Mr. President, the overwhelming majority of the Senate in my view \nsupport either the lift-and-leave approach or the leave-then-lift \nalternative approach. The Dole-Lieberman proposed legislation now seems \nto have moved substantially toward the leave-then-lift approach. That \nis important. They are moving in their resolution toward the position \nof leave first, then lift the embargo. That is a key distinction, and \nthat is a distinction that has separated those of us on the two sides \nof this issue in the Senate for the last 12 months.\n  Mr. President, this is a very significant change in the Dole-\nLieberman proposal that has been overlooked by most people in the press \ncorps, many critics of the bill, and even many supporters of the bill.\n  The latest version of the Dole-Lieberman bill is a major improvement \nin my view in that it takes into account and into consideration some \nconcerns of our NATO allies who have forces on the ground in Bosnia by \ndelaying the implementation of the termination of the Bosnian embargo \nuntil the U.N. forces withdraw. That is a key difference from the \napproach that was taken in past resolutions. Additionally--and I think \nvery importantly--the new Dole-Lieberman proposal puts the onus or \nresponsibility on the Government of Bosnia and the troop contributing \ncountries to decide if the U.N. forces should stay in Bosnia.\n  It does this by terminating the embargo based on either of two \nconditions:\n  Condition 1: a Bosnian Government request that the U.N. forces \nwithdraw from Bosnia; or\n  Condition 2: a decision by the U.N. Security Council or the UNPROFOR \ntroop-contributing countries to withdraw the U.N. forces.\n  As I understand the Dole-Lieberman proposal, if condition 1 is met, \nimplementation of the termination of the embargo would be delayed until \n12 weeks after the Bosnian Government requests that the United Nations \nbe withdrawn. If, on the other hand, condition 2 is met--that is, the \ntroops of the contributing countries decide to leave without a request \nfrom the Bosnian Government--termination of the embargo would be \ndelayed until such time as the U.N. forces have been withdrawn from \nBosnia.\n  This is in my view a much different proposal than what we have \ndebated in the past. It is much different from what has passed the \nHouse of Representatives. It is a much more responsible approach than \nthe original proposal which lifted the embargo unilaterally without \nregard for the continued U.N. troop presence in Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, I say all of that on the positive side of the Dole-\nLieberman amendment. The key missing ingredient, however, of the new \nDole-Lieberman amendment is any mention of what should be obvious to \nall and what must be obvious during the debate on this proposal to \nthose of us in the Senate, and I hope to the country; namely, that the \nPresident of the United States has publicly pledged to deploy up to \n25,000 United States troops on the ground, if necessary, in Bosnia to \nhelp extract the U.N. forces.\n  Mr. President, Congress cannot responsibly legislate on Bosnia and \nignore this fact. If Congress wants to prevent United States ground \nforces from assisting our allies in withdrawing from Bosnia, we should \nmake that clear. If Congress wants the allies and the United Nations to \nwithdraw from Bosnia and is willing to support President Clinton's \ncommitment, Congress should make that clear. Congress cannot \nresponsibly advocate a course of \n\n[[Page S 10180]]\naction and pretend to ignore the inevitable and certain consequences of \nthat action.\n  If the United Nations withdraws from Bosnia, United States \nparticipation to assist our allies to withdraw from Bosnia would be \nrequired and has been publicly committed by the President of the United \nStates. The Dole-Lieberman bill, at this time, is silent on this \ncrucial point. If this legislation is passed as written, in my view, it \nwill send a loud signal by its silence. It will send a loud signal that \nCongress is prepared to advocate a course of action but is not prepared \nto back it up.\n  Over the last 3 years, we have witnessed a lowest common denominator \napproach in the United Nations, in NATO, among our allies, and in \nUnited States policymaking regarding Bosnia. Every policy decision on \nBosnia seems to be reduced to what Winston Churchill, if he were with \nus today, would certainly describe as ``mush, gush, and slush.'' We see \nthis in the so-called mandates of the U.N. Security Council. We see \nthis in the U.N.-NATO dual key command structure. We see this in the \nstatements of the members of the U.N. Security Council who have voted \nfor every Security Council resolution for the last 4 years but who act \nas though the United Nations is some outer space alien of which they \nnever heard.\n  Mr. President, we see this in the position of many in this \nadministration, in this Congress, and in the news media who for the \nlast 2 years have decried any ``unjust solution'' but who have been \nunwilling to commit American resources for a just solution, and \nunwilling to admit that there never will be a just solution in Bosnia \nunless the United Nations and NATO are willing to impose it by force.\n  Mr. President, that is reality. There will never be a just solution \nin Bosnia unless the United Nations and NATO are willing to impose it \nby force.\n  I hope, as the Senate debates the Dole-Lieberman bill this week, that \nwe will not continue and even add to the lowest-common-denominator \napproach that has been so evident in all the Bosnia decisions by \ninternational and by other bodies.\n  There is no good solution to the Bosnian tragedy. There is no easy \nsolution. There is no solution that anyone can guarantee is going to \nwork. Some approaches, in my view, are worse than others, but all have \nunwelcome consequences. The American people are entitled to understand \nthe possible consequences as we debate this issue.\n  What would be the consequences if the U.N. forces withdraw? NATO has \nbeen putting together a plan to withdraw the U.N. forces. This plan \ncalls for deployment of up to 82,000 troops, some 25,000 of whom would \nbe American military personnel based on the commitment of the President \nof the United States pursuant to his pledge to our NATO allies. This is \na sizable force but, in my view, it is a necessary force, given the \ntopography of Bosnia and the history of that conflict and the history \nof that region.\n  This large force may be deemed by some to be a worst-case force, but \nit makes a worst case much less likely to occur. Our military leaders \nhave been candid in telling us, both in testimony and in private \ndiscussions, that this withdrawal operation could be very dangerous. I \nthink they are right. There is also a possibility, however, that the \nwithdrawal could be relatively unimpeded by both sides. It could \nproceed rapidly; it could proceed effectively. No one knows or pretends \nto know how dangerous this will be, but prudence and careful planning \nare absolutely essential.\n  Mr. President, we should note that the NATO plan makes no provision \nfor the withdrawal of refugees. Everyone should understand that. There \nis no provision in that NATO plan for withdrawal of refugees. Our \nmilitary commanders, in fact, concede that one of the most difficult \naspects of a withdrawal operation will be dealing with Bosnian \ncivilians. They may attempt to keep the U.N. forces and the NATO forces \nfrom leaving Bosnia out of fear that they will be prey to the attacking \nSerbs once the restraining presence of UNPROFOR is removed. They may do \nthis regardless of what their Government may say publicly or privately.\n  We also must consider what will happen to the civilian population \nonce the extensive humanitarian relief effort is no longer functioning \nthere. A humanitarian tragedy is likely, and we should understand that \nas we debate this serious issue.\n  Both the Government of Bosnia and the Bosnian Serb leaders have \npublicly stated that they would assist the U.N. forces in withdrawing \nif the United Nations makes a decision to withdraw. But NATO military \ncommanders, understandably, express concern about the following \npossibilities:\n  First, the sincerity and durability of these statements by leaders \nwhose word in the past has been questioned; second, whether the warring \nparties will try to gain control of the tons of U.N. military equipment \nand supplies presently located in Bosnia; third, whether the Bosnian \nSerbs will be cooperative as they realize that the completion of the \nU.N. withdrawal will likely result in the lifting of the arms embargo \non the Government of Bosnia; and fourth, the narrow and winding roads \nthat make up much of Bosnia's transportation system. It will take \nlittle effort by a determined foe to destroy the numerous bridges and \ntunnels that are often the only ingress and egress to the numerous \nBosnian towns and to Bosnia itself where the U.N. personnel are \nlocated. The Bosnian Serbs control much of the high ground around these \nroads and these towns.\n  From those who continue to advocate immediate and unilateral lift of \nthe embargo, an intellectually honest approach requires facing up to \nthe arming and training of the Bosnian Government forces. This course \nwill likely require air support, assuming the Bosnian Serbs move in for \nthe kill before the arming of the Bosnian forces is complete, which \nwill, at best, take several weeks or months. It also requires \nrecognition that our allies will pull out of Bosnia and hold the United \nStates responsible for the Bosnian tragedy which may unfold if we \nunilaterally lift the embargo before the U.N. forces are out.\n  From those who advocate either immediate and unilateral lift of the \nembargo or, on the other hand, U.N. withdrawal followed by a lift of \nthe arms embargo, in either event, under either course of action, \nintellectual honesty requires a congressional authorization or at least \na congressional acknowledgment that U.S. forces will be used to help \nevacuate our NATO allies and the other U.N. forces.\n  Mr. President, from those who advocate keeping the U.N. forces in \nBosnia, intellectual honesty requires the acknowledgment that these \nforces must be beefed up, probably with considerable United States \nhelp; that clear authority for military decisions must be delegated by \nthe United Nations to NATO and the dual-key approach must be ended; and \nthat exposed U.N. personnel all over Bosnia must be brought to more \ndefensible positions so they are not simply hostages for one side. Each \nof these actions moves further and further away from the humanitarian \nmission, and each of these actions moves closer toward direct \ninvolvement in the conflict, and all should recognize that is what \nstaying the course means.\n  If the embargo is lifted multilaterally after UNPROFOR departs, \nallied air support will be demanded by the Government of Bosnia. We \nalready know that, those of us who have listened to them when they have \nbeen here or heard their public statements. They are going to demand \nthat we owe them air support. That is going to be their demand.\n  If the embargo is lifted unilaterally before or after the date the \nU.N. forces depart, Congress and the American people must recognize \nthat this burden will fall primarily on the United States because our \nallies, if we lift the embargo unilaterally, are not going to be \nanxious to participate. In either case, there is no assurance that the \nBosnian Government will be able to defend their territory, even with \nair support.\n  Mr. President, as I have stated, there are no good solutions in \nBosnia. I have my own views as to the approach the United Nations and \nthe United States and our allies should follow in Bosnia.\n  First, there should be a final intense diplomatic effort to negotiate \nan end of the conflict in Bosnia. I am under no illusion that a \ndiplomatic effort will be successful. It is not likely to be \nsuccessful, but at least it should be tried, because all the other \nalternatives have tremendous downside consequences. \n\n[[Page S 10181]]\n\n  Second, the United Nations should serve notice on all parties that if \na negotiated settlement is not reached within a specified period of \ntime, the U.N. forces will be withdrawn from Bosnia. Both the Bush and \nClinton administrations have urged our allies to commit their forces \nand to remain on the ground in Bosnia. When these forces are withdrawn, \nI believe the United States has a moral obligation to assist in their \nwithdrawal. In our effort to save Bosnia, we must not destroy NATO.\n  Third, once the U.N. forces have been withdrawn, the Bosnian arms \nembargo should be lifted multilaterally, if possible, unilaterally if \nthat is the only course. The United States and our allies should assist \nin arming and training the Bosnian Government forces, and that is going \nto cost some money and it is going to take some time. We all need to \nunderstand that.\n  Fourth, the allies and the contact group must devise a ``containment \npolicy'' and make it clear to the government in Belgrade that it will \nbe held fully responsible if this conflict spreads across other \nborders.\n  Mr. President, to sum up, legislating on Bosnia is fraught with \ndanger. But if we are to legislate--and it appears that we are--we must \nunderstand the full consequences of our legislation. We must be willing \nto go on record as supporting or disapproving the commitment that \nPresident Clinton has made to our allies to help them withdraw from \nBosnia. To do otherwise would be adding more ``mush, gush, and slush.''\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Will the Senator allow me about a minute and a half?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 7\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. NUNN. I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I thank the able Senator from Georgia, the ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee, for his appropriate and \npertinent remarks on the situation in Bosnia. I strongly support the \nDole-Lieberman bill and am pleased to be an original cosponsor of it.\n  As the Senate begins consideration of S. 21, the Dole-Lieberman bill, \nthis week, I ask that Members consider and discuss the very important \nissue of U.S. support for a United Nations withdrawal. This support, \nwith the aid of NATO, requires a very close and careful consideration \nand discussion by the Members of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I am not trying to control time here, but I \nhave a little time left, and I will be glad to yield to the Senator \nfrom Nebraska 3 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself completely with \nthe remarks made by my learned and distinguished colleague from \nGeorgia. I will oppose the Dole-Lieberman proposition, as I understand \nit, basically for the reasons brought forth in the carefully worded and \nwell-thought-out statement made by the Senator from Georgia.\n  We have to look to the future. As bad as the situation is over there \nnow--and I think no one feels that they have all of the right answers--\nwe have to look to the future. I am afraid, Mr. President, that despite \nthe good intentions of the Dole-Lieberman amendment, it clearly sows \nthe seeds, which are ripe for harvest, for the beginning of the end of \nNATO.\n  The situation in Bosnia today is very bad, and the pictures that are \ncoming through very loud and clear on television are horrifying, \nportraying the atrocities that are being taken in that most unfortunate \nwar in Europe. However, I happen to feel that we should always try and \nwalk in others' shoes. I simply say that if we take action today, or \nthis week, we might regret it in the future, because it sows the seeds \nfor the end of NATO, which has been a force for peace since World War \nII. And then we might look back on that action and say we probably \nacted in haste, we probably acted in compassion, but we probably acted \nin a way that would not be in the long-term best interest of peace in \nEurope and probably would go a long way to disrupting the NATO alliance \nand our friends and allies in Europe that have been a part of that.\n  This is a grave situation. I wish that our allies would agree to \nremove the peacekeeping forces because, seemingly, that is what both \nsides of the combatants there want. I happen to feel that the U.N. \nmission is doomed to failure under the circumstances that are present.\n  Nevertheless, unless and until our allies in NATO can be convinced of \nthat, I say let us proceed with caution. I have grave concerns about \nthe way we are going. I do not know the answers. I simply say that \ncaution is a better part of valor at this particular juncture. I thank \nmy friend from Georgia, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NUNN. I will yield whatever I have left to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. NUNN. I will yield that to the Senator from Texas, and whatever \nshe does not use, I will yield back.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent to add 2 minutes onto the 3 \nminutes I have been yielded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate the fact that several of \nmy colleagues on the Armed Services Committee are talking today about \nthe situation in Bosnia. It is clear that we cannot sit by and do \nnothing. We have talked about this issue for months.\n  Six weeks ago, I stood right on the border of Macedonia looking into \nSerbia. I was visiting our U.S. troops who were there on an outpost \nunder the auspices of the United Nations. I saw the terrain; I talked \nto our troops, both in Croatia and Macedonia; I talked to the people \nwho are running the operation there; I talked to the head of the U.N. \ndelegation there, Mr. Akashi.\n  I think I have a feel for the situation that is there. Mr. President, \nI think we must learn from our experiences. The United Nations has a \nvery valid role to play when there is a peace to keep. But, Mr. \nPresident, we have the best of intentions in the United Nations, but we \nhave the worst of results. In fact, the United Nations is becoming an \nobstacle to solving this situation--not that they mean to be. They are \ntrying. We give them the fact that they are trying.\n  But, Mr. President, they cannot function. And because they are there, \nwe have the effect of one side being unarmed, basically, and the other \nside being aggressive with arms. We had the Prime Minister of Bosnia \nhere, and he said,\n\n       I keep hearing people say there are two sides here. Yes, \n     one side is shooting, the other side is dying.\n\n  Mr. President, he is right. We cannot sit by and let it happen by \nsaying that we have U.N. peacekeepers sitting there on the ground and, \ntherefore, one side should remain unarmed. They are being ravaged, Mr. \nPresident, and we must do something about it. We cannot continue to \ntalk on the floor of the U.S. Senate while they are being ravaged \nacross the ocean.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that our leader, Senator Dole, will bring \nup his resolution at the earliest possible moment to tell the President \nhow strongly we feel that we should not get involved with this mission \nbeyond what the President has said he will do to help extricate the \nU.N. peacekeepers under the auspices of NATO.\n  Mr. President, we have to define that mission very carefully. That \nmission must be extraction. I do not like all the talk of, well, \nextraction also means containment of troops, it also means emergencies \nanywhere that they might occur in Bosnia. And now we are talking about \nsending helicopters there--American helicopters. Will they have \nAmerican troops running the helicopters, flying those helicopters?\n  Mr. President, there are a lot of questions, and I do not think we \ncan afford to just say all of those things are acceptable for our \nAmerican troops. I do not want American troops flying helicopters into \nBosnia. I do not want American troops to be put forth for any emergency \nin Bosnia. That is ground combat. We are talking about potential ground \ncombat.\n  Mr. President, I am representing American troops and I am going to do \neverything I can to make sure that they are as safe as they can be, and \nthat they are not involved in a mission which does not have the United \nStates' security interest. \n\n[[Page S 10182]]\n\n  Mr. President, that is the question here. We have gotten ourselves \ninvolved in Somalia through mission creep. We just let it evolve, and \nwe lost Rangers--our own U.S. Army Rangers. Mr. President, we are \nlooking at a potential for mission creep here if we are not very \ncareful.\n  So I am going to appeal to the President of the United States to \nwatch for mission creep. Helicopters with American troops is mission \ncreep.\n Contraction of our forces, our U.S. peacekeepers, is mission creep. \nEmergencies anywhere in Bosnia is mission creep.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope that Senator Dole brings his resolution to the \nfloor so that the President of the United States can hear: The time has \ncome to lift the arms embargo and let these people have a fair fight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from South Dakota, [Mr. Pressler], is recognized to speak for \nup to 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/18/senate-section/article/S10178-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AIRLINE SAFETY STANDARDS\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, yesterday morning at 6 a.m. I had the \npleasure of riding on the first flight between Rapid City and Sioux \nFalls that provides new air service in our State.\n  As a member of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, I \nhave long been a champion of air service in our smaller cities, the \nsafety of smaller aircraft, and the provision of air services to \ncitizens living in non-hub airport areas.\n  I have also been very concerned about air fares for travel to and \nfrom our Nation's smaller cities. For example, can someone living in \nHumboldt, SD, get a supersaver ticket if they have to fly first into a \nhub airport? So often the best deal, so to speak, on airline tickets, \ngo to those people who live in bigger cities with hub airports such as \nNew York, Minneapolis, Denver, Los Angeles, et cetera. Frequently, we \nfind that flying into that hub airport from the smaller city is the \nexpensive part of the trip. Citizens living in nonhub cities should not \nbe overlooked.\n  Mr. President, our air transportation system is based on the hub and \nspoke system. Even in New York, a State with substantial air service, \ncitizens living in upstate New York must fly on a small carrier into a \nhub to be connected to their next destination. The same is true in \nFresno, CA, where my sister lives. This also is the case in my home \nState of South Dakota.\n  The question is, Do the smaller planes ensure the same level of \ntravel safety? On the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, \nI have been a champion of small aircraft safety. We will continue \nworking to promote safe air travel on all sizes of aircraft.\n  I certainly do not advocate Government regulation, but I am \nconstantly jawboning the big airlines where there is a coded \nrelationship with the smaller airline to treat the smaller airlines \nfairly. After all, the smaller carriers are the lifeline of many \nsmaller communities and provide the larger carriers with many of their \npassengers.\n  Yesterday, as I mentioned, I took part in the inaugural flight \nproviding air service between South Dakota's two larger cities, Rapid \nCity and Sioux Falls. I am glad to say that Great Lakes Aviation, which \ncode-shares with United Airlines, initiated that service. It will help \nour State a great deal.\n  I shall continue to be a champion of airlines in smaller cities, \nworking to ensure we have good air service into the hubs so that \ncitizens living in smaller communities remain linked to the Nation's \nair transportation system. From air safety to reasonable air fares to \nair service availability, our nonhub cities deserve equal attention \nfrom the airline industry.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to briefly discuss the important \nissue of international aviation. I, along with a number of my \ncolleagues, am working on a resolution intended to aid our air carriers \nserving Japan.\n  Currently, Japan is violating the United States-Japan bilateral \naviation agreement by denying our passenger and cargo carriers the \nright to serve cities throughout the Pacific rim from Japan. Cargo and \npassenger traffic beyond Japan into Malaysia and China and so forth is \nvery lucrative. The Japanese are attempting to prevent our carriers \nfrom serving this traffic since they want to protect these markets for \ntheir own carriers which are very inefficient.\n  Federal Express has a new Pacific rim cargo hub they are ready to \nopen at Subic Bay in the Philippines. They cannot open it. The Japanese \nwill not permit Federal Express to serve routes from Japan which are \nnecessary to make this hub operational. The Japanese are violating the \nbilateral aviation treaty and this is costing the shareholders of \nFederal Express tens of millions of dollar. Each day that passes causes \nthese substantial damages to increase.\n  We must not tolerate this flagrant violation of an international \nagreement. The world is watching and we should not set a dangerous \nprecedent for international aviation relations.\n  Our air carriers also have a problem obtaining sufficient access to \nboth Heathrow and Gatwick airports in the United Kingdom. Access to \nHeathrow is of particular concern since Heathrow is the most important \ninternational gateway airport serving points throughout the world. We \nmust continue to work to open these markets for our carriers.\n  The only reason that the Japanese or the British have more traffic on \nparticular routes where they ``compete'' with United States carriers is \ndue to restrictions which distort the market and protect foreign \ncarriers from true head-to-head competition with our more efficient \ncarriers. For example, they use restrictive bilateral agreements, \nimpose so-called ``doing business'' problems on our carriers such as \nputting them in terminals that are intolerable to passengers, and, in \nthe case of the Japanese, they outright refuse to respect the clear \nterms of our aviation agreement.\n  I have been working on international aviation issues because \ninternational opportunities are critical to the long-term profitability \nof our carriers. Also, consumers benefit greatly by increased \ncompetition in international markets.\n  There is an important relationship between the issues of service to \nsmall communities and international aviation policy. I tie the two \nissues together because increased international opportunities will \nstrengthen the economic health of our airline industry. In turn, this \nfinancial strength should translate into better service to all domestic \nmarkets, particularly smaller nonhub markets.\n  By working to strengthen our carriers abroad, it is my hope I am \nimproving service for consumers in underserved markets. Therefore, I am \nurging our major airlines to give fair treatment here at home to people \nwho live in smaller cities and rural areas. The administration, the \nCongress, and the airline industry should all work together to \naccomplish these domestic and international aviation goals.\n  For example, I just came from the Senate Finance Committee, on which \nI serve, where we were considering fuel taxes on various modes of \ntransportation. One issue that was discussed which is of particular \nconcern to me is the aviation fuel tax that is scheduled to go into \neffect later this year.\n  I am concerned the jet fuel tax will make the problem of air service \nin small communities much worse. I am also concerned this tax will \nadversely affect the competitiveness of our carriers in international \nmarkets.\n  Mr. President, we must never lose sight of the many difficult \nchallenges facing our air carriers. Importantly, we must never forget \nthat it is consumers and communities who have the largest stake of all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/18/senate-section/article/S10182-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10182-S10183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JIM HARDER\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER.\n   Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a dedicated, brave South \nDakotan who has made us all proud. Maj. Jim Harder, a native of South \nDakota, is an Air Force pilot and a member of the Air Force \nThunderbirds--a select group of accomplished aviators who entertain \naudiences with their aerial performances.\n\n  Jim is yet another living symbol of the hard working South Dakotan. \nHe graduated from Huron High School and South Dakota State University. \nAfter college, Jim decided to use his talents in the service of his \ncountry by joining the Air Force. He first sought to become a navigator \non an EC-135, but he \n\n[[Page S 10183]]\nso excelled in his duties that he was assigned to flying an F-16C, the \nmost advanced fighter/bomber in the Air Force. As a member of the elite \nThunderbirds, Jim performs a variety of roles: pilot, operations \nofficer, show evaluator, and safety observer.\n  For years, I as well as other Americans have enjoyed and marveled at \nthe Thunderbirds. These exceptional aviators do more than just \nentertain a crowd. They serve to demonstrate individual talents, and \ncollective skills that are second to none. It is no wonder that our Air \nForce pilots are considered the world's best. I am delighted that Jim \nis a part of this legacy of excellence.\n  Every summer, Ellsworth Air Force Base holds an annual air show which \nattracts thousands of spectators. Many South Dakotans come to enjoy an \nassortment of exhibits and historical information.\n  In addition, the base displays a fantastic array of aircraft on the \nground and in the air. At this year's show held on July 9, the \nThunderbirds were the featured attraction. So it was a homecoming for \nJim Harder, a homecoming that he was able to share with his father, \nElwood. I am sure no South Dakotan was more proud of Jim Harder and his \nfellow Thunderbirds than Elwood Harder.\n  Mr. President, I take great pride in sharing with my colleagues, the \nvisitors in the gallery, and C-SPAN viewers at home the extraordinary \nachievements of my fellow South Dakotans.\n  Jim Harder is yet another standout South Dakotan who has excelled in \nhis field. His versatile role in the Air Force Thunderbirds is a job \nthat requires dedication and diligent persistence. Most important, \nJim's skills and expertise elevates the level of performance of his \nfellow fliers.\n  Teamwork and individual dedication are why the Thunderbirds are \nrespected throughout the world. And individuals like Jim Harder--a man \nwho chose to devote his talents to the service of his country--are the \nreasons why our Nation's defense remains strong. Again, on behalf of \nall South Dakotans, I commend Jim Harder for his extraordinary \naccomplishments. I wish him continued success with the Air Force \nThunderbirds.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/18/senate-section/article/S10182-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        IN HONOR OF RUSS HANSEN\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, we all know that life on a farm is not \nalways easy. Few people know that farming is one of this country's most \nhazardous industries. Unforeseen accidents often occur, and try as we \nmight to avoid them, they seem to strike when we least expect it.\n  In 1993, one tragic incident took place on a farm in my home State. \nRuss Hansen, a 39-year-old farmer from Spink County, was killed in a \nfarming accident, leaving behind his wife, Mary, and three children, \nJoshua, Jeff, and Jill.\n  Words cannot fully console the mind when tragedies such as these \nhappen. We try to pay homage to those who have passed away, but nothing \nwill ever replace loved ones we have lost. Tributes remind us of the \nperson we once knew so well--and in their own special way help ease the \npain.\n  It was made known recently that the Hansen family will have a living \nmemorial in honor of their father and husband. Russ was a true steward \nof the land--a farmer who through his knowledge of the earth sought to \nmake the most of it and for it. Before he died, Russ donated some of \nhis farmland to South Dakota State University [SDSU]. The school used \nthe land to test varieties of wheat. Because of Russ' love of the land \nand devotion to the SDSU research, the school announced this spring \nthat the tests on his land have yielded a new hard red spring wheat. It \nis a wheat that is proving to be resistant to disease, pests, and \nshattering. And in a fitting tribute, the wheat will be called \n``Russ.'' It is expected to be on the general market by 1997.\n  Mr. President, no single person in this country has consistently been \nthe source of more innovation than the American farmer. The ritual of \nfarming is not just planting, growing, and harvesting. It is a quest to \ninnovate and challenge the land to produce something it has never \nproduced before. Russ Hansen was that kind of American farmer. I am \nsure Mary, Joshua, Jeff, and Jill Hansen are proud that Russ' legacy \nwill live on in the hearty new brand of wheat that will bear his name. \nI am proud of Russ' lifetime of devotion to the land, and the \ninnovators at South Dakota State University who worked with Russ to \nachieve this new high-quality wheat. It is a great achievement for SDSU \nand an ever-lasting tribute to Russ Hansen.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a related article printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      New Wheat Named After Farmer\n\n                       (By Jennifer DeAnn Olson)\n\n       Frankfort.--Memorials come in unexpected ways.\n       Mary Hansen received a phone call this spring saying that \n     scientists at South Dakota State University in Brookings had \n     developed a new variety of hard red spring wheat. They had \n     named the variety Russ after Hansen's husband, a 39-year-old \n     Spink County farmer and feedlot operator who died in a 1993 \n     farm accident.\n       ``Finding out about it, we were totally surprised,'' Hansen \n     said from her Frankfort farm. ``We were very proud and \n     pleased.''\n       Russ Hansen had worked closely with the people from SDSU \n     during his years of farming, donating land to be used as test \n     plots.\n       ``You had to know Russ. He could talk to anybody,'' Hansen \n     said, ``I think it was more than a working relationship (with \n     SDSU), it was a friendship.''\n       This friendship was obviously worth remembering. It yielded \n     a high-yield wheat, resistant to disease, pests and \n     shattering, once known as SD8073, now named Russ. The \n     variety, now being tested by certified seed growers, should \n     be ready for the general market by 1997.\n       Mary Hansen still lives on the farm. She has sold the \n     cattle and rented out her property. And the wheat variety has \n     been especially important to the Hansen's three children--\n     Joshua, 13; Jeff, 12; and Jill, 9.\n       ``It really says a lot about Russ,'' Hansen said.\n       ``Russ has been gone almost two years now, but he'll always \n     be around,'' she added.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/18/senate-section/article/S10183-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10183-S10184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     THE 1995 SIOUX FALLS CANARIES\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, when I was growing up in Humboldt, SD, \nprofessional baseball flourished throughout my State. I remember many \ngames from the now-defunct Basin League. Those contests of skill and \nteam play stirred within me a love and appreciation for America's \nfavorite pastime.\n  During the recent Fourth of July holiday, I was given the honor of \nthrowing out the first pitch for the Sioux Falls Canaries in its game \nagainst the Timber Bay Whiskey Jacks. Despite many wonderful plays and \nan enthusiastic crowd, the Canaries lost. Nevertheless, the evening was \nentertaining and exciting. It was baseball the way it should be played. \nThe players demonstrated superb individual skills, team dedication, and \nenjoyment of the game itself.\n  Mr. President, South Dakota professional baseball has a long and \ncolorful history as old as the State itself. It was in Sioux Falls in \n1889, the year South Dakota was granted statehood, when a pro baseball \nteam wearing bright yellow uniforms was formed in the city. The team \nwas named the ``Yellow Kids,'' after a comic strip that appeared in the \nSioux Falls Press. Upon viewing the team, Guy LaFollette, a local \nsportswriter for the Press, suggested the nickname ``Canaries.'' \nLaFollette continued to refer to the team as the Canaries in his sports \narticles. The label stuck. Eventually, the Canaries became the official \nname of the team.\n  Despite having a reputation of hiring away the best players from the \nother teams, the original Sioux Falls Canaries lasted until 1903, when \ntheir class D league, the Iowa and South Dakota League, folded.\n  Sioux Falls would be without a pro team until 1920 when the Sioux \nFalls Soos [Sues] began play in the South Dakota League. The team's \nmanager, Fred Carisch, was a veteran of the 1902 Canaries team. In \n1924, the Sioux Falls team changed its name back to the Canaries \nbecause the Sioux City Cardinals joined the Canaries as part of a new, \nexpanded, Tri-State League. Apparently, the thought was the two birds--\nthe Canaries and the Cardinals--sounded better when they played. \nUnfortunately, the league and the teams were disbanded after only one \nseason.\n  Professional baseball returned again to Sioux Falls in 1930, when Rex \nStucker organized a new version of the Canaries, which played in an \nindependent circuit for three seasons. The team \n\n[[Page S 10184]]\njoined the Nebraska State League in 1933, which was renamed the \n``Western League'' in 1938, when teams from Colorado, Wyoming, \nMinnesota, and Iowa joined.\n  In 1942, Rex Stucker upgraded the Sioux Falls Canaries from the Class \nC Western League to the Class D Northern League. However, World War II \nstopped league play after the 1942 season, and it would not resume \nuntil 1946. At that point, the Canaries was an independent team not \naffiliated with a major league baseball franchise. That would change in \n1947, when Stucker sold the Canaries to Mory Levinger, owner of the \nHappy Hour bar in Sioux Falls. Soon afterward, Levinger struck an \nagreement with the Chicago Cubs to make the Canaries one of its farm \nteams. However, in 1953, Levinger sold the team to Winnipeg and Sioux \nFalls again was without professional baseball.\n  In 1966, Sioux Falls became the home of a new team, which moved from \nthe semiprofessional Basin League to the Northern League. This team was \nknown as the Packers, however, not the Canaries, and was owned by a \ngroup of Sioux Falls businessmen. This team was a farm club for the \nCincinnati Reds. In fact, several Packers would become standouts in the \nbig leagues, most notably Ken Griffey, Sr. The Packers stayed in the \nNorthern League until the league folded after the 1971 season. Sioux \nFalls would be without a pro baseball team for more than 20 years.\n  In the early 1990's, Miles Wolff spent 2 years traveling the Upper \nMidwest meeting with interested baseball people and examining existing \nfacilities. By this time, the Upper Midwest had been the only area of \nthe Nation without minor league baseball. Mr. Wolff rightly saw it as \nan area ripe for minor league baseball expansion.\n  In June 1993, the fourth version of the Northern League began with \nsix organizations, including one in Sioux Falls. The organization was \nhonored to bring back the name of the first Sioux Falls pro team, the \nCanaries.\n  Mr. President, I am proud the Sioux Falls community has given such \ngreat support to the Canaries. In the inaugural 1993 season, the \nCanaries drew 86,187 in attendance. Last year, attendance grew to just \nshy of 100,000. This season promises to be no less of a banner year for \nSioux Falls Canaries' fan support. Currently, each home game is \naveraging 2,704 fans in attendance. This high level of fan support is \nprevalent throughout the entire Northern League. All six of the \nNorthern League teams are ranked nationally in the top 11 for average \nattendance per game for independent baseball leagues.\n  As with any quality sports team, the key to success begins with an \neffective management team and great support staff. In my opinion, the \nCanaries has one of the best organizations of any independent league \nteam. I salute team president Harry Stavernos and vice presidents Mark \nWilson, Buzz Hardy, and Rick Tracy for their leadership in guiding the \nCanaries to success. Field leadership of the team is in the capable \nhands of manager Dick Dietz, hitting instructor Frank Verdi, coach Hiro \nShirahata and player-coach Mike Burton.\n  The Sioux Falls Canaries' commitment to winning is not only \nexemplified by its management but also by the hard work and dedication \nof the players. The Canaries have amassed a won-loss record of 98-88 \nover its three seasons. The team holds the Northern League record for \nmost consecutive wins, nine in a row. The high quality of the players \nis evidenced by the 11 former Canaries now playing for major league \naffiliates.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe team roster of the 1995 Sioux Falls Canaries at the conclusion of \nmy remarks. Presently, the Canaries are only three games out of first. \nI have every reason to expect the team will finish on top by the end of \nthe season.\n  Mr. President, Sioux Falls baseball has had a great tradition of \nexceptional all-around play. I want to congratulate the Sioux Falls \nCanaries organization on more than living up to this high standard on \nthe field and giving the Sioux Falls community something to cheer \nabout. I wish the team the very best of success in the future.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        1995 SIOUX FALLS CANARIES                       \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n         No.                  Name               Position       Hometown\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDick Dietz..........

DALTON'S SPEECH AT CHANGE OF COMMAND OF \n                     COMMANDANT OF THE MARINE CORPS\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I attended the change of command of the \nCommandant of the U.S. Marine Corps where Gen. Charles Krulak relieved \nGen. Carl Mundy and became the 31st Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n  The Honorable John H. Dalton, Secretary of the Navy, made a truly \noutstanding speech. Therefore, I would like to share the contents of \nthis speech with my colleagues, so I ask unanimous consent that a copy \nof his speech entitled, ``The Marine Corps' Change of Command'' be \nprinted in the Congressional Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  The Marine Corps' Change of Command\n\n                         (By Hon. John Dalton)\n\n       Secretary White, distinguished members of Congress, General \n     Shalikashvili and the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \n     Marines, ladies and gentleman.\n       I am proud to serve as the Secretary of the United States \n     Marine Corps. And, I am deeply honored to participate in the \n     change of command of an institution that sets the standard \n     for military leadership around the world.\n       Today is an important day in the lives of these two great \n     men, General Carl Mundy and General Chuck Krulak. But, they \n     would be the first to tell you that today belongs not to \n     them, but to the Corps.\n       Their selfless attitude is seen clearly in Carl Mundy's \n     insistence that he not be recognized with any personal \n     decorations at this ceremony.\n       However, I think you all should know that on behalf of the \n     Department, I have awarded the Navy Distinguished Service \n     Medal to General Mundy. Similarly the Secretary of Defense \n     and each one of our sister services have awarded him their \n     Distinguished Service Medal.\n       General Mundy, you have served with honor, courage and \n     commitment in a manner befitting the Commandant of the Corps. \n     Our allies thank you, America thanks you and above all your \n     Marines thank you for a lifetime dedicated to the defense of \n     freedom.\n       Carl's many accomplishments and honors would not have been \n     possible without the love and support of his family, \n     especially his devoted wife, Linda. For nearly four decades \n     Linda has served as a Marine wife and mother. During the past \n     four years she has endeared herself to everyone she has \n     touched and has established a special place in history for \n     herself as the First Lady of the Marine Corps. It was an \n     honor for me to recognize her achievements with the \n     Department of the Navy's Distinguished Public Service Award.\n       The past four years have been challenging ones for the Navy \n     and Marine Corps team. Amidst the drawdown in force \n     structure, shrinking defense budgets and expanding global \n     commitments, General Mundy has led the Corps to new levels of \n     excellence, efficiency and effectiveness. By encouraging \n     closer integration\n      with the Navy, you have created a Marine Corps with enhanced \n     capabilities that is prepared for every eventuality.\n       It is this spirit of closer integration between the Navy \n     and Marine Corps that will be a legacy of Carl Mundy to our \n     Naval Service. Such integration and interoperability ensure \n     that the Navy and Marine Corps team will be prepared for the \n     challenges and battlefields of the next millennium.\n       General Mundy's inspiring leadership, bold courage, and \n     extraordinary vision have perpetuated a dynamic and \n     innovative Corps and have put in place the mechanism to \n     ensure that the Corps will continue to flourish.\n       Today is another step in the continuing evolution of the \n     Corps--one of America's true national treasures. Today we \n     witness the change of command, the passing of responsibility \n     and acceptance of accountability for the United States Marine \n     Corps.\n       General Krulak, you now take up the standard for the most \n     elite fighting force in \n\n[[Page S 10185]]\n     the world. May you command our Corps with strength, vision and the same \n     commitment to core values that marked the leadership of the \n     Commandants who precede you. The Corps will be blessed with \n     the unfailing support of your delightful wife Zandi. On \n     Tuesday of this week the 31st Commandant and his lady \n     celebrated their 31st wedding anniversary.\n       Today is important not only for Marines, but also for every \n     American, and especially those who have worn a military \n     uniform. It is a special day for us to remember the Corps' \n     heroic past and to celebrate its bright future.\n       The fundamental military values of honor, courage and \n     commitment are as much a part of the Marine Corps today as \n     they were at its birth in 1775. Marines today understand that \n     these values represent an ideal . . . an ideal worth fighting \n     for.\n       Fighting for ideals is what the Corps is all about. And, \n     the strength of today's Corps rests on a foundation of \n     extraordinary heroism rising up from the bedrock of America's \n     military history.\n       It is on that foundation of past heroism that the future of \n     the Corps will be built. It will be a future filled with \n     innovation, flexibility, resourcefulness and above all \n     spirit. It is a spirit which comes from being the best. \n     Marines know that when American interests are threatened or \n     our friends need help . . . America calls the Corps.\n       Throughout the past four years, Marines have been called \n     very often and, as throughout their history, they have \n     responded with the utmost professionalism. Whether it was \n     Haiti, Somalia, Bosnia or the Arabian Gulf, the Marines were \n     always ready to get the job done . . . and to get it done \n     right.\n       Whether as warfighters, peacekeepers, or rescuers; the \n     Marines have proven time and time again that America can \n     count on the Corps when there is a threat to our national \n     security.\n       The Marine Corps of today is just the adaptable, flexible, \n     and resourceful force America needs. In this unsettled and \n     often confusing post Cold War world, the military mission is \n     no longer as clearly defined. For this reason our military \n     forces must adapt in order to succeed.\n       Adapting is what Marines do best. The Marines have been \n     fighting America's wars for two centuries and continue to be \n     the force of choice for either keeping the peace; or storming \n     the beach.\n       In the past, Marines have done more beach storming than \n     peacekeeping, but in the future it is clear that both \n     missions will need to be performed. In my mind there is no \n     force in the world more capable of handling the complicated \n     military missions of the future than the United States Marine \n     Corps.\n       The Corps has had many great Commandants, but none who has \n     led through such a tumultuous period of internal change. \n     Today the Corps has never been better trained, better led, or \n     more ready. Only in this state would Carl Mundy even consider \n     relinquishing command of the Corps.\n       That is your legacy, ``a RELEVANT, READY and CAPABLE Corps \n     of Marines'' who embody the traditions of the past and who \n     are ready to meet the challenges of the future. RELEVANT to \n     meet the defense needs of the Nation tomorrow; READY to \n     respond instantly as America's 911 Force to prevent and \n     contain crises or fight today; and CAPABLE of meeting the \n     requirements of our National Military Strategy.\n       Carl, your days in uniform may soon be over, but your \n     service to the Corps will remain timeless. Your total \n     devotion to the Corps has nurtured America's undying love for \n     Marines. Your determination efforts have ensured that Marines \n     will always be the first to fight in America's defense.\n       Yesterday afternoon, in the oval office, our Commander in \n     Chief promoted Chuck Krulak to General. In that ceremony \n     President Clinton pointed to Carl Mundy and said \n     emphatically, ``Of all the General Officers I have worked \n     with, you were the one I knew was always telling me exactly \n     what you believed. I want you to know how much I appreciate \n     that.'' The President of the United States could not have \n     offered higher praise.\n       For fifty years Iwo Jima has been a special place for the \n     Marine Corps, and it was there atop Mount Suribachi that I \n     had the privilege to announce the President's nomination for \n     our 31st Commandant.\n       So as we consider the significance of this ceremony, a \n     change of command of the Corps that these two Marines have \n     devoted their lives to, I think it appropriate to recall the \n     words of Chaplain Roland Gittelsohn when he dedicated the \n     Fifth Marine Division Cemetery on Iwo Jima fifty years ago. \n     This February, Rabbi Gittelsohn recalled his words at the \n     ceremony commemorating that battle at the Iwo Jima War \n     Memorial beside Arlington National Cemetery. He said:\n       ``Here lie officers and men of all colors, rich men and \n     poor men together. Here are Protestants, Catholics and Jews \n     together. Here no man prefers another because of his faith or \n     despises him because of his color. Here there are no quotas \n     of how many from each group are admitted or allowed. Among \n     these men there is no discrimination. No prejudice. No \n     hatred. Theirs is the highest and purest democracy.\n       ``Any man among us, the living, who failed to understand \n     that, will thereby betray those who lie here . . . whoever \n     lifts his hand in hate against a brother, or thinks himself \n     superior to those who happen to be in a minority, makes of . \n     . . their sacrifice an empty, hollow mockery.\n       ``Thus do we consecrate ourselves, the living, to carry on \n     the struggle they began. Too much blood has gone into this \n     soil for us to let it lie barren.''\n       Those words spoken in honor of fallen Marines and Sailors \n     hold a living truth. The truth is that we, the living, must \n     carry on their struggle for liberty and freedom everyday, and \n     in everything we do.\n       God bless you, and God bless the United States Marine \n     Corps. Semper Fidelis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/18/senate-section/article/S10184-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10185-S10188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       H.R. 956 (PRODUCTS LIABILITY BILL) AND PRICE-ANDERSON ACT\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, during the course of debate on the \nproducts liability bill, I mentioned nuclear power plants and the \npossible effect that the proposed legislation might have on two issues \ndealing with a nuclear power plant problem--one being the issue of pain \nand suffering and the other being the statute of repose.\n  Then on May 9, 1995, I spoke on this issue in the U.S. Senate. I \nconcluded my remarks by saying that I wanted to do further research \npertaining to these issues.\n  I asked the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress \nto look into this and they have prepared a memorandum. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the attached memorandum from the Congressional Research \nService be printed in the Congressional Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the memorandum was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                          Library of Congress,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 23, 1995.\n     To: Sen. Howell Heflin; Attention: Jim Whiddon.\n     From: American Law Division.\n     Subject: Causes of Action under the Price-Anderson Act.\n       This is in response to your request for a memorandum \n     addressing whether state causes of action based on public \n     liability exist under the Price-Anderson Act.\\1\\ In \n     particular, your inquiry asks that we address survival of \n     state tort action, statutes of limitation and repose, and the \n     impact of the recently passed products liability legislation \n     (the House-passed and Senate-passed versions of H.R. 956, \n     104th Congress).\n     \\1\\ Footnotes at the end of the article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In Parts I and II, we analyze the Act's language, \n     legislative history and relevant case law, concluding that \n     the 1988 Amendments Act created a federal cause of action. \n     Whereas state causes of action based upon public liability \n     existed under Price-Anderson prior to the 1988 amendments, \n     such is no longer the case. The only state tort actions that \n     may continue to survive are those completely outside the \n     Price-Anderson public liability scheme. Under the 1988 \n     Amendments Act, federal courts, which have original \n     jurisdiction over public liability actions arising out of \n     nuclear incidents, are directed to apply state law \n     substantive rules. With the exception of waiver of defenses \n     provisions regarding extraordinary nuclear occurrences, the \n     Price-Anderson Act, as amended, lacks a specific statute of \n     limitations for public liability actions arising out of \n     nuclear incidents. As such, courts will apply the statute of \n     limitations in effect in the state in which the nuclear \n     incident occurred. In Part III, we analyze the possible \n     impact of the statutes of limitation and repose as contained \n     in the recently passed products liability legislation in \n     light of the Price-Anderson scheme.\n\n                             I. Background\n\n       In 1957, the Price-Anderson Act was enacted as an amendment \n     to the Atomic Energy Act in order to remove the deterrent of \n     potentially catastrophic liability to those in the private \n     sector who were interested in participating in the nuclear \n     power industry but reluctant to risk significant financial \n     resources and liability.\\2\\ In 1966, the Act was extended for \n     another ten year period and a key provision--a waiver of \n     defenses provision \\3\\--was added. Under this provision, the \n     defendant in any action involving public liability \\4\\ \n     arising from an ``extraordinary nuclear occurrence'' \\5\\ can \n     be required to waive certain legal defenses (e.g., defenses \n     based on conduct, immunity, and state statutes of \n     limitation).\\6\\ It is clear that the Act, as originally \n     enacted and as amended in 1966, was intended to have minimal \n     inference with State law.\\7\\ Also in 1966, the Act was \n     amended to include a provision authorizing the consolidation \n     in one U.S. District Court of all law suits arising from an \n     ``ENO''--conferring original jurisdiction upon the Federal \n     courts in such cases.\\8\\ The Act was amended again in 1975.\n       A long line of cases under the Act as amended through 1975 \n     had held that federal courts did not have subject matter \n     jurisdiction for claims arising out of non-ENO nuclear \n     incidents and that state tort remedies were not preempted by \n     the Act.\\9\\\n\n                          II. 1988 Amendments\n\n       Under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988, original \n     federal jurisdiction was significantly broadened to cover not \n     only those actions arising from ENOs but those \n\n[[Page S 10186]]\n     arising from any ``nuclear incident.'' \\10\\ A definition of the term \n     ``public liability action'' \\11\\ was added with provision \n     made for the substantive rules for decision to be derived \n     from State law.\\12\\ As the Act now reads, the applicable \n     section--Sec. 170(n)(2) \\13\\--states:\n       ``With respect to any public liability action arising out \n     of or resulting from a nuclear incident, the United States \n     district court in the district where the nuclear incident \n     takes place . . . shall have original jurisdiction without \n     regard to the citizenship of any party or the amount in \n     controversy. . . . [emphasis added].''\n     Section 170(n)(2) continues with provision that public \n     liability actions pending in state court shall be removed or \n     transferred to the appropriate federal district court ``upon \n     motion of the defendant or of the Commission [NRC] or the \n     Secretary [of HHS].''\n       The legislative history makes it clear that these changes \n     were intended to confer original jurisdiction in the federal \n     district courts and that Congress chose this option rather \n     than designing a new body of substantive law to govern such \n     cases.\\14\\\n\n\n                   CASE LAW UNDER THE 1988 AMENDMENTS\n\n       A recent Third Circuit Court of Appeals decision, In Re TMI \n     Litigation Case Consol. II \\15\\ stated:\n       ``Under the terms of the Amendments Act, the ``public \n     liability action'' encompass ``any legal liability'' of any \n     ``person who may be liable'' on account of a nuclear \n     incident. . . . Given the breadth of this definition, the \n     consequence of a determination that a particular plaintiff \n     has failed to state a public liability claim potentially \n     compensable under the Price Anderson Act is that he has no \n     such claim at all. After the Amendments Act, no state cause \n     of action based upon public liability exists. A claim growing \n     out of any nuclear incident is compensable under the terms of \n     the Amendments Act or it is not compensable at all. Any \n     conceivable state tort action which might remain available to \n     a plaintiff following the determination that his claim could \n     not qualify as a public liability action, could not be one \n     based on ``any legal liability'' or ``any person who may be \n     liable on account of a nuclear incident.'' It would be some \n     other species of tort altogether, and the fact that the state \n     courts might recognize such a tort has no relevance to the \n     Price-Anderson scheme. At the threshold of any action \n     asserting liability growing out of a nuclear incident, then, \n     there is a federal definitional matter to be resolved: Is \n     this a public liability action? If the answer to that \n     question is ``yes,'' the provisions of the Price-Anderson Act \n     apply; there can be no action for injuries caused by the \n     release of radiation from federally licensed nuclear power \n     plants separate and apart from the federal public liability \n     action created by the Amendments Act.\\16\\''\n       The court went on to state:\n       ``The Amendments Act creates a federal cause of action \n     which did not exist prior to the Act, establishes federal \n     jurisdiction for that cause of action, and channels all legal \n     liability to the federal courts through that cause of action. \n     . . . Thus, Congress clearly intended to supplant all \n     possible state causes of action when the factual prerequisite \n     of the statute are met.\\17\\''\n       Another recent Court of Appeals decision, O'Conner v. \n     Commonwealth Edison Co.,\\18\\ held that the Amendments Act \n     embodies substantive federal policies and, rather than merely \n     create federal jurisdiction for a state claim, created a new \n     federal cause of action that supplanted the prior state cause \n     of action.\\19\\ With regard to the interpretation of the \n     phrase ``law of the State'' as it appears in the definition \n     of ``public liability action.'' \\20\\ a recent case of first \n     impression reasoned that the phrase was intended to be \n     broadly defined--to include the whole law of the state (state \n     substantive law and choice of law provisions).\\21\\ Another \n     recent federal court decision noted that because Price-\n     Anderson provides no statute of limitations, the limitations \n     period must be borrowed from State law.\\22\\\n\n\n         federal cause of action based on state substantive law\n\n       The Price-Anderson Act, as originally drafted, did not \n     create a federal cause of action. However, it is clear that \n     the Amendments Act of 1988--although relying up on state law \n     elements--does. The 1988 Amendments Act broadened the scope \n     of the Price-Anderson Act and provides for retroactive \n     subject matter jurisdiction in the federal courts over claims \n     involving nuclear incidents and Specifically, federal courts \n     have original jurisdiction over any ``public liability \n     action'' arising out of a ``nuclear incident.'' \\23\\\n       The new definition of ``public liability action'' created a \n     federal cause of action (while directing the federal courts \n     to apply state law) by stipulating that any such suit be \n     deemed to be an action arising under the Price-Anderson Act--\n     meeting Constitutional requirements. \\24\\ In the Amendment \n     Act, Congress created a federal tort which has its origins in \n     state law. The basis of the action no longer stems from state \n     law but now arises from federal law.\\25\\ State law rules \n     shall apply unless inconsistent.\\26\\\n       If the public liability action results from an ENO, the \n     federal statute of limitations provided in Sec. 170(n)(1) may \n     apply. If the indemnity agreement required under the Act \n     incorporated a waiver of defenses based on a statute of \n     limitations, state statutes of limitations that are more \n     restrictive than that prescribed in Sec. 170(n)(1) (3-years-\n     from discovery) will be superseded while those that are less \n     restrictive (e.g., longer than the prescribed period) will \n     remain in effect. The Act contains no other federal statute \n     of limitations \\27\\ other than that provided in the case of \n     waiver of defenses with respect to ENOs. Therefore, to the \n     extent that a state provides for a specific statute of \n     limitations (not otherwise inconsistent with Sec. 170 of the \n     Act), the federal court (or state court if such action is not \n     removed or transferred) appears to be required to apply such \n     state law provision.\\28\\\n              III. Effects of Products Liability Bill \\29\\\n\n       Products liability suits are subject in every state to a \n     statute of limitations, which is a period of time after an \n     injury or illness occurs, or after its symptoms or their \n     cause is discovered, within which an action must be brought. \n     A minority of states have also enacted a statute of repose, \n     which bars products liability suits where the injury-causing \n     products exceeds a specified age. The House-passed version of \n     H.R. 956 contains no statute of limitations, whereas the \n     Senate-passed version contains a two-year statute of \n     limitations. Both bills contain statutes of repose, but they \n     are significantly different.\n\n\n                         statute of limitations\n\n       Because the House-passed version of H.R. 956 contains no \n     statute of limitations, it would not affect the Price-\n     Anderson Act, which, as noted, also has none and therefore \n     applies the applicable state statute of limitations. Section \n     109(a) of the Senate-passed version of H.R. 956 has a two-\n     year statute of limitations, but section 102(c)(2) of the \n     bill provides that nothing in it ``may be construed to .  .  \n     . supersede or alter any Federal Law.'' However, section \n     102(b)(1) provides that the bill supersedes state law ``to \n     the extent that State law applies to an issue covered under \n     [the bill].''\n       As noted, the Price-Anderson Act, as amended in 1988, \n     creates a federal cause of action and does not permit state \n     causes of action within its public liability scheme. Because \n     the Senate-passed version of H.R. 956 would not supersede or \n     alter any federal law, it appears that it would not alter the \n     Price-Anderson's Act scheme of using state statutes of \n     limitations. One could argue that, because the Price-Anderson \n     Act uses state statutes of limitations, and the Senate-passed \n     bill supersedes state law, the Price-Anderson Act therefore \n     would use the Senate-passed bill's statute of limitations. \n     Although this interpretation does not seem out of the \n     question, it appears that the better view would be that to \n     use the Senate-passed bill's statute of limitations in Price-\n     Anderson Act cases would be to supersede a federal law, which \n     would be contrary to the bill's expressed intent. \n     Nevertheless, as this seems uncertain, it might be advisable \n     for Congress to make its intention explicit.\n\n\n                           statutes of repose\n\n       Section 109(b) of the Senate-passed version of H.R. 956 \n     contains a 20-year statute of repose applicable to any \n     product that is a ``durable good.'' The definition of this \n     term, in section 101(6), apparently is confused in its \n     incorporation of the Internal Revenue Code, but essentially \n     includes products used in a trade or business but not \n     consumer goods. Therefore, we will assume that the term would \n     include nuclear power plants and their component parts.\n       The Senate bill's statute of repose would not apply, even \n     to durable goods, in four situations: (1) cases of toxic \n     harm; (2) where the product is ``[a] motor vehicle, vessel, \n     aircraft, or train that is used primarily to transport \n     passengers for hire''; (3) where the defendant made an \n     express written warranty as to the safety of the product that \n     was longer than 20 years, but, at its expiration, the statute \n     of repose would apply; and (4) small aircraft covered by the \n     18-year statute of repose prescribed by the General Aviation \n     Revitalization Act of 1995, Public Law 103-298, 49 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 40101 note.\n       Section 106 of the House-passed version of H.R. 956 \n     contains a 15-year statute of repose applicable to all \n     products, including consumer goods, except small aircraft, \n     covered by the 18-year statute of repose prescribed by the \n     General Aviation Revitalization Act of 1995. There are only \n     two other exceptions to the House bill's 15-year statute of \n     repose: (1) if the defendant made an express written warranty \n     as to the safety of the product that was longer than 15 \n     years, the warranty would apply, but, at its expiration, the \n     statute of repose would apply; and (2) the 15-year statute of \n     repose would ``not apply to a physical illness the evidence \n     of which does not ordinarily appear less than 15 years after \n     the first exposure to the product.''\n       With respect to the preemption of other laws, the House- \n     and the Senate-passed bills are the same with respect to \n     federal laws but different as to state laws. With respect to \n     federal laws, section 102(c)(2) of the Senate-passed bill \n     provides, as noted above, that nothing in it ``may be \n     construed to .  .  . supersede or alter any Federal law.'' \n     Similarly, section 402(2) of the House-passed bill provides \n     that nothing in it ``shall be construed to .  .  . supersede \n     any Federal law.'' (The Senate-passed bill's not using the \n     word ``alter'' would not appear to be of any consequence.)\n       With respect to state laws, section 101(b) of the House-\n     passed bill, like section 102(b)(1) of the Senate-passed \n     bill, provides that the bill supersedes state law ``to the \n     extent that State law applies to an issue covered under [the \n     bill].'' However, the Senate-passed bill, but not the House-\n     passed bill, contains an \n\n[[Page S 10187]]\n     exception applicable to its statute of repose. It provides that, if a \n     state law prescribes a shorter statute of repose, such state \n     law would apply. All state statutes or repose are shorter \n     than 20 years, but fewer than half the states have statutes \n     of repose. Therefore, the effect of the Senate-passed bill \n     would be to impose a 20-year statute of repose on the \n     majority of states without statutes of repose, but to leave \n     the other state's statutes of repose as they are.\n       How would these provisions affect the Price-Anderson Act? \n     This depends upon whether the Price-Anderson Act incorporates \n     state statutes of repose, as it does state statutes of \n     limitations. We have found no authority on point, but it \n     appears unlikely that it would incorporate state statutes of \n     repose. This is because such statutes can preclude suits from \n     being filed even before an injury occurs, and, as the Price-\n     Anderson Act creates a federal cause of action, it seems \n     unlikely that a court would construe it, in the absence of \n     some expression of congressional intent, to allow a state to \n     preclude use of a federal cause of action. If the Price-\n     Anderson Act does not incorporate state statutes of repose, \n     then\n      neither the House- nor Senate-passed statutes of repose \n     would apply, as both bills state that they would not \n     supersede federal law.\n       If, however, the Price-Anderson Act does incorporate state \n     statutes of repose, then we may apply the same analysis we \n     did with respect to the Senate-passed bill's statute of \n     limitations. We repeat what we wrote there, substituting \n     ``statute of repose'' for ``statute of limitations,'' and \n     referring to both versions of H.R. 956 instead of only the \n     Senate-passed version: Because neither version of H.R. 956 \n     would supersede any federal law, it appears that neither \n     would alter the Price-Anderson's Act scheme of using state \n     statutes of repose. One could argue that, because the Price-\n     Anderson Act uses state statutes of repose, and both the \n     House- and Senate-passed versions of H.R. 956 would supersede \n     state law, the Price-Anderson Act would use the House- or \n     Senate-passed bill's statute of repose. Although this \n     interpretation does not seem out of the question, it appears \n     that the better view would be that to use either bill's \n     statute of repose in Price-Anderson Act cases would be to \n     supersede a federal law, which would be contrary to either \n     bill's expressed intent.\n       Suppose, however (continuing to assume that the Price-\n     Anderson Act incorporates state statutes of repose, which \n     appears more likely not to be the case), that the Price-\n     Anderson Act would use the House- or Senate-passed bill's \n     statute of repose. Then the effect of the bills would differ. \n     The House-passed bill's 15-year statute of repose would apply \n     in every case, but the Senate-passed 20-year statute of \n     repose would apply only in those states that do not have a \n     shorter statute of repose. In those states that do have a \n     shorter statute of repose, it would apply.\n       As noted, however, it seems more likely that state statutes \n     of repose do not apply now and that no statute of repose \n     would apply under either the House- or Senate-passed bills. \n     Again, though, it might be advisable for Congress to make its \n     intentions explicit.\n     Henry Cohen,\n       Legislative Attorney.\n     Ellen M.

Per the \n     legislative history, the stipulated statute of limitations \n     period was not ``a maximum period for assertion of Price-\n     Anderson covered claims, since the waiver authorized by the \n     bill serves only to avoid the application of more restrictive \n     State statutes of limitations.

No. 1605, supra n.3 at 21, reprinted at 1966 \n     U.S.C.C.A.N. 3221. The minimum statute of limitations for the \n     filing of claims after an accident supersedes more \n     restrictive State statutes of limitations, but does not \n     affect less restrictive State laws.

Mr. President, a news article in this morning's \nWashington Times says the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms \nrecently purchased 22 OV-10D aircraft from the Defense Department.\n  These aircraft were used by the Marine Corps in the Vietnam war for \nclose air support in combat. They were also used in Operation Desert \nStorm for night observation.\n  The aircraft are heavily weapons-capable, especially from a law-\nenforcement perspective. ATF says the planes have been stripped of \ntheir weapons. Their purpose, according to ATF, is for surveillance. \nThe planes can locate people on the ground by detecting their body \nheat.\n  It's no secret that the ATF is undergoing intense public scrutiny. It \nhas done some real bone-headed things. It has been criticized for \nenforcing the law while crossing the line of civil rights protections.\n  ATF's credibility will be even further tested the next 2 weeks when \njoint committee hearings are held in the other body on the Waco matter. \nAnd the Senate Judiciary Committee also will hold hearings on Waco in \nSeptember.\n  I raise this issue today, Mr. President, because the purchase of \nthese aircraft in the current climate might continue to feed the \npublic's skepticism, and erode the pubic's confidence in our law \nenforcement agencies.\n  For that reason, it is incumbent upon ATF to fully disclose and fully \ninform the public as to the purchase of these aircraft.\n  First, what, specifically, will they be used for?\n  Second, where will they be located?\n  Third, what assurances are there that the planes will remain unarmed?\n  The sooner these questions are answered by ATF--openly and candidly--\nthe less chance there is that the public's skepticism will grow.\n  Mr. President, the continued credibility of the ATF is on the line, \nin my judgment. At times such as these, when scrutiny is at its \nhighest, the best strategy is to go on the offense. Spare no expense in \ndisclosing fully and swiftly. Because full and swift disclosure is the \nfirst step in restoring credibility.\n  The ATF's credibility is important not just for itself, but for law \nenforcement in general. There is much work to do to restore the \npublic's trust and confidence. I hope that ATF will step up to the \nchallenge and provide the necessary assurances.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Times \narticle, written by Jerry Seper, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, July 18, 1995]\n\n                 ATF Gets 22 Planes To Aid Surveillance\n\n\n                   Weapons-capable aircraft repainted\n\n                            (By Jerry Seper)\n\n       The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has obtained 22 \n     counterinsurgency, heavy-weapons-capable military aircraft.\n       The 300-mph OV-10D planes--one of several designations used \n     by the Marine Corps during the Vietnam War for gunfire and \n     missile support of ground troops, and by the Air Force during \n     Operation Desert Storm for night observation--have been \n     transferred from the Defense Department to ATF.\n       The turboprop aircraft, which will be used for day and \n     night surveillance support, were designed to locate people on \n     the ground through their body heat.\n       When used by the military services, the planes were \n     equipped with infrared tracking systems, ground-mapping \n     radar, laser range-finders, gun sights and 20mm cannons.\n       ATF spokeswoman Susan McCarron confirmed yesterday that the \n     agency had obtained the aircraft but noted they had been \n     stripped of their armament. She said that nine of the OV-10Ds \n     were operational and that the remaining 13 were being used \n     for spare parts.\n       ``We have nine OV-10Ds that are unarmed; they have no \n     weapons on them,'' Ms. McCarron said. ``They are being used \n     for surveillance and photography purposes. The remainder are \n     being used for spare parts.''\n       Ms. McCarron said the aircraft were obtained by ATF from \n     the Defense Department ``when DOD was getting rid of them,'' \n     and that other agencies also had received some of the \n     airplanes.\n       General Service Administration records show that some of \n     the unarmed aircraft also were transferred to the Bureau of \n     Land Management for use in survey work, while others went to \n     the California\n      Forestry Department for use in spotting fires and in \n     directing ground and aerial crews in combating them.\n       Other models of the OV-10 also are being used by officials \n     in Washington state for nighttime surveillance of fishing \n     vessels suspected of overfishing the coastal waters.\n       The transfer of the aircraft to ATF comes at a time of \n     heightened public skepticism and congressional scrutiny of \n     the agency's ability to enforce the law without trampling on \n     the rights of citizens.\n       The ATF's image suffered mightily in the aftermath of its \n     1993 raid and subsequent shootout at the Branch Davidian \n     compound in Waco, Texas, during which four agents and six \n     Davidians were killed. It sustained another public-relations \n     blow after it was revealed that ATF agents helped organize a \n     whites-only ``Good O' Boys Roundup'' in the Tennessee hills.\n       Hearings of the Waco matter begin tomorrow in the House. A \n     Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the racist trappings of \n     the roundup is scheduled for Friday.\n       One Senate staffer yesterday said there was ``some real \n     interest'' in the ATF's acquisition of the aircraft, and that \n     questions ``probably will be asked very soon of the agency'' \n     about the specifics of their use and locations where they \n     have been assigned.\n       According to federal law enforcement sources and others, \n     including two airline pilots who have seen and photographed \n     the ATF planes, two of the combat-capable aircraft--known as \n     ``Broncos''--have been routed to Shawnee, Okla., where they \n     were painted dark blue over the past month at an aircraft \n     maintenance firm known as Business Jet Designs Inc.\n       Michael Pruitt, foreman at Business Jet Designs, confirmed \n     yesterday that two of the ATF aircraft had been painted at \n     the Shawnee site and that at least one more of the OV-10Ds \n     ``was on the way.'' Mr. Pruitt said the aircraft were painted \n     dark blue with red and white trim. The sources said the paint \n     jobs cost the ATF about $20,000 each.\n       The firm's owner, Johnny Patterson, told associates last \n     month he expected to be painting at least 12 of the ATF \n     aircraft but was unsure whether he could move all of them \n     fast enough through his shop. Mr. Patterson was out of town \n     yesterday and not available for comment.\n       According to the sources, the ATF's OV-10Ds, recently were \n     overhauled under the government's Service Life Extension \n     Program and were equipped with a state-of-the-art forward-\n     looking infrared system that allows the pilot to locate and \n     identify targets at nights--similar to the tracking system \n     used on the Apache advanced attack helicopter.\n       Designed by Rockwell International, the OV-10D originally \n     was outfitted with two 7.62mm M-60C machine guns, each with \n     500 \n\n[[Page S 10189]]\n     rounds of ammunition. It also was modified to carry one Sidewinder \n     missile under each wing, Snakeye bombs, fire bombs, rocket \n     packages and cluster bombs.\n       The OV-10D can carry a 20mm gun turret with 1,500 rounds of \n     ammunition.\n       During the Vietnam War, two OV-10Ds were used for a variety \n     of missions during a six-week period and flew more than 200 \n     missions in which they were credited with killing 300 enemy \n     troops and saving beleaguered outposts from being overrun by \n     the communists.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/18/senate-section/article/S10188-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO BEULAH G. VARNELL\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I want to commend and congratulate an \noutstanding employee of the Department of Agriculture in Alabama, \nBeulah G. Varnell. She has been working in various capacities for the \nDepartment there for over 50 consecutive years.\n  Prior to joining the Department of Agriculture's Consolidated Farm \nService Agency [CFSA], Mrs. Varnell worked at the Red Stone Arsenal in \nHuntsville, AL, for a short period of time. In 1945, she began work as \nAssistant Clerk of Conservation Materials and the next year became \nPrincipal Conservation Material Clerk. She progressed steadily over the \nnext few years to Senior Clerk in 1949.\n  Beulah Varnell has demonstrated exceptional ability to assuming and \ncarrying out many programs, with primary responsibilities for \nadministrative, price support, conservation, wool and mohair, and feed \ngrain. She became Chief Program Assistant in 1966 and is known across \nthe State for her knowledge of CFSA programs and her extraordinary \nability to get the job done and done well. This is reflected by her \nwillingness to help out with all other programs in the county office.\n  She has worked for four different CEO's during her 50 years with the \nagency. She has always donated annual leave to the leave transfer \nrecipients and maintains 240 hours of annual leave at the end of each \nyear as indicated by all available records. She currently has \naccumulated 4,103 hours of sick leave, and has never been off work for \nany extended period of time. There is a familiar anecdote that Beulah \nonce had a wreck while on her way to work and asked that her typewriter \nbe brought to her home so that she could continue her duties \nuninterrupted. That is dedication.\n  Beulah married Royce Varnell, who is retired from the Tennessee \nValley Authority, in 1950. She is very close to her family, including \nher brother, 3 sisters, nieces, and nephews. The Varnell's have two \nfarms in Rogersville, AL, one planted with soybeans, the other \nmaintaining several head of cattle. Beulah has lived on a farm in \nRogersville all her life and has been associated with all aspects of \nfarming through personal experiences and her job with CFSA.\n  She is an active member of the Rogersville Church of Christ where she \nteaches a class. Beulah and Royce have a garden every year and also \nmaintain a numerous assortment of flowers around their home. In her \nspare time, she enjoys crocheting and quilting. She also enjoys \nspending time at the camphouse on the Tennessee River, visiting with \nfriends and family.\n  In short, Beulah Varnell enjoys life to its fullest, and is happiest \nwhen helping others. She is a great asset to CFSA and the Department of \nAgriculture, having always remained totally dedicated to the needs of \ncounty producers. I congratulate her and salute her as one of the best \nexamples of public service our Nation has to offer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/18/senate-section/article/S10189-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           IS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft].\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1786\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, throughout the current debate on S. 343, \nregulatory reform, little has been said about the devastating effects \nof regulations on America's urban core inner-city centers. Yet it is \nprecisely our Nation's most distressed urban areas which are really \nthreatened as a result of the onerous implications of some of the \nregulations on the city center. I believe it is time for us to look at \nthose regulations as they relate to the cities and the potential for \njob growth and development in those cities. And it is time for us to \nhave a look at whether or not we can mitigate the impacts of regulation \nagainst some of the areas where job development and growth are most \nchallenging.\n  So I have submitted an amendment which is called the Urban Regulatory \nRelief Zone Act of 1995, an amendment to Senate bill 343, which is \ndesigned to try to provide that kind of relief. I believe it is in the \nbest interests of our urban centers to be able to develop waivers so \nwhen we really find the regulations are hurting the health, the safety, \nthe well-being, the security of our citizens, that, in fact, those \nregulatory provisions can be waived in cooperation with the Federal \nGovernment to provide an opportunity for jobs.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be added, add the \n     following:\n\n               ``TITLE II--URBAN REGULATORY RELIEF ZONES\n\n     SECTION 201. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Urban Regulatory Relief Zone \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the likelihood that a proposed business site will \n     comply with many government regulations is inversely related \n     to the length of time over which a site has been utilized for \n     commercial and/or industrial purposes in the past, thus \n     rendering older sites in urban areas the sites most unlikely \n     to be chosen for new development and thereby forcing new \n     development away from the areas most \n\n[[Page S 10190]]\n     in need of economic growth and job creation; and\n       (2) broad Federal regulations often have unintended social \n     and economic consequences in urban areas where such \n     regulations, among other things--\n       (A) offend basic notions of common sense, particularly when \n     applied to individual sites;\n       (B) adversely impact economic stability;\n       (C) result in the unnecessary loss of existing jobs and \n     businesses;\n       (D) undermine new economic development, especially in \n     previously used sites;\n       (E) create undue economic hardships while failing \n     significantly to protect human health, particularly in areas \n     where economic development is urgently needed in order to \n     improve the health and welfare of residents over the long \n     term; and\n       (F) contribute to social deterioration to a such degree \n     that high unemployment, crime, and other economic and social \n     problems create the greatest risk to the health and well-\n     being of urban residents.\n\n     SEC. 203. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are to--\n       (1) enable qualifying cites to provide for the general \n     well-being,\n      health, safety and security for their residents living in \n     distressed areas by empowering such cities to obtain \n     selective relief from Federal regulations that undermine \n     economic stability and development in distressed areas \n     within the city; and\n       (2) authorize Federal agencies to waive the application of \n     specific Federal regulations in distressed urban areas \n     designated as Urban Regulatory Relief Zones by an Economic \n     Development Commission--\n       (A) upon application through the Office of Management and \n     Budget by an Economic Development Commission established by a \n     qualifying city pursuant to section 205; and\n       (B) upon a determination by the appropriate Federal agency \n     that granting such a waiver will not substantially endanger \n     health or safety.\n\n     SEC. 204. ELIGIBILITY FOR WAIVERS.\n\n       (a) Eligible Cities.--The mayor or chief executive officer \n     of a city may establish an Economic Development Commission to \n     carry out the purposes of section 205 if the city has a \n     population greater than 200,000 according to:\n       (1) the U.S. Census Bureau's 1992 estimate for city \n     populations; or\n       (2) beginning six months after the enactment of this title, \n     the U.S. Census Bureau's latest estimate for city \n     populations.\n       (b) Distressed Area.--Any census tract within a city shall \n     qualify as distressed area if--\n       (1) 33 percent or more of the resident population in the \n     census tract is below the poverty line; or\n       (2) 45 percent or more of out-of-school males aged 16 and \n     over in the census tract worked less than 26 weeks in the \n     preceding year; or\n       (3) 36 percent or more families with children under age 18 \n     in the census tract have an unmarried parent as head of the \n     household; or\n       (4) 17 percent or more of the resident families in the \n     census tract received public assistance income in the \n     preceding year.\n\n     SEC. 205. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COMMISSIONS.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The mayor or chief executive officer of a \n     qualifying city under section 204 may appoint an Economic \n     Development Commission for the purpose of--\n       (1) designating distressed areas, or a combination of \n     distressed areas with one another or with adjacent industrial \n     or commercial areas, within the city as Urban Regulatory \n     Relief Zones; and\n       (2) making application through the Office of Management and \n     Budget to waive the application of specific Federal \n     regulations within such Urban Regulatory Relief Zones.\n       (b) Composition.--To the greatest extent practicable, an \n     Economic Development Commission shall include--\n       (1) residents representing a demographic cross section of \n     the city population; and\n       (2) members of the business community, private civic \n     organizations, employers, employees, elected officials, and \n     State and local regulatory authorities.\n       (c) Limitation.--No more than one Economic Development \n     Commission shall be established or designated within a \n     qualifying city.\n\n     SEC. 206. LOCAL PARTICIPATION.\n\n       (a) Public Hearings.--Before designating an area as an \n     Urban Regulatory Relief Zone, an Economic Development \n     Commission established pursuant to section 205 shall hold a \n     public hearing, after giving adequate public notice, for the \n     purpose of soliciting the opinions and suggestions of those \n     persons who will be affected by such designation.\n       (b) Individual Requests.--The Economic Development \n     Commission shall establish a process by which individuals may \n     submit requests to the Economic Development Commission to \n     include specific Federal regulations in the Commission's \n     application to the Office of Management and Budget seeking \n     waivers of Federal regulations.\n       (c) Availability of Commission Decisions.--After holding a \n     hearing under paragraph (a) and before submitting any waiver \n     applications to the Office of Management and Budget pursuant \n     to section 207, the Economic Development Commission shall \n     make publicly available--\n       (1) a list of all areas within the city to be designated as \n     Urban Regulatory Relief Zones, if any;\n       (2) a list of all regulations for which the Economic \n     Development Commission will request a waiver from a Federal \n     agency; and\n       (3) the basis for the city's findings that the waiver of a \n     regulation would improve the health and safety and economic \n     well-being of the city's residents and the data supporting \n     such a determination.\n\n     SEC. 207. WAIVER OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) Selection of Regulations.--An Economic Development \n     Commission may select for waiver, within an Urban Regulatory \n     Relief Zone, Federal regulations that--\n       (1)(A) are unduly burdensome to business concerns located \n     within an area designated as an Urban Regulatory Relief Zone; \n     or\n       (B) discourages new economic development within the zone; \n     or\n       (C) creates undue economic hardships in the zone; or\n       (D) contributes to the social deterioration of the zone; \n     and\n       (2) if waived, will not substantially endanger health or \n     safety.\n       (b) Request for Waiver.--(1) An Economic Development \n     Commission shall submit a request for the waiver of Federal \n     regulations to the Office of Management and Budget.\n       (2) Such request shall--\n       (A) identify the area designated as an Urban Regulatory \n     Relief Zone by the Economic Development Commission;\n       (B) identify all regulations for which the Economic \n     Development Commission seeks a waiver; and\n       (C) explain the reasons that waiver of the regulations \n     would economically benefit the Urban Regulatory Relief Zone \n     and the data supporting such determination.\n       (c) Review of Waiver Request.--No later than 60 days after \n     receiving the request for waiver, the Office of Management \n     and Budget shall--\n       (1) review the request for waiver;\n       (2) determine whether the request for waiver is complete \n     and in compliance with this title, using the most recent \n     census data available at the time each applicant is \n     submitted; and\n       (3) after making a determination under paragraph (2)--\n       (A) submit the request for waiver to the Federal agency \n     that promulgated the regulation and notify the requesting \n     Economic Development Commission of the date on which the \n     request was submitted to such agency; or\n       (B) notify the requesting Economic Development Commission \n     that the request is not in compliance with this Act with an \n     explanation of the basis for such determination.\n       (d) Modification of Waiver Requests.--An Economic \n     Development Commission may submit modifications to a waiver \n     request.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The provisions of this title shall become effective one day \n     after the date of enactment.''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I sent an amendment to the amendment \nto the desk because I think Senator Ashcroft is doing a very important \nthing for the urban areas of our country. It is clear that we need to \ndo everything we can to create jobs in our urban areas, and \nparticularly in the distressed parts of our urban areas.\n  I did make a minor amendment in the change of the effective date, but \nI support Senator Ashcroft's amendment wholeheartedly and appreciate \nhis yielding the floor to me for this short time.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1581\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we all want significant and meaningful \nregulatory reform. No one wants rules that do not make sense. Nobody \nwants regulatory requirements that exceed real needs. We want \nGovernment to be smart, effective, reasonable, and practical.\n  There are plenty of regulatory horror stories. Some are accurate and \nsome are not. There is more than enough evidence for us to be convinced \nof the fact that the regulatory process is broken and needs fixing. We \nspent several months in Governmental Affairs earlier this year \nconsidering a bill introduced by Senators Roth and Glenn which, with a \nfew important amendments, we reported to the full Senate for its \nconsideration. It was passed by a unanimous, bipartisan vote of 15 to \n0. It has cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment, legislative review, \nand a procedure for the review of existing rulings. With a few \nmodifications this is the Glenn-Chafee substitute that is now before \nus. It is tough medicine that is designed to cure and not to kill the \nregulatory process.\n  The Glenn-Chafee substitute is tough because it would require, by \nlaw, that every major rule be subject to a cost-benefit analysis and, \nfor key agencies, a risk assessment. It would require that each agency \nassess whether the benefits of the rule that it is proposing or \npromulgating will justify the costs of implementing it; and whether the \nrule is the most cost-effective rule among the various alternative \nproposals.\n  These two elements are key to rational rulemaking. It is tough \nbecause, by statute, it resolves once and for all the role of the \nPresident in overseeing the regulatory process. The bill gives the \nPresident the authority to oversee the cost-benefit analysis and risk \nassessment requirements, and recognizes the significant contribution \nthat the President can make to rational rulemaking.\n  It gives Congress the right to stop a rule before it takes effect. It \nis tough because it allows for judicial review of an agency's \ndetermination as to whether or not a rule meets the $100 million \neconomic impact test, and because a rule can be remanded to an agency \nfor the failure of the agency to do the cost-benefit analysis or risk \nassessment.\n  It is tough because it requires rules scheduled for review to be \nsubject to repeal, should the agency fail to review them in 10 years, \naccording to the schedule and requirements of this legislation.\n  The Glenn-Chafee substitute also reflects some common sense, because \nit recognizes that decisions about benefits and costs are, by \nnecessity, not an exact science but an exercise of judgment. It \nreflects common sense because it does not subject all rules to \ncongressional review, but only the major rules. It reflects common \nsense because it uses information as a tool for assessing agency \nperformance and makes that information available for everyone to judge \nand to challenge.\n  The Dole-Johnston amendment goes too far. In its zeal for reform, it \noverreaches and damages the very process that it sets out to repair.\n  It is not reform. It is overload. It is like throwing a bucket of \nwater to a drowning person. It is as if a doctor is tripling the \nprescribed dosage in order to get a better effect. It ends up actually \nharming the patient instead of helping.\n  While the Dole-Johnston substitute is an improvement over S. 334, as \nintroduced, and has been improved in some way, it still falls far short \nof the goal that we need for regulatory reform, which is to improve the \nregulatory process so that it works better, results in rules that make \nsense, and at the same time we maintain the important health, safety \nand environmental protections that Americans expect and deserve. The \nDole-Johnston substitute would bog down--rather than clean up--the \nregulatory process, and would put important health, safety, and \nenvironmental protections needlessly at risk.\n  The Cabinet officials of this administration have issued a statement \nof policy stating that they would recommend that the President veto S. \n343 in its present form, as of July 10, 1995, when the policy statement \nwas written. The summary states that the cumulative effect of S. 343 \nwould burden the regulatory system with additional paperwork, \nunnecessary cost, significant delay, and excessive litigation, and then \nstates in a very unusual document that the Secretaries of Labor, \nAgriculture, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, \nTransportation, Treasury, Interior, EPA, and the Director of OMB all \nwould make that recommendation for a veto.\n  This document has been put in the Record. It sets forth paragraph by \nparagraph, issue by issue, and item by item why the Dole-Johnston \napproach represents overload, why it would drown the system instead of \nrepairing it.\n  The Glenn-Chafee substitute would fundamentally change, as we should, \nthe way that Federal regulatory agencies do business. At the same time, \nit would keep a system that would allow us to preserve critically \nneeded health, safety, and environmental approaches. The Glenn-Chafee \nsubstitute would help prevent regulatory agencies from issuing rules \nthat are not based on good common sense or on good science, or that \nwould impose costs that are not justified by the benefits of the rule. \nBut it would not inhibit or prevent agencies from taking the necessary \nsteps that the American public wants to take to protect their health \nand their environment and their safety.\n  The question here is the balance that we are going to set. That is \nreally the issue. And it is an incredibly detailed and arcane bunch of \nissues that we must deal with. But if we make a big mistake and go way \ntoo far and bog down a system in a whole series of new approaches \nsubject to litigation, we will end up doing a tremendous disfavor, not \njust to the American people but to the business community itself, which \nalso needs the regulatory system to work.\n  Glenn-Chafee strikes a good balance in a number of ways. First, all \nFederal agencies would be required to perform and publish cost-benefit \nanalyses before issuing major rules. The agencies would be required to \ncompare the costs and benefits of not only the proposed rule but of \nreasonable alternatives as well, including non-regulatory, market-based \napproaches. The agencies would be required to explain whether the \nexpected benefits of the rule justify the cost and whether the rule \nwill achieve the benefits in a more cost-effective manner than the \nalternatives. The cost-benefit analysis would be reviewed by a panel of \nindependent experts, and the agencies would be required to respond to \npeer reviewers' concerns.\n  Under Glenn-Chafee, the major regulatory agencies would be required \nto perform and publish risk assessment before issuing major rules \nregulating \n\n[[Page S 10192]]\nrisks to the environment, health, and safety. The risk assessments \nwould be required to be based on reliable scientific data, and would \ndisclose and explain any assumptions and value judgments. The risk \nassessment would have to be reviewed by a panel of independent experts, \nand agencies would have to respond to peer reviewers' concerns. Federal \nagencies would be required to review important regulations, eliminate \nunnecessary regulations, and reform any that do not meet the new \nstandards that this bill would create. If an agency fails to conduct a \nreview within the time required by the schedule, it would be required \nto issue a notice of proposed rulemaking to repeal the rule rather than \nto have the rule automatically sunset. That rulemaking would have to be \ncompleted in 2 years. That is one of the key differences between the \ntwo approaches that we will be deciding a little later on today.\n  Congress would have under Glenn-Chafee 45 days before issuance of any \nmajor rule to review the rule, to prevent it from taking effect by \npassing expedited procedures in a joint resolution of disapproval. That \nfinally would put elected representatives in a position to assure that \nagencies' rules are consistent with Congress' intent. And this is the \npower that I have fought to create as long as I have been in this body.\n  Under Glenn-Chafee, covered agencies would be required to set \nregulatory priorities, to address the risks that are most serious and \ncan be addressed in a cost-effective manner. Agencies would be required \nto explain and reflect these priorities in their budget requests.\n  Every 2 years the President would be required to report to Congress \nthe cost and the benefits of all regulatory programs and \nrecommendations for reform. The OMB would be required by law to oversee \ncompliance with the bill, and would be required to review all major \nrules before issuance. This would strengthen Presidential control over \nregulatory agencies, particularly the independent agencies.\n  The Glenn-Chafee substitute includes all of the provisions that we \nneed to produce lasting and meaningful regulatory reform. In a number \nof respects Glenn-Chafee goes farther than the regulatory reform bill \npassed by the House of Representatives, H.R. 9, which does not provide \nfor the review of existing regulations or congressional review, or the \nintegration of comparative risk analysis into agency priority setting \nand budget.\n  Glenn-Chafee goes past S. 1080, the Omnibus Regulatory Reform bill \nthat passed the Senate overwhelmingly in the 1980's. And no one can \nseriously dispute the fact that the Glenn-Chafee substitute is a strong \nregulatory reform bill. Again, it passed the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee with statements of just how strong it was just a few months \nago by a unanimous bipartisan vote.\n  How does that compare to Dole-Johnston? Dole-Johnston would impose \nnew and sometimes conflicting decisional criteria, essentially \ndisplacing standards in existing laws by forbidding issuance of any \nrule unless the criteria are met. This is one of the most troubling \nfeatures of the proposal. And one of my concerns about Dole-Johnston is \nthat it would so encumber agencies that it would swamp the regulatory \nprocess rather than reform it, making it a greater burden rather than a \nlesser one.\n  No one can disagree--I do not think anyone is arguing against this--\nthat we should only have rules where the benefits justify the cost. The \nGlenn-Chafee substitute has that standard. It requires every agency to \ncertify that the benefits justify the costs, and if it cannot so \ncertify, to explain why.\n  The way that the Glenn-Chafee bill works is that since all major \nrules are presented to Congress 45 days before they take effect, if \nthere is a rule which the agency head says is appropriate for whatever \nreasons but that the benefits do not justify the cost, we in Congress \nwill then have an opportunity to decide whether or not such a \nregulation whose benefits do not justify its costs should take effect. \nThere will be times where we will decide it should, for whatever \nreason. It may be that the underlying law requires it. But where an \nagency head, as part of the cost-benefit analysis, tells us that the \nbenefits do not justify the cost, we then are in the position to decide \nwhether or not it is still our intention that the rule go into effect. \nThat is the real power of the legislative review process.\n  An agency may also not be able to certify that the benefits justify \nthe cost because the underlying statute may have required that the \nagency regulate without regard to the cost effect.\n  Congress may have decided that an agency should issue a rule \nestablishing the safe level of a toxic element in the air and that we \nwant that level achieved regardless of what the cost implications might \nbe. So assessing the cost and the benefits may simply not be an option \nfor that agency. Well, we want the agency to tell us that so that we, \nelected officials, accountable to the people, can decide: Do we really \nwant to impose a rule that has costs which cannot be justified by the \nbenefits? We may pass laws that say that, but when it comes to the \nrulemaking, we should have an opportunity and be forced to consider the \nactual costs that we are imposing on this society. We have that in the \nGlenn-Chafee substitute.\n  Now, the Dole-Johnston substitute has a different approach. It says \nspecifically that an agency cannot regulate unless it finds that the \nbenefits justify the costs, or if the rule cannot satisfy that \ncriteria, the rule must meet three other tests including that it adopts \nthe least cost alternative and that it results in a significant \nreduction in risk.\n  Last week, we adopted an amendment that reaffirmed what the sponsors \nof the bill had been saying in this Chamber, that the decisional \ncriteria of their bill do not override any existing statute--and that \nwas an important issue to clarify--that where there is a conflict \nbetween an underlying health, safety or environmental law and the \ndecisional criteria of Dole-Johnston, it is intended that the \nunderlying statute govern. But the problem is that probably in most \ncases there will not be a direct conflict. And in those cases the Dole-\nJohnston decisional criteria could be interpreted as governing. So now \nlet us look at the criteria.\n  Least cost of the Dole-Johnston decisional criteria would require \nthat an agency pick the least cost alternative in choosing how to \nregulate. Now, on the surface that may sound right, going with the \nleast expensive, but once the surface is scratched, this approach not \nonly fails the commonsense test, it is inconsistent with the cost-\nbenefit test.\n  Why would we want to restrict Federal agencies to picking the \ncheapest way to regulate when in many cases it will not be the best way \nto regulate and will not be the most cost effective way to regulate? \nWhy would we want to deny agencies from getting the biggest bang for \nthe buck out of the regulatory scheme? If going with the cheapest were \nalways the best approach, we would all be driving Yugos.\n  Now, if, for $100 million in costs, we can save 1,000 lives, but for \n$110 million in costs, we can save 2,000 lives, ought we not be able to \ngo with the slightly more expensive approach for double the savings in \nlives even though the lower cost-smaller savings in lives approach \nmight meet the minimal statutory criteria?\n  Statutes usually have a range. They usually describe things in terms \nof minimal safety and allow discretion for the agency. Do we want to \ntell an agency that you cannot spend that extra 10 percent to double \nthe savings in lives? Is that really what we want to do? Then why do \nthe cost-benefit analysis? There is an inconsistency.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield for a question. But before I do \nyield, let me say this. I am going to get to the issue which the \nSenator and I have discussed over the last few days, which is whether \nor not there is an exception then to the least-cost approach. I am \ngoing to address that issue immediately and then perhaps he could ask a \nquestion after I address the exception which the Senator from Louisiana \nhas pointed to as to why we are not driven always to least cost. I know \nthat is the Senator's position. However, the language is quite clear. \nAnd I will be addressing what he calls an exception to show that it is \nnot an exception. But I would be happy to get into that issue.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Is the Senator seriously saying that if you can save, \nwhat \n\n[[Page S 10193]]\nwas it, 10,000 lives for $1 million, that for an extra $100,000 you \ncould not save another 1,000 lives--is the Senator really saying that \nhe believes that about our bill?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I do, because that is clearly quantifiable. I just \nquantified it. And that is the way the agencies read the Dole-Johnston \nbill, and that is why the agencies have written a statement, and that \nis why the bill should be amended, and that is why we have discussed an \namendment, one of a number of amendments to the Senator's bill. Since I \nhave just quantified it, it is not eligible for the exception. The \nexception only applies where it is not quantifiable, and I have just \ngiven a quantified exception.\n  I have just said for $100 million you can save 1,000 lives, but for \n$110 million you can save 2,000 lives. Now, the Senator is going to say \nand has said, well, that is nonquantifiable and therefore it is subject \nto this exception, to the least cost approach because the value of a \nlife cannot be quantified.\n  First of all, agencies do quantify it, but, second, in my \nhypothetical I have quantified it precisely and that is the way the \nagencies read this language. So we can sit here all day and debate as \nto whether or not, when you have 1,000 lives as a quantified benefit, \nthat is quantified or nonquantified since for many of us the value of a \nlife cannot be quantified.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. But the agencies read it this way, and I think it should \nbe clarified.\n  I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator say that the benefit is the same \nbenefit if 100,000 lives are saved or if 200,000 lives are saved?\n  Mr. LEVIN. No.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. It is a different benefit.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would say a different benefit, both quantified but they \nare different.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Both quantified. And the cheapest 200,000 lives would \nbe a separate calculation.\n  It seems to me, if those are different benefits, the agency would not \nbe required then to employ the so-called cheapest but could employ, it \ncould employ the benefit for the greater savings because it is a \ndifferent benefit and the calculation would be the cheapest for that \ndifferent benefit.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would think the agency should be able to do it, but \nunder this language the only exception, certain exception to the \nrequirement is to take the least costly approach. And you can only do \nit where it is a nonquantifiable benefit, and I think the Senator would \nagree with me this is a quantifiable benefit.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. That is right. But since it is a different benefit, it \nis a different calculation. It seems to me that if the benefit is \ndifferent, that if the extra lives mean it is a different benefit----\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is the same rule.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. It is the same rule. But if it is a different benefit, \nthen it is a different cost-benefit ratio and the cheapest for the \ndifferent benefit is the superior one for which the Senator has argued.\n  Mr. LEVIN. You would think that the agency in applying that rule \nought to be able to spend the extra 10 percent to double the number of \nlives.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. My view is and my question was----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I would agree that for a nickel more you can go first \nclass is the old way of saying that, and if first class means that you \nget more lives saved per value committed, I think we would want to be \nable to do that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think so, too.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. My sense is that if it is a different benefit----\n  Mr. LEVIN. The number is different. If the Senator says a different \nbenefit, the number is different. It is twice as large.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. That is correct. And it seems to me that means this \nbill should be driving that--that if the number is different, it is a \ndifferent benefit, and we should get to that number the cheapest way \npossible. In getting to any other number, the cheapest way possible \nshould be our objective. If we decide to save 120,000 lives, there is a \ncheapest way to get there. And if we want to save 100,000 lives, there \nis a cheapest way to get there. And it seems to me, since those are \ndifferent benefits, the Dole-Johnston proposal would allow us to get to \nthose benefits by the cheapest strategy.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think I would agree with the Senator that we ought to \ntry to have a cost-benefit in what we do. The problem is that when we \nlegislate, we do not say save 1,000 lives or we do not say save 2,000 \nlives. What we say is that the agency should regulate emission of a \ncertain element going into the air in order to achieve a safe level. \nAnd then we give to the agencies typically, because we do not know here \nprecisely what that safe level is frequently, some discretion. And then \nthe agency is told to do a cost-benefit analysis.\n  That is our requirement in this bill, to do a cost-benefit analysis. \nNow the agency says--and this is my hypothetical--the agency cost-\nbenefit analysis says, for 100 million bucks, you are going to save \n1,000 lives. If you want to spend $110 million, you are going to save \n2,000 lives.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. You are doing something else; you are doing something \ndifferent.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, that is what the cost-benefit \nanalysis describes to the agency doing that analysis. The point is, \nwill you allow the agency, using that cost-benefit analysis, to go to \nthe $110 million instead of $100 million, even though the $100 million \nmay meet the minimum threshold, since there is a range allowed by \ndefinition, or else you would not be doing the cost-benefit analysis? \nYou would not need to. It would not be as relevant as it otherwise \nshould be. You are doing a cost-benefit analysis most of the time \nbecause a range is permitted, and if a range is permitted under the \nstatute, the question is then, will you allow the agency discretion to \nimplement something more expensive than the least costly, if you can, \nfor a small incremental amount to significantly increase the benefit?\n  I think the intention of the sponsors is to allow the agency to do \nso. However, we have pointed out over and over again that the language \nof the bill does not permit the agency to do it, because it says that \nunless the benefit is nonquantifiable--nonquantifiable--you cannot go \nto anything but the least costly.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. LEVIN. So we have urged the sponsors to strike the word \n``nonquantifiable'' before ``benefit.'' When the word ``benefit'' is \ndefined earlier in the statute, it says ``quantifiable or \nnonquantifiable.'' But in this exception to the requirement for least \ncost, the limitation of nonquantifiable is before the word ``benefit.'' \nIn my hypothetical, I have given a quantifiable benefit, 1,000 versus \n2,000 and $100 million versus $110 million. Then the agencies read this \nand I read this as being a quantifiable benefit, thereby not subject to \nthe exception.\n  The Senator from Louisiana has argued that that is a nonquantifiable \nbenefit because you cannot quantify the value of a human life. Even if \nthat were conceded, the problem is that the benefit that we are \nquantifying here is the number of human lives, and agencies read that \nas a quantifiable benefit. I happen to think the intention of the \nsponsors is that you are or should be allowed to go to something more \nexpensive than the least costly. That is what they keep telling us. But \nthe language remains restricted in that way, and that is what I am \naddressing.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If we struck that word ``nonquantifiable,'' I take it, \nit would solve the Senator's problem?\n  Mr. LEVIN. It would solve that particular problem in the criteria. \nThat is one of three problems, and it would solve that problem.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If the Senator will yield the floor, I am prepared to \noffer such an amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am not prepared to yield the floor. I will yield in \nabout 10 minutes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. All right. I have an amendment prepared to that effect.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would like to finish my statement, and then I will be \nhappy to yield. I want to commend the Senator \n\n[[Page S 10194]]\nfor that change which has been the subject of about a day's debate \nhere.\n  There is another criterion, so-called decisional criterion, in Dole-\nJohnston which is that the regulation must result in a significant \nreduction in risk. That is another hurdle that the agency has to go \nthrough before an agency is allowed to regulate. This one does not make \nsense either.\n  What if an agency can reduce the risk for very little money but \ncannot prove that it is a significant reduction in the risk? Should an \nagency be able to regulate if there is a reduction in the risk to our \nsafety or our food or the environment which may be not a significant \nreduction but is a reduction and is worth doing on a cost-benefit basis \nbecause the cost is so slight that even though the benefit is not \nmajor, nonetheless it is justified?\n  Dole-Johnston would establish a whole new standard and would require \nthe agencies to show that the reduction in risk is significant, even \nthough the cost might be minimal.\n  The Department of Transportation has informed us that if they had to \nmeet this test when regulating for shoulder belts or for lap belts for \nthe back seat, that they may not have been able to have met that test. \nThe shoulder belt lessens the risk by 10 percent over the reduction in \nthe risk for the lap belt, and they are not confident that would meet \nthe test for significant. But the cost may be so nominal that they may \ndecide it is worth doing anyway, although the benefit is not a major \nbenefit.\n  So there is another problem with the decisional criteria which can be \naddressed by striking that word so that the cost-benefit analysis will \nbe driving this, even if the benefit is modest, where the cost is far \nmore modest.\n  Another problem with Dole-Johnston is that each of the decisional \ncriteria that they set forth--and we have discussed two of them here--\nestablishes another basis for legal challenge. Each of these criteria \nforms the basis for judicial review and judicial second-guessing of the \nagency's rulemaking decision.\n  For instance, if the agency decides benefits justify the cost, did \nthe agency pick a rule that provides for market-based and performance-\nbased standards? Did the agency pick a rule that was least costly? Were \nthere any other alternatives slightly less costly? Does the rule \nprovide for significant reduction in risk? What is significant? Was the \nagency right in valuing the risk reduction as significant?\n  The litigation that is possible with these decisional criteria is \nalmost endless. The whole judicial review problem with Dole-Johnston is \nanother major issue of concern, and we have spent some time discussing \nthis with the sponsors, both on and off the floor.\n  We believe, based on what agencies tell us, that courts would be \nasked to interpret over 100 different issues. One massive golden \nopportunity for litigation is the requirement in the bill that an \nagency consider and do a cost-benefit analysis on every reasonable \nalternative presented to them. This is not limited to a significant \nnumber of reasonable alternatives. The agency is required to respond \nand do a cost-benefit analysis for every reasonable alternative for \nregulation, and this is all subject to judicial review.\n  What does that mean? Say an agency is issuing a rule to establish a \nhealth or safety standard for a toxic substance in drinking water. They \nare looking at--I am making up a substance, a number here--the agency \nis looking in the range of 12 parts per billion of a certain substance. \nWhat happens if somebody suggests 11\\1/2\\ parts per billion; someone \nelse suggests 12\\1/2\\ parts per billion; someone else suggests 11 parts \nper billion; someone else 13 parts per billion? Each of these, let us \nassume, the agency considers to be a reasonable alternative. Under \nDole-Johnston, that requires the agency to consider and do a cost-\nbenefit analysis on each of these possibilities. That analysis would \nthen be subject to judicial review to see why the agency did not pick \none of those other reasonable alternatives. It is endless.\n  Another aspect, a judicial review problem of Dole-Johnston is the \nfact that the bill allows for interlocutory appeals of an agency's \ndetermination as to whether or not a rule is major, whether or not it \nshould be subject to a risk assessment, whether or not it should be \nsubject to a regulatory flexibility analysis.\n  This is unprecedented in 50 years of the Administrative Procedure \nAct. We have not had interlocutory appeals under the Administrative \nProcedure Act. This is the opportunity to go to the court and have \njudicial review of an agency action before the action is taken, before \nit is finalized.\n  In this case, that means that after an agency has issued a notice of \nproposed rulemaking, a party--it is not clear what level of standing \nwould be required by a party in order to bring an interlocutory \nappeal--but a party to the notice of rulemaking may take the agency to \ncourt within 60 days to challenge the agency's preliminary decision \nthat a rule is not major, does not need a risk assessment, does not \nneed a regulatory flexibility analysis.\n  When a rulemaking is at its early stages, the public is expected to \nmake comments to the agency about the impact of the rule. It may be \nthat during the rulemaking process, the agency is presented with new \nand sufficient evidence for the agency to decide that indeed the rule \nis a major rule, or is one that does require a risk assessment, or one \nthat does require regulatory flexibility analysis. But with the \ninterlocutory appeal, if a party did not challenge the agency at the \nbeginning of a rulemaking, it is foreclosed from raising a challenge at \nthe end of the rulemaking, regardless of what is learned during the \nactual rulemaking process. And that is why, when we were considering \nthe Nunn-Coverdell amendment, I noticed that I thought this was going \nto hurt small businesses and small governments because they are going \nto lose the opportunity of learning about the impact of a rule from \nrulemaking so that they can challenge those critical issues after the \nfinal rule is adopted.\n  They are given an opportunity to challenge it early when there is a \npreliminary notice, but unless they take that interlocutory approach, \nthey are then foreclosed from appealing at the end of the process, \nafter they know the facts upon which they can make the appeal. We are \nnot doing a favor to small businesses when we are doing that.\n  On the other hand, if we allow them both at the beginning and the \nend, then you are going to have excessive litigation and two bites at \nthe apple. So the alternative that the Administrative Procedure Act \nused all these years is to say you can appeal these decisions at the \nend of the rulemaking process. But what this bill does for the first \ntime is creates this interlocutory appeal early in the rulemaking \nprocess, thinking we are doing a favor for small businesses and small \ngovernments and, in fact, we are not doing so at all.\n  Now, another consideration is the strong concern by the Justice \nDepartment that the court will entertain requests by a party bringing \nan interlocutory appeal to suspend the rulemaking during the court's \nconsideration of the appeal. That is a logical request; we are making \nan interlocutory appeal early in the rulemaking and suspending the \nrulemaking pending the appeal. Although it is not expressly permitted \nby the legislation, it is not expressly prohibited either. Should the \ncourts begin granting these delays, months, and perhaps years, would be \nadded to the rulemaking process.\n  The Glenn-Chafee substitute permits judicial review of an agency's \ndetermination as to whether or not a rule is major, but that occurs \nafter the final rule is issued. The knowledge that a rule can be \nchallenged at the end on that basis will make an agency proceed with \nits determination very carefully. It is an important deterrent, knowing \nthat its decision on that issue and a number of other issues are \nsubject to appeal at the end of the process.\n  Another problem with the judicial review in the Dole-Johnston \nsubstitute is the change that it makes to section 706 of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act. That is another big difference in these \ntwo pieces of legislation. The Dole-Johnston bill not only establishes \nrequirements for cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment, and for major \nrulemaking, but it also rewrites the Administrative Procedure Act, \nwhich applies to all rulemaking, and, in doing so, rewrites almost 50 \nyears of case law. \n\n[[Page S 10195]]\n\n  With respect to judicial review, the Dole-Johnston substitute adds a \nnew standard for judicial review of an agency's rulemaking. For 50 \nyears, the standard has been arbitrary and capricious for informal \nrulemaking and substantial evidence for formal rulemaking. The Dole-\nJohnston substitute adds a third--substantial support in the rulemaking \nfile for the factual basis of an informal rulemaking.\n  Now, I do not know the difference between substantial support and \nsubstantial evidence. But I do know it will be a greatly litigated \nissue. It may make great business for the legal community, but \notherwise, it is going to be doing nothing but producing mischief.\n  I have been advised that some judges have stated there is very little \ndifference between the substantial evidence and the arbitrary and \ncapricious test. Other courts have articulated a difference, concluding \nthat the arbitrary and capricious test is more deferential to agency \ndecisionmaking.\n  Now, the Dole-Johnston substitute would add a whole new test, and \nbriefs will be filed and cases developed, splitting the hairs between \nsubstantial support and substantial evidence. Of course, the difference \nbetween both is arbitrary and capricious. We should not do it. There is \nno reason given here to do it. We are adding a new test without any \nclarity. It is the difference between that test and the one currently \napplied in the Administrative Procedure Act. We are not doing anybody \nwho has to live in that regulatory process a favor by doing that.\n  Now, another serious problem with the Dole-Johnston substitute is the \nprovision on how existing rules are to be reviewed, or lookback, as \nmany of us call it. Now, lookback is important. It is important because \nwe want rules that have been in existence for years and which have gone \nunchallenged, but which may be causing serious problems, to be reviewed \nunder the new standards and the requirements of regulatory reform. But \nhow we do that is very important.\n  The Dole-Johnston substitute establishes a process by which, every 5 \nyears, each agency reissues a schedule for the review of rules. A rule, \nonce put on the schedule, is to be reviewed within 10 years. However, \nDole-Johnston permits a private party to petition to have a major rule \nadded to the schedule for review, and if it is, then that major rule \nmust be reviewed within 3 years. The 10-year review cycle for these \nadded rules is telescoped to within the next 3 years.\n  S. 343, as originally introduced, was severely criticized because, \nthrough the use of multiple petitions--that is, request the agencies to \ntake certain actions--outside parties would be able to control the \npriorities of a Federal agency and divert and direct Federal resources. \nWhile an attempt has been made to address that problem, it still \nremains.\n  By allowing persons to petition to get major rules added to the \nschedule and then reviewed within 3 years, we are right back where we \nwere when the original S. 343 was introduced, by having agency \npriorities dictated by outside parties. Moreover, the bill allows an \noutside party to petition to place a major rule on the schedule of \nrules to be reviewed, even if the agency is already included in the \nschedule. So even though the agency has included a rule on the schedule \nto be reviewed, an outside party could petition the agency to include \nit on the schedule to be reviewed. Why? Because that way it gets an \nearlier review. The agency may have said we are going to review it in \nthe fourth, fifth, or seventh year, and a party not satisfied with \nthat, even though the rule it is worried about is already on the \npetition, is nonetheless going to ask that it be put it on the schedule \nanyway, because when it wins--and it will win because, by definition, \nthe agency would concur with it--this time the party will get its rule \nreviewed within 3 years.\n  Now, what that means is hundreds of people in each agency, having an \ninterest in rules, every 5 years is going to be jockeying for where on \na schedule of review its rule is going to be, and that is judicially \nreviewable.\n  Now, mind you, it can take up to 10 years to review the rules on that \nschedule. But every 5 years every agency--many of them with hundreds of \nrules and thousands of petitioners--is going to have to adopt a \nschedule, and the schedule is judicially reviewable. It probably would \ntake 5 years just to review the petition and the judicial appeals of \npeople jockeying for support for where on a schedule their rule is \ngoing to be reviewed.\n  Finally, we get through all the appeals, if the courts can figure all \nthis out. Hundreds of petitioners, hundreds of rules, each agency, the \n5 years comes and what happens? Presumably, you would think the agency \nwould have 10 years in which to find and implement the schedule. No, \nevery 5 years they have to issue a new schedule. Right in the middle of \na 10-year review period they have to issue a new schedule which is \nsubject to judicial review.\n  This is a prescription for regulatory hash. This is going to be \nnothing but a litigious mess with this kind of a system.\n  We are not doing people a favor who are now bedeviled by a regulatory \nprocess, who are now wasting a fortune in complying with rules that we \nshould not have adopted; that now we are in court all the time \nchallenging agencies, by adopting a system which says that we will \nreview rules, where on the schedule they go. It is all subject to \nlitigation. Anybody can challenge it. If it is not on the schedule, \nthat is subject to litigation.\n  Every agency has its own schedule. There could be hundreds of rules \nthat an agency is implementing. That is not an unusual number. There \ncould be thousands of people who are interested in those rules who \nwould have standing to challenge that schedule.\n  Finally, if you can get through that, if you can get through that \nwhole bunch of roadblocks and hurdles, when you are ready to start to \nimplement the schedule, a new 5-year trigger begins. You have to start \nall over again.\n  This is one of the reasons why we say that this approach is too \ncumbersome and that we will swamp the regulatory process instead of \nsimplify it, and instead of eliminating the pieces of it which are \ndriving folks nuts.\n  There is broad agreement in this body that we have overregulated, \nthat too often we have imposed costs without adequate benefits, that we \nought to require cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment, that we \nought to look back at existing rules. I do not think there are two \nMembers of this body that do not agree with those principles.\n  The problem is whether or not we can implement this in a way which \nwill allow agencies to breathe, so they can carry on their functions of \npreserving the health, safety and welfare of this Nation, where we want \nthem to do it. Can we strip away from them the excess, without dumping \non them such impossible tasks that we are going to tangle up the \nprocess so that nothing can get done, and benefit nobody.\n  We have businesses that want these rules to be reviewed. I think most \nMembers in this body want to review existing rules according to new \nstandards, but we have to do it in a way that works; otherwise we can \nvote aye and think we are doing something good for our society, and end \nup creating a monster.\n  Every denial of a petition to be on the schedule is subject to \njudicial review. Then we have 60 days after publication of a final \nschedule to sue, to have the court review the appropriateness of the \nschedules as a whole, or the denial of an individual petition to place \na major rule on the schedule.\n  All of these cases, in all of these agencies, are supposed to be \nheard in a circuit court of appeals for the District of Columbia, and \nthey all have to be filed in the same timeframe. The court of appeals \nwill have to review all these schedules and all these petition denials \nin about the same time.\n  Now, additionally, Mr. President--and I am almost done--there are \nserious problems with the multiple petitions that are permitted by this \nlegislation. The Dole-Johnston bill adds several new things that you \ncan ask an agency to do within a certain time period and have a denial \nsubject to judicial review. Current law allows petitions to an agency \nat any time for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule. That is \nunder current law.\n  So if you ask an agency to issue a rule, amend a rule or repeal a \nrule, you can file a petition, but there is no deadline in current law \nby which an agency has to respond. If an agency does not respond to \nthat request, a petitioner \n\n[[Page S 10196]]\ncan go to court and force the agency to respond to the petition, if the \nagency fails to do so.\n  Now, that is current law. So there is an opportunity to go to court \nin that narrow area where an agency fails to respond to a petition for \nthe issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule.\n  The Dole-Johnston substitute expands current law on petitions by \nadding to the Administrative Procedure Act two additional purposes for \nwhich an interested person can petition an agency. You can ask for the \namendment or repeal of an interpretive rule, or the amendment or repeal \nof a general statement of policy or guidance. You can ask for the \ninterpretation regarding the meaning of a rule or the meaning of an \ninterpretive rule or general statement of policy or guidance.\n  Whereas, under current law if you ask for the issuance, amendment, or \nrepeal of a rule, and the failure to respond is subject to a court \nintervention, under the Dole-Johnston substitute, if you ask an agency \nto amend or repeal or interpret an interpretive rule, general statement \nof policy or guidance, that also, now, becomes subject to judicial \nreview.\n  Agencies do a lot more than issue rules. They issue guidance all the \ntime, interpretations all the time, statements of policy all the time, \nprobably by the thousands, in order to help people understand and work \nthrough a complicated regulatory system.\n  Under Dole-Johnston all of that--I do not know and no one knows how \nmany thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of requests \nthere are for interpretation and guidance that are filed with these \nagencies each year; we do not know--will now be subject to deadlines \nand to judicial review. That is the block that we are superimposing on \nthis regulatory process.\n  The agency can either deny or grant those requests for all of that \nmaterial within 18 months. Judicial review is immediate upon a denial. \nThis, again, is going to dramatically change an agency's control over \nits priorities and its resources. Agencies can just simply be \noverwhelmed--and I emphasize, this is new. The ability to submit a \nrequest is not new. They have been asked for a decade. What is new is \nthat now all these requests for guidance and interpretation are now \ngoing to be subject to deadlines and court review. That is what is new, \nmassively new, overwhelmingly new.\n  We should be trying to downsize Government, not swamp it. We should \nnot let the agencies become total victims of random and multiple tugs \nand pulls from either individuals or interests that have special axes \nto grind.\n  Agencies also have a national purpose to be achieved. They have not \ndone an adequate job of responding to individuals. Everyone in our \noffice spends too much time trying to force agencies to respond to our \nconstituents--sometimes just to respond, much less to respond fairly or \nin an appropriate way.\n  They have to do a much better job. This will overwhelm an agency by \nproviding court appeals, following deadlines, even where there is a \nresponse, because the response is subject to judicial review.\n  Now, there are two additional opportunities, in addition to what I \nhave just said, that Dole-Johnston makes available to people who are \nmaking requests of rulemaking agencies.\n  Any interested person can petition an agency under Dole-Johnston to \nreview a risk assessment, other than a risk assessment that is used for \na major rule. The agency must act within 180 days under that petition \nand the agency denial of the petition would be judicially reviewable as \na final agency action.\n  Also, any person subject to a major rule can petition an agency to \nmodify or waive specific requirements of the major rule and authorize \nsuch person to demonstrate compliance through alternative means not \notherwise permitted by the major rule. The agency must act on that \npetition within 180 days.\n  Now, while there appears to be no judicial review of any agency \naction with respect to this latter petition process, nonetheless, given \nthe number of people who are subject to major rules, an agency could be \nflooded with petitions for alternative means of compliance, each of \nwhich would have to be responded to within 180 days.\n  A big part of the legislation which all of us are working on, and \nsome of us are struggling with, is to get agencies to prioritize their \nregulatory activity so that we are putting Government resources on the \nmost important risks, the most important dangers, and not spending \nexcessive time and effort with less significant matters. Opening each \nand every agency to their responsibility to not only respond but to \ndefend against hundreds, probably thousands of new kinds of petitions \nfor specific regulatory actions, takes us in the opposite direction. \nThe Dole-Johnston substitute tries to address it by providing for a \nconsolidation of some of the petitions that are permitted in the bill, \nand for the judicial review of those petitions. But that is only for \npetitions relating to major rules. Petitions related to nonmajor rules \nare treated the same as the original Dole bill and can be made at any \ntime and as often as people like.\n  Dole-Johnston provides a procedure for the review of existing rules. \nEach agency would be required to issue a proposed schedule for the \nreview of rules which can contain major and nonmajor rules. Those \nschedules would be subject to public notice and comment. Private \npersons can also petition an agency to add a major rule to the \nschedule. A petitioner has to show that the rule is major and that \nthere is a substantial likelihood that it does not meet the decisional \ncriteria in the bill. All the petitions must be filed within a limited \ntime period while the schedule for the review of rules is being \nconsidered. The schedule is issued every 5 years, and rules on the \nschedule are to be reviewed within 10 years, as we have said, with the \npossibility of a couple of years' extension.\n  However, if a petitioner is successful, the Dole-Johnston substitute \nprovides that the review of the petitioned rule gets bumped up to the \nfirst 3 years of the 10-year period. So any rule that is added to the \nschedule by petition must be reviewed, not within 10 years, but within \n3 years. And, if it succeeds, it then bumps a rule that was already \nwithin that 3-year period, presumably, since there are a finite number \nof rules that can be reviewed within a 3-year period.\n  So you are going to have all the jockeying and all the petitions \nfiled in the court in order to try to get a position on the schedule \nwhich is high up. And if one fails, then there is a petition to get on \nthe schedule so that you can get a higher position. Once the final \nschedule for each agency is published, again, parties will have 60 days \nto file suit and suit can be brought to challenge the denial of being \non the schedule. Or even in the event that you are on the schedule, \nagain, you can bring a suit in order to improve your position.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying this. The Dole-Johnston \nsubstitute simply goes too far. In its effort to reform it will swamp \nthe very process that it sets out to repair. It is not reform, it is \nbureaucratic overload. It is like throwing a bucket of water to a \ndrowning person instead of a rope. The Glenn-Chafee proposal, that we \nwill be considering later on today and voting on, embodies the bill \npassed by the Governmental Affairs Committee. It is reform, it is not \noverload. We simply must do two things and can do two things. We can \nhave reform of the regulatory process, but we can do it in a way that \ndoes not jeopardize important health, safety, and environmental \nprotections which have improved our lives in America.\n  We want to be able to trust the water we drink and the food that we \neat and the air that we breathe and the planes that we fly and the \nbridges that we cross. And we can have that. We can avoid regulatory \nexcess. And the way to do that is to adopt the Glenn-Chafee substitute.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. INHOFE). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering with Senator \nGlenn and many of our other colleagues is a solid proposal for \nregulatory reform. The purpose of regulatory reform legislation is to \nimprove the quality of the regulations that are issued by the Federal \nagencies. That is what we are trying for. What we want to do is to weed \nout the bad rules, the rules that do not make sense. We want \n\n[[Page S 10197]]\nthe science and the economics used to design rules to be of the best \nquality. And we want rules with flexibility built in, to make the \ncompliance burden as small as possible.\n  I believe the Glenn-Chafee substitute accomplishes many reforms. Let \nus tick a few off. It requires a cost-benefit analysis for every major \nrule. It requires agencies to select the most cost effective option \nthat achieves the goals establish by the law. It requires agencies to \nselect regulatory options that provide the greatest flexibility for \ncompliance and recognize the compliance difficulties faced by small \nbusinesses and towns, small towns. It requires rules with costs that \nare greater than the benefits to be identified before they are \npromulgated. It requires OMB to review the cost-benefit studies in an \nopen process that gives access to all those with an interest. It \nestablishes expedited procedures for Congress to review major rules \nbefore they become effective, so that poorly drawn rules with \nunjustified costs can be stopped. That is the 60-day review process \nthat we have. It includes clear principles for risk assessment. It \nrequires each agency to establish a peer review process, ensuring that \nthe science used to make important determinations is the best \navailable. It requires agencies to develop an agenda to review existing \nrules and to repeal rules that are no longer needed or that cost too \nmuch.\n  It gives courts authority to enforce the review requirements of the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act, ensuring that rules affecting small \nbusinesses and small towns recognize their compliance problems. And it \nrequires agencies to reexamine budgetary and enforcement priorities and \nto modify programs to maximize the reduction in risks to health and to \nthe environment.\n  OK, it does all of those things. These are important steps that will \nimprove the quality and reduce the compliance burden of Federal \nregulations. Some people have said, ``Oh, the Glenn-Chafee bill is just \nstatus quo. It just repeats what we have now.'' That is absolutely not \nso, as he have delineated in the prior points. Now, these are important \nsteps that will improve the quality and reduce the compliance burden of \nFederal regulations. I am confident that these steps can be taken \nwithout undermining our environmental or health laws.\n  But there are several other things, so-called reforms, that this bill \ndoes not have. And they are not reforms at all, they are steps \nbackward.\n  It does not include extensive special interest petitions to force \nendless rounds of review for every new and existing rule, risk \nassessment, and enforcement action taken by an agency. That is what \nSenator Levin was talking about.\n  It does not direct agencies to pick the least costly action a statute \nallows. Under the least cost approach an agency can not go for a \nslightly more expensive approach that will produce many more benefits. \nYou are locked in at the lowest cost, and that is not good.\n  It does not allow Federal judges to second-guess the complex data, \nassumptions, and calculations that are developed through risk \nassessment to support a rule. The judges cannot go fishing back into \nall of that.\n  It does not automatically sunset existing rules because an agency did \nnot have the resources to carry out a review ordered by a court.\n  It does not waste millions and millions of taxpayers' dollars on \nstudies and assessments and lawsuits for minor rules.\n  And it does not delay for months, even years, needed and justifiable \nrules to protect health and safety and the environment while endless \nrounds of review are conducted to ensure that rules meet a standard of \nnear perfection.\n  Senator Glenn has many times suggested a two-part test for the Senate \nto use in comparing these two bills. I recommend to my colleagues that \nthey pay attention to these two points.\n  First, would the bill produce better rules, rules that are more cost \neffective and have a foundation in good science and economics?\n  Second, does the bill threaten to undermine the health, safety and \nenvironmental protection that has been achieved by the laws we have \nenacted over the past 25 years?\n  We want reform without a rollback. That is the test.\n  The Glenn-Chafee amendment passes that test. It incorporates all the \nsignificant reforms that the Senate adopted in 1982 when we considered, \non this floor, S. 1080. That was a splendid piece of legislation. It \nwas acclaimed by all as a thoroughgoing reform. In addition to the \nprovisions of cost-benefit analysis and congressional veto that were \nincluded in S. 1080, the Glenn-Chafee amendment has new principles for \nrisk assessment, an agenda to review existing regulations and steps to \nrealign priorities based on risk. It goes well beyond S. 1080.\n  S. 1080 was adopted on the floor of this Senate 93 to nothing. I \nsuspect the distinguished senior Senator from Louisiana voted for it. \nHe certainly did not vote against it. Maybe he was not present, but he \nhas a good attendance record so I suspect he voted for that bill. It \nwas good enough in 1982.\n  The Glenn-Chafee amendment would catch poorly drawn or costly rules. \nCost-benefit analysis is required of major rules. Courts can enforce \nthis requirement. OMB is to oversee the preparation of these cost-\nbenefit studies. The information on the costs and benefits of each rule \nwill be sent to Congress, lay over there for 60 days before a rule \nbecomes effective. Congress can veto the rule.\n  From the debate on this issue it appears that Congress may well \nreceive between 500 and 1,000 rules every year under this congressional \nreview process. If even a small minority of the Members of this body \nwant reconsideration of a particular rule, it will be easy enough to \nensure that a vote on the resolution occurs.\n  Now, I am currently serving as chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, and I have some concern about the workload that this \nso-called reform will create, having coming before us between 500 and \n1,000 rules every year. But this is real reform. I expect we will be \nvoting on many resolutions and many times will force agencies to \nreconsider their rules. If a bad rule gets through, we will have no one \nto blame but ourselves here in Congress; we let it happen. We can stop \nbad rules under the reform provisions that are contained in the Glenn-\nChafee amendment. Once Congress has this veto mechanism in place, \njudicial review will become less important as a method to weed out bad \nrules. Courts will be reluctant to overturn a rule that has been issued \nby the executive branch and cleared in an expedited fashion in \nCongress.\n  The Glenn-Chafee amendment will bring significant changes to the \nregulatory process.\n  I do not think the underlying Johnston substitute passes the two-part \ntest that Senator Glenn has outlined. I am concerned that it may \nprevent timely action to protect human health and safety and the \nenvironment. I know that is not what the authors intended, but I \nbelieve it will have this result.\n  The reforms are so far-reaching they could paralyze the Federal \nagencies. That is what Senator Levin has been talking about. It is very \ndifficult to issue a significant rule to protect human health or the \nenvironment even under the procedures in place today. With the new \nhurdles erected by the substitute, S. 343, it could well become \nimpossible to get a rule enacted.\n  Now, Mr. President, last week the senior Senator from Illinois \ndescribed the experience his State had with cost-benefit analysis. \nIllinois passed a law in 1978 with cost-benefit provisions similar to \nthose in this Johnston substitute. The Illinois law did not work. It \nwas repealed. Everybody in Illinois that had any experience with their \ncost-benefit law will tell you it just plain does not work.\n  You do not have to go to Illinois to learn about the experience with \ncost-benefit analysis. We had that experience here with the Federal \nlaw. We have one environmental law, the Toxic Substances Control Act. \nThis is called TSCA. That contains many of the same procedures that are \nset forth in the underlying substitute.\n  So we have been down this road before. Now, Yogi Berra said you can \nsee a lot by looking, and you can see a lot by looking. We can learn a \nlot from this so-called TSCA experience. The lawyers who wrote this \nbill that is before us now, the Johnston substitute, must have used \nthis TSCA experience and the TSCA law as a model. TSCA is \n\n[[Page S 10198]]\na cost-benefit statute. To issue a rule under TSCA, EPA must determine \nthat the benefits of the rule justify the costs.\n  Under TSCA, EPA is required to impose the least burdensome \nregulation, just like the Johnston bill does. TSCA requires that all of \nthe available regulatory options be considered to determine which is \nthe least burdensome.\n  Now, this is an important illustration, Mr. President. We have been \ndown this road before. We have something actually before us that is \nnearly exactly the same as the Johnston substitute, the so-called Toxic \nSubstances Control Act. How did it work?\n  EPA, under this TSCA bill, is required to produce substantial \nevidence in the record to support its rulemaking determination. That is \nwhat the Johnston substitute requires.\n  Now, when it was enacted in 1976, many in Congress claimed that TSCA \nwould become the most powerful of all the environmental statutes. It \nappears to authorize EPA to regulate virtually any chemical in \ncommerce, for any adverse effect, in any environmental medium, in \nproducts and in the workplace. TSCA was to be the law that integrated \nall our environmental goals under one umbrella.\n  However, TSCA has been a disaster. EPA has only attempted one major \nregulatory action since TSCA was passed nearly 20 years ago. EPA worked \non that one rule for 10 years. It reviewed hundreds of health studies, \nspent millions of dollars reviewing the comments and the data from the \nindustries to be regulated. The rule was issued after 10 years, and it \nwas immediately challenged in court under the special judicial review \nstandards that apply to TSCA, which are the same standards that would \nbe imposed on all laws under the Johnston amendment. So we have been \ndown this track. Now, what happens? The rule was overturned by the \nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that the opinion of the court \nbe printed in the Record after my comments this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The reason the court gave for vacating the rule was the \nfailure of EPA to provide substantial evidence in the record to support \nits actions. You did not do enough, they said.\n  The substantial evidence test does not apply to any other \nenvironmental laws, only to TSCA, and the only rule ever attempted \nunder TSCA was overturned by the courts because EPA did not meet a \ntest, a test that under the Johnston amendment would apply to all our \nenvironmental laws.\n  Reading the decision, one gets the impression that even if EPA had \npassed the substantial evidence test, the rule would have been thrown \nout on other grounds. The court said that EPA had not considered a \nsufficient number of regulatory alternatives because it only did cost \nestimates on five options, not all of the possible options. The court \nsaid EPA had not satisfied the requirement that it impose the least \nburdensome option because it had not presented any evidence the least \nburdensome option was among the five considered.\n  One could almost conclude that those who drafted the regulatory \nreform bill before the Senate--in other words, the Johnston \nsubstitute--did so with the Fifth Circuit Court's ruling in mind. Every \nhurdle that has made TSCA a useless law to protect health and \nenvironment is rolled up in this bill before us today. It applies \nacross all of our health and our safety and our environmental statutes. \nNo wonder the administration says it will veto the Johnston bill if it \npasses.\n  Mr. President, if the Senate will be guided by the two questions \nSenator Glenn set out--first; will real reform occur; and, second; will \nenvironmental laws be protected or will they be undermined--only one of \nthe two proposals before us today passes that muster. The Glenn-Chafee \namendment contains a series of steps that will improve the quality and \nreduce the burden of Federal regulations. It does so without \nthreatening to undermine our environmental and safety laws.\n  The other bill may be described by Senator Johnston as a tougher \nreform bill. No doubt more rules will be blocked by that bill. Under \nthat bill, it could well result that Federal regulatory agencies would \nbe brought to a virtual standstill. That is what I am confident will \nhappen if this bill should ever become law, which fortunately has a \nslim chance of occurring.\n  But that is not the goal of regulatory reform, to have the whole \nregulatory process of our Federal Government brought to a halt. I am \nsure Senator Johnston and proponents of his bill believe setting high \nstandards for regulations will get better rules. But in making the \nhurdle too high, so high that needed rules, rules that are fully \njustified by their benefits, can never reach the level of perfection \nthat is demanded, they are blocked by endless rounds of review.\n  While those on the other side may charge that the Glenn-Chafee \namendment achieves only modest improvement in regulations, I fear that \nthe underlying substitute may result in no health and environmental \nregulations at all. If that is the objective, fine. If the objective is \nwe do not want any rules, and apparently we are going to pass \neverything in infinite detail in the laws that we pass, that is one \nthing, but certainly, in my judgment, that is not the best course for \nour Nation.\n  I thank the Chair.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  Corrosion Proof Fittings, et al., petitioners, v. the Environmental \n  Protection Agency and William K. Reilly, Administrator, respondents\n\n                              No. 89-4596.\n\n       United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, Oct. 18, \n     1991.\n       On Motion for Clarification Nov. 15, 1991.\n       Rehearing Denied Nov. 27, 1991.\n       Petition was filed for review of final rule promulgated by \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Toxic Substances \n     Control Act section prohibiting future manufacture, \n     importation, processing, and distribution of asbestos in \n     almost all products. The Court of Appeals, Jerry E. Smith, \n     Circuit Judge, held that: (1) foreign entities lacked \n     standing under Act to challenge rule; (2) EPA failed to give \n     required notice to public, before conclusion of hearings, \n     that it intended to use ``analogous exposure'' data to \n     calculate expected benefits of product bans; and (3) EPA \n     failed to give adequate weight to statutory language \n     requiring it to promulgate least burdensome, reasonable \n     regulation required to protect environment adequately.\n       The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final \n     rule under section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act \n     (TSCA) to prohibit the future manufacture, importation, \n     processing, and distribution of asbestos in almost all \n     products. Petitioners claim that the EPA's rulemaking \n     procedure was flawed and that the rule was not promulgated on \n     the basis of substantial evidence. Certain petitioners and \n     amici curiae contend that the EPA rule is invalid because it \n     conflicts with international trade agreements and may have \n     adverse economic effects on Canada and other foreign \n     countries. Because the EPA failed to muster substantial \n     evidence to support its rule, we remand this matter to the \n     EPA for further consideration in light of this opinion.\n                                   I\n\n                      Facts and Procedural History\n\n       Asbestos is a naturally occurring fibrous material that \n     resists fire and most solvents. Its major uses include heat-\n     resistant insulators, cements, building materials, fireproof \n     gloves and clothing, and motor vehicle brake linings. \n     Asbestos is a toxic material, and occupational exposure to \n     asbestos dust can result in mesothelioma, asbestosis, and \n     lung cancer.\n       The EPA began these proceedings in 1979, when it issued an \n     Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking announcing its intent \n     to explore the use of TSCA ``to reduce the risk to human \n     health posed by exposure to asbestos.'' See 54 Fed. Reg. \n     29,460 (1989). While these proceedings were pending, other \n     agencies continued their regulations of asbestos uses, in \n     particular the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n     (OSHA), which in 1983 and 1984 involved itself with lowering \n     standards for workplace asbestos exposure.\\1\\\n       An EPA-appointed panel reviewed over one hundred studies of \n     asbestos and conducted several public meetings. Based upon \n     its studies and the public comments, the EPA concluded that \n     asbestos is a potential carcinogen at all levels of exposure, \n     regardless of the type of asbestos or the size of the fiber. \n     The EPA concluded in 1986 that exposure to asbestos ``poses \n     an unreasonable risk to human health'' and thus proposed at \n     least four regulatory options for prohibiting or restricting \n     the use of asbestos, including a mixed ban and phase-out of \n     asbestos over ten years; a two-stage ban of asbestos, \n     depending upon product usage; a three-stage ban on all \n     asbestos products leading to a total ban in ten years; and \n     labeling of all products containing asbestos. Id at 29,460-\n     61.\n\n[[Page S 10199]]\n\n       Over the next two years, the EPA updated its data, \n     receiving further comments, and allowed cross-examination on \n     the updated documents. In 1989, the EPA issued a final rule \n     prohibiting the manufacture, importation, processing, and \n     distribution in commerce of most asbestos-containing \n     products. Finding that asbestos constituted an unreasonable \n     risk to health and the environment, the EPA promulgated a \n     staged ban of most commercial uses of asbestos. The EPA \n     estimates that this rule will save either 202 or 148 lives, \n     depending upon whether the benefits are discounted, at a cost \n     of approximately $450-800 million, depending upon the price \n     of substitutes. Id. at 29,468.\n       The rule is to take effect in three stages, depending upon \n     the EPA's assessment of how toxic each substance is and how \n     soon adequate substitutes will be available.\\2\\ The rule \n     allows affected persons one more year at each stage to sell \n     existing stocks of prohibited products. The rule also imposes \n     labeling requirements on stage 2 or stage 3 products and \n     allows for exemptions from the rule in certain cases.\n       Section 19(a) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 2618(a), grants \n     interested parties the right to appeal a final rule \n     promulgated under section 6(a) directly to this or any other \n     regional circuit court of appeals. Pursuant to this section, \n     petitioners challenge the EPA's final rule, claiming that the \n     EPA's rulemaking procedure was flawed and that the rule was \n     not promulgated based upon substantial evidence. Some amici \n     curiae also contend that the rule is invalid because it \n     conflicts with international trade agreements and may have \n     adverse economic effects on Canada and other foreign \n     countries. We deal with each of these contentions seriatim.\n\n                                   II\n\n                                Standing\n\n\n                                   A\n\n                  Issues Raised Solely by Amici Curiae\n\n       [1] The EPA argues that the briefs of two of the amici \n     curiae, Quebec and Canada, should be stricken because they \n     improperly raise arguments not mentioned by any petitioner. \n     To the extent that these briefs raise new issues, such as the \n     EPA's decision not to consider the adverse impacts of the \n     asbestos ban on the development of the economies of third-\n     world countries, we disregard these arguments.\\3\\ At times, \n     however, the briefs raise variations of arguments also raised \n     by petitioners. We thus draw on these briefs where helpful in \n     our consideration of other issues properly brought before \n     this court by the parties.\n       [2] The EPA also asserts that we cannot consider arguments \n     raised by the two amici that relate to the differences in \n     fiber types, sizes, and manufacturing processes because these \n     differences only are raised by the petitioners within the \n     context of prohibiting specific friction products, such as \n     sheet gaskets and roof coating. This is, however, a role that \n     amici are intended to fill: to bridge gaps in issues \n     initially and properly raised by parties. Because various \n     petitioners urge arguments similar to these, we properly can \n     consider these specific issues articulated in the amici \n     briefs.\\4\\\n                                   b\n\n                Standing of Foreign Entities Under TSCA\n\n       The EPA also contends that certain foreign petitioners and \n     amici do not have standing to contest the EPA's final rule. \n     In its final rulemaking, the EPA decided to exclude foreign \n     effects from its analysis. Cassiar Mining Corporation, a \n     Canadian mining company that operates an asbestos mine, and \n     the other Canadian petitioners believe that the EPA erred by \n     not considering the effects of the ban on foreign countries \n     and workers.\n       [3] At issue in this case is a question of prudential \n     standing, which is of less than constitutional dimensions. \n     The touchstone of the analysis, therefore, is the statutory \n     language used by Congress in conferring standing upon the \n     general public. Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 501, 95 S.Ct. \n     2197, 2206, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975).\n       [4] Only those who come within the ``zone of interests to \n     be protected or regulated by the statute'' have prudential \n     standing to bring challenges to regulations under the statute \n     at issue.\\5\\ Indeed, when a party's interests are \n     ``inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute,'' \n     it can ``reasonably be assumed that Congress [did not] \n     intend[ ] to permit the suit.'' Clarke, 479 U.S. at 399, 107 \n     S.Ct. at 757.\n       The Canadian petitioners believe that Congress, by granting \n     the right of judicial review to ``any person,'' 15 U.S.C.A. \n     Sec. 2618(a)(1)(A) (West Supp.1991), meant to confer standing \n     on anyone who could arrange transportation to the courthouse \n     door. The actual language of TSCA, however, belies the broad \n     meaning the petitioners attempt to impart to the act, for the \n     EPA was not required to consider the effects on people or \n     entities outside the United States. TSCA provides a laundry \n     list of factors to consider when promulgating a rule under \n     section 6, including ``the effect [of the rule] on the \n     national economy.'' Id. Sec. 2605(c)(1)(D) (emphasis added). \n     International concerns are conspicuously absent from the \n     statute.\n       [5] Under the ``zone of interests'' test, we liberally \n     construe Congressional acts to favor a plaintiff's standing \n     to challenge administrative actions. Warth, 422 U.S. at 501, \n     95 S.Ct. at 2206. This is not to say, however, that all \n     plaintiffs affected by a regulation or order have standing to \n     sue; ``[i]n cases where the plaintiff is not itself the \n     subject of the contested regulatory action, the test denies a \n     right of review if the plaintiff's interests are so \n     marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes \n     implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed \n     that Congress intended to permit the suit.'' Clarke, 479 U.S. \n     at 399, 107 S.Ct. at 757.\n       [6] The Canadian petitioners do not have standing to \n     contest the EPA's actions. Nothing in the statute requires \n     the EPA to consider the effects of its actions in areas \n     outside the scope of section 6. TSCA speaks of the necessity \n     of cleaning up the national environment and protecting United \n     States workers but largely is silent concerning the \n     international effects of agency action. Because of this \n     national emphasis, we are reluctant to ascribe international \n     standing rights to foreign workers affected by the loss of \n     economic sales within this country. We note that the Supreme \n     Court, using similar analysis, recently denied standing \n     rights to workers only incidentally affected by a postal \n     regulation. Air Courier Conference of Am. v. American Postal \n     Workers Union, -- U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 913, 112 L.Ed.2d 1125 \n     (1991). Indeed, to ``proceed[] at the behest of interests \n     that coincide only accidentally with [the statutory] goals'' \n     of TSCA actually may work to defeat those goals. Hazardous \n     Waste Treatment Council, 861 F.2d at 283. We therefore do not \n     consider the arguments raised by the Canadian petitioners.\n       [7] Cassiar separately asserts even closer contacts with \n     the United States and believes that its status as a vendor to \n     an American vendee gives it the right to contest \n     administrative decisions that affect the economic well-being \n     of the vendee. Some courts recognize that vendors can stand \n     as third parties in the shoes of their vendees in order to \n     contest administrative decisions.\\6\\\n       Even if we were to accept this line of reasoning, however, \n     the result would be unavailing. Cassiar's vendee is an \n     independent entity, fully capable of asserting its own \n     rights. Given the purely national scope of TSCA, Cassiar \n     cannot, bootstrap from its vendee simply because it sells \n     asbestos to an American company. Merely inserting a product \n     into the stream of commerce is not sufficient to confer \n     standing under TSCA. If the rule were otherwise, the concept \n     of standing would lose all meaning, for the only parties who \n     would not have standing would be those who sell nothing in \n     the United States and thus are indifferent to federal \n     government actions. There is no indication that Congress \n     intended to enact so loose a concept of standing, and we do \n     not import that intent into the act today.\\7\\\n       Hence, Cassiar does not have prudential standing to bring \n     this claim, because TSCA expressly concerns itself with \n     national economic concerns. Cassiar brings forth no evidence \n     that it actually controls, and does not just deal with, the \n     American vendee. We thus conclude, along the lines of Moses, \n     778 F.2d at 271-72, that parties that Congress specifically \n     did not intend to participate in, or benefit from, an \n     administrative decision have no right to challenge the \n     legitimacy of that decision.\n       [8] We draw support for our holding from the decision of \n     the EPA to give a similar construction to TSCA. ``It is \n     settled that courts should give great weight to any \n     reasonable construction of a regulatory statute adopted by \n     the agency charged with the enforcement of that statute.'' \n     Investment Co. Inst. v. Camp, 401 U.S. 617, 626-27, 91 S.Ct. \n     1091, 1097, 28 L.Ed.2d 367 (1971). ``Thus, only where \n     congressional intent is pellucide are we entitled to reject \n     reasonable administrative construction of a statute.'' \n     National Grain & Feed Ass'n v. OSHA, 886 F.2d 717, 733 (5th \n     Cir. 1989).\n       [9] We find the EPA's decision to ignore the international \n     effects of its decision to be a rational construction of the \n     statute. Chemical Mfrs. Ass'n v. Natural Resources Defense \n     Council, 470 U.S. 116, 125, 134, 105 S.Ct. 1102, 1107, 1112, \n     84 L.Ed.2d 90 (1985). Because it is unlikely that these \n     foreign entities were ``intended [by Congress] to be relied \n     upon to challenge agency disregard of the law,'' Clarke, 479 \n     U.S. at 399, 107 S.Ct. at 757 (citations omitted), we hold \n     that they are\n      outside the zone of interests encompassed by TSCA and thus \n     lack standing to protest the EPA's rulemaking.\\8\\\n\n                                  III\n\n                           Rulemaking Defects\n\n       [10-12] The petitioners allege that the EPA's rulemaking \n     procedure was flawed. Specifically, the petitioners contend \n     that the EPA erred by not cross-examining petitioner's \n     witnesses, by not assembling a panel of experts on asbestos \n     disease risks, by designating a hearing officer, rather than \n     an administrative law judge (ALJ), to preside at the hearings \n     on the rule, and by not swearing in witnesses who testified. \n     Petitioners also complain that the EPA did not allow cross-\n     examination of some of its witnesses and did not notify \n     anyone until after the hearings were over that it intended to \n     use ``analogous exposure'' estimates and a substitute pricing \n     assumption to support its rule. Most of these contentions \n     lack merit and are part of the petitioners' ``protest \n     everything'' approach,\\9\\ but we address specifically the two \n     EPA actions of most concern to us, the failure of the EPA to \n     afford cross-examination of its own witnesses and its failure \n     to provide notice of the analogous exposure estimates.\n       [13] Administrative agencies acting under TSCA are not \n     required to adhere to all of the procedural requirements were \n     might require of an adjudicative body. See 15 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2605(c)(3). In evaluating petitioners' claims, we are \n     guided by our long-held view that an \n\n[[Page S 10200]]\n     agency's choices concerning its rulemaking procedures are entitled to \n     great deference, as the agencies are ``best situated to \n     determine how they should allocate their finite resources.'' \n     Superior Oil Co. v. FERC, 563 F.2d 191, 201 (5th Cir. 1977).\n       [14] Section 19(c)(1)(B)(ii) of TSCA requires that we hold \n     unlawful any rule promulgated where EPA restrictions on \n     cross-examination ``precluded disclosure of disputed material \n     facts which [were] necessary to a fair determination by the \n     Administrator.'' 15 U.S.C. Sec. 2618(c)(1)(B)(ii). In \n     promulgating this rule, the EPA allowed substantial cross-\n     examination of most, but not all, of its witnesses. \n     Considering the importance TSCA accords to cross-examination, \n     the EPA should have afforded interested parties full cross-\n     examination on all\n      of its major witnesses. We are mindful of the length of the \n     asbestos regulatory process in this case, but Congress, in \n     enacting the rules governing the informal hearing process \n     under TSCA, specifically reserved a place for proper \n     cross-examination on issues of disputed material fact. See \n     id. Sec. Sec. 2605(c)(3), 2618(c)(1)(B)(ii). Precluding \n     cross-examination of EPA witnesses--even a minority of \n     them--is not the proper way to expedite the finish of a \n     lengthy rulemaking procedure.\n       The EPA's general failure to accord the petitioners \n     adequate cross-examination, however, is not sufficient by \n     itself to mandate overturning the rule. The ``foundational \n     question is whether any procedural flaw so subverts the \n     process of judicial review that invalidation of the \n     regulation is warranted.''

Under this standard, the EPA's denial of cross-\n     examination, by itself, is insufficient to force us to \n     overturn the EPA's asbestos regulation.\n       [15] We cannot reach the same conclusion in another area, \n     however. The EPA failed to give notice to the public, before \n     the conclusion of the hearings, that it intended to use \n     ``analogous exposure'' data to calculate the expected \n     benefits of certain product bans. In general, the EPA should \n     give notice as to its intended methodology while the public \n     still has an opportunity to analyze, comment, and influence \n     the proceedings. The EPA's use of the analogous exposure \n     estimates, apart from their merits, thus should have been \n     subjected to public scrutiny before the record was closed. \n     While it is true that ``[t]he public need not have an \n     opportunity to comment on every bit of information \n     influencing an agency's decision,'' Texan v. Lyng, 868 F.2d \n     795, 799 (5th Cir. 1989), this cannot be used as a defense to \n     the late adoption of the analogous exposure estimates, as \n     they are used to support a substantial part of the regulation \n     finally promulgated by the EPA.\\10\\\n       We draw support for this conclusion from Aqua Slide 'N' \n     Dive v. CPSC, 569 F.2d 831 (5th Cir.1978), in which the CPSC \n     decided, without granting interested parties the opportunity \n     to comment, that its proposed regulation merely would slow \n     the industry's rate of growth rather than actually cut sales. \n     We rejected the CPSC's rule, and our reasons there are \n     similar to those that require us to reject the EPA's reliance \n     upon the analogous exposure data today:\n       [T]he evidence on which the Commission relies was only made \n     public after the period for public comment on the standard \n     had closed. Consequently, critics had no realistic chance to \n     rebut it. . . . It matters not that the late submission \n     probably did not violate the notice requirement of 5 U.S.C.A. \n     Sec. 553. . . . The statute requires that the Commission's \n     findings be supported by substantial evidence, and that \n     requirement is not met when the only evidence on a crucial \n     finding is alleged to be unreliable and the Commission has \n     not exposed it to the full scrutiny which would encourage \n     confidence in its accuracy.\n       Id. at 842-43 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).\n       In short, the EPA should not hold critical analysis in \n     reserve and then use it to justify its regulation despite the \n     lack of public comment on the validity of its basis. Failure \n     to seek public comment on such an important part of the EPA's \n     analysis deprived its rule of the substantial evidence \n     required to survive judicial scrutiny, as in Aqua Slide.\n       [16] We reach this conclusion despite the relatively \n     lenient standard by which we judge administrative rulemaking \n     proceedings. E.g., Superior Oil Co., 563 F.2d at 201. The EPA \n     seeks to avert this result by contending that the petitioners \n     had constructive notice that the EPA might adopt the \n     analogous exposure theory because it included, among its \n     published data, certain information that might be manipulated \n     to support such an analysis. We hold, however, that \n     considering that for some products the analogous exposure \n     estimates constituted the bulk of the EPA's analysis, \n     constructive notice was insufficient notice.\\11\\ In summary, \n     on an issue of this import, the EPA should have announced\n      during the years in which the hearings were ongoing, rather \n     than in the subsequent weeks after which they were closed, \n     that it intended to use the analogous exposure estimates. \n     On reconsideration, the EPA should open to public comment \n     the validity of its analogous exposure estimates and \n     methodology.\n\n                                   IV\n\n                          The Language of TSCA\n\n\n                                   A\n\n                           Standard of Review\n\n       Our inquiry into the legitimacy of the EPA rulemaking \n     begins with a discussion of the standard of review governing \n     this case. EPA's phase-out ban of most commercial uses of \n     asbestos is a TSCA Sec. 6(a) rulemaking. TSCA provides that a \n     reviewing court ``shall hold unlawful and set aside'' a final \n     rule promulgated under Sec. 6(a) ``if the court finds that \n     the rule is not supported by substantial evidence in the \n     rulemaking record . . . taken as a whole.'' 15 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2618(c)(1)(B)(i).\n       [17] Substantial evidence requires ``something less than \n     the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing \n     two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not \n     prevent an administrative agency's finding from being \n     supported by substantial evidence.'' Consolo v. Federal \n     Maritime Comm'n, 383 U.S. 607, 620, 86 S.Ct. 1018, 1026, 16 \n     L.Ed.2d 131 (1966). This standard requires (1) that the \n     agency's decision be based upon the entire record,\\12\\ taking \n     into account whatever in the record detracts from the weight \n     of the agency's decision; and (2) that the agency's decision \n     be what `` `a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \n     support [its] conclusion.' '' American Textile Mfrs. Inst. v. \n     Donovan, 452 U.S. 490, 522, 101 S.Ct. 2478, 2497, 69 L.Ed.2d \n     185 (1981) (quoting Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. \n     474, 477, 71 S.Ct. 456, 459, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951)). Thus, even \n     if there is enough evidence in the record to support the \n     petitioners; assertions, we will not reverse if there is \n     substantial evidence to support the agency's decision. See, \n     e.g., Villa v. Sullivan, 895 F.2d 1019, 1021-22 (5th Cir. \n     1990); Singletary v. Bowen, 798 F.2d 818, 822-23 (5th \n     Cir.1986); accord Fort Valley State College v. Bennett, 853 \n     F.2d 862, 864 (11th Cir. 1988) (reviewing court examines the \n     entire record but defers to the agency's choice between two \n     conflicting views).\n       [18, 19] Contrary to the EPA's assertions, the arbitrary \n     and capricious standard found in the APA and the substantial \n     evidence standard found in TSCA are different standards, even \n     in the context of an informal rulemaking.\\13\\ Congress \n     specifically went out of its way to provide that ``the \n     standard of review prescribed by paragraph (2)(E) of section \n     706 [of the APA] shall not apply and the court shall hold \n     unlawful and set aside such rule if the court finds that the \n     rule is not supported by substantial evidence in the \n     rulemaking record ... taken as a whole.'' 15 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2618(c)(1)(B)(i). ``The substantial evidence standard \n     mandated by [TSCA] is generally considered to be more \n     rigorous than the arbitrary and capricious standard normally \n     applied to informal rulemaking,'' Environmental Defense Funds \n     v. EPA, 636 F.2d 1267, 1277 (D.C.Cir.1980), and ``afford[s] a \n     considerably more generous judicial review'' than the \n     arbitrary and capricious test.

Sanders, \n     430 U.S. 99, 97 S.Ct. 980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977). The test \n     ``imposes a considerable burden on the agency and limits its \n     discretion in arriving at a factual predicate.''

Environmental Defense Fund, 636 F.2d at 1277. As \n     with consumer product legislation, ``Congress put the \n     substantial evidence test in the statute because it wanted \n     the courts to scrutinize the Commission's actions more \n     closely than an `arbitrary and capricious' standard would \n     allow.''

In evaluating whether the EPA \n     has presented substantial evidence, we examine (1) whether \n     the quantities of the regulated chemical entering into the \n     environment are ``substantial'' and (2) whether human \n     exposure\n      to the chemical is ``substantial'' or ``significant.'' Id. \n     at 359. An agency may exercise its judgment without \n     strictly relying upon quantifiable risks, costs, and \n     benefits, but it must ``cogently explain why it has \n     exercised its discretion in a given manner'' and ``must \n     offer a `rational connection between the facts found and \n     the choice made.'

Ins., 463 U.S. 29, 103 \n     S.Ct. 2856, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983)).\n       [23,24] We note that in undertaking our review, we give all \n     agency rules a presumption of validity, and it is up to the \n     challenger to any rule to show that the agency action is \n     invalid. Alabama Nursing Home Ass'n v. Harris, 617 F.2d 388, \n     393-94 (5th Cir. 1980). The burden remains on the EPA, \n     however, to justify that the products it bans present an \n     unreasonable risk, no matter how regulated. See Industrial \n     Union Dep't v. American Petroleum Inst., 448 U.S. 607, 662, \n     100 S.Ct. 2844, 2874, 65 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1980); cf. National \n     Lime Ass'n v.

See 15 U.S.C. Sec. 2605(a).\n\n\n                                   B\n\n                      The EPA's Burden Under TSCA\n\n       TSCA provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n       (a) Scope of regulation.--If the Administrator finds that \n     there is a reasonable basis to \n\n[[Page S 10201]]\n     conclude that the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, \n     use, or disposal of a chemical substance or mixture, or that \n     any combination of such activities, presents or will present \n     an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, \n     the Administrator shall by rule apply one or more of the \n     following requirements to such substance or mixture to the \n     extent necessary to protect adequately against such risk\n      using the least burdensome requirements. Id. (emphasis \n     added). As the highlighted language shows, Congress did \n     not enact TSCA as a zero-risk statute.\\14\\ The EPA, \n     rather, was required to consider both alternatives to a \n     ban and the costs of any proposed actions and to ``carry \n     out this chapter in a reasonable and prudent manner [after \n     considering] the environmental, economic and social impact \n     of any action.'' 15 U.S.C. Sec. 2601(c).\n       [25] We conclude that the EPA has presented insufficient \n     evidence to justify its asbestos ban. We base this conclusion \n     upon two grounds: the failure of the EPA to consider all \n     necessary evidence and its failure to give adequate weight to \n     statutory language requiring it to promulgate the least \n     burdensome, reasonable regulation required to protect the \n     environment adequately. Because the EPA failed to address \n     these concerns, and because the EPA is required to articulate \n     a ``reasoned basis'' for its rules, we are compelled to \n     return the regulation to the agency for reconsideration.\n       1. Least Burdensome and Reasonable.\n       [26] TSCA requires that the EPA use the least burdensome \n     regulation to achieve its goal of minimum reasonable risk. \n     This statutory requirement can create problems in evaluating \n     just what is a ``reasonable risk.'' Congress's rejection of a \n     no-risk policy, however, also means that in certain cases, \n     the least burdensome yet still adequate solution may entail \n     somewhat more risk than would other, known regulations that \n     are far more burdensome on the industry and the economy. The \n     very language of TSCA requires that the EPA once it has \n     determined what an acceptable level of non-zero risk is, \n     chose the least burdensome method of reaching that level.\n       In this case, the EPA banned, for all practical purposes, \n     all present and future use of asbestos--a position the \n     petitioners characterize as the ``death penalty \n     alternative,'' as this is the most burdensome of all possible \n     alternatives listed as open to the EPA under TSCA. TSCA not \n     only provides the EPA with a list of alternative actions but \n     also provides those alternatives in order of how burdensome \n     they are.\\15\\ The\n      regulations thus provide for EPA regulation ranging from \n     labeling the least toxic chemicals an industry may use. \n     Total bans head the list as the most burdensome regulatory \n     option.\n       By choosing the harshest remedy given to it under TSCA, the \n     EPA assigned to itself the toughest burden in satisfying \n     TSCA's requirement that its alternative be the least \n     burdensome of all those offered to it. Since, both by \n     definition and by the terms of TSCA, the complete ban of \n     manufacturing is the most burdensome alternative--for even \n     stringent regulation at least allows a manufacturer the \n     chance to invest and meet the new, higher standard--the EPA's \n     regulation cannot stand if there is any other regulation that \n     would achieve an acceptable level of risk as mandated by \n     TSCA.\n       We reserve until a later part of the opinion a product-by-\n     product review of the regulation. Before reaching this \n     analysis, however, we lay down the inquiry that the EPA \n     should undertake whenever it seeks total ban of a product.\n       The EPA considered, and rejected, such options as labeling \n     asbestos products, thereby warning users and workers involved \n     in the manufacture of asbestos-containing products of the \n     chemical's dangers, and stricter workplace rules. EPA also \n     rejected controlled use of asbestos in the workplace and \n     deferral to other government agencies charged with worker and \n     consumer exposure to industrial and product hazards, such as \n     OSHA, the CPSC, and the MSHA. The EPA determined that \n     deferral to these other agencies was inappropriate because no \n     one other authority could address all the risks posed \n     ``throughout the life cycle'' by asbestos, and any action by \n     one or more of the other agencies still would leave an \n     unacceptable residual risk.\\16\\\n       Much of the EPA's analysis is correct, and the EPA's basic \n     decision to use TSCA as a comprehensive statute designed to \n     fight a multi-industry problem was a proper one that we \n     uphold today on review. What concerns us, however, is the \n     manner in which the EPA conducted some of its analysis. TSCA \n     requires the EPA to consider, along with the effects of toxic \n     substances on human health and the environment, ``the \n     benefits of such substance[s] or mixture[s] for various uses \n     and the availability of substitutes for such uses,'' as well \n     as ``the reasonably ascertainable economic consequences of \n     the rule, after consideration for the effect on the national \n     economy, small business, technological innovation, the \n     environment, and public health.'' Id. Sec. 2605(c)(1)(C-D).\n       The EPA presented two comparisons in the record: a world \n     with no further regulation under TSCA, and a world in which \n     no manufacture of asbestos takes place. The EPA rejected \n     calculating how many lives a less burdensome regulation would \n     save, and at what cost. Furthermore the EPA, when calculating \n     the benefits of its ban, explicitly refused to compare it to \n     an improved workplace in which currently available control \n     technology is utilized. See 54 Fed.Reg. at 29,474. This \n     decision artificially inflated the purported benefits of the \n     rule by using a baseline comparison substantially lower than \n     what currently available technology could yield.\n       [27] Under TSCA, the EPA was required to evaluate, rather \n     than ignore, less burdensome regulatory alternatives. TSCA \n     imposes a least-to-most-burdensome hierarchy. In order to \n     impose a regulation at the top of the hierarchy--a total ban \n     of asbestos--the EPA must show not only that its proposed \n     action reduces the risk of the product to an adequate level, \n     but also that the actions Congress identified as less \n     burdensome also would not do the job.\\17\\ The failure of the \n     EPA to do this constitutes a failure to meet its burden of \n     showing that its actions not only reduce the risk but do so \n     in the Congressionally-mandated least burdensome fashion.\n       Thus it was not enough for the EPA to show, as it did in \n     this case, that banning some asbestos products might reduce \n     the harm that could occur from the use of these products. If \n     that were the standard, it would be no standard at all, for \n     few indeed are the products that are so safe that a complete \n     ban of them would not make the world still safer.\n       This comparison of two static worlds is insufficient to \n     satisfy the dictates of TSCA. While the EPA may have shown \n     that a world with a complete ban of asbestos might be \n     preferable to one in which there is only the current amount \n     of regulation, the EPA has failed to show that there is not \n     some intermediate state of regulation that would be superior \n     to both the currently-regulated and the completely-banned \n     world. Without showing that asbestos regulation would be \n     ineffective, the EPA cannot discharge its TSCA burden of \n     showing that its regulation is the least burdensome available \n     to it.\n       Upon an initial showing of product danger, the proper \n     course for the EPA to follow is to consider each regulatory \n     option, beginning with the least burdensome, and the costs \n     and benefits of regulation under each option. The EPA cannot \n     simply skip several rungs, as it did in this case, for in \n     doing so, it may skip a less-burdensome alternative mandated \n     by TSCA. Here, although the EPA mentions the problems posed \n     by intermediate levels of regulation, it takes no steps to \n     calculate the costs and benefits of these intermediate \n     levels. See 54 Fed.Reg. at 29,462, 29,474. Without doing this \n     it is impossible, both for the EPA and for this court on \n     review, to know that none of these alternatives was less \n     burdensome than the ban in fact chosen by the agency.\n       The EPA's offhand rejection of these intermediate \n     regulatory steps is ``not the stuff of which substantial \n     evidence is made.'' Aqua Slide, 569 F.2d at 843. While it is \n     true that the EPA considered five different ban options, \n     these differed solely with respect to their effective dates. \n     The EPA did not calculate the risk levels for intermediate \n     levels of regulation, as it believed that there was no \n     asbestos exposure level for which the risk of injury or death \n     was zero. Reducing risk to zero, however, was not the task \n     that Congress set for the EPA in enacting TSCA. The EPA thus \n     has failed ``cogently [to] explain why it has exercised its \n     discretion in a given manner,'' Chemical Mfrs. Ass'n, 899 \n     F.2d at 349, by failing to explore in more than a cursory way \n     the less burdensome alternatives to a total ban.\n       2. The EPA's Calculations.\n       Furthmore, we are concerned about some of the methodology \n     employed by the EPA in making various of the calculations \n     that it did perform. In order to aid the EPA's \n     reconsideration of this and other cases, we present our \n     concerns here.\n       [28] First, we note that there was some dispute in the \n     record regarding the appropriateness of discounting the \n     perceived benefits of the EPA's rule. In choosing between the \n     calculated costs and benefits, the EPA presented variations \n     in which it discounted only the costs, and counter-variations \n     in which it discounted about the costs and the benefits, \n     measured in both monetary and human injury terms. As between \n     these two variations, we choose to evaluate the EPA's work \n     using its discounted benefits calculations.\n       Although various commentators dispute whether it ever is \n     appropriate to discount benefits when they are measured in \n     human lives, we note that it would skew the results to \n     discount only costs without according similar treatment to \n     the benefits side of the equation. Adopting the position of \n     the commentators who advocate not discounting benefits would \n     force the EPA similarly not to calculate costs in present \n     discounted real terms, making comparisons difficult. \n     Furthermore, in evaluating situations in which different \n     options incur costs at varying time intervals, the EPA would \n     not be able to take into account that soon-to-be incurred \n     costs are more harmful than postponable costs. Because the \n     EPA must discount costs to perform its evaluations properly, \n     the EPA also should discount benefits to preserve an apples-\n     to-apples comparison, even if this entails discounting \n     benefits of a non-monetary nature. See What Price Posterity?, \n     The Economist, March 23, 1991, at 73 (explaining use of \n     discount rates for non-monetary goods).\n       When the EPA does discount costs of benefits, however, it \n     cannot choose an unreasonable time upon which to base its \n     discount calculation. Instead of using the time of injury as \n     the appropriate time from which to discount, as one might \n     expect, the EPA instead used the time of exposure.\n\n[[Page S 10202]]\n\n       The difficulties inherent in the EPA's approach can be \n     illustrated by an example. Suppose two workers will be \n     exposed to asbestos in 1995, with worker X subjected to a \n     tiny amount of asbestos that will have no adverse health \n     effects, and worker Y exposed to massive amounts of asbestos \n     that quickly will lead to an asbestos-related disease. Under \n     the EPA's approach, which takes into account only the time of \n     exposure rather than the time at which any injury manifests \n     itself, both examples would be treated the same. The EPA's \n     approach implicitly assumes that the day on which the risk of \n     injury occurs is the same day the injury actually occurs.\\18\\ \n     Such an approach might be proper when the exposure and injury \n     are one and the same, such as when a person is exposed to an \n     immediately fatal poison, but is inappropiate for discounting \n     toxins in which exposure often is followed by a substantial \n     lag time before manifestation of injuries.\\19\\\n       Of more concern to us is the failure of the EPA to compute \n     the costs and benefits of its proposed rule past the year \n     2000, and its double-counting of the costs of asbestos use. \n     In performing its calculus, the EPA only included the number \n     of lives saved over the next thirteen years, and counted any \n     additional lives saved as simply ``unquantified benefits.'' \n     54 Fed. Reg. at 29,486. The EPA and intervenors now seek to \n     use these unquantified lives saved to justify calculations as \n     to which the benefits seem far outweighed by the astronomical \n     costs. For example, the EPA plans to save about three lives \n     with its ban of asbestos pipe, at a cost of $128-227 million \n     (i.e., approximately $43-76 million per life saved). Although \n     the EPA admits that the lives saved past the year 2000 \n     justify the price. See generally id. at 29,473 (explaining \n     use of unquantified benefits).\n       Such calculations not only lessen the value of the EPA's \n     cost analysis, but also make any meaningful judicial review \n     impossible. While TSCA contemplates a useful place for \n     unquantified benefits beyond the EPA's calculation, \n     unquantified benefits never were intended as a trump card \n     allowing the EPA to justify any cost calculus, no matter how \n     high.\n       The concept of unquantified benefits, rather, is intended \n     to allow the EPA to provide a rightful place for any \n     remaining benefits that are impossible to quantify after the \n     EPA's best attempt, but which still are of some concern. But \n     the allowance for unquantified costs is not intended to allow \n     the EPA to perform its calculations over an arbitrarily short \n     period so as to preserve a large unquantified portion.\n       Unquantified benefits can, at times, permissibly tip the \n     balance in close cases. They cannot, however, be used to \n     effect a wholesale shift on the balance beam. Such a use \n     makes a mockery of the requirements of TSCA that the EPA \n     weigh the costs of its actions before it chooses the least \n     burdensome alternative.\\20\\\n       [29] Most problematical to us is the EPA's ban of products \n     for which no substitutes presently are available. In these \n     cases, the EPA bears a tough burden indeed to show that under \n     TSCA a ban is the least burdensome alternative, as TSCA \n     explicitly instructs the EPA to consider ``the benefits of \n     such substance or mixture for various uses and the \n     availability of substitutes for such uses.'' Id. \n     Sec. 2605(c)(1)(C). These words are particularly appropriate \n     where the EPA actually has decided to ban a product, rather \n     than simply restrict is use, for it is in these cases that \n     the lack of an adequate substitute is most troubling under \n     TSCA.\n       As the EPA itself states, ``[w]hen no information is \n     available for a product indicating that cost-effective \n     substitutes exist, the estimated cost of a product ban is \n     very high.'' 54 Fed.Reg. at 29,468. Because of this, the EPA \n     did not ban certain uses of asbestos, such as its use in \n     rocket engines and battery separators. The EPA, however, in \n     several other instances, ignores its own arguments and \n     attempts to justify its ban by stating that the ban itself \n     will cause the development of low-cost, adequate substitute \n     products.\n       [30] As a general matter, we agree with the EPA that a \n     product ban can lead to great innovation, and it is true that \n     an agency under TSCA, as under other regulatory statutes, \n     ``is empowered to issue safety standards which require \n     improvements in existing technology or which require the \n     development of new technology.'' Chrysler Corp. v. Department \n     of Transp., 472 F.2d 659, 673 (6th Cit.1972). As even the EPA \n     acknowledges, however, when no adequate substitutes currently \n     exist, the EPA cannot fail to consider this lack when \n     formulating its own guidelines. Under TSCA, therefore, the \n     EPA must present a stronger case to justify the ban, as \n     opposed to regulation, of products with no substitutes.\n       We note that the EPA does provide a waiver provision for \n     industries where the hoped-for substitutes fail to \n     materialize in time. See 54 Fed. Reg. at 29,464. Under this \n     provision, if no adequate substitutes develop, the EPA \n     temporarily may extend the planned phase-out.\n       The EPA uses this provision to argue that it can ban any \n     product, regardless of whether it has an adequate substitute, \n     because inventive companies soon will develop good \n     substitutes. The EPA contends that if they do not, the waiver \n     provision will allow the continued use of asbestos in these \n     areas, just as if the ban had not occurred at all.\n       The EPA errs, however, in asserting that the waiver \n     provision will allow a continuation of the status quo in \n     those cases in which no substitutes materialize. By its own \n     terms, the exemption shifts the burden onto the waiver \n     proponent to convince the EPA that the waiver is justified. \n     See id. As even the EPA acknowledges, the wavier only ``may \n     be granted by [the] EPA in very limited circumstances.'' Id. \n     at 29,460.\n       The EPA thus cannot use the waiver provision to lessen its \n     burden when justifying banning products without existing \n     substitutes. While TSCA gives the EPA the power to ban such \n     products, the EPA must bear its heavier burden of justifying \n     its total ban in the face of inadequate substitutes. Thus, \n     the agency cannot use its waiver provision to argue that the \n     ban of products with no substitutes should be treated the \n     same as the ban of those for which adequate substitutes are \n     available now.\n       [31] We also are concerned with the EPA's evaluation of \n     substitutes even in those instances in which the record shows \n     that they are available. The EPA explicitly rejects \n     considering the harm that may flow from the increased use of \n     products designed to substitute for asbestos, even where the \n     probable substitutes themselves are known carcinogens. Id. at \n     29,481-83. The EPA justifies this by stating that it has \n     ``more concern about the continued use and exposure to \n     asbestos than it has for the future replacement of asbestos \n     in the products subject to this rule with other fibrous \n     substitutes.'' Id. at 29,481. The agency thus concludes that \n     any ``[r]egulatory decisions about asbestos which poses well-\n     recognized, serious risks should not be delayed until the \n     risk of all replacement materials are fully quantified.'' Id. \n     at 29,483.\n       This presents two problems. First, TSCA instructs the EPA \n     to consider the relative merits of its ban, as compared to \n     the economic effects of its actions. The EPA cannot make this \n     calculation if it fails to consider the effects that \n     alternate substitutes will pose after a ban.\n       Second, the EPA cannot say with any assurance that its \n     regulation will increase workplace safety when it refuses to \n     evaluate the harm that will result from the increased use of \n     substitute products. While the EPA may be correct in its \n     conclusion that the alternate materials pose less risk than \n     asbestos, we cannot say with any more assurance than that \n     flowing from an educated guess that this conclusion is true.\n       Considering that many of the substitutes that the EPA \n     itself concedes will be used in the place of asbestos have \n     known carcinogenic effects, the EPA not only cannot assure \n     this court that it has taken the least burdensome \n     alternative, but cannot even prove that its regulations will \n     increase workplace safety. Eager to douse the dangers of \n     asbestos, the agency inadvertently actually may increase the \n     risk of injury Americans face. The EPA's explicit failure to \n     consider the toxicity of likely substitutes thus deprives its \n     order of a reasonable basis. Cf. American Petroleum Inst. v. \n     OSHA, 581 F. 2d 493, 504 (5th Cir. 1978) (An agency is \n     required to ``regulate on the basis of knowledge rather than \n     the unknown.'').\n       Our opinion should not be construed to state that the EPA \n     has an affirmative duty to seek out and test every workplace \n     substitute for any product it seeks to regulate. TSCA does \n     not place such a burden upon the agency. We do not think it \n     unreasonable, however, once interested parties introduce \n     credible studies and evidence showing the toxicity of \n     workplace substitutes, or the decreased effectiveness of \n     safety alternatives such as non-asbestos brakes, that the EPA \n     then consider whether its regulations are even increasing \n     workplace safety, and whether the increased risk occasioned \n     by dangerous substitutes makes the proposed regulation no \n     longer reasonable. In the words of the EPA's own release that \n     initiated the asbestos rulemaking, we direct that the agency \n     consider the adverse health effects of asbestos substitute \n     ``for comparison with the known hazards of asbestos,'' so \n     that it can conduct, as it promised in 1979, a ``balanced \n     consideration of the environmental, economic, and social \n     impact of any action taken by the agency.'' 44 Fed. Reg. at \n     60,065 (1979).\n       [32] In short, a death is a death, whether occasioned by \n     asbestos or by a toxic substitute product, and the EPA's \n     decision not to evaluate the toxicity of known carcinogenic \n     substitutes is not a reasonable action under TSCA. Once an \n     interested party brings forth credible evidence suggesting \n     the toxicity of the probable or only alternatives to a \n     substance, the EPA must consider the comparative toxic costs \n     of each.\\21\\ Its failure to do so in this case thus\n      deprived its regulation of a reasonable basis, at least in \n     regard to those products as to which petitioners \n     introduced credible evidence of the dangers of the likely \n     substitutes.\\22\\\n       4. Unreasonable Risk of Injury.\n       The final requirement the EPA must satisfy before engaging \n     in any TSCA rulemaking is that it only take steps designed to \n     prevent ``unreasonable'' risks. In evaluating what is \n     ``unreasonable,'' the EPA is required to consider the costs \n     of any proposed actions and to ``carry out this chapter in a \n     reasonable and prudent manner [after considering] the \n     environmental, economic, and social impact of any action.'' \n     15 U.S.C. Sec. 2601(c).\n       [33] As the District of Columbia Circuit stated when \n     evaluating similar language governing the Federal Hazardous \n     Substances Act, ``[t]he requirement that the risk be \n     `unreasonable' necessarily involves a balancing test like \n     that familiar in tort law: The regulation may issue if the \n     severity of the injury \n\n[[Page S 10203]]\n     that may result from the product, factored by the likelihood of the \n     injury, offsets the harm the regulation itself imposes upon \n     manufacturers and consumers,'' Forester v. CPSC, 559 F.2d \n     774, 789 (D.C.Cir. 1977). We have quoted this language \n     approvingly when evaluating other statutes using similar \n     language. See, e.g., Aqua Slide, 569 F.2d at 839.\n       That the EPA must balance the costs of its regulations \n     against their benefits further is reinforced by the \n     requirement that it seek the least burdensome regulation. \n     While Congress did not dictate that the EPA engage in an \n     exhaustive, full-scale cost-benefit analysis, it did require \n     the EPA to consider both sides of the regulatory equation, \n     and it rejected the notion that the EPA should pursue the \n     reduction of workplace risk at any cost. See American Textile \n     Mfrs. Inst., 452 U.S. at 510 n. 30, 101 S.Ct. at 2491 n. 30 \n     (``unreasonable risk'' statutes require ``a generalized \n     balancing of costs and benefits'' (citing Aqua Slide, 569 \n     F.2d at 839)). Thus, ``Congress also plainly intended the EPA \n     to consider the economic impact of any actions taken by it \n     under . . . TSCA.'' Chemical Mfrs. Ass'n 899 F.2d at 348.\n       Even taking all of the EPA's figures as true, and \n     evaluating them in the light most favorable to the agency's \n     decision (non-discounted benefits, discounted costs, \n     analogous exposure estimates included), the agency's analysis \n     results in figures as high as $74 million per life saved. For \n     example, the EPA states that its ban of asbestos pipe will \n     save three lives over the next thirteen years, at a cost of \n     $128-227 million ($43-76 million per life saved), depending \n     upon the price of substitutes; that it ban of asbestos \n     shingles will cost $23-34 million to save 0.32 statistical \n     lives ($72-106 million per life saved); that its ban of \n     asbestos coatings will cost $46-181 million to save 3.33 \n     lives ($14-54 million per life saved); and that its ban of \n     asbestos paper products will save 0.60 lives at a cost of $4-\n     5 million ($7-8 million per life saved). See Fed. Reg. at \n     29,484-85. Were the analogous exposure estimates not \n     included, the cancer risks from substitutes such as ductile \n     iron pipe factored in, and the benefits of the ban \n     appropriately discounted from the time of the manifestation \n     of an injury rather than the time of exposure, the costs \n     would shift even more sharply against the EPA's position.\n       While we do not sit as a regulatory agency that must make \n     the difficult decision as to what an appropriate expenditure \n     is to prevent someone from incurring the risk of an asbestos-\n     related death, we do note that the EPA, in its zeal to ban \n     any and all asbestos products, basically ignored the cost \n     side of the TSCA equation. The EPA would have this court \n     believe that Congress, when it enacted its requirement that \n     the EPA consider the economic impacts of its regulations, \n     thought that spending $200-300 million to save approximately \n     seven lives (approximately $30-40 million per life) over \n     thirteen years is reasonable.\n       As we stated in the OSHA context, until an agency ``can \n     provide substantial evidence that the benefits to be achieved \n     by [a regulation] bear a reasonable relationship to the costs \n     imposed by the reduction, it cannot show that the standard is \n     reasonably necessary to provide safe or healthful \n     workplaces.'' American Petroleum Inst., 581 F.2d at 504. \n     Although the OSHA statute differs in major respects from \n     TSCA, the statute does require substantial evidence to \n     support the EPA's contentions that its regulations both have \n     a reasonable basis and are the least burdensome means to a \n     reasonably safe workplace.\n       The EPA's willingness to argue that spending $23.7 million \n     to save less than one-third of a life reveals that its \n     economic review of its regulations, as required by TSCA, was \n     meaningless. As the petitioners' brief and our review of EPA \n     caselaw reveals, such high costs are rarely, if ever, used to \n     support a safety regulation. If we were to allow such \n     cavalier treatment of the EPA's duty to consider the economic \n     effects of its decisions, we would have to excise entire \n     sections and phrases from the language of TSCA. Because we \n     are judges, not surgeons, we decline to do so.\\23\\\n\n                                   V\n\n  Substantial Evidence Regarding Least Burdensome, Adequate Regulation\n\n       TSCA provides that a reviewing court ``shall hold unlawful \n     and set aside'' a final rule promulgated under section 6(a) \n     ``if the court finds that the rule is not supported by \n     substantial evidence in the rulemaking record . . . taken as \n     a whole.'' 15 U.S.C. Sec. 2618(c)(1)(B)(i). The substantial \n     evidence standard ``afford[s] a considerably more generous \n     judicial review'' than the arbitrary or capricious test, \n     Abbott Laboratories, 387 U.S. at 143, 87 S.Ct. at 1513, and \n     ``imposes a considerable burden on the agency and limits its \n     discretion in arriving at a factual predicate.'' Mobil Oil \n     Corp. v. FPC, 483 F.2d 1238, 1258 (D.C.Cir.1973).\n       [34] We have declared that the EPA must articulate an \n     ``understandable basis'' to support its TSCA action with \n     respect to each substance or application of the substance \n     banned. Chemical Mfrs. Ass'n, 899 F.2d at 357. To make a \n     finding of unreasonable risk based upon this assessment, the \n     ``EPA must balance the probability that harm will occur from \n     the activities against the effects of the proposed regulatory \n     action on the availability to society of the benefits of \n     asbestos.'' 54 Fed.Reg. at 29, 467. With these edicts in \n     mind, we now examine each product against the TSCA \n     criteria.\\24\\\n                                   A\n\n                           Friction Products\n\n       [35] We begin our analysis with the EPA's ban of friction \n     products, which constitutes the lion's share of the proposed \n     benefits of the asbestos regulation--nearly three-fourths of \n     the anticipated asbestos deaths. The friction products in \n     question, although primarily made up of drum and disk brakes, \n     also include brake blocks and other friction products.\n       Workers are exposed to asbestos during the manufacture, \n     use, repair, and disposal of these products. The EPA banned \n     most of these products with a stage 2 ban, which would \n     require companies to cease manufacturing or importing the \n     products by August 25, 1993, with distribution to end one \n     year later. The final stage 3 ban would ban any remaining \n     friction products on August 26, 1996, with distribution again \n     ceasing one year later. See id. at 29,461-62.\n       We note that of all the asbestos bans, the EPA did the most \n     impressive job in this area, both in conducting its studies \n     and in supporting its contention that banning asbestos \n     products would save over 102 discounted lives. Id. at 29,485. \n     Furthermore, the EPA demonstrates that the population \n     exposure to asbestos in this area is great, while the \n     estimated cost of the measure is low, at least in comparison \n     to the cost-per-life of its other bans. Were the petitioners \n     only questioning the EPA's decision to ban friction products \n     based upon disputing these figures, we would be tempted to \n     uphold the EPA, even in the fact of petitioner's arguments \n     that workplace exposure to friction product asbestos could be \n     decreased by as much as ninety percent using stricter \n     workplace controls and in light of studies supporting the \n     conclusion that some forms of asbestos present less danger. \n     Decisions such as these are better left to the agency's \n     expertise.\n       Such expertise, however, is not a universal talisman \n     affording the EPA unbridled latitude to act as it chooses \n     under TSCA. What we cannot ignore is that the EPA failed to \n     study the effect of non-asbestos brakes on automotive safety, \n     despite credible evidence that non-asbestos brakes could \n     increase significantly the number of highway fatalities, and \n     that the EPA failed to evaluate the toxicity of likely brake \n     substitutes. As we already mentioned, the EPA, in its zeal to \n     ban asbestos, cannot overlook, with only cursory study, \n     credible contentions that substitute products actually might \n     increase fatalities.\n       The EPA commissioned an American Society of Mechanical \n     Engineers (ASME) study that concluded that while more \n     research was needed, it appeared that many of the proposed \n     substitutes for friction products are not, and will not soon \n     be available, especially in the replacement brake market, and \n     that the substitutes may or may not assure safety.\\25\\ \n     Despite this credible record evidence, by a study \n     specifically commissioned by the EPA, that substitute \n     products actually might cause more deaths than those asbestos \n     deaths predicted by the EPA, the agency did not evaluate the \n     dangers posed by the substitutes, including cancer deaths \n     from the others fibers used and highway deaths occasioned by \n     less effective, non-asbestos brakes. This failure to examine \n     the likely consequence of the EPA's regulation renders the \n     ban of asbestos friction products unreasonable.\n       This failure would be of little moment, were the relevant \n     market confined to original equipment disk brakes and pads. \n     For these original equipment brakes, it appears that \n     manufacturers already have developed safe substitutes for \n     asbestos, considering that nearly all new vehicles come with \n     non-asbestos disk brakes, with non-asbestos drum brakes \n     apparently soon to follow. See id. at 29,493. The ASME Report \n     concluded that ``at the present rate of technological \n     progress, most new passenger cars could be equipped with \n     totally non-asbestos frictional systems by 1991, and most \n     light trucks and heavy trucks with S-cam brakes, by 1992.'' \n     See id. at 29,494.\n       Although the petitioners dispute the evidence, we find \n     particularly telling the fact that manufacturers already are \n     producing most vehicles with newly designed, non-asbestos \n     brakes. The ban of asbestos brakes for these uses here \n     appears reasonable and, had the EPA taken the proper steps to \n     consider and reject the less burdensome alternatives, we \n     might find the ban of these products supported by substantial \n     evidence.\n       With respect to the aftermarket replacement market, \n     however, the EPA's failure to consider the safety \n     ramifications of its decisions is problematic. Original \n     equipment, non-asbestos brakes are designed from the start to \n     work without the superior insulating properties of asbestos. \n     The replacement market brakes, on the other hand, were \n     designed with asbestos, rather than substitutes, in mind. As \n     the EPA itself states, ``[c]ommenters generally agreed that \n     it is easier to develop replace\n      ment asbestos-free friction materials for use in vehicles \n     that are intentionally designed to use such materials that \n     it is to develop asbestos-free friction materials for use \n     as after-market replacement products in vehicles currently \n     in use that have brake systems designed to use asbestos.'' \n     Id. Because of these difficulties, the EPA decided to use \n     a stage 3 ban for replacement brakes.\n       Despite acknowledging the difficulty of retrofitting \n     current asbestos brakes, however, the EPA decided that the \n     problem with non-asbestos brakes was not that they are \n     inferior, but that they are less safe because the government \n     does not regulate them. \n\n[[Page S 10204]]\n     Based upon this conclusion, the EPA decided that is need not consider \n     the safety of alternative brakes because, after consultation \n     with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, \n     (NNTSA), the EPA concluded that regulation of non-asbestos \n     brakes soon would be forthcoming. Id.\n       This determination is insufficient to discharge the EPA's \n     duties under TSCA. The EPA failed to settle whether \n     alternative brakes will be as safe as current brakes, even \n     though, by its own admission, the ``EPA also acknowledges \n     that a ban on asbestos in the brake friction product \n     categories may increase the uncertainty about brake \n     performance.'' Id. at 29,495. The EPA contends that it can \n     rely upon NHTSA to discharge its regulatory burdens, but it \n     ignores the fact that the problem with non-asbestos brakes \n     may be technical, rather than regulatory, in nature.\n       Future consideration by the NHTSA cannot support a present \n     ban by the EPA when the record contains conflicting and non-\n     conclusive evidence regarding the safety of non-asbestos \n     brake replacement parts. After being presented with credible \n     evidence ``that a ban on asbestos use in the aftermarket for \n     brake systems designed for asbestos friction products will \n     compromise the performance of braking systems designed for \n     asbestos brakes,'' id. at 29,494, the EPA under TSCA had to \n     consider whether its proposed ban not only was reasonable, \n     but also whether the increased deaths caused by less \n     efficient brakes made the ban of asbestos in the replacement \n     brake market unreasonable.\n       In short, while it is apparent that non-asbestos brake \n     products either are available or soon will be available on \n     new vehicles, there is no evidence indicating that forcing \n     consumers to replace their asbestos brakes with new non-\n     asbestos brakes as they wear out on their present vehicles \n     will decrease fatalities or that such a ban will produce \n     other benefits that outweigh its costs. Furthermore, many of \n     the EPA's own witnesses conceded on cross-examination that \n     the non-asbestos fibrous substitutes also pose a cancer risk \n     upon inhalation, yet the EPA failed to examine in more than a \n     cursory fashion the toxicity of these alternatives. Under \n     these circumstances, the EPA has failed to support its ban \n     with the substantial evidence needed to provide it with a \n     reasonable basis.\n       Finally, as we already have noted, the structure of TSCA \n     requires the EPA to consider, and reject, the less burdensome \n     alternatives in the TSCA hierarchy before it can invoke its \n     power to ban a product completely. It may well be true, as \n     the EPA contends, that workplace controls are insufficient \n     measures under TSCA and that only a ban will discharge the \n     EPA's TSCA-imposed duty to seek the safest, reasonable \n     environment. The EPA's failure to consider the regulatory \n     alternatives, however, cannot be substantiated by conclusory \n     statements that regulation would be insufficient. See Texas \n     Indep. Ginners Ass'n v. Marshall, 630 F.2d 398, 411-12 (5th \n     Cir. 1980); Aqua Slide, 569 F.2d at 843. We thus concede that \n     while the EPA may have presented sufficient evidence to \n     underpin the dangers of asbestos brakes, its failure to \n     consider whether the ban is the least burdensome alternative, \n     and its refusal to consider the toxicity and danger of \n     substitute brake products, in regard to both highway and \n     workplace safety, deprived its regulation of the reasonable \n     basis required by TSCA.\n\n\n                                   b\n\n                     Asbestos-Cement Pipe Products\n\n       [36]  The EPA's analysis supporting its ban of asbestos-\n     cement (``A/C'') pipe is more troublesome than its action in \n     regard to friction products. Asbestos pipe primarily is used \n     to convey water in mains, sewage under pressure, and \n     materials in various industrial process lines. Unlike most \n     uses of asbestos, asbestos pipe is valued primarily for its \n     strength and resistance to corrosion, rather than for its \n     heat-resistant qualities. The EPA imposed a stage 3 ban on \n     asbestos pipe.  54 Fed. Reg. at 29,462.\n       Petitioners question EPA's cost/benefit balancing, noting \n     that by the EPA's own predictions, the ban of asbestos pipe \n     will save only 3-4 discounted lives, at a cost ranging from \n     $128-227 million ($43-76 million per life saved), depending \n     upon the price of substitutes. Id. at 29,484. Furthermore, \n     much of EPA's data regarding this product and others depends \n     upon data received from exposures observed during activities \n     similar to the ones to be regulated--the ``analogous \n     exposure'' analysis that the EPA adopted subsequent to the \n     public comment period, which thus was not subjected to cross-\n     examination or other critical testing.\\26\\ Finally, the \n     petitioners protest that the EPA acted unreasonably because \n     the most likely substitutes for the asbestos pipe, PVC and \n     ductile iron pipe, also contain known carcinogens.\n       Once again we are troubled by the EPA's methodology and its \n     evaluation of the substitute products. Many of the objections \n     raised by the asbestos cement pipe producers are general \n     protests about the EPA's studies and other similar \n     complaints. We will not disturb such agency inquiries, as it \n     is not our role to delve into matters better left for agency \n     expertise. We do, however, examine the EPA's methodology in \n     places to determine whether it has presented substantial \n     evidence to support its regulation.\n       As with friction products, the EPA refused to assess the \n     risks of substitutes to asbestos pipe. Id. at 29,497-98. \n     Unlike non-asbestos brakes, which the EPA contends are safe, \n     the EPA here admits that vinyl chloride, used in PVC, is a \n     human carcinogen that is especially potent during the \n     manufacture of PVC pipe. As for the EPA's defense of the \n     ductile iron pipe substitute, the EPA also acknowledges \n     evidence that it will cause cancer deaths but rejects these \n     deaths as overestimated, even though it can present no more \n     support for this assumption than its own ipse dixit.\n       The EPA presented several plausible, albeit untested, \n     reasons why PVC and ductile iron pipe might be less of a \n     health risk than asbestos pipe. It did not, however, actually \n     evaluate the health risk flowing from these substitute \n     products, even though the\n      ``EPA acknowledges that the individual lifetime cancer risk \n     associated with the production of PVC may be equivalent to \n     that associated with the production of A/C pipe.'' Id. at \n     29,497. The agency concedes that ``[t]he population cancer \n     risk for the production of ductile iron pipe could be \n     comparable to the population cancer risk for production of \n     A/C pipe.'' Id.\n       It was insufficient for the EPA to conclude that while its \n     data showed that ``the number of cancer cases associated with \n     production of equivalent amounts of ductile iron pipe and A/C \n     pipe `may be similar,' the estimate of cancer risk for \n     ductile iron pipe `is most likely an overestimate,' '' see 54 \n     Fed.Reg. at 29,498, unless the agency can present something \n     more concrete than its own speculation to refute these \n     earlier iron pipe cancer studies. Musings and conjecture are \n     ``not the stuff of which substantial evidence is made,'' Aqua \n     Slide, 569 F.2d at 843, and ``[u]narticulated reliance on \n     Commission `experience' may satisfy an `arbitrary, \n     capricious' standard of review, but it does not add one jot \n     to the record evidence.'' Id. at 841-42 (citations omitted). \n     ``While expert opinion deserves to be heeded, it must be \n     based on more than casual observation and speculation, \n     particularly where a risk of fatal injury is being \n     evaluated.'' Id. These concerns are of special note where the \n     increased carcinogen risk occasioned by the EPA's proposed \n     substitutes is both credible and known.\n       This conclusion only is strengthened when we consider the \n     EPA's failure to analyze the health risks of PVC pipe, the \n     most likely substitute for asbestos pipe, which the EPA \n     concedes poses a cancer risk similar to that presented by \n     asbestos pipe. The failure of the EPA to make a record \n     finding on the risks of PVC pipe is particularly \n     inexplicable, as the EPA already is studying increasing the \n     stringency of PVC regulation in separate rulemaking \n     proceedings, an action that one of the very intervenors in \n     the instant case has been urging for years. See NRDC v. EPA, \n     824 F.2d 1146, 1148-49 (D.C.Cir.1987) (en banc).\n       The EPA, in these separate proceedings, has estimated the \n     cancer risk from PVC\n      plants to be as high as twenty deaths per year, a death rate \n     that stringent controls might be able to reduce to one per \n     year, see id. at 1149, far in excess of the fractions of a \n     life that the asbestos pipe ban may save each year, by the \n     EPA's own calculations. Considering that the EPA concedes \n     that there is no evidence showing that ingested, as \n     opposed to inhaled, asbestos is a health risk, while the \n     EPA's own studies show that ingested vinyl chloride is a \n     significant cancer risk that could cause up to 260 cancer \n     deaths over the next thirteen years, see id.; 54 Fed.Reg. \n     at 29, 498, the EPA's failure to consider the risks of \n     substitute products in the asbestos pipe area is \n     particularly troublesome. The agency cannot simply choose \n     to note the similar cancer risks of asbestos and iron pipe \n     and then reject the data underpinning the iron and PVC \n     pipe without more than its own conclusory statements.\n       We also express concern with the EPA's cavalier attitude \n     toward the use of its own data. The asbestos pipe industry \n     argues that the exposure times the EPA used to calculate its \n     figures are much higher than experience would warrant, a \n     contention that the EPA now basically concedes. Rather than \n     recalculate its figures, however, based upon the best data \n     available to it, the EPA merely responds that while the one \n     figure may be too high, it undoubtedly underestimated the \n     exposure levels, because contractors seldom comply with OSHA \n     regulations. In the words of its brief, ``[t]hus, EPA \n     concluded that its estimates contain both over and \n     underestimates, but nevertheless represented a reasonable \n     picture of aggregate exposure.''\n       The EPA is required to support its analysis with \n     substantial evidence under TSCA. When one figure is \n     challenged, it cannot back up its position by changing an \n     unrelated figure to yield the same result. Allowing such \n     behavior would require us only to focus on the final numbers \n     provided by an agency, and to ignore how it arrives at that \n     number. Because a conclusion is no better than the \n     methodology used to reach it, such a result cannot survive \n     the substantial evidence test.\n       Finally, we once again note that the EPA failed to \n     discharge its TSCA-mandated burden that it consider and \n     reject less burdensome alternatives before it impose a more \n     burdensome alternative such as a complete ban. The EPA \n     instead jumped immediately to the ban provision, without \n     calculating whether a less burdensome alternative might \n     accomplish TSCA's goals. See 54 Fed. Reg. at 29,489. We \n     therefore conclude that the EPA failed to present substantial \n     evidence to support its ban of asbestos pipe.\n\n\n                                   c\n\n             Gaskets, Roofing, Shingles, and Paper Products\n\n       We here deal with the remaining products affected by the \n     EPA ban. Petitioners challenge the basis for the EPA's \n     finding that \n\n[[Page S 10205]]\n     beater-add and sheet gaskets, primarily used in automotive parts, \n     should be banned. The agency estimated its ban would save \n     thirty-two lives over a thirteen-year time span, at an \n     overall cost of $207-263 million ($6-8 million per life \n     saved). Id. at 29,484.\n       We have little to add in this area, beyond our general \n     discussion and comments on other products apart from a brief \n     highlight of the EPA's use of analogous exposure data to \n     support its gasket ban. For these products, the analogous \n     exposure estimate constituted almost eighty percent of the \n     anticipated total benefits--a proportion so large that the \n     EPA's duty to give interested parties notice that it intended \n     to use analogous exposure estimate was particularly \n     acute.\\27\\ Considering some of the EPA's support for its \n     analogous exposure estimates--such as its assumption that \n     none of the same workers who install beater-add and sheet \n     gaskets ever is involved in repairing or disposing of them, \n     and the unexplained discrepancy between its present \n     conclusion that over 50,000 workers are involved in this area \n     and its 1984 estimate that only 768 workers are in\n      volved in ``gasket removal and installation,'' see 51 \n     Fed.Reg. 22,612, 22,665 (1986)--the petitioners' complaint \n     that they never were afforded the opportunity to comment \n     publicly upon these figures, or to cross-examine any EPA \n     witnesses regarding them, is particularly telling.\n       [37] The EPA also banned roof coatings, roof shingles, non-\n     roof coatings, and asbestos paper products. Again, we have \n     little to add beyond our discussions already concluded, \n     especially regarding TSCA's requirement that the EPA always \n     choose the least burdensome alternative, whether it be \n     workplace regulation, labeling, or only a partial ban. We \n     note, however, that in those cases in which a complete ban \n     would save less than one statistical life, such as those \n     affecting asbestos paper products and certain roofing \n     materials, the EPA has a particular need to examine the less \n     burdensome alternatives to a complete ban.\n       Where appropriate, the EPA should consider our preceding \n     discussion as applicable to their bans of these products. By \n     following the dictates of Chemical Mfrs. Ass'n, 899 F.2d at \n     359, that the quantities of the regulated chemical entering \n     into the environment be ``substantial,'' and that the human \n     exposure to the chemical also must be ``substantial'' or \n     ``significant,'' as well as our concerns expressed in this \n     opinion, the EPA should be able to determine the proper \n     procedures to follow on its reconsideration of its rule and \n     present the cogent explanation of its actions as required \n     under Chemical Manufacturers Association.\n\n\n                                   D\n\n        Ban of Products Not Being Produced in the United States\n\n       Petitioners also contend that the EPA overstepped TSCA's \n     bounds by seeking to ban products that once were, but no \n     longer are, being produced in the United States. We find \n     little merit to this claim, considering that sections 5 and 6 \n     of TSCA allow the EPA to ban a product ``that presents or\n      will present'' a significant risk. (Emphasis added.)\n       Although petitioners correctly point out that the value of \n     a product not being produced is not zero, as it may find some \n     future use, and that the EPA here has banned items where the \n     estimated risk is zero, this was not error on the part of the \n     EPA. The numbers appear to favor petitioners only because \n     even products with known high risks temporarily show no risk \n     because they are not part of this country's present stream of \n     commerce. This would soon change if the produce returned, \n     which is precisely what the EPA is trying to avoid.\n       Should some unlikely future use arise for these products, \n     the manufacturers and importers have access to the waiver \n     provision established by the EPA for just these \n     contingencies. Under such circumstances, we will not disturb \n     the agency's decision to ban products that no longer are \n     being produced in or imported into the United States.\n       [38] Similarly, we also decide that the EPA properly can \n     attempt to promulgate a ``clean up'' ban under TSCA, \n     providing it takes the proper steps in doing so. A clean-up \n     ban, like the asbestos ban in this case, seeks to ban all \n     uses of a certain toxic substance, including unknown, future \n     uses of the substance. Although there is some merit to \n     petitioners' argument that the EPA cannot possibly evaluate \n     the costs and benefits of banning unknown, uninvented \n     products, we hold that the nebulousness of these future \n     products, combined with TSCA's language authorizing the EPA \n     to ban products that ``will'' create a public risk, allows \n     the EPA to ban future uses of asbestos even in products not \n     yet on the market.\n\n\n                                   E\n\n                        Fundamental EPA Choices\n\n       Finally, we note that there are many other issues raised by \n     petitioners, such as the EPA's decision to treat all types of \n     asbestos the same, its conclusion that various lengths of \n     fibers present similar toxic risks, and its decision that \n     asbestos\n      presents similar risks even in different industries. See \n     generally 54 Fed.Reg. at 29,470-71 (detailing differences \n     in potency of chrysotile and other forms of asbestos and \n     toxicity of various fiber lengths). We mention these \n     concerns now only to reject them.\n       Of these, any many similar points, the petitioners merely \n     seek to have us reevaluate the EPA's initial evaluation of \n     the evidence. While we can, and in this opinion do, question \n     the agency's reliance upon flawed methodology and its failure \n     to consider factors and alternatives that TSCA explicitly \n     requires it to consider, we do not sit as a regulatory agency \n     ourselves. Decisions such as the EPA's decision to treat \n     various types of asbestos as presenting similar health risks \n     properly are better left for agency determination and, while \n     the EPA is free to reconsider its data should it so choose \n     when it revisits this area, it also is free to adopt similar \n     reasoning in the future.\n\n                                   VI\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       In summary, of most concern to us is that the EPA has \n     failed to implement the dictates of TSCA and the prior \n     decisions of this and other courts that, before it impose a \n     ban on a product, it first evaluate and then reject the less \n     burdensome alternatives laid out for it by Congress. While \n     the EPA spend much time and care crafting its asbestos \n     regulation, its explicit failure to consider the alternatives \n     required of it by Congress deprived its final rule of the \n     reasonable basis it needed to survive judicial scrutiny.\n       Furthermore, the EPA's adoption of the analogous exposure \n     estimates during the final weeks of its rulemaking process, \n     after public comment was concluded, rather than during the \n     ten years during which it was considering the asbestos ban, \n     was unreasonable and deprived the petitioners of the notice \n     that they required in order to present their own evidence on \n     the validity of the estimates and its data bases. By \n     depriving the petitioners of their right to\n      cross-examine EPA witnesses on methodology and data used to \n     support as much as eighty percent of the proposed benefits \n     in some areas, the EPA also violated the dictates of TSCA.\n       Finally, the EPA failed to provide a reasonable basis for \n     the purported benefits of its proposed rule by refusing to \n     evaluate the toxicity of likely substitute products that will \n     be used to replace asbestos goods. While the EPA does not \n     have the duty under TSCA of affirmatively seeking out and \n     testing all possible substitutes, when an interested party \n     comes forward with credible evidence that the planned \n     substitutes present a significant, or even greater, toxic \n     risk than the substance in question, the agency must make a \n     formal finding on the record that its proposed action still \n     is both reasonable and warranted under TSCA.\n       We regret that this matter must continue to take up the \n     valuable time of the agency, parties and undoubtedly, future \n     courts. The requirements of TSCA, however, are plain, and the \n     EPA cannot deviate from them to reach its desired result. We \n     therefore GRANT the petition for review, VACATE the EPA's \n     proposed regulation, and REMAND to the EPA for further \n     proceedings in light of this opinion.\\28\\\n       On Petition for Review of a Rule of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency.\n       ON MOTION FOR CLARIFICATION\n       Before BROWN, SMITH, and WIENER, Circuit Judges.\n       PER CURIAM:\n       [39] Respondents, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \n     and William K. Reilly, seek a clarification of the status of \n     the phase 1, or stage 1, provisions in the challenged rule, \n     which provisions ban, effective August 27, 1990, the \n     manufacture, importation, and processing of asbestos \n     containing corrugated and flat sheet, asbestos clothing, \n     flooring felt, pipeline wrap, roofing felt, and vinyl/\n     asbestos floor tile, and any new uses of asbestos. See 40 \n     C.F.R. Sec. Sec. 763.165(a)-.167(a). The rule also requires \n     labeling of phase 1 products after\n      August 27, 1990, see id. Sec. 763.171(a), and prohibits the \n     distribution in commerce of such products after August 27, \n     1992, see id. Sec. 763.169(a). See Corrosion Proof \n     Fittings v. EPA, 947 F.2d 1201, 1208 & n. 2 (5th Cir. \n     1991).\n       Respondents assert that the clarification is needed \n     because, in part V.D of our opinion, id. at 1228-29, we have \n     held that the EPA may ``ban products that once were, but no \n     longer are, being produced in the United States.'' Thus, the \n     motion seeks clarification of the status of any products that \n     still were being manufactured, imported, or processed on July \n     12, 1989, which is the date on which the final rule was \n     issued, see 54 Fed. Reg. 29,459 (1989), but which no longer \n     were being manufactured, imported, or processed, as a result \n     of the phase 1 ban, on the date of our opinion, which is \n     October 18, 1991.\n       The motion for clarification is GRANTED. The holding in \n     part V.D of our opinion applies only to products that were \n     not being manufactured, imported, or processed on July 12, \n     1989, the date of the rule's promulgation. To the extent, if \n     any, that there is doubt as to whether particular products \n     are in that category, the EPA may resolve the factual dispute \n     on remand.\n       1. OSHA began to regulate asbestos in the workplace in \n     1971. At that time, the permissible exposure limit was 12 \n     fibers per cubic centimeter (f/cc), which OSHA lowered \n     several times until today it stands at 0.2 f/cc. OSHA \n     currently is considering lowering the limit to 0.1 f/cc, \n     following a challenge to the regulation in Building & Constr. \n     Trades Dep't v. Brock, 838 F.2d 1258, 1267-69 (D.C. Cir. \n     1988). The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) since \n     1976 has limited mine worker asbestos exposure to 2 f/cc. See \n     30 C.F.R. Sec. 71.702 (1990).\n       The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has banned \n     consumer patching compounds containing respirable asbestos, \n     see 16 C.F.R. Sec. Sec. 1304-05 (1990), and also requires \n     labeling for other products containing respirable asbestos. \n     Similarly, the Food and \n\n[[Page S 10206]]\n     Drug Administration has banned general-use garments containing asbestos \n     unless used for protection against fire. See 16 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 1500.17 (1990).\n       2. The main products covered by each ban stage are as \n     follows:\n       (1) Stage 1: August 27, 1990: ban on asbestos-containing \n     floor materials, clothing, roofing felt, corrugated and flat \n     sheet materials, pipeline wrap, and new asbestos uses;\n       (2) Stage 2: August 25, 1993: ban on asbestos-containing \n     ``friction products'' and certain automotive products or \n     uses;\n       (3) Stage 3: August 26, 1996: ban on other asbestos-\n     containing automotive products or uses, asbestos-containing \n     building materials including non-roof and roof coatings, and \n     asbestos cement shingles.\n       See 54 Fed. Reg. at 29,461-62.\n       3. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 531 n. 13, 99 S.Ct. \n     1861, 1870 n. 13, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). While it is true \n     that the joint brief of petitioners Centrale des Syndicats \n     Democratiques, Confederation des Syndicats Nationaux, and \n     United Steel Workers of America (Canada) (collectively along \n     with petitioner Cassiar Mining Corp. (Cassiar), the \n     ``Canadian petitioners'') also deal with some of the same \n     issues raised by amici, we hold in part II.B, infra, that \n     these petitioners lack standing. The arguments of amici \n     cannot be bootstrapped into this case based upon the \n     arguments of petitioners who themselves lack standing.\n       4. The EPA also seeks to bar the brief of Grinnell College. \n     That brief, however, presents arguments directly related to \n     the arguments raised by the parties seeking to prevent the \n     ban of asbestos shingles.\n       5.

Hannah, 459 \n     F.2d 1183, 1190-91 (D.C.Cir. 1972), in which a foreign vendor \n     was able to borrow its domestric vendee's standing rights to \n     pursue its own claim. That case, however, involved the APA, \n     which, unlike TSCA, does not confine itself to matters \n     concerning national economic interests.\n       8. The Canadian petitioners also allege that United States \n     treaty obligations, such as the provisions of the General \n     Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), award them the right \n     to protest the EPA's actions. GATT requires nations to \n     indicate that their environmental decisions meet \n     international standards, thus preventing countries from using \n     arbitrary environmental rulings as de facto trade barriers. \n     GATT, however, establishes trade dispute procedures of its \n     own. These Canadian parties therefore have no standing here \n     to challenge the EPA's decision.\n       9. These complaints include the failure of the EPA to \n     cross-examine petitioners' witnesses, which it was not \n     required to do, and the EPA's decision not to designate an \n     AIJ, which also was within its discretion under 40 C.F.R. \n     Sec. Sec. 750.7 and 750.8 (1990). Similarly, the EPA's \n     failure to issue subpoenas was of little moment, as the \n     petitioners in fact suffered no injury from the lack of \n     subpoenas. See id. Sec. 750.5.\n       We also note that while an independent panel of experts \n     often might be needed, in this case the EPA was not required \n     to assemble such a panel on asbestos disease risks, as it \n     already possessed an abundance of information on the subject, \n     including a report by the members of the Ontario Royal \n     Commission, a study often cited by the petitioners \n     themselves. Considering the number of studies available, the \n     EPA was not required to assemble its own panel to duplicate \n     them, except to fill in any gaps.\n       10. According to the EPA, if the analogous exposure \n     estimates were not included, the benefits of the rule would \n     decrease from 168 to 120 deaths avoided, discounted at 3%. 54 \n     Fed. Reg. at 29,469, 29,485. The analogous exposure \n     estimates, adopted after hearings were concluded, thus \n     increase the purported benefits of the rule by more than one-\n     third.\n       11. For some of the products, such as the beater-add and \n     sheet gaskets, the analogous exposure analysis completely \n     altered the EPA's calculus and multiplied four- or five-fold \n     the anticipated benefits of the proposed regulation. This was \n     a change sufficient to make the proceedings unfair to the \n     petitioners and was of sufficient importance that the EPA's \n     failure to afford any cross-examination on this issue was an \n     abuse of discretion.\n       12. The term ``rulemaking record'' means (A) the rule being \n     reviewed; (B) all commentary received in response to the \n     (EPA) Administrator's notice of proposed rulemaking, and the \n     Administrator's own published statement of the effects of \n     exposure of the substance on health and the environment, the \n     benefits of the substance for various uses and the \n     availability of substitutes for such uses, and ``the \n     reasonably ascertainable economic consequences of the rule'' \n     on the national economy, small business, technological \n     innovation, the environment, and public health; (C) \n     transcripts of hearings on promulgation of the rule; (D) \n     written submissions of interested parties; and (E) any other \n     information the Administrator deems relevant. See 15 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2618(a)(3) (referring to Sec. Sec. 2604(f) and \n     2605(c)(1) in regard to component (B) above).\n       13. The EPA cites Superior Oil Co., 563 F.2d at 199, an APA \n     case, for the proposition that in informal rulemaking, the \n     arbitrary and capricious standard and the substantial \n     evidence standard ``tend to converge.'' While it certainly is \n     true that the requirement of substantial evidence within \n     formal rulemaking is more strenuous, we acknowledged in \n     Superior Oil that when comparing arbitrary and capricious to \n     substantial evidence, ``[i]t is generally accepted that the \n     latter standard allows for `a considerably more generous \n     judicial review' than does the former.'' Id. (quoting Abbott \n     Laboratories, 387 U.S. at 143, 87 S.Ct. at 1512). Considering \n     that Congress specifically rejected the arbitrary and \n     capricious standard in the TSCA context, we will not act now \n     to read that same standard back in by holding that the two \n     standards are in fact one and the same.\n       14. Cf. Southland Mower Co. v. CPSC, 619 F.2d 499, 510 (5th \n     Cir. 1980) (``It must be remembered that `[t]he statutory \n     term ``unreasonable risk'' presupposes that a real, and not a \n     speculative, risk be found to exist and that the Commission \n     bear the burden of demonstrating the existence of such a risk \n     before proceeding to regulate.' '' (Citation omitted.)).\n       15. The statute provides, in order, the possible regulatory \n     schemes as follows:\n       (1) A requirement (A) prohibiting the manufacturing, \n     processing, or distribution in commerce of such substance or \n     mixture, or (B) limiting the amount of such substance or \n     mixture which may be manufactured, processed, or distributed \n     in commerce.\n       (2) A requirement--\n       (A) prohibiting the manufacture, processing, or \n     distribution in commerce of such substance or mixture for (i) \n     a particular use or (ii) a particular use in a concentration \n     in excess of a level specified by the Administrator in the \n     rule imposing the requirement, or\n       (B) limiting the amount of such substance or mixture which \n     may be manufactured, processed, or distributed in commerce \n     for (i) a particular use or (ii) a particular use in a \n     concentration in excess of a level specified by the \n     Administrator in the rule imposing the requirement.\n       (3) A requirement that such substance of mixture or any \n     article containing such substance or mixture be marked with \n     or accompanied by clear and adequate warnings and \n     instructions with respect to its use, distribution in \n     commerce, or disposal or with respect to any combination of \n     such activities. The form and content of such warnings and \n     instructions shall be prescribed by the Administrator.\n       (4) A requirement that manufacturers and processors of such \n     substance or mixture make and retain records of the processes \n     used to manufacture or process such substance or mixture and \n     monitor or conduct tests which are reasonable and necessary \n     to assure compliance with the requirements of any rule \n     applicable under this subsection.\n       (5) A requirement prohibiting or otherwise regulating any \n     manner or method of commercial use of such substance or \n     mixture.\n       (6) (A) A requirement prohibiting or otherwise \n     regulating any manner or method of disposal of such substance \n     or mixture, or of any article containing such substance or \n     mixture, by its manufacturer or processor or by any other \n     person who uses, or disposes of, it for commercial purposes.\n       (B) A requirement under subparagraph (A) may not require \n     any person to take any action which would be in violation of \n     any law or requirement of, or in effect for, a State or \n     political subdivision, and shall require each person subject \n     to it to notify each State and political subdivision in which \n     a required disposal may occur of such disposal.\n       (7) A requirement directing manufacturers or processors of \n     such substance or mixture (A) to give notice of such \n     unreasonable risk of injury to distributors in commerce of \n     such substance or mixture and, to the extent reasonably \n     ascertainable, to other persons in possession of such \n     substance or mixture or exposed to such substance or mixture, \n     (B) to give public notice of such risk of injury, and (C) to \n     replace or repurchase such substance or mixture as elected by \n     the person to which \n\n[[Page S 10207]]\n     the requirement is directed. 15 U.S.C. Sec. 2605(a). As is plain from \n     the order in which they are listed, options at the top of the \n     list are the most burdensome regulatory options, \n     progressively declining to the least burdensome option.\n       16. EPA argues that OSHA can only deal with workplace \n     exposures to asbestos and that the CPSC and MSHA cannot take \n     up the slack, as the CPSC can impose safety standards for \n     asbestos products based only upon the risk to consumers, and \n     MSHA can protect against exposure only in the mining and \n     milling process. These agencies leave unaddressed dangers \n     posed by asbestos exposure through product repair, \n     installation, wear and tear, and the like.\n       17. Although we, as always, rely mainly upon the language \n     of the statute to determine Congress's intent, we also note \n     that the legislative history of TSCA supports the notion of \n     TSCA's least-to-most-burdensome hierarchy. As the Senate \n     sponsor of the ``least burdensome'' requirement stated, \n     Congress did ``not want to give the Administrator unlimited \n     authority and let him say, `I will impose this control, if \n     there are other controls that are effective and are less \n     burdensome on the industry.' '' 122 Cong. Rec. 8295 (1976) \n     (statement of Sen. Cannon).\n       In addition, the EPA itself acknowledges this hierarchy \n     when it states in its brief that ``TSCA authorizes and \n     directs [the] EPA to impose that burden [of a total ban] if \n     the risks of a substance cannot be adequately addressed in \n     another way.'' (Emphasis added.) The EPA does not explain how \n     it can determine that the risks of a substance cannot be \n     addressed in another way if it refuses to make a finding that \n     the alternatives will not discharge the EPA's TSCA burden. It \n     cannot simply state that there is no level of zero risk \n     asbestos use and then impose the most burdensome alternative \n     on that sole basis.\n       We do not today determine what an appropriate period for \n     the EPA's calculations would be, as this is a matter better \n     left for agency discretion. See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n 463 \n     U.S. at 53, 103 S.Ct. at 2872. We do note, however, that the \n     choice of a thirteen-year period is so short as to make the \n     unquantified period so unreasonably large that any EPA \n     reliance upon it must be displaced.\n       Under the EPA's calculations, a twenty-year-old worker \n     entering employment today still would be at risk from \n     workplace dangers for more than thirty years after the EPA's \n     analysis period had ended. The true benefits of regulating \n     asbestos under such calculations remain unknown. The EPA \n     cannot choose to leave these benefits high and then use the \n     high unknown benefits as a major factor justifying EPA \n     action.\n       We also note that the EPA appears to place too great a \n     reliance upon the concept of population exposure. While a \n     high population exposure certainly is a factor that the EPA \n     must consider in making its calculations, the agency cannot \n     count such problems more than once. For example, in the case \n     of asbestos brake products, the EPA used factors such as risk \n     and exposure to calculate the probable harm of the brakes, \n     and then used, as an additional reason to ban the products, \n     he fact that the exposure levels were high. Considering that \n     calculations of the probable harm level, when reduced to \n     basics, simply are a calculation of population risk \n     multiplied by population exposure, the EPA's redundant use of \n     population exposure to justify its actions cannot stand.\n       3. Reasonable Basis.\n       In addition to showing that its regulation is the least \n     burdensome one necessary to protect the environment \n     adequately, the EPA also must show that it has a reasonable \n     basis for the regulation. 15 U.S.C. Sec. 2605(a). To some \n     extent, our inquiry in this area mirrors that used above, for \n     many of the methodological problems we have noted also \n     indicate that the EPA did not have a reasonable basis. We \n     here take the opportunity to highlight some areas of \n     additional concern.\n       18. Recently, in a different context, we observed the \n     important distinction between present and future injury. See \n     Willett v. Baxter Int'l, Inc., 929 F.2d 1094, 1099-1100 & n. \n     20 (5th Cir.1991).\n       19. We also note that the EPA chose to use a real discount \n     rate of 3%. Because historically the real rate of interest \n     has tended to vary between 2% and 4%, this figure was not \n     inaccurate.\n       The EPA also did not err by calculating that the price of \n     substitute goods is likely to decline at a rate of 1% per \n     year, resulting from economies of scale and increasing \n     manufacturing prowess. Because the EPA properly limited the \n     scope of these declines in its models so that the cost of \n     substitutes would not decline so far as to make the price of \n     the substitutes less than the cost of the asbestos they were \n     forced to replace, this was not an unreasonable real rate of \n     price decline to adopt.\n       20. We thus reject the arguments made by the Natural \n     Resources Defense Council, Inc., and the Environmental \n     Defense Fund, Inc., that the EPA's decision can be justified \n     because the EPA ``relied on many serious risks that were \n     understated or not quantified in the final rule,'' presented \n     figures in which the ``benefits are calculated only for a \n     limited time period,'' and undercounted the risks to the \n     general population from low-level asbestos exposure. In \n     addition, the intervenors argue that the EPA rejected using \n     upper estimates, see 54 Fed.Reg. at 29,473, and that this \n     court now should use the rejected limits as evidence to \n     support the EPA. They thus would have us reject the upper \n     limit concerns when they are not needed, but use them if \n     necessary.\n       We agree that these all are valid concerns that the EPA \n     legitimately should take into account when considering \n     regulatory action. What we disagree with, however, is the \n     manner in which the EPA incorporated these concerns. By not \n     using such concerns in its quantitive analysis, even where \n     doing so was not difficult, and reserving them as additional \n     factors to buttress the ban, the EPA improperly transformed \n     permissible considerations into determinative factors.\n       21. This is not to say that an interested party can \n     introduce just any evidence of a suspected carcinogen or \n     other toxin in its efforts to slow down a valid EPA \n     regulation. The agency may, within its discretion, consider \n     the probable merits of such dilatory tactics and act \n     appropriately. Cf. National Grain & Feed Ass'n, 866 F.2d at \n     734 (``[W]e do not require the agency to respond in detail to \n     every imaginable proposal for tighter standards.''). Where, \n     however, the health risks of substitutes, such as non-\n     asbestos brakes and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe, are both \n     plausible and known, the EPA must consider not only the \n     probable costs of continued use of the product it is \n     considering, but also the harm that\n      would follow from its regulation and increased use of an \n     alternate, harmful product.\n       22. We note that at least part of the EPA's arguments rest \n     on the assumption that regulation will not work because the \n     federal government will not adequately enforce any workplace \n     standards that the EPA might promulgate. This is an improper \n     assumption. The EPA should assume reasonable efforts by the \n     government to implement its own regulations. A governmental \n     agency cannot point to how poorly the government will \n     implement regulations as a reason to reject regulation. \n     Rather, the solution to poor enforcement of regulations is \n     better enforcement, not more burdensome alternative solutions \n     under TSCA.\n       23. See Environmental Defense Fund, 636 F.2d at 1275 n. 17 \n     (``[W]e must construe the statute `so that no provision will \n     be inoperative or superfluous' '' (quoting Motor & Equip. \n     M[rs. Ass'n v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1108 (D.C.Cir. 1979), \n     cert. denied, 446 U.S. 952, 100 S.Ct. 2917, 64 L.Ed.2d 808 \n     (1980))); see also Old Colony R.R. v. Commissioner, 284 U.S. \n     552, 560, 52 S.Ct. 211, 213, 76 L.Ed. 484 (1932) (in \n     interpreting statutory language, ``the plain, obvious and \n     rational meaning of a statute is to be preferred to any \n     curious, narrow, hidden sense'').\n       As the petitioners point out, the EPA regularly rejects, as \n     unjustified, regulations that would save more lives at less \n     cost. For example, over the next 13 years, we can expect more \n     than a dozen deaths from ingested toothpicks--a death toll \n     more than twice what the EPA predicts will flow from the \n     quarter-billion-dollar bans of asbestos pipe, shingles, and \n     roof coatings. See L. Budnick, Toothpick-Related Injuries in \n     the United States, 1979 Through 1982, 252 J. Am. Med. Ass'n, \n     Aug. 10, 1984, at 796 (study showing that toothpick-related \n     deaths average approximately one per year).\n       24. In large part, our analysis draws upon our general \n     discussion already concluded. Where necessary, however, we \n     develop specific themes more appropriately addressed in the \n     context of a specific product. The EPA on subsequent review \n     should consider these specific comments as applicable to its \n     procedures dealing with other products, where necessary. In \n     other words, by presenting a concern in the context of one \n     product, we do not mean to imply that it arises only in that \n     area.\n       25. One of the study's authors, Mr. Anderson, submitted \n     written testimony that the ``replacement/substitution of \n     asbestos-based with nonasbestos brake linings will produce \n     grave risks'' and that ``the expected increase of skid-\n     related highway accidents and resultant traffic deaths would \n     certainly be expected to overshadow any potential health-\n     related benefits of fiber substitution.'' The ASME report \n     itself concludes only that ``[i]f the eventual elimination of \n     all asbestos in friction products is to be accomplished, \n     additional future studies are required.'' This is an \n     insufficient basis upon which to support the EPA's judgment \n     that non-asbestos brakes are just as safe as asbestos brakes.\n       26. In this case, the EPA extrapolated data regarding \n     asbestos exposure during installation of asbestos pipe \n     products and estimated, by formula, how often workers would \n     be exposed to asbestos during repair and disposal.\n       27. The EPA estimates drop from 32.24 discounted lives to \n     6.68 discounted lives without the analogous exposure data.\n       28. Pursuant to the Internal Operating Procedures \n     accompanying Fifth Cir.Loc.R. 47, Judge Brown reserves the \n     right to file a separate opinion.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, we will be having the vote on the Glenn-\nChafee substitute after our respective conferences today at noon. I \nhave several wrap-up remarks I want to make before we do break at \n12:30.\n  The first thing I want to address is each day now we heard examples \nfrom proponents of Dole-Johnston about how silly some of these \nregulations are, and I agree with that. We have a lot that are very, \nvery silly. I believe we have bureaucratic excess. We need regulatory \nreform, and there are plenty of \n\n[[Page S 10208]]\nanecdotal stories to go around about what the problems are.\n  But I do not think we need to make our Government look any more \nstupid than it actually is, in some instances, and some of the things \nthat have been stated as silly regulations have proven, upon \ninvestigation, to be not true. We do not need reform based on half \ntruths and inaccuracies. Many of these stories have been shown to be \nnot true or are, at least, serious exaggerations.\n  Let me give an example. The other day I believe the Senator from Utah \nsaid that if a company spills 1 pint of antifreeze, the Federal \nGovernment requires it to notify the Coast Guard in Washington. That is \nsimply not true.\n  The main ingredient of antifreeze is ethylene glycol. It is covered \nby the Clean Air Act because of its high evaporation rate. According to \nEPA, you have to spill over 1,000 pounds of antifreeze to have to \nreport an ethylene glycol spill; 1,000 pounds comes out to about 140-\nsome gallons, 143 or 144 gallons, I believe. That would be almost three \nbarrels of ethylene glycol that would have to be spilled.\n  If you did spill that much, you are supposed to report it to the \nNational Response Center, which is staffed by Coast Guard personnel as \npart of a multiagency support for that Center. It is not just reporting \nto the Coast Guard. But the facts of the case are, it is 1,000 pounds \nand you report it to this Center, which is staffed by Coast Guard \npersonnel as part of a multiagency support force.\n  There was also a claim made the other day that Federal rules prevent \na farmer from diverting water from a river, even when the farm drains \nback into the same river, and this happened despite the involvement, I \nguess the story goes, even with the approval of the BLM, the Forest \nService, and the State government.\n  I never saw any substantiation for this story, but I do believe that \nwhile the water diversion problem may have existed during past \nadministrations when they allowed wetlands regulations to be divided \namong agencies with no coordination, that is not the case now. The \nClinton administration uses an interagency memorandum of understanding \nthat provides for coordination among agencies, that provides for \nfarmers and ranchers to interact with only one agency, and provides a \nsingle set of guidelines coming out from the Government. Once again, \nthere is a new approach to this being taken by this administration that \nmakes the anecdotal information at, very best, an exaggeration.\n  Another example of distortion was the claim that EPA insists on \nregulating asbestos even when it says that the number of annual deaths \nfrom toothpick ingestion exceeds the number of deaths from asbestos \nexposure. This proves to be just flat wrong.\n  According to EPA, a 1984 American Medical Association study showed \nthat toothpick-related deaths average about 1 per year for the whole \nNation out of our 260 million people, or close to that many. In 1988, \nEPA released a report that estimated that 4,280 people have died over \nthe past 130 years due to asbestos in the buildings in which they live. \nThat averages out to more than 30 deaths a year.\n  According to EPA, this is actually a low estimate because many more \nasbestos-related deaths can be expected for building workers, such as \ncustodians who are exposed at much higher levels. So here, again, we \nhave the facts that show that the proponents are distorting the truth \nand relying on inaccurate anecdotal stories to create a false image of \nour Government.\n  Sure, we want reform. Yes, Government needs to work better, but let \nus be reasonable. Let us use common sense. We do not need to make up \nstories about the Government working against the public interest and \nthen end up throwing out the baby with the bath water, as my colleague \nfrom California, Senator Feinstein, put it yesterday. Let us not \njeopardize public health and safety with scare stories of bureaucratic \nexcess. Too much is at stake to justify such callous disregard for the \npublic interest or the truth.\n  Mr. President, regulatory reform is one of the most important issues \nwe are going to take up this whole Congress. There is clearly a need to \nreform the regulatory process. We can all tell the horror stories of \nregulations gone awry, but before we rush to fix a problem with even \nworse medicine, let us take a hard look at what balanced, fair, and \neffective regulatory reform is all about.\n  I believe that regulatory reform must not only alleviate unnecessary \nburdens on businesses and on States and on local governments and on \nindividuals, but at the same time it must also ensure the Government's \nability to protect the health, safety, and environment of the American \npeople. That is my twofold test. That is a test of balance that is in \nthe best interest of all the people of this country.\n  Today, we have an opportunity to vote for true regulatory reform, \nreform that focuses on the biggest regulations, that makes agencies \nweigh the costs and benefits of their actions, that makes agencies take \na hard look at the regulations on the books. At the same time, we have \nthe opportunity to vote for reform that maintains the ability of \nagencies to do their jobs. That is commonsense reform, and the Glenn-\nChafee substitute to S. 343 is pure common sense.\n  Let me outline six major differences between the Glenn-Chafee \nsubstitute and the Dole-Johnston substitute. I hope those listening in \ntheir offices, those who may not have decided how they are going to \nvote yet after our noon break, will listen to these things and consider \nthem very, very carefully, because these are major reasons why I feel \nyou should support the Glenn-Chafee substitute.\n  First, the Glenn-Chafee substitute focuses on truly major rules. We \nrequire truly significant rules--it will be between 100 and 200 rules \nper year--to go through rigorous cost-benefit analyses and risk \nassessment requirements. Even though we voted to amend the threshold of \na major rule to $100 million in the Dole-Johnston substitute, we also \nvoted to require any rule that has a significant impact on small \nbusinesses to go through the rigorous cost-benefit analyses and risk \nassessment requirements.\n  Therefore, the Dole-Johnston substitute bill will still cover several \nhundred more rules than the Glenn-Chafee substitute and will tie up \nscarce agency resources with little added benefit. In fact, the \nestimate is this will run it up to somewhere between 500 and 800 \nregulations that would have to be reviewed per year. These are not \ncheap to do.\n  Alice Rivlin estimated that when it was at a $50 million estimate, \nthat we would require an additional $1.3 billion and 4,500 additional \nfull-time employees. Now this is run up several times over that, and I \nwould presume that $1.3 billion per year is going to be exceeded by the \nrequirements that we find in the Dole-Johnston substitute now.\n  That was not in the original bill, I realize, but it was voted on the \nfloor, and as of now the small businesses going through the rigorous \ncost-benefit analyses and risk assessment requirements will run the \ncost and complexity of this way up.\n  Our goal should not be to swamp the agencies so they are unable to \ncarry out their missions. Whether that mission be to protect the \nhealth, safety, or environment or another important public function, \nour goals should be to help them do their jobs more effectively. We \nshould require these rigorous cost-benefit analyses and risk \nassessments for the rules that have a significant impact on the \neconomy, not for all the rules now covered by S. 343. That is why a \nvote for the Glenn-Chafee substitute is a vote for commonsense reform.\n  Second, the Glenn-Chafee substitute requires cost-benefit analysis \nfor all major rules, but does not make the agencies pass a least-cost, \ncost-benefit test. That is its decisional criteria, before issuing \nrules. Costs and benefits are often hard to quantify and cost-benefit \nanalysis, while useful, is less than perfect. It is a developing \nscience.\n  The Dole-Johnston substitute requires agencies to pass a set of four \nrigid tests before they can issue a major rule. Most troubling of these \ncriteria is the least-cost test. The agency must pick the cheapest \nalternative, even if for a few more dollars it could save hundreds of \nmore lives or reduce pollution by a much greater amount. In other \nwords, common sense goes out the door on this approach. It has to be \n\n[[Page S 10209]]\nleast cost. Examples on the floor were given. If you had an additional \ncost of $2, and it would save an additional 200 lives, you could not \nput that into effect because you have to use least cost in the Dole-\nJohnston substitute as it is now constituted.\n  Dole-Johnston does allow agencies to use other more costly \nalternatives, but only in the case of ``scientific uncertainties,'' or \n``nonquantifiable benefits.'' So if the agency is certain about a \nbenefit or can quantify how much extra benefit they gain by using \nsomething other than the least-cost alternative, they are prohibited \nfrom doing it. That just does not make any sense at all.\n  Because these decisional criteria are tests that the agency must pass \nbefore promulgating a rule, the issue of whether the benefits really do \njustify the costs and whether the agency picked the least-cost \nalternative will certainly become matters for the lawyers to settle in \ncourt.\n  Agencies should absolutely be required to use cost-benefit analysis. \nI think we all agree on that. But they should not be forced to pass a \nrigid least-cost, cost-benefit test to issue every major rule. If an \nagency does not think a rule's benefits justify its costs, but still is \nrequired by law to issue that rule, the rule should come back to us in \nCongress. That is where the responsibility lies, and that is what we \nprovide in this legislation. It can come back to Congress, and that is \nwhere it should be, because after all, as much as 80 percent of agency \nrules are strictly required by laws we have passed in the Congress. I \nkeep coming back to this point, but the plain truth is that if we \nreally want regulatory reform, we should start fixing the laws we have \npassed, not load up the agencies and the American people with more \nbureaucratic procedures and more litigation. That is what Dole-Johnston \ndoes.\n  Third, the Glenn-Chafee substitute provides for a review of current \nrules--in other words, laws, rules, regs, that are in effect now, maybe \nsome have been in effect for many years--but with no automatic \narbitrary sunset if agencies fail to review a rule.\n  We provide for review of existing rules, much like the Dole-Johnston \nbill, but we do not have an automatic immediate sunset of rules if an \nagency fails to review those rules according to schedule.\n  As the Senator from Louisiana points out, the agency may get up to a \n2-year extension. True. However, it is still true that if the agency \nstill does not complete its review by then, then at that point, the \nrule becomes immediately unenforceable; in other words, it is canceled.\n So it does still sunset after the extension. The Glenn-Chafee \nsubstitute, on the other hand, requires an agency that fails to review \na rule according to schedule to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking \nto repeal the rule. And this process allows public comment on the rule \nand ensures that a rule does not sunset arbitrarily. The agency must \nthen complete this rulemaking action within 2 years, and such action is \njudicially reviewable.\n\n  Also, an annual process is established for Congress to amend agency \nreview schedules in cases where an agency does not schedule review of \nrules people think are in need of review. This process will lead to the \nreview and elimination of outmoded rules. Dole-Johnston, with its \nreview petition process, will lead to delay, waste of money, and \nlawsuits. Let me reemphasize these points and set the record straight \nfrom yesterday. All the charges that our agency review of existing \nrules has no teeth are just not true. Under Glenn-Chafee, agencies must \nreview existing rules and solicit public comment on the review and on \nthe schedule. Agencies just cannot sit back and do nothing about \nreviewing existing rules under the Glenn-Chafee substitute, as some of \nmy colleagues said yesterday. Glenn-Chafee requires agencies to review \nexisting rules, to set a schedule for that review, to solicit input \nfrom the public, and to complete that review within a time certain.\n  The Dole-Johnston substitute creates a petition process for \ninterested parties to get a rule on the schedule for review. These \npetitions are all judicially reviewable and there is no limit on the \nnumber of petitions; there can be hundreds, there can be thousands. The \nagency has two options. If the agency grants the petition, it has to \ncomplete the review of that rule within 3 years, or the rule sunsets. \nIf they deny the petition, they can get dragged to court. It seems to \nme that puts the agency between a rock and a hard place--3 years or the \ncourthouse. It also seems to me that these petitions put interested \nparties, like the regulated businesses, not the agencies, in the \ndriver's seat.\n  The Glenn-Chafee substitute has an enforcement mechanism to make sure \nagencies review rules, contrary to what we heard yesterday. Under \nGlenn-Chafee, agencies must publish a schedule to review rules. That is \na requirement that is judicially reviewable. Agencies cannot just sit \non their hands and not review rules. If an agency, upon review, decides \nto amend or repeal a rule, it must do so within 2 years, and that is \njudicially reviewable. If an agency does not complete its review of a \nrule within the allotted time, it must publish a notice of proposed \nrulemaking to repeal the rule. And it must complete that agency action \nwithin 2 years. And that is judicially reviewable. That is a real \nhammer.\n  We do not allow judicial review of what rules the agency decides to \nput on the list or of the deadlines for the review of those rules. But \nagencies must solicit and consider public input into this process. We \njust want to make sure the agencies spend their time and resources \ndoing a review of rules, not defending their every action in court. We \nthink, once again, that just makes common sense.\n  The Senator from Louisiana stated that the schedule for review of \nrules is in the sole discretion of the agency. This is misleading. We \nuse the phrase ``sole discretion'' to stop industries and others from \nlitigating what and when rules should be reviewed. If interested \nparties have complaints about rules not getting on the schedule, there \nis a specific process allowing annual amendments and additions to any \nschedule through Congress. If any groups of constituents feel that an \nimportant rule is being ignored by agencies, this is the politically \naccountable way to handle that problem. We should not add to the \nlitigation explosion, the litigation burden that would otherwise be \ncreated through Dole-Johnston.\n  Fourth, the Glenn-Chafee substitute is not a lawyer's dream. We allow \nfor judicial review of, one, the determination of a major rule and, \ntwo, whether a final rule is arbitrary and capricious in light of the \nwhole rulemaking file. We do not allow separate challenges of the \nprocedures of cost-benefit analysis or risk assessment.\n  The Dole-Johnston bill has much more judicial review which can be \ninterpreted to allow a review of procedural compliance with analyses \nand assessments.\n  Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, yesterday, had a list of 88 \ndifferent points of judicial review. That was taken from a longer list, \nas I understand it, of 144 that one of the agencies said, as they \ninterpret the bill as now proposed under Dole-Johnston--they could find \n144 separate areas where there could be judicial review. We have it \nhere, and if I have time, I will read it. But under S. 343, this is one \nwhere OSHA has about 15 different places that they--more than that; it \nis about 30 different places where OSHA says they can see there would \nbe judicial review, as they view it, unnecessarily, where things could \njust be tied up in court. I will get to that if I have time for it a \nlittle bit later.\n  I think it is important to remember that S. 343 has many more \nprovisions for judicial review than what is found in section 625, the \nsection the Senator from Louisiana kept coming back to yesterday. The \nDole-Johnston substitute creates numerous new positions that are \njudicially reviewable. It changes the standards for review for the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, and it makes fundamental changes in the \nuse of consent decrees and burden of proof for industry compliance. All \nof these changes in Dole-Johnston, coupled with the judicial review \nlanguage in section 625, mean one thing: more lawsuits, more money \nspent on lawyers, less money spent on the public's business of \nprotecting the health, safety, and environment.\n  Fifth, the Glenn-Chafee substitute does not create brand new \npetitions by private persons that will eat up agency resources and will \nlet special interests, not the agency or Congress, guide priorities. \nThe Dole-Johnston bill creates \n\n[[Page S 10210]]\nseveral new avenues for interested persons to petition agencies, \nincluding, one, issuance of amendment or repeal of a rule; two, \namendment or repeal of an interpretive rule or general statement of \npolicy or guidance; three, interpretation regarding meaning of a rule, \ninterpretive rule, general statement of policy, or guidance; four, \nplacing a rule on schedule for review; five, alternative methods of \ncompliance; six, review of freestanding risk assessment. All petitions \nmust be decided at a time certain, which ranges from 18 months to 180 \ndays. Except for the petition for alternative method of compliance, all \nthese petition decisions are judicially reviewable. That is a massive \nnumber of points of judicial reviewability.\n  Again, we see that the real effect of Dole-Johnston will be to create \nspecial avenues for special interests and more ways for lawyers to tie \nup agencies in court.\n  The Glenn-Chafee substitute has no special interest provisions. The \nDole-Johnston bill, on the other hand, has very specific fixes for \nspecial interests. For example, it changes the Delaney clause and EPA's \ntoxic release inventory. These provisions have no place in a \nGovernment-wide regulatory reform bill. Changes to these important \nlaws--and I think some changes should be made--should be handled by the \ncommittees of jurisdiction in the context of full debate about the \nunderlying laws. They should not be piggybacked on the larger process \nbill.\n  This way of lacing the process reform legislation with special \ninterest fixes is not reform. It involves special pleadings for the \nspecial money few. The American people will pay a heavy price in the \nend if we go that route.\n  These are six important reasons why we should support the Glenn-\nChafee substitute over the Dole-Johnston substitute. My colleague from \nLouisiana has tried to improve the underlying bill, S. 343. He has been \nout here on the floor every day, almost by himself, trying to make the \ncase for his improvements. But I do not believe the improvements are \nenough. The bill is still too flawed to be supported. It endangered the \npublic health and safety and the environment. It wastes Government \nresources. In enriches lawyers and bogs down the courts for the \ninterests of a few. So I think we should enact the Glenn-Chafee \nsubstitute, which I feel is a commonsense reform.\n  I want to also set the record straight about two additional issues in \nGlenn-Chafee that the proponents of Dole-Johnston misrepresented \nyesterday. First is the issue of exemptions. Glenn-Chafee has been \ncriticized for not having enough exemptions. There are several issues \ninvolved here. There is one question about general exemptions. Both \nDole-Johnston and Glenn-Chafee exempt several categories of rules from \nthe regulatory reform legislation by exempting them from the \ndefinitions of rule and/or major rule. The question is, how do the two \nbills differ?\n  Now, in total, I believe Dole-Johnston has more exemptions than \nGlenn-Chafee. I think some of these should actually be added to Glenn-\nChafee. But Dole-Johnston is also missing some exemptions that Glenn-\nChafee has. We need to get together on this. Dole-Johnston does not \nexempt actions relating to the removal of a product from commerce, for \ninstance. It only exempts actions authorizing sales of a product. Now, \nthis is wrong. If we allow expedited introduction of some product into \nthe stores--that is, with no lengthy cost-benefit analysis and risk \nassessment--we should provide for expedited removal of dangerous \nproducts. That is only fair. Public health and safety demands no less.\n  If we just think about the lignite situation of a few years ago, we \ncan see why it is important that we be able to expeditiously remove \ndangerous products from the marketplace.\n  Dole-Johnston also does not exempt Federal Election Commission rules \nand certain Federal Communication Commission rules relating to \npolitical campaigns. We believe the political nature of both these FEC \nand FCC rules recommend that they should not be treated like other \nrules. They may need review, but not under this legislation with review \nin the political environment of the White House and OMB.\n  Dole-Johnston does have exemptions not in the Glenn-Chafee bill. \nThese are exemptions that also were not in S. 291, our bipartisan \nGovernmental Affairs Committee bill. They have been added since then. \nNo. 1, Dole-Johnston exempts rules relating to customs, duties and \nrevenue; No. 2, international trade law and agreements; No. 3 public \ndebt; No. 4, relief from statutory prohibitions; No. 5, decisions of \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; No. 6, matters involving \nfinancial responsibilities of securities brokers and dealers.\n  Now, some of these exemptions do make a lot of sense. Customs duties \nand Treasury fiscal policy rules relating to the public debt, for \nexample, should be exempted. These exemptions should be added to Glenn-\nChafee. There are some areas we can agree and should keep working to \nimprove the legislation. I think that is what we should do--keep \ntalking about these and work out the things we all agree on are best \nbetween these two approaches.\n  Now, the issue of exemptions also involves the question about special \nexemptions. The debate last week went beyond the general exemptions to \nfocus on whether special exemptions are needed to protect public health \nand safety rules. As my colleagues know, last week exemptions were \nadded to Dole-Johnston for mammography standards and rules to protect \nchildren from poisoning.\n  At the same time, amendments for exemptions for meat inspection and \nsafe drinking water rules were rejected. Again, this debate raised the \nissue of whether each bill needs special exemptions to protect \nimportant pending health and safety rules. The simple answer is that \nGlenn-Chafee needs no special exemptions, Dole-Johnston does.\n  First, both bills allow agencies to use the current APA good-cause \nexemption. This allows an agency to exempt a rule from notice and \ncomment rulemaking whenever necessary to protect the public interest. \nOnce exempted from notice and comment procedures, the rule is exempt \nfrom the cost benefit and other requirements of the regulatory reform \nlegislation. As far as Glenn-Chafee is concerned, no other special \nexemptions are needed.\n  Second, proponents of Dole-Johnston argued last week that their bill \nhas an extra exemption for health and safety rules, and Glenn-Chafee \ndoes not have this exemption.\n  This is a smoke screen. Again, Glenn-Chafee does not need an extra \nspecial exemption. The APA good cause exemption is enough. Dole-\nJohnston needs an extra exemption because of its effective date and \nbecause of its onerous requirements.\n  Proponents of Dole-Johnston argue that their bill solved people's \nconcerns about USDA's proposed meat inspection rule and other pending \nrules, because it provided a 180-day--later extended to 1-year--\nextension which is in now, and I emphasize the word ``extension'' for \nagencies to complete all required cost-benefit and related steps.\n  Dole-Johnston supporters characterized this section as an emergency \nexemption and criticized Glenn-Chafee for not having a comparable \nsection. This is just wrong. The real issue is not about emergencies. \nAgain, the APA gives Glenn-Chafee an emergency exemption.\n  The real issue involves pending rules. The USDA meat inspection rule, \nfor example, is not an emergency rule. It has been under development \nfor some time. It is, after all, a proposed revision of a set of \ninspection results that have been in effect, more or less, since 1906. \nIt is not an emergency rule. Neither are EPA's cryptosporidium safe \ndrinking water rules or FDA's mammography rules or the rules to protect \nchildren from poison.\n  These health and safety rules are vulnerable under Dole-Johnston not \nbecause of the inadequacy of emergency exemption provisions, but \nbecause Dole-Johnston, No. 1, covers pending rules; No. 2, subjects \nthose rules to onerous cost-benefit analysis and decisional criteria \nrequirements.\n  Dole-Johnston 1-year extension allows agencies to issue a rule, but \nthen they still have to finish their cost before analysis in that year \nand then go back and revise the rule for the least cost test demands a \ndifferent solution.\n  Moreover, regardless of the cost-benefit test, Dole-Johnston's other \nrequirements, like its APA revisions I discussed yesterday, still open \nup the rule to immediate challenge. These include new APA rulemaking \npublication requirements, a new APA substantial \n\n[[Page S 10211]]\nsupport standard, the petition processes, and all the related avenues \nfor judicial review. Even with the Johnston amendment, only to cover \nrules for which a notice of proposed rulemaking was published after \nApril 1, 1995, pending rules already in the rulemaking pipeline will \nemerge and immediately be subject to all of the Dole-Johnston \nrequirements.\n  This threat to rules in the pipeline will make agencies stop \nrulemaking, reassess the sufficiency of their rulemaking record, and \neven reanalyze their proposed rule then modify and republish their \nproposed rule in order to address issues that would be raised under the \nnew standards of Dole-Johnston.\n  Let me make this very clear. The issue is not whether an agency has \nor could exempt a rule from notice and comment rulemaking. The issue is \nwhether a new rule coming out of the pipeline will satisfy the new \nrequirements of the new law. The answer is that Dole-Johnston's \nextension does not solve this problem.\n  Unlike Dole-Johnston, Glenn-Chafee will jeopardize pending rule \nmakings. First, the Glenn-Chafee effective date is 10 days after an \nenactment for proposed rules. Glenn-Chafee will only cover new rules \nproposed at least 6 months after enactment of the legislation. This 6-\nmonth delay will allow agencies a reasonable amount of time to put into \nplace the new tough procedures required by the law.\n  Second, Glenn-Chafee requires an evaluation of costs and benefits. We \nalso require a certification, whether the benefits justify the costs, \nand whether the rule will achieve its objectives in a more cost-\neffective manner than the alternatives.\n  While this necessities a cost-benefit analysis, it is in no way as \nprescriptive as Dole-Johnston's least cost decisional criteria, let \nalone Dole-Johnston's minimal impact Regulatory Flexibility Act \nrequirements.\n  The bottom line is the proponents of Glenn-Chafee are not afraid of \nhaving agencies comply with our cost-benefit requirements. They are \ntough, but they are also fair and they are workable. The Dole-Johnston \n1-year extension, on the other hand, is no solution. It is an \nextension, not an exemption. In fact, it simply introduced uncertainty.\n  All interested parties will have to wait until the completion of the \nrequired cost before analysis and satisfaction of the least cost test \nto learn whether the rule will continue in effect or whether the agency \nwill reenter rulemaking to revise the rule.\n  This uncertainty and waste of resources serves no interest other than \nGovernment inefficiency and ineffectiveness. To summarize these \nexemption questions, No. 1, we may be able to agree on more general \nexemption to the definition of rule and major rule; No. 2, Glenn-Chafee \ndoes not need any special exemptions because of the APA's current good \ncause exemption. This protects emergency rules. Our future effective \ndate also protects rules now in the pipeline. No. 3, the only bill that \nneeds extra special exemptions is Dole-Johnston. Its immediate \neffective date will capture pending rules. Its onerous requirements \nwill force many important rules back to the drawing board, wasting \nresources, causing delays and literally inviting litigation.\n  Another matter that must be set straight involves some statements \nmade yesterday regarding the risk assessment provisions in Glenn-\nChafee. Some have stated that the Glenn-Chafee substitute is weak \nbecause it requires risk assessments for only particular agencies and \nprograms rather than requiring them for all agencies. This is not weak. \nIt is common sense. It makes sense to make agencies that issue rules \nrelating to health, safety, and the environment comply with these \nrequirements. It does not make sense to cover every agency.\n  For example, what if the health care financing administration wants \nto change Medicare eligibility requirements. That is a rule related to \nhealth. Under Dole-Johnston they may have to do a risk assessment. That \ndoes not make sense. I do not think so.\n  All we are trying to do in the Glenn-Chafee substitute is to use some \ncommon sense. It does not make sense to cover all agencies, because not \nall agencies should do risk assessments.\n  Glenn-Chafee risk assessment requirements are less prescriptive and \nbetter science than the Dole-Johnston substitute. We need to be careful \nwhen legislating science. I do not classify myself as a scientist. Many \nscientists have warned against writing language that is too \nprescriptive.\n  For example, the Dole-Johnston substitute states that agencies must \nbase each risk assessment only on the ``best reasonably available \nscientific data in scientific understanding.'' I ask, who determines \nwhat data are best in that requirement? What is best? Scientists say \nthere is often wide dispute within the scientific community about what \ndata are best, and it is common practice for agencies to use several \ndifferent data sets.\n  This language will not allow that to happen anymore. They use several \ndifferent data sets, and then they use their best judgment. In other \nwords, they come back to something that may be startling, they use \ncommon sense--and that is what we would require.\n  The Dole-Johnston substitute also says that when conflicts among data \noccur, agencies must discuss, ``all relevant information including the \nlikelihood of alternative interpretations of the data and emphasizing \npostulates that represent the most reasonable inferences * * *'' Again, \nwho makes this determination of most reasonable? Proponents of S. 343 \nare assuming there is only one right answer. But scientists tell us \nthat risk assessment is a growing science with lots of uncertainty, and \nrarely, if ever, is there just one right answer.\n  Let me also respond to what the Senator from Delaware said yesterday, \nthat the Glenn-Chafee substitute goes against the National Academy of \nSciences by preferring default assumptions to relevant data. That is \njust not right. It is wrong. I will read that again: It goes against \nthe National Academy of Sciences by preferring the default assumption \nto relevant data.\n  Default assumption means, basically, that we do not know, so we make \na decision not knowing, not having as much data as we would like to \nhave. That is a shorthand of what default assumptions means. But that \nis just not right. On the contrary, we explicitly state in the Glenn-\nChafee bill that, ``each agency shall use default assumptions when \nrelevant and adequate scientific data and understanding are lacking.'' \nThat does not say we prefer such assumptions to relevant data. We say \nuse them when relevant data are not available.\n  Moreover, unlike the Dole-Johnston bill, we require agencies to issue \nguidance to ``provide procedures for the refinement and replacement of \npolicy-based default assumptions.'' In other words, we even provide in \nthere for going out and doing our level best to get some relevant \ninformation, not just to go along with default assumptions, as was \nstated yesterday.\n  So, I disagree with the Senator on that point. But I also want to add \nthat we should not be in the business of telling the agencies to throw \nout all their assumptions, no matter what. That also would not be good \nscience. What we try to do in the Glenn-Chafee bill is to make our risk \nlanguage less prescriptive. We should not freeze the science, as many \nscientists fear would happen if we legislate risk assessment with no \nroom for incorporating new understanding in how these assessments \nshould be done.\n  That brings me to a more general point. The Senator from Louisiana \nbrought up the issue several times yesterday regarding EPA's own \nreports about its ability to do good science. First, I do not think it \nis really fair to imply that EPA has not done a good job. That is not \njust my opinion. The National Academy of Sciences, in their 1994 report \ncalled Science and Judgment In Risk Assessment reaffirmed EPA's \napproach to risk assessment, stating--and this is from the National \nAcademy of Sciences: ``EPA's approach to assessing risks is \nfundamentally sound, despite often-heard criticism.''\n  The report gave many recommendations for EPA to improve its policies \nand practices. As I understand it, EPA currently has programs underway \nto do just exactly that. In their March 1995 report, just a couple of \nmonths ago, called Setting Priorities, Getting Results: A New Direction \nFor EPA, the National Academy of Public Administration, NAPA, concurred \nwith the National Academy of Science findings. \n\n[[Page S 10212]]\nSecond, I think it is important to point out what else the NAPA study \nfound, the National Academy of Public Administration. They state:\n\n       Congress should not attempt to define ``best science'' or \n     ``best estimate'' in statutes. Congress should not attempt to \n     legislate specific risk assessment techniques, or to adjust \n     assumptions that underlie risk assessments. Such legislation \n     would almost certainly inhibit innovation and improvement in \n     risk assessments methods while constraining scientists from \n     using their judgment in appropriate ways.\n\n  That is a very definitive statement from NAPA. And their report goes \non to say, further:\n\n       Congress should draft any risk legislation so as to \n     constrain the grounds on which risk analyses might be \n     challenged in court. Courts should ensure that regulators \n     follow reasonable procedures, but should not be put in the \n     position of resolving science policy questions such as the \n     definition of ``best science.''\n\n  That is what we try to do in the Glenn-Chafee substitute. We get rid \nof words like ``best data'' or ``the most reasonable inference.'' We \nlimit judicial review, and that is a far better approach.\n  Another issue: What is and is not exempted from risk assessment \nrequirements? The Dole-Johnston substitute exempts from the \nrequirements actions to introduce a product into commerce. Should we \nnot also exempt actions to remove a product from commerce? To put a \nproduct on the market, no risk assessment needs to be done. But to get \na dangerous substance off the market, an agency has to do a full-blown \nrisk assessment? That does not seem right.\n  I mentioned a few moments ago, what if we had the thalidomide scare \ngoing on today? That would be held up from being taken off the market, \nI guess. And that would not make any sense at all.\n  Finally, what about peer review? The Glenn-Chafee bill is actually \ntougher than the Dole-Johnston bill. We require peer review analysis of \nboth cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment. We believe both should \nbe reviewed. Both have lots of assumptions. Both should be scrubbed to \nmake sure that agencies are making good decisions based on good \ninformation.\n  The Dole-Johnston bill also exempts peer review from the Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act, FACA. Last year, during the health care debate, \nmy colleagues who support the Dole-Johnston substitute made a very big \nthing about making sure that such panels were done in sunshine and \ncomplied with FACA.\n  Now they seem to have changed their minds, exempting all peer reviews \nfrom FACA. I do not think that is the way we should be conducting \nbusiness. Glenn-Chafee does not exempt FACA, and that is the way we \nshould do business.\n  Mr. President, some of the comments that were made last year about \nFACA, when we were considering health reform--my colleague, Senator \nMack, for instance, said:\n\n       Secrecy in Government is not the American way. Secrecy in \n     Government has led to all sorts of abuses and denial of \n     freedom in other lands. We must keep our system of government \n     open and accountable to the citizens of our country for \n     public inspection and scrutiny. FACA requires that these \n     meetings should be meetings in public, published notice of \n     meetings in the Federal Register. Let the public know of the \n     agenda for those meetings. The act requires boards to permit \n     persons to obtain transcripts, appear and testify or file \n     statements, make a record, keep minutes, working papers, et \n     cetera, available. Keep detailed minutes, permit citizens to \n     purchase manuscripts and transcripts. Keep adequate financial \n     records. And the act also requires there should be a 2-year \n     time period for boards and commissions.\n\n  Senator Craig, Senator Grassley, Senator Lott, I believe my colleague \nSenator Specter, Senator McConnell, and Senator Dole all spoke on \nbehalf of keeping FACA and supported FACA and the importance of FACA.\n  Senator Dole in particular said:\n\n       And, plain and simple, the American public did not trust \n     the Clinton plan. They did not trust the secrecy in which it \n     was written. They did not trust the principle that Government \n     knows best. There is no reason why these boards should be \n     granted the power to meet in secrecy. Indeed, there is every \n     reason why they must meet in public.\n\n  On and on, we have several pages of those here. I will not read all \nof them into the Record.\n  But, Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to take a very hard look at \nthe regulatory reform substitutes before them. I urge them to support \nthe Glenn-Chafee bill. The Glenn-Chafee bill is a very tough reform \nbill. It also provides a balanced--repeat, a balanced--and a fair \napproach to reform. It will relieve regulatory burdens on businesses \nand individuals.\n  I repeat that. It will relieve regulatory burdens on businesses and \nindividuals. At the same time, it will also protect the health and \nsafety and the environment of the American people. This is responsible \nlegislation. I urge your consideration and support.\n  Mr. President, in indicating the litigation that can occur with this \nlegislation, OSHA has looked at this, and they asked a question, they \npostulated something here. The title of this is: ``S. 343, Endless \nRounds of Litigation While Workers Wait For Protection.'' They say:\n       Imagine: You are a metal finisher who works with a toxin \n     that causes acute pneumonitis, pulmonary edema, kidney \n     disease, and lung cancer. You are not alone. 500,000 other \n     men and women also work with this compound.\n       Right now, OSHA can protect you from exposure to this \n     dangerous hazard by proving that: workers are exposed to a \n     significant risk, the proposed standard would substantially \n     reduce that risk, and the standard would be technologically \n     and economically feasible.\n       Under S. 343, a protective rule to limit your exposure to \n     this compound could be invalidated because of the endless \n     opportunities for judicial review. For example, a petition \n     could:\n       Claim that OSHA failed to consider substitute risks. (See \n     631(8); Sec. 632(a); Sec. 633(f)(3))\n       Claim that OSHA failed to distinguish between risk \n     assessment and risk management. (Sec. 633(a)(2))\n       Claim that OSHA failed to use only the best reasonably \n     available scientific data and scientific understanding. (Sec. \n     633(c)(1))\n       Claim that OSHA failed to select data based on reasoned \n     analysis of the quality and relevance of the data. (Sec. \n     633(c)(2))\n       Claim that OSHA failed to consider whether the data was \n     published in peer reviewed literature. (Sec. 633(c)(3))\n       Claim that OSHA failed to discuss alternative \n     interpretations of that data that emphasize postulates that \n     represent the most reasonable inferences from the supporting \n     data. (Sec. 633(c)(5)(A))\n       Claim that OSHA used a policy judgement when relevant \n     scientific data was available. (Sec. 633(d)(1))\n       Claim that OSHA failed to explain adequately the extent to \n     which policy judgements were validated, or conflict with, \n     empirical data. (Sec. 633(d)(2)(A))\n       Claim that OSHA failed to describe adequately reasonable \n     alternative policy judgements and the sensitivity of the \n     conclusions of the risk assessments to the alternatives. \n     (Sec. 633(d)(2)(C))\n       Claim that OSHA inappropriately combined or compounded \n     multiple policy judgements. (Sec. 633(d)(2)(3))\n       Claim that OSHA failed to express adequately the range and \n     distribution of risks and the corresponding exposure \n     scenarios, and failed to identify adequately the expected \n     risk to the general population and to more highly exposed or \n     sensitive populations. (Sec. 633(f)(1)(C))\n       Claim that OSHA failed to describe adequately the \n     significant substitution risks of the rule. (Sec. 633(f)(3))\n       Claim that OSHA's peer review panel was not balanced and \n     independent. (Sec. 633(g))\n       Claim that OSHA's response to peer review comments were \n     inadequate. (Sec. 633(D)(3))\n       Claim that OSHA failed to provide adequate opportunity for \n     public participation and comment. (Sec. 633(D)(3))\n       Claim that OSHA did not properly determine that the \n     benefits of the rule justify the costs. (Sec. 624(b)(1))\n       Claim that OSHA failed to identify all of the significant \n     adverse effects of the rule. (Sec. 621)\n       Claim that OSHA failed to give regulated persons adequate \n     flexibility to respond to changes in general economic \n     conditions. (Sec. 621(6)(C))\n       Claim that OSHA did not properly determine the least-cost \n     alternative of the reasonable alternatives. (Sec. \n     624(b)(3)(A))\n       And more claims, and more claims, and more claims.\n       Thankfully, OSHA addressed this dangerous compound in its \n     Cadmium standard. If S. 343 had been in place, however, this \n     protective standard could have been delayed for years, \n     leading to many work-related cases of cancer and kidney \n     disease that could otherwise have been avoided.\n  So, Mr. President, this is just one little example of--what is that, \n25 or 30, I guess, examples after just a first-cut look at S. 343 that \nOSHA indicates they feel would provide grounds for litigation.\n  Mr. President, I wished to make a reasonably complete statement, \nwhich I think I have done here this morning. We have combined several \nprevious things that were brought up over the last couple of days as \nwell as refuting some of the scare stories that have been applied. We \nstill have basically six different areas in which we disagree. \n\n[[Page S 10213]]\n\n  It is on major rules and how we deal with those; on the cost-benefit \nanalysis versus the least-cost approach. We provide for review of \ncurrent rules with no automatic sunset. We disagree with Dole-Johnston \nthat provides a sunset after an extension period.\n  Our bill is not a lawyer's dream. It does not provide nearly \nunlimited judicial review of everything from beginning to end. And our \nsubstitute does not create brand new petitions by private sources, by \nprivate persons or groups, that will just eat up agency resources and \nlet special interests, not the agency or Congress, guide our \npriorities. And we do not have special interest provisions. We do not \ntry to deal with things in this bill that deal with processes. We do \nnot try to solve things like the Delaney clause on which separate \nlegislation is being prepared by a different committee; toxics release \ninventory and things such as that.\n  So I believe we have a better bill here, and I hope that when the \nvote occurs this afternoon after our noon break we will have enough \nvotes to pass this. I know it is a squeaker. I know that we may lack \nthe votes to do this. But I hope that after people look at the two \nbills side by side, they will realize we take the more reasoned \napproach to this and that this really is a superior bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the Glenn-Chafee substitute to \nthe regulatory reform bill, because it will achieve real reform without \nparalyzing the Government agencies that set health, safety, and \nenvironmental standards, and without wasting their resources on redtape \nthat adds nothing to the wisdom of their decisions. It will lead to \ncommonsense regulation, rather than excessive litigation and full \nemployment for lawyers.\n  It will give us cost-effective regulations, rather than always the \ncheapest, but not necessarily the most effective, rule. And it will \nallow for full public participation in regulatory decisionmaking, \ninstead of back door, special interest processes that exclude the \npublic.\n  In each of these respects, our proposal is superior to the pending \nalternative. The Dole-Johnston alternative applies its cost-benefit \nanalysis and risk assessment requirements to hundreds of rules each \nyear that do not have enough of an impact on the economy to justify the \nexpenditure.\n  To require dozens of costly, time-consuming procedural steps for even \nminor rules is wasteful and counterproductive. At a time when we are \ncutting agency budgets and laying off tens of thousands of employees, \nforcing the agencies to comply with these procedures is simply a way to \nprevent them from doing their real work--protecting the American public \nfrom significant health and safety threats.\n  Some say that we rely too much on the Government and that in doing so \nwe risk our freedom.\n  But none of us as individuals can protect ourselves from the \ndestruction of the ozone layer, from deadly bacteria in our food or \ndrinking water, or from HIV when we get a blood transfusion. The \nGovernment must be active in these areas, and it must have the \nresources to do for all of us what we cannot do for ourselves. The \nDole-Johnston proposal will cost at least $1.3 billion a year, but it \ndoes not provide any new funding to pay for these costs. This $1.3 \nbillion is money that will not be available for enforcement and \nadministration of essential laws and regulations.\n  The Dole-Johnston alternative relies on private lawsuits to be what \nsome call the hammer to make agencies comply with the law. But as \nProfessor Peter L. Strauss of Columbia Law School testified before the \nJudiciary Committee,\n\n       Permitting judicial review of the process hands over to \n     interested private parties weapons with which they can \n     cheaply and unaccountably delay government action and make it \n     more expensive to accomplish what government should be doing.\n\n  Our alternative, by contrast, leaves the review of rules more in the \nhands of Congress.\n  We can block any regulation from taking effect by invoking the \nlegislative veto provision, which the Senate has already passed in \nseparate legislation. That is a better answer than private litigation.\n  Congress gives agencies their power to regulate, and we are \nultimately responsible for what they do. If a rule is unreasonably \nburdensome and costly, if it is based on bad science, Congress has the \npower and will have the opportunity under our alternative to intervene \nand block it.\n  We do not need to depend on special interest lawyers, and we should \nnot depend on them, to ensure that Federal regulations make sense.\n  Senator Hatch has repeatedly cited examples of bad regulation from \nPhilip K. Howard's book ``The Death of Common Sense.'' But Mr. Howard's \ntestimony is enlightening, because he favors limits on judicial review \nlike those in our proposal. Mr. Howard testified that, ``The main \ncontrol over agencies should be oversight by Congress, not endless \nprocedure or appeals to courts over procedural nitpicks.''\n  I also prefer the Glenn-Chafee substitute because the alternative \ncreates special opportunities for businesses to escape regulation \nwithout any public involvement or notice. Section 629 of the Dole-\nJohnston alternative allows any regulated business to petition for a \nwaiver from any major rule. The petition must be granted if the \nbusiness shows that it is reasonably likely that the business can \nachieve the goal without complying with the rule.\n  In other words, if the new safe meat handling rules were in effect, \nand a meat packer were able to convince USDA that ``there is a \nreasonable likelihood'' that it could keep its meat free of E. coli \nwithout doing any sampling for bacteria, USDA would have to grant its \npetition.\n  The Dole-Johnston alternative gives no one else a chance to question \nor challenge the company's petition, to cross-examine its scientists, \nor even to know that the petition is pending. A secret relationship \nbetween the agency and the company is created. And if the agency grants \nthe petition, no one can challenge the decision in court. Section \n629(e) provides that ``in no event shall agency action taken pursuant \nto this section be subject to judicial review.'' The public interest is \ntotally ignored.\n  When, as here, the issue is agency action to exempt a business from \nregulation, the Dole-Johnston alternative rejects any interest in risk \nassessment and good science. The agency is given 180 days to respond to \nthe company's petition, which may not be sufficient time to investigate \nthe issue fully.\n  The agency is not required to conduct a risk assessment, or subject \nits decision on waiving the rule to peer review. The Dole-Johnston \nalternative operates on the assumption that agencies can be trusted to \nmake the right decision in the case of waiving a rule--but not in \nissuing the rule.\n  I object to this back door way to let businesses escape regulations \nthat are designed to protect the public. At a minimum, there must be \nsome opportunity for public involvement and comment.\n  I also question whether a process like this can be justified if it \ndoes not require peer review of the agency's decision, to ensure that \nthere is not collusion. The Glenn-Chafee proposal does not provide for \nthis kind of petition at all, and it is, therefore, superior to the \nDole-Johnston alternative. I am also pleased that the Glenn-Chafee \namendment does not include the special interest fixes or the Dole-\nJohnston alternative. For example, our proposal does not undermine the \nDelaney clause, which prohibits the approval of cancer-causing food \nadditives.\n  We all agree on the need for Delaney reform, but it is a complex, \ntechnical subject that requires careful consideration by the committees \nof jurisdiction. The approach in the Dole-Johnston alternative is too \nsimplistic and provides insufficient protection to infants and \nchildren, whose special diets leave them especially vulnerable to food-\nborne carcinogens.\n  Finally, the Dole-Johnston alternative continues to be a supermandate \nthat requires agencies to choose the cheapest alternative in any case \nwhere the benefits to health, safety or the environment are \nquantifiable. Suppose that OSHA finds that requiring grain elevators to \ncontinuously vacuum up dust could save 10 lives a year by preventing \ndust explosions, but would be more expensive than have employees sweep \nup once a shift.\n  OSHA could not require the grain elevator to install dust control \nequipment, or to maintain a consistently \n\n[[Page S 10214]]\nlow ``action level'' of dust, because it is not the least cost \nalternative.\n  Our proposal, on the other hand, is not a supermandate and does not \nimpose any new decision criteria. OSHA would be able to choose the more \nprotective alternative, as it did under the Reagan administration, \nbecause that is the alternative that better accomplishes the goal of \nthe statute--providing a safe workplace.\n  The Nation has made tremendous progress in the last quarter of a \ncentury toward cleaning up the environment, protecting endangered \nspecies, ensuring the safety of food and drugs, and improving health \nand safety in the workplace. We must not destroy this progress in the \nguise of reforming the laws and regulatory system that made it \npossible. The Glenn-Chafee substitute will help us streamline the \nregulatory process and make it more cost effective. It will not throw \nthe baby out with the bath water.\n  I urge the Senate to support the Glenn-Chafee substitute.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to reform our regulatory process.\n  No one can deny that we need to write smarter, clearer, more \neffective, and more flexible Federal regulations. The question before \nus is not whether to reform our regulations. The question is how to \nreform them.\n  I believe that the most balanced answer to this question is in S. \n1001, that Senators Glenn, Chafee, and I, along with other of our \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle, offer here today.\n  And I am afraid that S. 343, the Dole-Johnston bill, remains an \nunbalanced, costly, confrontational approach, that fails to meet its \nown reform criteria, and that will fail to protect the public health \nand safety--the general welfare that it is our Constitutional duty to \nprotect.\n  Mr. President, the days are long gone when Americans grew their own \nfood, made their own tools, stayed pretty close to home, and saw most \ndisease as an act of God.\n  Now we buy food from all over the world, packaged and processed with \nunpronounceable chemicals, even irradiation.\n  We travel at higher speeds over longer distances, in larger and \nlarger aircraft, and in automobiles that are as much electronic as they \nare mechanical.\n  Mr. President, as much as we may long for a simpler, more self-\nsufficient time, we must face the costs--in new risks to our health and \nsafety--that come with the benefits of our rapidly evolving economy.\n  It is one thing to recognize those costs, Mr. President, and quite \nanother to know what to do about them. What is the best way to protect \nagainst the new threats to our safety and health that come from the way \nwe now live?\n  That is the heart of the question before us in this debate on \nregulatory reform.\n  Mr. President, the issue before us today has been a generation in the \nmaking. Many of the safety and health regulations now on the books had \ntheir origins 25 to 30 years ago, when we began to face up to the real \ncosts--in injury, disease, and even death--from unregulated \nmanufacturing processes and products.\n  By the end of the 1960's and the beginning of the 1970's, we came to \nrealize that consumer choice alone--the guiding principle of the free \nmarket--was not enough to protect us from poorly designed, inadequately \nresearched, or criminally negligent products and processes.\n  Our private enterprise economy functions so well because it is based \non individual initiative and self-interest. Economic competition among \nfree individuals drives the inventiveness that gives us new products, \nnew technologies--progress that has given us the most powerful economy \nin the history of the world.\n  But those competitive individuals all face the same need to keep \ntheir costs lower than their competitors--each individual must find \nways to avoid paying for anything that competitors get for free.\n  The unfortunate effect in this process is that what we all have in \ncommon--the need for clean water, clean air, clean food, safe working \nconditions, products that are safe and effective--those things we have \nin common are not necessarily protected in each business's calculations \nof economic efficiency.\n  At the same time, with the rapid technological changes brought by our \nfree enterprise economy, we find ourselves more and more dependent on \nproducts whose safety and effectiveness we cannot evaluate ourselves--\nexcept, perhaps by experiencing the tragic consequences of thalidomide \nor DDT, or increasing automobile injuries and deaths.\n  So we need some way to make sure we can take care of those things we \nhave in common--the common good.\n  A generation ago, the public began to demand cleaner air, safer food, \nwater, and transportation. To accomplish those goals, Congress has \npassed laws, and agencies have written the regulations to put the goals \nof those laws into effect.\n  In era of skepticism, cynicism, and downright hostility toward \ngovernment, these are the most popular federal laws now on the books, \nMr. President.\n  Everywhere I travel in my own State of Delaware, and in other States \naround our country, people of every political persuasion tell that they \ncontinue to support government policies that keep our food and water \nsafe and clean, that assure we can travel in safety, and that protect \nthe environment.\n  At the same time, these are also some of the most frustrating, \ndemanding, confusing regulations that our small businesses and property \nowners must face. Reform must balance the demands of the public for \ncontinued safety with the needs of those businessmen and women who seek \nreasonable relief.\n  Still, taken as a whole, in terms of their impact on the economy, \nthese regulations are not, Mr. President, the unmitigated disaster some \nwould have us believe.\n  Our food, our water, our prescription drugs, our highways and \nairways--even our children's clothes and toys--are safer today because \nof Federal regulations.\n  But at what cost, ask our colleagues? They tell us that our country \nis being strangled by regulations, jobs are being lost, that the burden \nof regulations is sinking our economy.\n  Now, Mr. President, a couple of days ago on the floor of the Senate I \nrelated a story from my own State of Delaware about regulations run \namok, about a rule that flies in the face of common sense, a rule that \ncost a good friend of mine an outrageous amount of money simply to \nsettle a claim out of court.\n  I know as well as anyone here that these horror stories are real, and \nthat it is high time we undertook serious reform of the ways we write \nFederal rules and regulations.\n  But our job here is to weigh the full body of evidence, and to put \nthe individual cases that are so frustrating and infuriating into \ncontext, and correct them individually. When I told that story, I said \nI would return to the floor to discuss the real cost of regulations, \nthe real costs of these rules to our economy.\n  Fortunately, Mr. President, the big picture is not what some would \nhave us believe. The fact is that the burden of regulation a share of \nour economy has not exploded as some of my colleagues have stated here \non the floor.\n  As a matter of fact, the share of regulatory costs in our economy has \nactually gone down, as documented by an analysis done last month by the \nGAO. From 1977 to this year, the regulatory cost have shrunk by 11 \npercent--from about 4.5 percent of GDP to about 4 percent of GDP.\n  There is nothing in the facts to support the claim that the cost of \nregulations has exploded, nothing to justify putting hurdles, even \nlandmines, in front of every regulation now on the books, and every \nregulation now in the works.\n  Mr. President, many of the stories we have heard here in recent \ndays--stories of regulators' excesses and abuses of power--are more \nfolklore than fact. But if even these horror stories were true, would \nthat justify putting the health and safety of the American public at \nrisk? Would the risks justify the benefits? Would it not be better to \nfix the particular abuses, rather than take the Dole approach?\n  Let us look at this another way, Mr. President. Many of my colleagues \ninsist on using a grossly inflated estimate of the total cost of \nregulations--$562 billion a year, by one well-publicized estimate. \n\n[[Page S 10215]]\n\n  But that number includes costs like farm subsidies, that transfer \nfunds from one sector of the economy to another--they add up to zero on \nthe national accounts. And they also include the costs of complying \nwith the IRS--a burden we all resent, but one that the Dole-Johnston \nbill does not touch. The IRS is not covered by regulatory reform--that \nis an issue for tax reform, a topic for another day.\n  So the real costs of complying with regulations is actually more like \n$228 billion a year, according the study cited in the GAO report I have \nhere today--half of what some would have us believe.\n  But what do we get for those costs? Is this just money down the \ndrain? Not according to the Center for Risk Analysis at the Harvard \nSchool of Public Health. Its report from March of this year cites one \nstudy--from the peer-reviewed Yale Journal on Regulation--that sets the \nbenefits of health, safety, and environmental regulations at $200 \nbillion a year.\n  A little quick math suggests that we are left with a total NET cost \nof regulations to the economy--if we take reasonable account of \nbenefits that we can measure in dollars and cents, as well as the \ncosts--of about $28 billion a year.\n  That $228 billion a year in regulatory costs means about $912 dollars \na year for everyone in the country, or about $2.50 a day, for all of \nthe health, safety, and environmental protection we enjoy.\n  If we throw in some of the benefits that cannot be measured in \ndollars and cents--a little extra peace of mind, some fairness in the \ndistribution of benefits, deference to principles like federalism--that \nseems like a pretty fair deal.\n  Some might call it a bargain--clean water, safe food, secure \ntransportation, and a few basic American values thrown in--for $2.50 a \nday.\n  Like most of the numbers we have heard in this debate, of course, \nthese are estimates, extrapolations, and a reflection of how hard it is \nto measure these things. As much as we need to know the hard facts \nabout the costs and benefits of regulations, we are still learning how \nto count them.\n  But that small number makes sense when we look at the effect of \nregulations on the growth of our economy, Mr. President. It is hard to \nfind evidence that regulations are dragging us down. Throughout the \nentire post-War period to the present, Mr. President, before the \nenactment of significant environmental, health, and safety regulations \nand after, our economy has continued to grow at a remarkably steady \npace.\n  When you look at the pattern of growth that our economy has been able \nto sustain over this period, Mr. President, it is impossible to detect \na point at which regulations become a burden.\n  Between 1980 and 1994, our industrial output rose more than 50 \npercent. In the past 3 years, it has increased 15 percent. Our output \nis now twice as high as it was in 1970, and five times as high as 1950.\n  Our productivity has risen about 3 percent per year in the past \ndecade. A recent comprehensive survey of the impact of environmental \nregulations--on those industries like chemicals, petroleum, and paper \nthat have had the most to clean up--showed little or no correlation \nbetween regulations and profits, competitiveness, or productivity.\n  Where is the evidence that the cost of regulations has exploded?\n  Where is the evidence that the cost of regulations has become a major \nburden on the growth of the economy?\n  It simply is not there, Mr. President.\n  In fact, there is persuasive evidence that regulation has generated \npositive overall effects for our economy, by spurring innovations and \neconomies.\n  We know that there are positive economic effects from lowering costly \nthreats to public health and safety, threats that take their toll in \nmedical bills, time lost on the jobs, and so forth. By making our \ncitizens healthier and safer, regulations make our economy more \nefficient, because we do not waste scarce resources paying for \npreventable illness and injury.\n  But in addition to preventing wasteful expenditures--and preventing \nunnecessary human suffering--regulations can have positive effects on \neconomic innovation.\n  Here is an example from that recent Business Week article: When OSHA \nissued a new standard for worker exposure to formaldehyde, costs to the \nindustry were estimated at $10 billion. But when the affected \nindustries changed the way they operated, the costs were negligible, \nand the changes improved their international competitiveness. The \nconclusion? The regulations were a large net plus for the industry and \nthe country.\n  Let us think about this for a minute, Mr. President. Does anyone here \nwant to argue that an economy that wastes less--that sends less of its \nwaste products into the environment in which its citizens live--is less \nefficient than an economy that spews tons of waste into the air and \nwater?\n  Logic does not support the idea that these regulations will make us \nless competitive--as a nation, over the long run--and the data do not \nsupport it, either.\n  So let us not let exaggerated costs and horror stories of regulatory \nexcess stampede us into a wholesale attack on regulations that, by and \nlarge, are doing what we want them to do.\n  But there is a real problem, Mr. President, one that is at the heart \nof the movement to reform regulations, a movement we should all \nsupport.\n  That problem is the lack of flexibility and the lack of openness in \nrule-making and enforcement of regulations. And that problem can be \ntraced to the arrogance and insensitivity of the public officials \ncharged with writing and enforcing many of our regulations.\n  It is fundamental, Mr. President--power corrupts. From the comically \nofficious church parking lot attendant on Sunday morning to the most \npowerful public officials, people's heads swell when they are given \npower over others. Our regulatory agencies are not immune from this law \nof human nature.\n  Mr. President, the abuse of private power by polluters, unsafe \nemployers, and sellers of dangerous products--that abuse of private \npower is the reason we need regulations.\n  And the abuse of public power by arrogant public officials is the \nreason we need regulatory reform.\n  It should be our job to fight both forms of abuse, not add momentum \nto that pendulum that swings from one extreme to the other.\n  Which of the two bills before us is more likely to remedy this \nproblem and still protect the public interest?\n  I am convinced that the Glenn-Chafee approach is the more balanced, \neffective way to restore common sense to the way we write our \nregulations, without putting punitive layers of paperwork and \nprocedures in the way of better regulations than we have today.\n  This approach requires a cost-benefit analysis and a risk assessment \nfor public safety, health, and environmental regulations that have a \nmajor impact--$100 million--on the economy.\n  It backs those up with specific requirements for peer review, \ncongressional review, and executive oversight of each agency's rule \nwriting. And the courts will examine each agency's compliance with the \nscientific and economic justifications for each rule.\n  It requires that agencies include flexible, market-based alternatives \nin their considerations, and makes them show how the rule they choose \nmatches up to those alternative for cost-effectiveness.\n  The Glenn-Chafee substitute calls for a thorough-going review of \nregulations now on the books, and sets up a procedure to assure that we \nhave a sensible way to rank the risks we face--from contaminated air, \nwater, or food, or from unsafe aircraft, cars, or toys. We will attack \nthe worst problems first, the best way to allocate our scarce \nresources.\n  Mr. President, the Glenn-Chafee substitute is tough, thoughtful \nreform.\n  Ironically, the Dole-Johnston bill adds to the costs of regulation by \nadding inflexible, prescriptive procedures to the process, subject to \npetition and judicial review requirements that could keep better \nrules--replacing the bad ones on the books today--from seeing the light \nof day.\n  But most significantly, it forces agencies to write every rule \naccording to fixed criteria--they must choose the least cost \nalternative among all the possible versions. But the cheapest rule may \nnot be the best--it depends on the circumstances, it requires more \nflexibility. \n\n[[Page S 10216]]\n\n  The cheapest broom may get the job done in most cases, but when you \nneed an operation, maybe you would consider paying a little more for \nthe best doctor you can afford. It depends on the problem you are \ntrying to solve.\n  Flexibility is not what the Dole-Johnston bill provides. Do we really \nthink that public officials will become more accommodating, more \nconcerned with differing circumstances, if they must, by law, choose \nthe rule that they can defend in court as the cheapest way to get the \njob done?\n  Maybe they could get the public more benefits for a little more \ncost--maybe they could write a rule that is more cost-effective. But \nnot under the Dole-Johnston bill.\n  Under the Dole-Johnston bill, agencies will practice defensive rule \nwriting--to conform to whatever the latest case law says is the \ncheapest way to do things. They are not encouraged to apply a variety \nof criteria--maybe in some cases, the cheapest rule is the best; maybe \nwe want to maximize the benefits in safety and health; maybe we want \nthe rule with the most net benefits--the spread between costs and \nbenefits.\n  But the Dole-Johnston bill is not concerned with flexibility--it \nmandates that every rule fit into the same box--the least cost box.\n  Furthermore, the Dole-Johnston bill will add bureaucracy and \nlitigation, instead of reducing it. For example, lawyers will be able \nto challenge rules--or prevent them from going into effect--by raising \nany of a number of new issues which they cannot now raise.\n  This will keep Washington lawyers busy, and will keep agency lawyers \nbusy. That means everyone will be in court--instead of out in the \nfield, enforcing the new regulations. And in an effort to avoid \nlawsuits in the future, agencies will practice defensive rulemaking--\nbeing overly cautious, spending enormous amounts of money and becoming \neven more bureaucratic.\n  This is not reform. It makes the regulatory system more bureaucratic, \nnot less. It results in more litigation and less policy. It makes it \nharder for the Government to respond to legitimate needs.\n  Furthermore, the bill includes new cumbersome and complicated \nprocesses by which industry and special interests can petition to have \nexisting rules thrown out. There are numerous of these petition \nprocesses in the Dole-Johnston bill--and each of them can be brought \ninto court if the agency denies the petition. That explosion in \nlitigation simply is not what regulatory reform is about.\n  The effect of these and other procedural hurdles would be either to \nrequire larger bureaucracies, with bigger budgets--or, more likely \nunder current conditions--to make the process of getting out new, \nbetter rules virtually endless.\n  If advocates of this gridlock think that hog-tying the bureaucracies \nwill reduce the public's demand for safety, health, and environmental \nprotection, they have seriously misread public opinion. The demand for \nthese protections will collide with the cumbersome process they have \ndevised, adding to the frustration with government--and to the \nhostility and suspicion of the special interests who are served by \ndelay and weakening of those protections.\n  Regulatory reform should be the way to make the system more flexible, \nmore open, but S. 343--the Dole-Johnston bill--would establish a more \ncostly, less flexible rule writing process.\n  Mr. President, S. 343 has been written to be just a bad mirror image \nof the process some imagine we have today. It will tie up agencies in \nnew procedures, adding to the costs and uncertainty of the regulatory \nprocess, the same complaints many citizens have rightfully leveled \nagainst the current process.\n  It would waste resources by piling requirements on rulemakers that \nadd nothing to the public safety and health, and add nothing to the \neffectiveness of the regulatory process, and will do nothing to make \nagencies more accommodating to the real needs of individuals, firms, \nand communities.\n  Now I know that some of my colleagues here today, and certainly some \nof those business men and women who feel themselves most aggrieved by \ncurrent regulations view the prospect of frustrating a few Federal \nbureaucrats eagerly.\n  Some may even see regulatory reform as pay back time: a chance to \ndump on Federal agencies some of the burdens they have felt.\n  Mr. President, I ask those who may feel that way to consider how they \nwill feel if the effect on the regulatory process is to make it more \ncomplex, more time-consuming, more uncertain. Will those who feel most \naggrieved by the current system be better served if they succeed in \ntheir attempt at retribution?\n  The fact is, Mr. President, that the big corporations whose \ncontributions have bought them access to the legislative process--those \ncorporations have always been able to make the system work. They play \nthe regulatory system like a harp, and they have helped to write the \nnew rules of the game, a game in which their deep pockets and hefty \nlegal staffs will carry a lot of weight.\n  But what about the guy who cannot sail or fish on the Delaware River, \nor cannot take his family to the beach, when our waters are not \nprotected? What about the family with crippling health care costs from \ntheir child's respiratory problems when our air is not clean?\n  What of the small businesswoman who just wanted a fair shake and a \nstraight answer, who is told by OSHA or the EPA, ``Sorry, that rule has \nbeen held up by another petition--we cannot tell you how to bring your \nbusiness into compliance?''\n  Mr. President, those of us who are rightfully proud of the \naccomplishments of public safety and health regulations should be among \nthe first to want them to work efficiently and effectively, without \nwaste of taxpayers' dollars and without antagonizing the citizens who \noperate the businesses and who own the property that are the subjects \nof so many of these regulations.\n  Any waste in the process, any wasted effort and dollars by those who \ncomply with these regulations, is a waste of resources that could be \nused to create another job--or to improve the quality of our air and \nwater, or increase the safety of our airways and highways.\n  The tough choices before us in the next few years will leave little \nroom for excess in any programs. Those of us who support the Glenn-\nChafee amendment recognize our continuing responsibility to promote the \ngeneral welfare; reform is essential to wringing every dime's worth of \nprotection out of every regulation.\n  We cannot maintain a regulatory process that thoughtlessly pushes the \ncost of regulation onto the people whose businesses create the \nproducts--and the jobs--we all depend on. We must not have a regulatory \nprocess that generates increasing resentment and frustration on the \npart of the businessmen and women whose behavior--and balance sheets--\nmust change to put our regulations into effect.\n  Mr. President, all Americans benefit from regulations that work well, \nand that work efficiently. And we are all poorer if our businesses \ndivert resources away from productive economic activity for regulations \nthat are not well designed.\n  But demonizing Federal regulations--legislating by anecdote, where \noften imaginary excesses are inflated into an anti-Government scenario \nof bureaucrats run amok--is surely not the way to accomplish real \nregulatory reform.\n  Now, Mr. President, I am impressed by the extent of the changes in S. \n343 since it was reported out of the Judiciary Committee. The sheer \nvolume of revisions confirms, I believe, the minority view back then \nthat it was seriously flawed and not ready for consideration by the \nfull Senate.\n  The changes also reflect the good work of many of my colleagues, \nincluding Senator Roth and Senator Johnston, who have lent their \nexpertise to remove some of the worst elements of the earlier version \nof S. 343. They have spent hours and hours over recent weeks debating \nand revising the details of what we all agree is a very complex, arcane \nbill.\n  But the volume of changes also has its downside, Mr. President. It \nmeans that this bill, in its current form, has never been the subject \nof committee hearings or debate. It has remained a moving target, \ndefying any attempt to analyze the cumulative implications of its many \ninterrelated subchapters and provisions. \n\n[[Page S 10217]]\n\n  In the process, it has become an amalgam of innumerable drafts and \nrevisions, last-minute concessions, and internal inconsistencies.\n  The Dole bill began as a proposal that would frustrate, not promote \nreform, by adding paperwork, delays, and costs to a system already \nswamped by procedures. The many changes that have been adopted in \nrecent weeks have blunted, but not deflected, its original intent.\n  That is why I am pleased to support the efforts of Senator Glenn, \nSenator Chafee, and many others, to revive a superior approach to \nlegislative reform, one that was subject to extensive hearings, and \nthat enjoyed a unanimous, bipartisan vote from the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee.\n  I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this alternative, that is \na tough, considered approach to regulatory reform, that raises the \nstandards for the regulations that will be written from now on, and \nthat provides a rational program to assure all earlier regulations meet \nthese new, higher standards.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to call upon my colleagues to take a \nleadership role to change the status quo, to reduce the cumulative \nregulatory burden that costs the average American family $6,000 per \nyear, and to ensure that we will have smarter, more cost-effective \nregulation that will benefit us all.\n  I rise to repeat once again that meaningful regulatory reform is \ncritical to ensuring that we reduce the regulatory burden while still \nensuring strong protections for health, safety, and the environment. \nThe answer to this problem is legislation that will make a difference. \nMake no mistake about it, the answer to this problem is the Dole-\nJohnston compromise, not the Glenn substitute.\n  Mr. President, there is no argument but what the regulatory process \nis broken. Virtually every authority who has studied the regulatory \nprocess--from Justice Stephen Breyer to the Carnegie Commission, from \nVice President Gore to the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, from \nscores of scholars to dozens of think tanks--agrees that the regulatory \nprocess needs to be reformed. And this problem is so undeniable that I \ndo not believe any of my colleagues would publicly deny that there is a \nproblem. But the question remains, who wants to do something about this \nproblem that none of us can deny?\n  I submit that the Dole-Johnston compromise, S. 343, will do something \nabout the problem. It will effect meaningful, responsible regulatory \nreform. And I regret to say that the Glenn substitute will not.\n  We all agree that we do not want to be where we are with Government \nregulation. We will admit that we need to move back to reform old rules \nand move ahead to be sure future rules make sense.\n  Mr. President, allow me to draw an analogy. You could compare S. 343 \nand the Glenn substitute to automobiles that purport to allow us to \ntake this journey which we all say we want to make.\n  As I detailed yesterday, if you look at these two vehicles, they look \nsimilar at first blush. From a distance, they both have provisions for \ncost-benefit analysis, review of existing rules, risk assessment, \ncomparative risk analysis, market mechanisms and performance standards, \nreform of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, congressional review of \nrules, and regulatory accounting.\n  When you try to start the Glenn vehicle, you find it does not go \nbackward. It will not ensure that old, irrational rules already on the \nbooks are reviewed and reformed. You will find that the Glenn vehicle \ndoes not go forward. It does not have a focused cost-benefit test which \nwill ensure that new rules make sense, that their benefits justify \ntheir costs. When you look under the hood of the Glenn vehicle, you \nwill find to your surprise that it has no engine. The judicial review \nprovision is so weak that an agency can do a very sloppy job of doing a \ncost-benefit analysis or other analysis and then does not have to act \nupon that analysis, so it makes a difference on the rule. And there is \nlittle anyone can do about it.\n  Now, what good is this--a car that cannot go in reverse, cannot go \nforward, and has no engine? That vehicle will get you nowhere. That is \nthe Glenn substitute. If we are to have that, we may as well not have a \nregulatory reform statute because the Glenn substitute represents \nnothing but the status quo.\n  Mr. President, I need to take a little time to dispel a very serious \nmisconception that some people have about the Glenn substitute, and \nthat is it is not--it is not--the Roth bill. The Glenn substitute is \nnot by a long shot S. 291, the bill that I introduced in January and \nthat was reported unanimously out of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee.\n  While S. 291 was itself a compromise and was originally adopted by \nSenator Glenn as S. 1001, he has now taken steps to fatally weaken it.\n  Let me briefly highlight a few major departures. First, the Glenn \nsubstitute seriously weakens the lookback provision that was in the \nRoth bill. The Roth bill required agencies to review all major rules in \na 10-year period or be subject to sunset or termination.\n  The revised Glenn substitute now makes the review of rules a purely \nvoluntary undertaking. There are no firm requirements about the number \nof rules to be reviewed or which rules to review. In other words, it is \na matter up to the sole discretion of the agency. There are no \nrequirements about the number of rules, if any, that have to be \nreviewed.\n  A second major change. Senator Glenn's substitute guts the judicial \nreview provision that was in the Roth bill. Section 623(e) of the Roth \nbill and the original Glenn bill stated that the cost-benefit analysis \nand risk assessment shall, to the extent relevant, be considered by a \ncourt in determining the legality of the agency action, and that meant \nthat the court should focus on the cost-benefit analysis in determining \nwhether the rule was arbitrary and capricious.\n  The Glenn substitute strikes that language. That weakens the whole \nbill. That means the Glenn vehicle has no engine. The Glenn substitute \ndoes adopt cost-benefit language that was in the Roth bill. But without \nany meaningful judicial review, the cost-benefit test does not mean \nmuch at all. For a reviewing court, the analysis is just another piece \nof paper among the thousands of pieces of paper in the rulemaking \nrecord.\n  The Glenn substitute asks the agency to publish a determination \nwhether the benefits justify the costs. But the Glenn substitute does \nnot push regulators to issue rules whose benefits actually do justify \ntheir costs. I have always believed we need a stronger cost-benefit \ntest.\n  In effect, the Glenn substitute merely asks the agency to do a cost-\nbenefit analysis. However, the agency can do a poor analysis and, worse \nstill, does not have to act upon the analysis. In other words, the \ncost-benefit analysis need not make a difference in the rule. The rule \ncan still be inefficient and ineffective. This is not the Roth bill. \nThis is not what I want, and it is not what the American people want.\n  Mr. President, the Dole-Johnston compromise is the proper vehicle for \nregulatory reform. It will allow us to go back to review old rules on \nthe books. It will allow us to go forward and to ensure, as a general \nrule, new rules will have benefits that justify their costs. It has an \nengine to ensure we will get where we want. And I urge my colleagues \nwho want real regulatory reform to set aside partisan politics and join \nme in supporting the Dole-Johnston compromise.\n  The truth is, if you compare the Dole bill and the Glenn bill section \nby section, they, at first blush, look a lot alike. At bottom, there \nare some very key, important differences. First, meaningful regulatory \nreform must change future rules. The key to ensuring that new rules \nwill be efficient and cost-effective is to have an effective cost-\nbenefit test. The Dole bill has a focused cost-benefit test. The \ndecisional criteria in section 624 ensures that the benefits of a rule \nwill justify its cost unless prohibited by the underlying law \nauthorizing the rule.\n  In contrast, the Glenn bill has no cost-benefit decisional criteria. \nThe bill requires that a cost-benefit analysis be done, but the bill \ndoes not require that the cost-benefit analysis be used or that the \nrule will be affected by \n\n[[Page S 10218]]\nthe cost-benefit analysis. The agency only has to publish a \ndetermination whether the benefits of a rule will justify its cost and \nwhether the regulation is cost effective. But the Glenn bill does not \npush regulators to issue rules whose benefits actually do justify their \ncosts. I have always believed that an effective regulatory reform bill \nshould have a stronger cost-benefit test.\n  Some of my colleagues have complained about the least cost component \nof the decisional criteria. Many of us have been willing and have \nsought to negotiate language to substitute for or remedy some of the \nconcerns as expressed by my colleague, but I want now to return to a \nsecond point about regulatory reform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator that under a \nprevious order, the Senate was to recess at 12:30 and not to reconvene \nuntil 2:15.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has the floor.\n\n\n                      Extension of Time for Recess\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the recess \nordered for 12:30 p.m. today be delayed in order that Senator Daschle \nbe recognized to speak for a period of not more than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Roth \nbe permitted to speak until the minority leader reaches the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. President, as I was saying, I want to return to a second point \nabout regulatory reform. Effective regulatory reform cannot be \nprospective only. It must look back to reform old rules already on the \nbooks, and the Dole-Johnston compromise contains a balanced, workable \nand fair resolution of how agencies should review existing rules. \nAgencies may select for themselves any particular rules that they think \nneed reexamination, while allowing interested parties to petition the \nagency to add an overlooked rule.\n  To ensure that only a limited number of petitions will be filed, S. \n343 limits petitions to major rules and sets a high burden of proof. \nPetitioners must show a substantial likelihood that the rule could not \nsatisfy the cost-benefit decisional criteria of section 624. This is an \nefficient and workable method to review problematic rules.\n  The Glenn substitute, on the other hand, makes the review of agency \nrules a voluntary undertaking. There are no firm requirements for \naction, no set rules to be reviewed, no binding standard, no meaningful \ndeadline.\n  The Glenn substitute simply asks that every 5 years, the agency issue \na schedule of rules that each agency, in its sole discretion, thinks \nmerits review. It does not require any particular number of rules to be \nreviewed, and if someone asks the agency to review a particular rule, \nthere is no judicial review of a decision declining to place the rule \non the schedule. Moreover, there is no judicial review of any of the \ndeadlines for completing the review of any rules.\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ROTH. My time is limited, so I want to continue.\n  The third point I want to emphasize is that effective regulatory \nreform must be enforceable to be effective. That means there has to be \nsome opportunity for judicial review of the requirements of the \nlegislation, just as there is with most any law Congress passed. S. 343 \nstrikes a balance by allowing limited but effective judicial review.\n  S. 343 carves away from the standard level of judicial review \nprovided by the Administrative Procedures Act which has existed for \nalmost 50 years. The limited judicial review provided by S. 343 will \nhelp discourage frivolous lawsuits, and that is why S. 343 has limited \njudicial review.\n  An agency's compliance or noncompliance with the provisions of S. 343 \ncan be considered by a court to some degree. The court can, based on \nthe whole rulemaking record, determine whether the agencies \nsufficiently complied with the cost-benefit analysis and risk \nassessment requirements of S. 343 so that the rule passes muster upon \nthe arbitrary and capricious standard.\n  The arbitrary and capricious standard is very deferential to the \nagency. A court would uphold the rule unless the agency's cost-benefit \nanalysis or risk assessment was so flawed that the rule itself was \narbitrary and capricious. The court would not strike down a rule merely \nbecause there were some minor procedural missteps in the cost-benefit \nanalysis or risk assessment.\n  In contrast, the Glenn substitute, as now redrafted, does not permit \nmeaningful judicial review of the risk assessment or cost-benefit \nanalysis. The Glenn substitute only requires a court to invalidate a \nrule if the cost-benefit analysis or risk assessment was not done at \nall.\n But the Glenn substitute does not really allow the court to consider \nwhether the cost-benefit analysis or risk assessment was done properly. \nIndeed, the language of the legislation has been so weakened that now \nsubstantial portions of this bill are irrelevant to the extent that a \ncourt could not require the agency to perform the cost-benefit \nanalysis, the risk assessment or peer review in the manner prescribed \nby the bill.\n\n  Compliance with cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment \nrequirements of the bill would be optional by the agency, the same way \nit is optional for them to comply with the Executive order that now \nrequires these analyses.\n  Now, Senator Glenn has claimed that his bill is essentially the same \nas S. 291 which, of course, is the regulatory reform bill I introduced \nin January, which did receive bipartisan support of the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs. I say, as I stated earlier, that while the \noriginal Glenn bill was similar to the Roth bill, the latest version of \nthe Glenn bill seriously differs from the Roth bill. Many of the \nprovisions have been weakened. The Roth bill and the original Glenn \nbill required agencies to review all major rules in a 10-year period \nwith a possible 5-year extension, or the rules would sunset or \nterminate. The revised Glenn substitute lacked any firm requirement \nabout the number of bills to be reviewed.\n  Now, Mr. President, I think that is a very important and very \nsignificant change. As a matter of fact, as I said earlier, anyone who \nhas reviewed the regulatory rules on the books have agreed that many of \nthem are, today, irrelevant, cumbersome, and not equipped to do the job \nthat they were intended. These studies have been made by distinguished \norganizations, including a group at Harvard. Our former colleague, and \nnow Vice President Gore, has stated on a number of occasions, as part \nof his program to reinvent Government, that many regulations are \nundesirable. So I think it is a very, very serious mistake the way the \nGlenn substitute has weakened the lookback provisions of this \nlegislation.\n  As I said, my original bill required all rules to be reviewed in a \n10-year period, subject to a 5-year extension, and if a rule were not \nreviewed in that period of time, then, of course, the rule would be \nterminated. Under the revised Glenn substitute, that is not the case. \nIt leaves everything entirely in the discretion of the agency head. An \nagency head could provide a 5-year schedule of reviewing rules that \nincludes many appropriate rules. On the other hand, he or she could \ninclude one, zero, or five, as there are no requirements in the current \nversion of the Glenn legislation that rules be reviewed.\n  As I say, I think this is a serious mistake. Worse still, Senator \nGlenn has weakened the judicial review provision that was in the Roth \nbill and that originally appeared in the Glenn bill. Here I have \nreference to section 623(E) of the Roth bill, the original bill, which \nstated that the cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment shall, to the \nextent relevant, be considered by a court in determining the legality \nof the agency action.\n  This is a matter that is particularly bothersome, because what the \nproposed legislation provides is that an agency will make a cost-\nbenefit analysis and, where appropriate, it will make a risk \nassessment. But there is no requirement in the Glenn substitute that \neither the cost-benefit analysis or risk assessment be used in the \nrulemaking process. Now, it seems to me that that destroys the whole \npurpose of regulatory reform. I think many of us feel very strongly \nthat regulatory reform, \n\n[[Page S 10219]]\nas a general rule, means that benefits should justify costs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time before the \nrecess be further extended for a statement to be made by the majority \nleader, following the statement of the minority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the distinguished \nSenator from Delaware accommodating both myself and the majority \nleader.\n  Mr. President, over the last week we have debated a regulatory reform \nbill that poses a number of serious concerns. Senators have come to the \nfloor with amendments to address those concerns for over a week now.\n  It has become increasingly clear that in order to produce a bill that \nwill be acceptable to a majority of this body and the President, \nsignificant changes will need to be made. Frankly, given the way the \ndebate has gone--the fact that we have until now been unable to pass \nmost of our amendments--I am not optimistic that we will be able to \nbring this bill into a form that is reasonable and responsible, unless \nthe circumstances change.\n  Despite efforts last week to clarify that the bill will not override \nexisting law, the so-called least-cost standard that remains will drive \nagencies away from choosing more cost-effective and thus economically \nsensible and justifiable regulatory options.\n  Last week, the Senate rejected by one vote my amendment to protect \nthe ability of the Department of Agriculture to issue its proposed rule \nrequiring science-based hazard analysis and critical control point, or \nHACCP, systems in meat and poultry inspections.\n  I later learned that while I was here on the Senate floor recounting \nthe story of 2-year-old Cullen Mack, a young boy from South Dakota who \nfell ill from eating beef contaminated with E. coli bacteria, people \nwere suffering from E. coli poisoning in at least four States: Georgia, \nTennessee, Wisconsin, and Illinois.\n  So, despite the fact that we are confronted presently by real gaps in \nour ability to ensure a safer food supply, and despite the fact that \nthe USDA rule would take a huge step toward that goal, we continue to \nhave a bill that would subject that rule to legal challenge and \nconsequent delay.\n  Farmers have special concerns about this bill. The Department of \nAgriculture each year issues regulations to implement the farm \nprogram-- regulations that address wheat, wool, rice, cotton, and \nfeedgrain programs. The Department issues regulations to implement the \nFederal crop insurance program and the Conservation Reserve Program. \nUSDA marketing orders--orders which are voluntarily approved by \nagricultural producers--are implemented through Federal regulations.\n  Many, if not all, of these regulations would be subject to the cost-\nbenefit and risk assessment delays of this bill. They would be subject \nto the decision criteria in the bill calling for the least-cost option, \nand they would be subject to judicial challenge. Do we really want to \nforeclose regulatory options that would provide greater benefits to \nfarmers? Is this what we really want for rural America? I certainly do \nnot think that this makes sense for South Dakota or any other rural \nState.\n  Recently, the majority leader, came to the floor of the Senate to \ndiscuss the power of shame. His comments were made in the context of \nthe public debate over the content of Hollywood movies.\n  The leader made the point that shame can be a very valuable tool in \nthe effort to encourage movie-makers to be more socially responsible in \nwriting and producing movies. I agree. I think that in this society, \nshame can be a very powerful means of encouraging more responsible \nbehavior.\n  Certainly, the evidence is clear that the Community-Right-To-Know \nProgram has been able to put shame to good use. What industry wants to \ndeclare year after year that they are releasing poisons into the air \nand water of local communities? What industry is so callous that it is \nnot moved to reduce those releases when faced with public disclosure of \nits behavior?\n  Why, then, if we can agree that shame is such a powerful tool, are we \nattempting to erode the effectiveness of the toxic release inventory--\nknown as the Community-Right-To-Know Program--in this bill?\n  Last Thursday, this body voted against an amendment by Senators \nBaucus and Lautenberg to protect the Community-Right-To-Know Program.\n  Apparently, despite the clear success of this program in getting \nindustries to cut their releases of toxic chemicals, shame is too tough \na medicine for some industries to endure. Instead of shaming the \nspecial interests into responsible behavior, the Senate essentially \ndefended the special interests' shameful behavior.\n  In addition to the special-interest fixes and the willingness of the \nsponsors of the bill to undermine even the most needed and supported \nrules, there are countless opportunities for petitions in the bill that \nwill consume vast agency resources. Petitions themselves are subject to \njudicial review, increasing the likelihood of delay and administrative \nburden.\n  The sum effect of all these provisions would create havoc with out \nability to protect public safety. The Office of Management and Budget \nestimated that the Dole-Johnson bill would cost the Federal Government \nroughly $1.3 billion to implement, including the salaries of an \nadditional 4,500 full-time Federal employees, who would be needed to \nfulfill the bills' requirements. I am skeptical that the bill itself \ncould even pass a cost-benefit test. It may well impose more costs on \nthe Federal Government--and thus the taxpayers--than it purports to \nsave in regulatory expenses.\n  At a time when we are trying to downsize the Government and balance \nthe Federal budget, it makes little sense to consider legislation that \nwould reverse our course. Last week, the House appropriators \nrecommended cutting the Environmental Protection Agency's budget by \none-third. Other Federal agencies will surely feel the budget knife \nthis year and in the years to come.\n  Where will the money to pay the costs of this bill come from? Where \nwill we find this army of analysts to fulfill all the new requirements \nof this bill? Who will pay for them?\n  The primary beneficiaries of this bill will be the large corporate \nlaw firms, which undoubtedly will enjoy a renaissance of business if it \nbecomes law. The judicial review provisions invite a morass of \nlitigation. In fact, I understand that there will be at least 144 \ndifferent issues that can be litigated, if this bill is enacted. It is \nironic that this body passed legislation limiting opportunities for \nlitigation earlier this year and now stands poised to pass a bill \ndesigned to create an explosion of litigation.\n  Mr. President, no Senator would agree that every regulation that has \never been issued by the Federal Government makes good sense. All of us \nMembers recognize that excesses occur in the development and \nenforcement of rules.\n  In many cases, we in Congress are to blame, as we enact laws that \nprovide little or ambiguous regulatory guidance. Federal agencies are \nstaffed by human beings, who are known to make mistakes from time to \ntime. The political winds frequently change, carrying the Federal \nagencies in different and often inconsistent directions. So, the entire \nprocess is imperfect.\n  The question we are confronted with, then, is how can we improve the \nregulatory development process without crippling the ability of the \nFederal Government to protect the quality of our food supply, our \nwater, our air, and all the other of those services that Americans have \ncome to expect.\n  The bill we have been debating now for a week was seriously flawed \nwhen it was introduced, and our efforts to improve it have been \nthwarted. It remains a bill that could be used to undermine the ability \nof the Federal Government to carry out its responsibility to protect \nour environment and the health of American families. It is not \nemblematic of the type of society that most Americans believe we should \nbe striving for, and should not be enacted in its current form.\n  The alternative regulatory reform bill that has been introduced by \nSenators Glenn, Chafee, and others would provide serious, constructive \nreform that I believe should gain broad support. Unlike the Dole bill, \nthe Glenn-\n\n[[Page S 10220]]\nChafee bill would limit the opportunities for litigation to the \nfundamental question of whether the rule is a major rule and whether \nthe final rule is arbitrary and capricious, taking into account the \nentire rulemking record. Unlike the Dole bill, it does not allow \njudicial review of the agency decisions to grant or deny petitions.\n  The Glenn-Chafee bill contains no special-interest fixes, which do \nnot belong in a procedural bill like this and which should only be \naddressed through hearings and legislation debated within the \ncommittees of jurisdiction.\n  The Glenn-Chafee alternative does not impose rigid criteria of the \nDole bill that agencies must apply when selecting a regulatory option, \ndriving agencies toward the cheapest, but not necessarily the most \ncost-effective, alternative.\n  I think we can all agree that the costs and benefits of proposed \nrules should be considered during their development. But calculating \nthose costs and benefits can present a great challenge.\n  What is the value of ensuring that our children and grandchildren do \nnot suffer the effects of lead on their ability to reason? What is the \nvalue of ensuring that when we take our families to see the Grand \nCanyon, the air will be clean and we will have a clear view of that \nincredible vista? Given the extreme challenges in characterizing these \nvalues, does it make sense to apply such a rigid test to the rules that \nwill effect the quality of our lives so profoundly?\n  The Glenn-Chafee substitute places cost-benefit analysis in proper \nperspective. It requires agencies to identify the costs and benefits of \nproposed rules, but does not elevate cost considerations above all \nelse. The cheapest option is not always the best or the most cost-\neffective one.\n  The Glenn-Chafee bill follows an approach that I believe provides a \nfar better representation of the goals and objectives of mainstream \nAmerica with respect to regulatory reform. Apparently the Governmental \nAffairs Committee agrees with me.\n  I say that because the Glenn-Chafee is nearly identical to the bill \npassed unanimously by the Governmental Affairs Committee. It is \nmoderate and sensible, and I believe it should serve as a model for \nreforming the regulatory process. The modifications that Senators Glenn \nand Chafee subsequently made to the Governmental Affairs-passed bill \nrepresent good, sensible improvements.\n  First, we have eliminated the arbitrary sunset for existing rules, \nthat would have occurred whenever an agency failed to perform the \nneeded review in a timely manner. Given the history of antagonism to \nenvironmental and public health and safety regulations that have been \ndemonstrated by recent administrations, it does not make sense to \nprovide future administrations that might also be antagonistic to such \nrules with the incentive to intentionally fail to perform reviews as a \nback-door means of repealing existing rules and thwarting the will of \nCongress.\n  Second, the Glenn-Chafee bill eliminates the narrative definition of \nmajor rules, adding clarity to the bill, and limiting its scope so as \nnot to overburden Federal agencies.\n  Finally, the Glenn-Chafee alternative incorporates technical changes \nto the risk assessment portions of the bill to more closely track \nrecommendations made by the National Academy of Sciences, and to cover \nspecific programs, not merely agencies.\n  These changes strengthen the bill, make it more responsible and more \nreasonable. If the Senate is interested in real reform and wants to \npass a bill that can be signed into law then I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this substitute.\n  Mr. President, I know the distinguished majority leader is here. To \naccommodate him and allow Senators to get to the caucus, I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader, Senator \nDaschle. I will take just a moment. I want to review for my colleagues. \nI think we made some progress on the regulatory reform bill. I think \neverybody would like to vote for regulatory reform.\n  There are some limits. We cannot accommodate everyone's request. We \nwould have a bill that many on this side and many on that side would \nnot vote for if we tried to accommodate every request.\n  There will be a cloture vote immediately after the vote on the so-\ncalled Glenn-Chafee substitute. I think there will be a third cloture \nvote. As I set out in the schedule, hopefully we would finish this bill \ntoday, to start on Bosnia late this evening or early tomorrow morning.\n  There has been a cloture petition filed. There could be a third \ncloture vote. I have not made that final determination. Sooner or \nlater, we have to recognize we have just about accommodated everybody \nwe can. We have made a number of major changes in this legislation. \nSome are concerned that perhaps we made too many--``we,'' talking about \nthe people who manage the bill and understand the bill.\n  We think it is a good bill. It is real regulatory reform. It is what \nthe American people are demanding. It is what small businessmen, \nfarmers, ranchers, everybody else is demanding. We believe it is time \nto come to grips with it, and move on to something else.\n  We have had parts of 9 days on this bill. That seems to be a standard \non the Senate side. Everything takes 9 days. Maybe this will take 10 \ndays. I do not know that the end is in sight. I alert my colleagues, if \nyou are for regulatory reform, vote for cloture; if you are opposed to \nregulation reform, vote no, as you did yesterday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/18/senate-section/article/S10189-4", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RECESS UNTIL 2:15\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and \nsworn not having voted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I rise to express serious reservations about S. 343, the \nregulatory reform bill. After listening to over a week's debate, I \nremain doubtful that a vote in favor of S. 343 would serve the best \ninterests of the American people. While I support carefully crafted \nregulatory reform efforts like the Glenn-Chafee substitute, S. 343 does \nnot meet my standards nor the standards of the people of New Jersey.\n  I doubt whether my constituents want new red tape requirements which \nwould delay long-awaited regulations for food safety, drinking water \nquality, worker protections and pollution control. Even with the \nchanges adopted during the last week, S. 343 is still a prescription \nfor delay, duplication, and judicial gridlock.\n  S. 343 is not true reform. It is full of exemptions and special \ninterest provisions unrelated to the basic bill or which give \nassistance to particular industries. Its provisions will swamp agencies \nwith requirements for hundreds of new, costly, and time-consuming \nanalyses and it will undermine needed health, safety and environmental \nregulations already on the books.\n  S. 343 is filled with new opportunities for endless rounds of \njudicial review. Yesterday, our colleague Senator John Kerry stated \nthat the bill still contained 88 new places for court intervention in \nthe regulatory process, despite the efforts of many Senators to improve \nthis aspect of S. 343.\n  S. 343 could result in the sunset of many regulations if agencies \nfailed to review them accordingly to required time schedules. Even \nworse, the schedules themselves might be manipulated by special \ninterests who could overload agency review agendas and tie them up \nuntil regulations expired.\n  Finally, S. 343 still includes language which favors the least cost \nand not the most cost-effective regulations--an affront to common sense \nwhich could result in missed opportunities for sensible regulatory \nrevisions.\n  Mr. President, this country needs regulatory reform. Regulated \nbusinesses and individuals deserve the most flexible, cost-effective \nregulations agencies can craft while still providing the protections \nCongress has provided and all of us need. But it is also time for us to \nadmit the real cause of many regulatory complaints--overly prescriptive \nand sloppily drafted legislation.\n  While this bill needs further work, I hope we can resume negotiations \nand produce a regulatory reform bill we all can support.\n                           Amendment No. 1487\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I rise to express my support for \nthe substitute regulatory reform amendment currently pending before the \nSenate. I commend Senator Dole for putting together a measure that is \nbalanced, fair and commands bipartisan support. Certainly, we need \nFederal regulations to protect the public health and safety. But the \nrules must be reasonable. They must make sense. That is exactly what \nthe Dole substitute amendment attempts to ensure.\n  Mr. President, when I talk with South Dakotans, few topics raise \ntheir blood pressure faster than when they describe their frustrating \ndealings with the Federal bureaucracy. Government is supposed to work \nfor us, not against us. Yet time after time, I hear horror stories of \nWashington bureaucrats running amok, imposing complicated, costly and \nsilly rules.\n  Our current regulatory system is too large, too complicated, too \nburdensome, and too expensive. Worst of all, it is rapidly growing out \nof control. In the first two years of the Clinton administration, \nalmost 140,000 pages of new Federal regulations were published. This is \nexcessive. There is no way small businesses, local governments, or \nfarmers and ranchers in South Dakota can possibly keep up with the \nchanges.\n  Our current system costs all of us dearly. According to Thomas \nHopkins, an economics professor at the Rochester Institute of \nTechnology and the former Deputy Administrator of the Office of \nManagement and Budget, OMB, every American household spends about $4000 \nof their hard-earned income annually to comply with Federal \nregulations. As a nation, we spend between $500 and $800 billion each \nyear.\n  The overwhelming majority of Americans agree the Federal bureaucracy \nneeds an overhaul. Last November's election was a clear indication for \nsmaller, smarter government with less redtape. This legislation takes a \nbig step in that direction. Its main provision simply would require \nthat before major new regulations are enacted, Federal regulators must \nshow that the benefits justify the costs. This is simple common sense. \nIt would force Federal regulations to be reasonable. If a Federal \nregulator cannot show that the costs of a proposed rule are justified \nby the benefits, why should we allow it be implemented? Common sense \nsays we should not. This is a sensible hurdle that newly proposed rules \nshould be required to clear.\n  Mr. President, let me give two recent examples of ridiculous Federal \nregulations that demonstrate the need for this legislation. The U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA, is charged with enforcing our \nNation's safe drinking water laws. In an effort to enforce the law, the \nEPA zealously over interprets congressional intent. In effect, they \nrewrite the law ``raising the bar'' for municipalities by requiring \nexcessively burdensome water standards without comparing the costs of \ntheir rules to the benefits they hope to achieve.\n  Each year it seems, state and local officials are told last year's \nwater standards are no longer good enough. They are forced by the EPA \nto perform costly new tests for presences in their water supply. \nUnfortunately, the EPA \n\n[[Page S 10222]]\nfrequently relies on questionable evidence to show why the changes are \nnecessary. For many rural communities in South Dakota, excessive \ndrinking water standards threaten to break their small budgets.\n  Recently, the EPA has proposed yet another standard--one that would \nrequire communities to regulate sulfate levels in drinking water \nsupplies. This proposed standard has been made despite the fact there \nis no valid scientific showing of harm resulting from higher levels of \nsulfate. Congress instructed the EPA to study this issue. However, \ninstead of evaluating the health risk of sulfate in drinking water, the \nEPA proposed a sweeping rule to allow no more than 500 milligrams of \nsulfate per liter of drinking water. When promulgating the proposed \nrule, the EPA did not consider the costs of compliance. They have not \nexplained or justified the supposed benefits the rule attempts to \nattain. They also have not given any reliable scientific basis for this \nrule.\n  The costs of enacting the proposed sulfate regulation would be \nenormous. It would affect roughly one-quarter of all the water systems \nin South Dakota--108 of the 483 water systems in the State. The South \nDakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources, DENR, which \nopposes the EPA's proposed sulfate rule, has estimated the costs of \ncompliance for those water systems would be $40 to $60 million. That is \njust the initial cost of compliance--not including operation and \nmaintenance costs. Small, rural communities in South Dakota should not \nbe forced to pay such a high price to enforce a regulation that has no \nvalid scientific justification.\n  Let me put these figures in real terms we can all understand. The \nlargest of the 108 affected communities is Madison, SD, with a \npopulation of 6,395 people. Currently, the average water bill for each \nhousehold in Madison is $13.75 per month. According to the South Dakota \nDENR, if the proposed rule is enacted, the additional cost to each \nhousehold would be about $10 per month. That would mean an average \nmonthly water bill of $23.75, or a 73 percent increase over current \nbills. Remember, this figure is for the largest of the affected \ncommunities, which presumably would be the most able to absorb the \ncosts of compliance.\n  Let us take Big Stone City, SD, as another example. With a population \nof 670 people, Big Stone City has the median population of the 108 \ncommunities in South Dakota affected by the proposed rule. Currently, \nthe average monthly water bill per household in Big Stone City is \n$9.80. If the EPA has its way, each household in that community would \nsee its water bill rise $27.50 for a total monthly bill of $37.30. That \nwould be an astonishing 281 percent increase. Again, Big Stone City is \nthe median size of the affected communities. Just imagine the impact \nthe EPA's rule would have on communities smaller than Big Stone City.\n  Mr. President, what would these communities get in return for these \nshocking rate increases? Nothing. That is right. For years, South \nDakotans have been drinking water containing sulfate with no apparent \nadverse health effects. The EPA has not been able to show \nscientifically that higher levels of sulfate in drinking water pose a \nreal health threat to humans. The proposed rule would ensure drinking \nwater has less sulfate, but that does not mean it is safer water. \nHowever, an EPA bureaucrat thinks the Federal Government should \nregulate sulfate. These plans are being made regardless of the enormous \ncosts involved on small communities. This situation does not make \nsense.\n  Mr. President, as I stated earlier, clearly we need to take \nprecautions to ensure the quality of our drinking water. However, \ncommon sense says, before spending billions nationwide to comply with a \nnew regulation, we should ensure the benefits are worth the costs. The \nEPA should be required to demonstrate why it now believes sulfate is \ndangerous to human health. They should have to show how the benefits of \ntheir new rule justify the enormous costs it would impose on small \ncommunities like Madison and Big Stone City. That is what the Dole \nsubstitute would require of the EPA. Is that too much to ask?\n  Mr. President, let me give another example of a ridiculous Federal \nregulation that, several months ago, threatened farmers and ranchers in \nmy State. The proposed regulation concerned the Endangered Species Act. \nEarlier this spring, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service considered \nlisting prairie dogs under the Endangered Species Act, entitling them \nto numerous protections under Federal law, despite the fact there are \n71 times more prairie dogs than people in South Dakota. Let me repeat \nthat: in South Dakota, there are 71 prairie dogs for every man, woman \nand child--yet, earlier this year, Federal bureaucrats actually \nconsidered listing them as an endangered or threatened species.\n  Once a species has been listed under the act, certain uses of the \nland inhabited by the species can be prohibited until the condition of \nthe species has improved to the point it can be taken off the list. \nVirtually, the entire western half of South Dakota potentially could \nhave been affected. Fortunately, there are no longer plans to list the \nprairie dog as endangered or threatened. However, it still may be \nlisted as a ``candidate species'' entitled to some level of Federal \nprotection.\n  There are millions of prairie dogs in South Dakota digging even more \nmillions of holes. Their holes are a real menace to cattle and horses. \nRanchers are forced to destroy livestock which step in the holes and \nbreak their legs. Prairie dogs also eat grass and other vegetation, a \nsparse commodity in the western half of my State.\n  How can anyone believe prairie dogs are a threatened species facing \npossible extinction? Farmers and ranchers in my home State do not \nunderstand this. I do not either. If this absurd rule had been enacted, \nkilling prairie dogs would have been a Federal offense. Their \npopulation quickly would have grown far beyond their current numbers--\ncausing more harm and destruction to South Dakota farmers and \nranchers--all with the Federal Government's blessing. If the situation \nseveral months ago were not so serious, it would have been laughable.\n  These examples show why people in my home State are fed up with the \nFederal regulatory process. I am too. Is it any wonder why we believe \nthe Federal bureaucracy is out of control and must be reined in? South \nDakotans certainly want safe drinking water, safe food and a clean \nenvironment. But they also want Federal rules that are reasonable, \nunderstandable and flexible to allow as much compliance as possible.\n  That is why I support the Dole substitute amendment. If it were \nenacted the EPA could not implement its proposed sulfate rule until it \ncan show that the benefits of the rule justify the enormous costs \ninvolved. Again, is that too much to ask?\n  In addition to benefiting consumers, this legislation also would have \na positive impact on small businesses in my State. The current level of \nregulation from Washington puts an incredible burden on small \nbusinesses. Over-regulation chokes businesses in paperwork, stifles \ninnovative ideas and undermines the ability of American businesses to \ncompete in international markets. I have talked to many small \nbusinessmen and women who believe due to the sheer number of \nregulations, the complexity of the rules, and the different standards \nof enforcement between areas of the country and even between different \ninspectors, it is impossible for them not to be in violation of some \nregulation at any given time. This situation is not acceptable.\n  We greatly need to move the Federal bureaucracy away from the \n``gotcha'' mentality many have toward American business. Regulators \nshould not see themselves exclusively as ``super-cops,'' as many do, \nwaiting to pounce on any business that violates some regulation in the \nmost technical way. Regulators need to develop a cooperative \nrelationship with businesses. Both should work together to find \ninnovative and cost-effective ways to comply with the spirit of the law \nas intended by Congress, rather than with hyper-technical regulations.\n  American business is not the enemy. The vast majority of small \nbusinesses are run by fine, ethical businessmen and women who want to \nobey the law, not skirt it. They want to be good corporate citizens. \nThey do not seek ways to bend or break the law. They work hard to treat \ntheir employees fairly. \n\n[[Page S 10223]]\nThey spend considerable amounts of money to provide a safe workplace \nfor them. They do this not because the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration, OSHA, or the Department of Labor require such action. \nThey do it because it makes good, sound business sense. After all, \nsatisfied employees are productive employees.\n  Judging from the enormous amounts of new Federal regulations \ncontinually being issued, however, you might think each American \nbusiness spends all its time devising ways to bend or break the law. \nEvery aspect of business life increasingly is being regulated. That has \nto stop.\n  Mr. President, to conclude, let me again state my support for the \nDole substitute. The country needs less regulation from Washington. No \none in my home State thinks there are too few Government regulations. \nNo small business has asked me for more Government paperwork to fill \nout. No farmer or rancher has requested yet more restrictions on how \nthey can use their own land.\n  The country needs less regulation. South Dakotans know Washington \ncannot regulate away our problems. Too many rules are on the books and \nnot enough common sense is in the system. In short: Federal rulemaking \nneeds an overhaul. The Dole substitute amendment would help reduce the \nnumber of rules generated by Washington. It would establish a sensible \nhurdle for new regulations: the costs must be justified by the \nbenefits. That is simple common sense. The regulatory system cannot \ncontinue as it has been promulgating rule after rule with little \nconcern for their practical effect. Is that asking too much? I urge my \ncolleagues to support and vote for this legislation.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act \nof 1995 is a response to the belief that our executive branch agencies \nhave become unreasonable in their regulation of the behavior of \nbusinesses and individuals. This is a powerful idea whose influence \nhas, until recently, been underestimated. No longer. This is the third \ntime this year that the Senate has considered legislation to restrain \nsuch Government action.\n  On January 27, 1995, the Senate passed S. 1, the Unfunded Mandates \nReform Act, which requires Congress to acknowledge, by recorded vote, \nthe costs imposed by Federal laws on State and local governments, as \nwell as on the private sector. President Clinton signed the unfunded \nmandates on March 22, 1995.\n  Just 2 months later, the Senate passed S. 219, the Regulatory \nTransition Act, which established a 45-day review period for \ncongressional review of regulations. Conferees are now attempting to \nreconcile that bill with the House-passed legislation, which places a \ntemporary moratorium on Federal rulemaking.\n  The same concerns have prompted the Senate to take up the \nComprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995 now before us. A central \nelement of this bill is the requirement that agencies justify their \nactions through risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis. This is not \na new idea, although it is given unprecedented emphasis in this bill. I \nfirst introduced legislation to require risk assessment of \nenvironmental regulations in 1991, and I have introduced similar \nlegislation in each succeeding Congress.\n  All of these bills have been based on the simple proposition that \ndecisionmaking by Federal agencies ought to be informed by the best \navailable science. Of course, science cannot be the sole basis of \nagency decisions, for there are limits to scientific knowledge, and \nwhat we do know is imprecise. Yet science must be taken into account. \nWe must have the humility to acknowledge what we don't know, but also \nthe good sense to make use of what we do. That was the approach taken \nby the legislation I introduced in previous years, and it was the \napproach of the Johnston-Baucus-Moynihan amendment that \npassed the Senate as part of the Safe Drinking Water Act \nreauthorization bill in May 1994. That amendment would\n have required EPA to conduct risk assessments and cost-benefit \nanalyses for all major regulations. EPA would have been required to \ncertify that the benefits of a rule justify the costs and that no \nregulatory alternative would be more cost-effective in achieving an \nequivalent reduction of risk. Unlike the measure before us, last year's \nlegislation would not have superseded existing law, and EPA's analyses \nwould not have been subject to judicial review.\n\n  Our amendment was modest enough, but predictably it had opponents, \nincluding some members of the Clinton administration and certain \nrepresentatives of the environmental community. They seemed to view the \nissue only in absolute terms, being of the view that requiring cost-\nbenefit analysis and risk assessment would bring about the dismantling \nof environmental regulation by requiring EPA to consider risks and \ncosts over environmental health and safety. Over the last 4 years, it \nhas been our repeated experience--mine--to hear such complaints from \nenvironmental groups. Indeed, it is well known that opposition to risk \nassessment was significant enough last year to help kill the EPA \nCabinet bill and the Safe Drinking Water Act reauthorization. Note \nwell. Had the Environmental Protection Agency in 1994 accepted risk \nassessment and cost-benefit analysis as part of its mandate, it would \nbe a cabinet department today.\n  Let me give one example of the sort of analysis some have chosen to \napply to risk assessment proposals. On May 21, 1991, Joseph Thornton, a \npolicy analyst with Greenpeace, testified before a hearing of the \nEnvironment Subcommittee of the House Committee on Science, Space, and \nTechnology on the ``Risk Assessment: Strengths and Limitations of \nUtilization for Policy Decisions.'' This is what he said:\n\n       Greenpeace and communities who have experienced risk \n     assessment first hand are united that risk assessment \n     endangers the environment, public health, and the democratic \n     process as it is now practiced. The major real world use of \n     risk assessment has been to approve pollution. . . . Even \n     when [it has] been used for the purpose of setting \n     priorities, quantitative risk assessment is a flawed, \n     uncertain, and subjective process that is subject to \n     political pressures from those who have the most resources, \n     and the most influence. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n  This was not untypical of attitudes we encountered. The terms of the \ndebate even began to take on a curious\n doctrinal cast: It became fashionable at one point to refer to risk \nassessment as one element of an Unholy Trinity. According to Mr. John \nD. Echeverria, a National Audubon Society attorney quoted in the New \nYork Times on February 7, 1994, the Unholy Trinity is comprised of \nproposals on risk assessment, unfunded mandates, and Government takings \nof private property. And so I suppose I should not be surprised that, \ndespite the fact that my League of Conservation Voters record has \nfrequently risen above 90 percent, and despite having once been \nChairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, I \nhave never, in 19 years on the committee, received a letter of \ncommendation from the environmental community, a community not the \nleast averse to plastering congressional walls with plaques. As an \nadvocate of risk assessment, I am viewed with suspicion.\n  Not surprisingly--it is an old story--the legislation now before the \nSenate is far more prescriptive than anything advocated in the past by \nthis Senator. The controversy that accompanied any discussion of risk \nassessment and cost-benefit analysis as recently as a year ago has all \nbut disappeared. Today, even opponents of the Dole-Johnston bill are \nquick to state they favor the use of sound cost-benefit analysis and \nrisk assessment in environmental decisionmaking. A year has passed, an \nelection has intervened, and now we are faced with the Comprehensive \nRegulatory Reform Act of 1995. One wonders whether the opponents of the \nearly efforts by the Senators from Louisiana, Montana, and New York may \nbe a bit wistful about the opportunity they passed up last year. \nClearly, the terms of the debate have changed. The Senate has changed. \nWe never seem to learn that the failure to recognize the need for \nsensible, incremental change invites radical change.\n  Although the Dole-Johnston compromise significantly improved the \nearlier drafts of this legislation, it does in my view overreact. I \nshare many of the concerns of my colleagues and hope further amendments \nwill be accepted to improve the bill. At this point, I would like to \nset forth the principles that have guided my votes on this important \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S 10224]]\n\n  As I have said, I do support the appropriate use of cost-benefit \nanalyses and risk assessments in major\n rulemaking. However, I recognize that risk assessment and cost-benefit \nanalysis are imperfect tools. Even in the best analyses, significant \nuncertainties exist. More important, any legislation that would impose \na cost-benefit test must recognize that other factors including values, \nequity concerns, and policy judgments are equally important or even \ndispositive factors in the decisionmaking process.\n\n  These points were well illustrated during our debate on the acid rain \nprovisions of the Clean Air Amendments of 1990. Cost-benefit \nconsiderations were important elements of the debate. However, in the \nend Congress made policy judgments based in large measure on the \nunquantified and unquantifiable value we place on our natural \nenvironment. We decided, for instance, that some regions of the \ncountry, such as upstate New York, should not be forced to bear a \ndisproportionate impact of acid rain pollution. We now know that the \nactual costs of the acid rain program are less than one-third of most \nestimates at the time, and that we still do not understand the ultimate \nimpact of acid deposition on the environment. That experience \nillustrated the limitations of cost-benefit analysis as a rigid \ndecisionmaking tool, and it ought to be a lesson to us.\n  Returning to the Dole-Johnston bill, we reached a consensus last week \non two major issues. First, we recognized the tremendous resource \nburden that risk assessment and cost benefit analyses impose on \nagencies, and we changed the definition of major rule to $100 million \nrather than $50 million. This is a move in the right direction. \nHowever, the adoption of another amendment, which extends the \ndefinition to include rules that have a major effect on small business, \nmay recreate the problem we were trying to correct. Second, we \nclarified our intention that the legislation should not impose a \nsupermandate. That is, it should not override existing law. This does \nnot mean we are entirely satisfied with existing laws, but it \nrecognizes that we will not suddenly attain to vastly more intelligent \nand effective regulations by this single piece of legislation.\n  I disagree with those who view regulatory reform legislation as a \nsimple answer to the problems accompanying our current health, safety, \nand\n environmental statutes. Problems do exist--with Superfund, with the \ncurrent interpretation of the Delaney clause, and elsewhere. To achieve \ntrue comprehensive regulatory reform, we should move forward with \ncurrent efforts to reauthorize and improve important statutes such as \nSuperfund, the Clean Water Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n\n  I also have continuing concerns with the judicial review and lookback \nprovisions of the Dole-Johnston bill. Regulatory reform should not \nprovide expansive opportunities for technical and procedural \nchallenges, as much as K Street might wish. We should not turn the \ncourts into arbiters of the adequacy of highly technical cost-benefit \nanalyses and risk assessments. For example, section 634 of the Dole-\nJohnston bill would allow interested parties to petition agencies to \nreview existing risk assessments and would subject agency decisions on \npetitions to court challenge.\n  Do we really expect courts to decide whether the agency or industry \ninterpretation of the data should prevail? Do we really think we can \nlegislate, and litigate, good science? Let us clearly and unambiguously \nlimit judicial review only to final agency rulemaking actions.\n  Further, while I agree that the periodic review of existing rules is \nan important element of regulatory reform, the lookback process should \nbe constrained to focus on the most significant opportunities for \nimprovement. We need a process that is controlled by the agencies, \nusing clearly defined criteria, with adequate opportunity for public \ncomment--not one controlled by special interests or the courts.\n  I am pleased that the comparative risk principles which I have \nproposed on earlier occasions have been incorporated in both the Dole-\nJohnston bill and the Glenn-Chafee alternative. However, as I have said \nbefore, the use of comparative risk to help set agency priorities must \nrecognize the limitations of current methods and provide for continuous \ndevelopment of the discipline. I therefore strongly support the \nrecommendation in the bill that a nationally recognized scientific body \nbe asked to evaluate the state of the science and identify \nopportunities for improvement of this important science policy tool.\n  Finally, it ought to be said that many of the\n   problems with our current system cannot be solved by the application \nof cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment, or any other device. \nRecently, we received a major study conducted by the National Academy \nof Public Administration, ``Setting Priorities, Getting Results.'' The \nreport makes a number of recommendations for improving environmental \ndecisionmaking. As we debate the appropriate role of risk assessment \nand cost-benefit analysis, we should heed this admonition:\n\n       Risk analysis is not a cure-all. The members of Congress \n     and other decision-makers who have displayed a strong desire \n     for more objective and precise quantitative estimates of \n     environmental risks and of the costs and benefits of \n     environmental protection will be disappointed. The \n     unfortunate reality, that EPA and Congress must confront, is \n     that neither risk assessment nor economic analysis can answer \n     most of their crucial questions about environmental problems. \n     The tools can only approximate answers with varying degrees \n     of certainty, and the answers often cannot be reduced \n     objectively to a few numbers. The objective findings of \n     science are essential components of EPA's decisions, but \n     wholly insufficient as a base for environmental policy-\n     making.\n\n  The report goes on to state, ``Despite these problems, summaries of \ncosts or benefits are useful if they encourage analysts or decision-\nmakers to think rigorously about what impacts and values should be \nincluded.''\n  This is the core of what we need to accomplish in regulatory reform \nlegislation: greater scientific rigor in agency thinking and \ndecisionmaking. Let us acknowledge that with this legislation the task \nof creating a more effective national effort to improve the Nation's \nhealth, safety, and environmental quality has just begun.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we have 53 votes. We need 60. I understand \ntomorrow we will have an additional four votes on this side of the \naisle to make 57, 3 short of the 60.\n  I am trying to determine whether or not we want to go with this bill, \nwhether we want to set it aside for a period of time, or set it aside \nforever.\n  I have been talking with the distinguished Democratic leader. It is \nmy suggestion that if nobody objects, we stand in recess until 4:15 to \ngive the principals involved a chance to go off somewhere to see \nwhether or not they believe any more of these major issues can be \nresolved, which might move the bill along.\n  I think, rather than just sit in a quorum call for the next hour, we \nwill stand in recess, unless the Democratic leader has some objection \nto that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I think that is a very good idea. \nObviously, we are at a point where we have to work through what remains \nas significant differences between the two sides. I think an \nopportunity over the next hour to discuss those differences and \ndetermine whether or not they are reconcilable is a very good \nopportunity for both sides. I will encourage it and think that this is \nprobably the best plan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/18/senate-section/article/S10221-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10224-S10225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECESS UNTIL 4:30 P.M.\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, following whatever disposition of regulatory \nreform, we will take up the resolution on Bosnia. We were visited today \nby Secretary of State Christopher and General Shalikashvili, and they \nmade their pitch about how bad the Dole-Lieberman resolution would be \non Bosnia, as far as lifting the arms embargo.\n  Somebody asked the question, if it is so bad, what is so good about \nwhat is happening in Bosnia now? Obviously, we did not have an answer. \nThere is not any answer.\n  Today I received from Lady Margaret Thatcher a letter which I think \nis probably the best summation I have read about Bosnia and the tragedy \nthere. I placed a copy on everyone's desk, but I will read it for the \nrecord.\n  The letter is as follows:\n                                                     July 18, 1995\n       Dear Senator Dole: I am writing to express my very strong \n     support for your attempt to have the arms embargo against \n     Bosnia lifted.\n       I know that you and all members of the United States Senate \n     share my horror at the crimes against humanity now being \n     perpetrated by the Serbs in Bosnia. The UN and NATO have \n     failed to enforce the Security Council Resolutions which \n     authorized the use of force to defend the safe havens and to \n     get humanitarian assistance through. The safe havens were \n     never safe; now they are falling to Serb assault. Murder, \n     ethnic cleansing, mass rape and torture are the legacy of the \n     policy of the last three years to the people of Bosnia. It \n     has failed utterly. We owe it to the victims at last and at \n     least to have the weapons to defend themselves--since we \n     ourselves are not willing to defend them.\n       The arms embargo was always morally wrong. Significantly, \n     it was imposed on the (then formally intact but fragmenting) \n     former Yugoslavia at that regime's own behest. It was then, \n     quite unjustly and possibly illegally, applied to the \n     successor states. Its effect--and, as regards the Surbs, its \n     intention--was to ensure that the proponents of a Greater \n     Serbia, who inherited the great bulk of the Yugoslav army's \n     equipment, enjoyed overwhelming military superiority in their \n     aggression. It is worth recalling that the democratically \n     elected, multi-faith and multi-ethnic Bosnian Government \n     never asked for a single UN soldier to be sent. It did ask \n     for the arms required to defend its own people against a \n     ruthless aggressor. That request was repeatedly denied, in \n     spite of the wishes of the US administration and of most \n     leading American politicians.\n       There is no point now in listing the failures of military \n     policy which subsequently occurred. Suffice it to say that, \n     instead of succeeding in enforcing the mandates the UN \n     Security Council gave them, UNPROFOR became potential and \n     then actual hostages. Airpower was never seriously employed \n     either. The oft repeated arguments against lifting the arms \n     embargo--that if it occurred UN troops would be at risk, that \n     the enclaves like Srebrenica would fall, that the Serbs would \n     abandon all restraint--have all now been proved worthless. \n     For all these things have happened and the arms embargo still \n     applies.\n       Two arguments are, however, still advanced by those who \n     wish to keep the arms embargo in place. Each is demonstrably \n     false.\n       First, it is said that lifting the arms embargo would \n     prolong the war in Bosnia. This is, of course, a morally \n     repulsive argument, for it implies that all we should care \n     about it a quick end to the conflict without regard to the \n     justice or otherwise of its outcome. But in any case it is \n     based on the false assumption that the Serbs are bound to \n     win. Over the last year the Bosnian army has grown much \n     stronger and the Bosnian Serbs weaker. The Bosnian army has, \n     with its Croat allies, been winning back crucial territory, \n     while desertion and poor morale are badly affecting the over-\n     extended Serb forces. What the Bosnian government lacks \n     however are the tanks and artillery needed to hold the \n     territory won and force the Serbs to negotiate. This lack of \n     equipment is directly the result of the arms embargo. Because \n     of it the war is being prolonged and the casualties are \n     higher. Lifting the arms embargo would thus shorten not \n     lengthen the war.\n       Second, it is said that lifting the arms embargo would lead \n     to rifts within the UN Security Council and NATO. But are \n     there not rifts already? And are these themselves not the \n     result of pursuing a failed policy involving large risks to \n     outside countries ground troops, rather than arming and \n     training the victims to repel the aggressor? American \n     leadership is vital to bring order out of the present chaos. \n     No country must be allowed to veto the action required to end \n     the present catastrophe. And if American leadership is truly \n     evident along the lines of the policy which you and your \n     colleagues are advancing I do not believe that any country \n     will actually try to obstruct it.\n       The West has already waited too long. Time is now terribly \n     short. All those who care about peace and justice for the \n     tragic victims of aggression in the former Yugoslavia now \n     have their eyes fixed on the actions of the US Senate. I \n     hope, trust and pray that your initiative to have the arms \n     embargo against Bosnia lifted succeeds. It will bring new \n     hope to those who are suffering so much.\n       With warm regards,\n           Yours Sincerely,\n                                              Margaret Thatcher.  \n\n  Mr. President, having read the letter, I think it says it all. I know \nthe administration has said we will finally have a policy. It will not \nbe business as usual. After 30 months, we will do something.\n  No one is talking about committing American ground troops. In fact, \njust the opposite. Lifting the arms embargo keeps America out of any \nengagement. It seems to me that is something that should have been done \na long time ago. We have waited almost a year. A year ago August we had \nour last vote on this important issue. Mr. President, 58 out of 100 \nSenators voted to lift the embargo--Democrats and Republicans, \nbipartisan.\n  This is not an initiative by Senator Dole or Senator Lieberman, \nthough we are working together. This is an initiative of the U.S. \nSenate, in a bipartisan way, to address a very serious problem.\n  The President has made two promises. One, to commit 25,000 American \nforces, if, in fact, there is a peace settlement, to keep the peace. \nMore recently, commit 25,000 Americans to extricate members of the U.N. \nprotection forces in case of withdrawal.\n  I am advised by the Bosnian Foreign Minister today that only 30 U.N. \nprotection force members are in occupied Serb territory today. And he \nasked the question, why would it take 25,000 Americans to extricate 30 \nmembers of the U.N. protection forces? He says very clearly that there \nwill be no interference on the part of Muslims with any withdrawal of \nU.N. protection forces. \n\n[[Page S 10226]]\n\n  No question about it, this matter is very, very important. It is very \nserious, as Secretary of State Christopher told Members today at noon. \nIt has been serious if you are the ones doing the dying--or even the \nkilling. But one side has done nearly all the dying, and one side has \ndone nearly all the killing.\n  Those doing the dying do not have tanks or heavy weapons or artillery \nto defend themselves. They have rifles. In many cases they surrendered \ntheir heavy weapons because they were told they would be safe in these \nsafe havens. So they surrendered their heavy weapons, their only means \nto defend themselves, and notified, in the case of Zepa, Medjedja, \nGorazde, that the safe havens--that Lady Thatcher points out in the \nletter were never safe--and now they are falling to Serb assault.\n  This debate will begin, if not today, hopefully tomorrow. I hope we \nwill have broad bipartisan support, unanimous support. I know the \nSecretary of State told Members at the Democratic policy lunch today \nthat timing is everything, ``This is a terrible time to bring up this \nresolution.''\n  We have been told that at every turn. It is always a bad time. We \nthought, ourselves, it was a bad time to bring up the resolution, when \nyou had U.N. Protection Forces chained to poles and held as hostages so \nthere would be no more air strikes, and used as human shields. So we \ndeferred consideration of the resolution. And we have waited and waited \nand waited, hoping something good might happen. But nothing good has \nhappened.\n  Again, the Foreign Minister of Bosnia, who will be here, I guess, for \nseveral days, and has met with a number of Senators in both parties, \nindicates clearly that the U.N. Protection Forces should go.\n  So I hope in the next 24 hours we will be able to move to the \nresolution. I hope my colleagues on this side will listen carefully to \nmany on this side who are cosponsoring this resolution, and colleagues \non the other side will listen carefully to Senator Lieberman and others \nwho will be leading the effort. The point I wish to make is this is not \na partisan effort. It is not an effort aimed at President Clinton. I \ncomplained--or criticized the Bosnian policy during the Bush \nadministration. So it is not something that we have discovered because \nwe now have a Democrat in the White House.\n  So for 30 months, many of us originally supported Candidate Clinton, \nwho said we ought to lift the arms embargo and have air strikes. We \nsupported him. I remember meeting in the White House in 1993, in the \nspring, and we were talking about lifting the arms embargo. Most of us \nthere supported the President's desire at that time to lift the arms \nembargo.\n  Then, for some reason--it has never been fully understood by this \nSenator--it just sort of went off the radar screen. Bosnia was \nforgotten. It is as though the President never said anything about \nBosnia, never said anything about lifting the arms embargo. Then we \nwere told a year ago, in April, if we would just wait--and there was a \nresolution offered by the then Democratic leader, Senator Mitchell, and \nSenator Nunn, that they would go to the United Nations and make a plea \nthat the British and the French also lift the arms embargo. That was \none way to stall any action on the other resolution.\n  The trouble is, they had never gone to the United Nations and asked \nfor that, asked that the embargo be lifted. So we are back. We believe \nit is critical. We believe it is crucial. If anybody has any doubts, \nwatch the television tonight, read the paper in the morning.\n  Again, to make it very clear to some who always feel it is going to \nAmericanize the war, we have already Americanized the war. Scott \nO'Grady is an American, last time I checked. And he was shot down \nbecause we had not been notified that there were SAM sites in the area.\n  So American pilots are part of NATO. Lifting the arms embargo, \nremoving the U.N. Protection Forces--and I commend the bravery and \ncourage of all those who are engaged in the U.N. Protection Forces. But \nthe problem is, they cannot protect themselves and they cannot protect \nthe safe havens and they act as a buffer for the aggressors, the Serbs. \nWhether they intend it or not, they have been, in effect, an ally of \nthe aggressors. And many of us do not believe that was ever intended.\n  Again, let me make a distinction between the Serb people and \nMilosevic and Karadzic and some of the others who are dedicated to \nethnic cleansing, murder, butchery--whatever it takes to eliminate \nBosnian Moslems. I know the Serb people are just as tired of the \nfighting, and the mothers are just as tired of sending their sons to \nface possible death, as anybody on the other side.\n  So we are going to be on the Bosnian resolution. I hope, on the \nmatter of timing, it seems to me the best thing that could happen for \nthis administration is for the Senate to pass with a big, big vote, our \nresolution. That would give the President and the Secretary of State or \nwhomever they designate to negotiate with the British and the French \nand others a great deal of leverage. Because at that point they could \nsay, ``The Senate has acted. The House has acted. It is time to go. It \nis time to go.''\n  Then we would turn the fighting over to the parties who are directly \ninvolved. Give the Bosnians a chance. They are a member of the United \nNations. They are an independent nation. They have lost--70 percent of \ntheir land has been taken; 70 percent. And we are saying, ``Oh, wait. \nWait. We want to wait a while.'' Will we wait until 80 percent is \ntaken?\n  All they want is a right they believe they are entitled to, which we \nbelieve in this country is an inherent right, the right of self \ndefense. They would hope for the same as a nation, the right of self \ndefense as a nation.\n  In my view, they are entitled to that right. I think most of us agree \nthey are entitled to that right. Take a look at the casualty figures. \nWho has been doing the dying? Who has been doing the killing? Who has \nbeen involved in that? I must say, in some cases it is probably hard to \ndifferentiate, because there has been a lot of treachery and tragedy on \nall sides. But for the most part, there is no question about who the \naggressors have been. I just believe it is time for us to stand up.\n  This is a moral issue, one that should have been addressed a long \ntime ago. It can be addressed without committing American forces. All \nwe need to do is say we are going to lift the arms embargo and as an \nindependent nation you are going to have a right to defend yourself--\nwhich does not seem to me to be a very difficult decision. We are not \ngoing to defend them. If we lift the embargo, it is not we defending \nthem. If we lift the embargo, you defend yourself.\n  So I hope my colleagues will be prepared for debate on this very \nimportant issue, and that we can take final action before the week is \nout.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham).

Mr. President, I will take just a moment to comment on \nthe leader's remarks. I believe that the leader's remarks are totally \nappropriate with regard to the Bosnian situation, and I feel that this \nshould not be a partisan issue. This is a moral issue that appeals to a \nstrong feeling throughout the country, I think, that something has \nhappened here in Bosnia that goes against the very nature of the way we \nbelieve countries should be treated.\n  In my view, what the majority leader has said about the right to self \ndefense is the key to this issue. There are a number of arguments that \nare going to come up that this will Americanize the war, to lift the \narms embargo; that it is better to do it multilaterally versus \nunilaterally. But that all is to the side of the central issue, which \nthe majority leader has pointed out, and that is: How in the world can \nwe say that a country cannot defend itself? What would give us that \nright?\n  A terrible mistake was made in putting an arms embargo in a situation \nwhere one side had all the armaments and the other side was very poorly \narmed. I think we have to do everything we can to have a debate that \ndoes not make this a partisan issue. And to reiterate what the majority \nleader has said, all the arguments that are made have been made time \nand time again to justify delaying lifting the arms embargo. But he \ncorrectly points out that there is never a good time. No matter \n\n[[Page S 10227]]\nwhat we do to try to lift the arms embargo, there is some excuse why it \nis not the right time to do it.\n  I say this as a person who, in his first month or two as a U.S. \nSenator, offered the first resolution I ever offered in this body to \nlift the arms embargo on the Bosnian Moslems. That was 2\\1/2\\ years \nago.\n  The situation in Bosnia today would be very, very different had we \nlifted the arms embargo at that time. I have appreciated the fact that \nwe have had, on many occasions, a good bipartisan effort to try to lift \nthis arms embargo. If I can pick one issue since I have been here that \nreally has not been partisan and should not be partisan, it would be \nthis very issue.\n  So I look forward to the debate when this comes up. Nothing could be \nmore urgent. I hope very much that we have an overwhelming vote in \nfavor of the proposal, as at least described by the leader in his \nremarks.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, one of the main challenges, which we \nface as a society, that relates to the regulatory climate in America is \nthe condition of our urban centers.\n  Today, many of our cities have become hopeless arenas of decay and \ndespair. They are places where industry used to flourish, places where \nproductivity used to take place. But the fact is that the number of \nenterprises in cities is plummeting. Just in the last 20 years, you can \nnote that the number of businesses which inhabit our urban centers has \ngone down dramatically.\n  St. Louis, MO, has had a 32-percent decline in the number of \nbusinesses, from 3,497 businesses in 1972 to 2,386 businesses in 1992. \nDetroit, MI, for example, went from 6,945 businesses in 1972 to 3,448 \nbusinesses in 1992--a 50-percent decrease. So we see that one of our \nproblems is that not only have cities become a difficult place for \nindividuals, they have become a difficult place for businesses and \nindustry.\n  As a matter of fact, it is important for us to understand, Mr. \nPresident, that this is a problem which is related to the notion that \npeople who do not have jobs are at peril. The entirety of our \nregulatory framework is designed to deal with the well-being of \nindividuals, to promote their health, their safety, and, hopefully, to \nextend their longevity, so that people live longer, so that they have \nan opportunity for a quality existence.\n  But the truth of the matter is at the very core of our urban \nsocieties. We have the biggest challenges that relate to health. We \nhave the biggest challenges that relate to longevity, and the biggest \nchallenges that relate to personal security.\n  America's urban areas suffer a murder every 22 minutes, a robbery \nevery 49 seconds, an aggravated assault every 30 seconds. In a survey \nof the parents of first- and second-graders in Washington, DC, 31 \npercent of those said that they worried a lot about their children \nbeing involved in violence; almost 40 percent of the low-income urban \nparents worried about their children being shot. That is a quality of \nlife issue. Thirty-one percent of the first and second graders in \nWashington, DC, reported witnessing shootings. One out of every three \nchildren had witnessed a shooting, and 39 percent said they had seen \ndead bodies. These are first and second graders.\n  We have a major challenge that relates to the security, the safety, \nand the health and well-being of our citizens in our urban centers. One \nout of every 24 black males in America will have his life ended by \nhomicide. Our urban centers are so hopeless and filled with despair, \nand opportunity is so absent, that we find that the challenge is the \nchallenge to stay alive. There is a death sentence for 1 out of every \n24 black males.\n  The New England Journal of Medicine stated that a young black man \nliving in Harlem is less likely to live to the age of 40 than a young \nman living in Bangladesh, which is perhaps the poorest of all of the \nnations on the face of the Earth. These things are startling. These \nthings bother us. The pathologies of urban America are very \nchallenging.\n  What is really stunning is the fact that the absence of work \nopportunity at the very heart of America's cities has been a big part \nof this condition. Youngsters in our urban settings are known to drop \nout at much higher rates than in other settings. Why? Some say it is \nbecause those youngsters in our schools do not see work opportunities, \nthey do not see the promise or hope of doing something worthwhile with \ntheir lives upon graduation. Why persist in school if there will be \nnothing for you to do when you graduate? It is in that setting that we \nneed to take a careful look at the way in which regulation has had an \nimpact on what happens in our urban settings.\n  I became sensitized to this, Mr. President, when I was spending a lot \nof time with the people last year. I would work in a variety of \nsettings in my campaign for the U.S. Senate. Across the State of \nMissouri, both in Kansas City and St. Louis, I encountered businesses \nthat wanted to expand but could not. They wanted to grow and they \nwanted to offer more employment and they wanted to build the arena of \nopportunities. But they could not do it because of regulations--\nregulations that throttled them.\n  Just yesterday, I spoke about Anpaul Windows, a company whose \nemployees--over half of them--were minorities. They were doing very \nwell and the company needed to expand, but they had to leave the \noppressive regulatory environment of the urban center for the green \nfields of suburbia because there were no contaminants in the green \nfields of suburbia. You could build a new factory there, and everything \nwas in accordance with the way the factories were supposed to be, and \nyou did not have to worry about the historic old buildings, or the \nprohibition about whether or not you could make a 8-foot door or a 10-\nfoot door because of the historic designation of the factory.\n  What happened was the Anpaul Window Co. left the city of St. Louis, \nwhich left the city that much emptier. They are doing well. It is in \nWashington, MO, not Washington, DC. But it is 50 or 60 miles away from \nthe people who need the jobs the most. They went to a new green field, \nbut they did so because the regulatory framework really militates \nagainst jobs, industry, and development in the heart of our cities. All \nof those old factories and all of those old plants do not comply with \nall the new regulations. Lots of times, there is just a little \nnarrowness in the door, or maybe a taint of some substance in the \nflooring. And the EPA comes in and says, well, grind over the floor and \nsee if you can get the taint out, and if it does not come off, there \nmay not be something that can be done to change it.\n  So what we have effectively done with our regulatory framework has \nbeen to impose the tremendous cost upon the citizens of our cities. It \nis a cost that not only they have to pay--higher costs for goods \nbecause our things are manufactured in plants that comply with \nregulations--it is an opportunity cost, because the city centers do not \nhave the opportunities for employment. They do not have the \nopportunities for industrial development. Those individuals do not \nshare in the opportunities of our culture. They are not worried so much \nabout the lead poisoning from paint, they are worried about the lead \npoisoning from a .38. These are real challenges that we ought to face.\n  Let me tell you about the printing concern in Kansas City. The \npresident has a publishing business which has grown over the past few \nyears; it now employs 85 people. While business is doing well, the \npresident wants to expand the business, but there is a problem. He \ncould expand into more parts of the building in the downtown area, \n\n[[Page S 10228]]\nin the urban center. He wanted to move into different parts of the \nbuilding, but regulations prevent such expansion. The printing company \nhas no environmental problems. But the landlord of the building where \nthe business is located has had a problem with trace elements of PCB's \nin the floor material in parts of the building. Tests have shown there \nare no elements of PCB's in the air. They are somehow in the material \nof the floor of the building.\n  Now, the president would probably like to expand to these other \nfloors of the building if he could be assured that there would be no \nliability. As it now stands, the EPA may condemn the whole building \naltogether. It would cost the company about $500,000 to move and to \ntake all these jobs out of the city. And it looks like that is what \nthey are going to have to do. The landlord has spent over $250,000 so \nfar in legal fees, and another $100,000 trying to grind down the floors \nto see if he could get through all the PCB's. I suppose he probably \nreleased more PCB's into the atmosphere than could have ever happened \notherwise.\n  The EPA, in other parts of the country, has allowed for a covering of \nthe floor to take care of situations like this. But the EPA cannot seem \nto make a decision in this Kansas City concern. Here we stand to lose \n85 downtown urban center jobs--the price of regulation--saying we \ncannot allow you to expand in this building for technical reasons that \nare not uniformly applied across the country.\n  I repeat, there have been situations where these kinds of things have \nbeen taken care of. But as it now stands, EPA's inaction has again \nstalled the economic progress and job growth where it was most sorely \nneeded. If this situation is not resolved, ultimately the printing \ncompany will have to move out of the city altogether. I just want to \nsay that these are real people. These are real situations.\n  We have children dying in drive-by shootings, we have individuals who \ncannot get jobs, we have despair, bad health, we have the lack of \nsecurity, the lack of safety that comes with a hollow core of the inner \ncities of America, in part because we have had a regulatory red line \naround the inner cities, which have basically said you cannot develop \nin here because this stuff is old. These buildings were used in \nprevious settings where we did not have the environmental requirements \nthat we have now, and because they were used in those previous \nsettings, they are full of liabilities for business. They are full of \nliabilities for industry. They are full of liabilities for producers.\n  As a result, if you want to be an industry, you want to be in \nbusiness, you want to be a producer, you cannot be here, but have to go \nto suburbia, in the green fields, and we find ourselves hollowing out \nour cities. We find young people in despair turning to all kinds of \nthings.\n  Under the guise of regulations that would abate noise, for instance, \nwe get the noise of crack cocaine. We hear the slam of the slammer \ndoor. We hear the shot of the pistol. We hear the wail of the family in \nthe wake of the ambulance that carries away the individual who has been \nwounded or killed.\n  It is time to recognize that this economics redlining of the inner \ncity that results from hyperregulation is costing us our ability to \ndeliver jobs.\n  Make no mistake about it, make no mistake about it, we all want to \nhave a healthier environment. But you cannot tell somebody who has a 1 \nin 25 chance of being shot as an unemployed person on the street in one \nof the urban cores, you cannot tell someone that you are keeping the \njobs out of there because there is a 1 in 1 million chance they might \nhave some respiratory problem as a result of some kind of atmospheric \nnonattainment.\n  We have to weigh the real impacts of what we are seeing happen here. \nThe real impact of regulations in many urban centers is a redlining \nagainst developments, a redlining against industry. It is a redlining \nagainst opportunity.\n  When we take development opportunities and industry out of the \ncommunities, we have joblessness, lawlessness, hopelessness. Those are \nconditions that are far greater threats to the safety, security and \ngeneral well-being of the population than many of the things we have \nsought to regulate.\n  What is the answer? How can we address this problem? What is it that \nwe ought to do? I am suggesting in the Urban Regulatory Relief Zone Act \nthat we should allow mayors of urban areas to convene economic \ndevelopment commissions that could make application for the waiver of \nspecific Federal regulations when those regulations preclude jobs and \ndevelopment, when they preclude opportunities, when they result in the \nhopelessness, despair, and danger in the inner city, when they really \nresult in a lower standard of longevity, a lower standard of health, a \nlower standard of safety, a lower standard of security.\n  When the impact of regulation has an inverse consequence--instead of \npromoting health, security and safety, it results in the absence of \njobs and opportunities in the core of our inner cities and destroys the \npotential for health, security and safety--the economic development \ncommissions of these areas ought simply to be able to make application \nto the Federal agencies and say to those Federal agencies, we ask for a \nwaiver, because the imposition of the requirement in our community has \nthe anomalous effect, has the opposite effect, of what it should have. \nIt is causing our children to be shot. It is causing our children to \ndrop out of school when they see no opportunity. We need to waive some \nof these regulations when the waiver would, in fact, elevate the \nhealth, the safety, and the employment opportunities, when the waiver \nwould help people live longer and more productive lives than the \nimposition.\n  So the Urban Regulatory Relief Zone Act which I have proposed would \nsimply be a way of saying it is time to make good on what our intention \nis. If our intention in regulation is to improve the health, safety, \nsecurity, and general well-being of individuals in our urban centers \nwhere the impact of regulation has frequently been the opposite, we \nneed to say ``Let's give those urban centers the chance, through \neconomic development commissions, to make application to have those \nregulatory provisions waived.''\n  I think we all understand that we do not want to have the potential \nfor the waiver of regulatory protections just willy-nilly. If \nregulations are decent or good or important, we do not want to waive \nthem lightly.\n  I think it is important to note if you had those kind of economic \ndevelopment commissions that the law provides for, and you have the \nkind of public notice that the law provides for, that the people who \nrepresent the affected population would only submit such applications \nfor waiver when they were convinced that as a result of the waiver \nthere would be an elevation of the life expectancy, an elevation of the \nhealth and safety, an elevation of the security, the quality of life of \nthe individuals.\n  Finally, this application, which under the proposed enactment would \ngo to the Office of Management and Budget and then be referred to the \nvarious agencies, would be finally acted on by the agency. If the \nagency concluded, in spite of the application, that there was a \nsubstantial danger to the health and safety of the occupants, it could \npersist in denying relief. It could say no to the waiver. It would give \nauthority for the EPA or other areas of regulation to say, ``The impact \nof our regulation in that community is hurting people, not helping. The \nimpact of our regulation is shortening people's lives. It is decreasing \ntheir health, not expanding their health. It is causing hopelessness \nand despair. It is causing young people to drop out of school because \nthey see no opportunity.'' Yes, we ought to, in this circumstance, \nwaive these technical requirements and, as a result, bring real benefit \nto the citizens of that particular area.\n  I believe this is a real opportunity. We have discriminated \ndramatically against urban residents with regulation. Regulations, \ninvariably, are designed to make things that were done in the past \nillegal, to make things that happened in a previous way of doing \nbusiness inappropriate.\n  We regulate to say you cannot do things that way anymore. There are \nsome good reasons for that. But the institutions that worked on these \nthings in the past are in the midst of our great cities. We have \nbasically said you cannot work there anymore. We are reaping the \nharvest. We are reaping the \n\n[[Page S 10229]]\nharvest because 40 percent of all adult men in our distressed inner \ncities did not work in a year that was studied recently, while a \nsignificant number worked only sporadically or part time.\n  Today, half of all the residents of the distressed neighborhoods in \nour big cities live below the federally defined poverty threshold. In \n1993, that was $14,763 for a family of four. The reason for that is, in \npart, we have said to businesses, we have a regulatory framework that \nreally provides incentives for you to get out of here, for you to go to \nthat green field in suburbia, go to a new place, leave the city alone.\n  We provided incentives. We have not done it purposely. We have not \ndone it knowingly. But we have provided real incentives for people to \nleave the urban centers of America.\n And, when we leave them empty we leave the people there empty. We \nleave them in peril. We leave them in distress. We leave them in \ndespair. And ultimately we leave some of them in a situation from which \nthey can never escape.\n\n  There are those who say, ``Well, you don't want to have a standard \nfor safety or an environment that is lower in the city than it is in \nsome other area. There has to be environmental justice.'' I believe in \nenvironmental justice. I believe everyone should have an equal chance \nat the good life that we want to enjoy. But I believe that when our \nrequirements are shortening the lives of individuals instead of \nextending them, when our requirements are pulling the rug out from \nunder the health of our population, we ought to think carefully about \nwhether or not they are having the right effect.\n  I do not have the studies in my hand right now, but I think virtually \nall of us in this Chamber understand that when we have looked at health \nstatistics people who are employed tend to be healthier than people who \nare unemployed, and people who are employed tend to be safer than \npeople who are unemployed. There is very little that is more dangerous \nin an employment setting in this country than there is to be standing \nunemployed on the street corners of some of our urban centers.\n  I believe we ought to look hard at the way in which regulation has \ndrawn a red line around the core of America's cities, the way \nregulation has basically said, ``Do not invest here. Do not produce \nhere. Do not do business here. You cannot get a job here.'' I think we \nought to say to ourselves, let us allow these cities to make an \nevaluation. When they come to a conclusion that the general well-being \nof the people--when they come to the conclusion that the health and \nsafety of the inner-city residents--would be benefited by a waiver, let \nus let them apply. And let us give the agency the authority to grant \nthat waiver application, so we can bring jobs and opportunity and hope \nback to the center of our cities.\n  I believe one of the next items which we will be moving toward in the \ndebate here in the U.S. Senate will be an item which is referred to as \nwelfare reform. We desperately need welfare reform. But, frankly, as \nmuch as we need welfare reform we need opportunity for individuals, \nbecause we are going to ask people to go to work and we are going to \nexpect them to go to work. But how can we ask people in our inner \ncities to go to work, how can we expect them to go to work, if we \ncontinue to develop a regulatory framework which redlines the inner \ncity and says there cannot be jobs here, there cannot be opportunity \nhere?\n  Mr. President, I believe it is time for us to grant relief to the \nurban centers, to give them a level playing field, to give them a \nchance to attract business and industry that is consistent with the \nhealth and safety, the longevity, and the security of the residents of \nthat area. Our regulatory framework has not served them well.\n  They have paid the higher prices that we have all talked about in the \nlast few weeks, talking about regulation here in this Chamber. But they \nhave also paid a tremendously higher price than just the increased cost \nof goods that come from regulation. They have paid the price of \njoblessness and they have paid the price of hopelessness. They have \npaid the price of looking into the eyes of their young people who have \nno ambition because they cannot see an opportunity in their \nneighborhood. That is a substantially greater price than the $600 \nbillion a year that it is estimated that regulation costs us in \nAmerica. Oh, yes, they have paid their share of the $600 billion. But \nthe opportunity costs--in the very heart of American urban centers has \nbeen a tremendous opportunity cost, and it is one which we can ill-\nafford to ignore.\n  So I rise this evening in the midst of the debate on regulatory \nreform to say we must recognize the unique circumstances of American \ncities. We must give these neighborhoods at the core of America, the \nmature cities of America, the opportunity to have relief when, as a \nmatter of fact, the imposition of regulations now achieves a purpose \nabsolutely contrary to the purpose for which the law was enacted which \nprovided for regulations. It shortens lives, impairs safety, ruins \nhealth, and destroys opportunity.\n  It is time for the Urban Regulatory Relief Zone Act, and I hope we \nhave an opportunity to include that in our dealings with regulatory \nrelief during our deliberations this week.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft).

Mr. President, for about the last couple of hours, 2\\1/2\\ \nhours, a number of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been \nnegotiating on S. 343, the regulatory reform bill. Those negotiations \nare still underway. So as not to waste time, I have suggested to the \ndistinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, that we now proceed \nto consideration of S. 21, which is the Bosnian resolution, and I am \nhopeful we can reach that agreement and then we would continue on S. 21 \nand hopefully finish it tomorrow. That would give the Members who are \nin the negotiations on S. 343 all day tomorrow to see if they can come \nto some agreement on three or four important issues.\n  I also have asked consent that, if they reach an agreement, that I \ncan come back to S. 343 and maybe reach some agreement on completion of \nthat bill or complete that measure. So as soon as I hear from the \nDemocratic leader I can advise my colleagues on the schedule for the \nbalance of the evening.\n  If we cannot get the agreement, then we will come back on S. 343. \nThere are a number of amendments that can be offered tonight, including \nthe pending amendment by the Senator from Missouri. Senator Ashcroft \nhas an amendment pending. So if we cannot reach an agreement, we will \ncome back on S. 343 tonight and the Senator's amendment will be the \npending amendment, as I understand it.\n  There are other amendments that can be offered tonight on S. 343, so \nI am not at liberty to say whether or not there will be votes. But we \nwill advise our colleagues as soon as we can.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/18/senate-section/article/S10229-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10229-S10230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, there has been extensive consultation \nbetween the distinguished majority leader and the Democratic leader, \nand we do have a unanimous-consent request to propound.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending bill, S. 343, be temporarily \nlaid aside; that the Foreign Relations Committee be discharged from \nfurther consideration of S. 21; and that the Senate turn to its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object, and it is \ncertainly not my intention to object. Let me make one observation and \nnote a couple of concerns, as we propound the second part of this \nrequest. \n\n[[Page S 10230]]\n\n  The observation is this: those who are engaged in trying to work \nthrough the remaining differences on the regulation reform bill \nreported to me just moments ago that real progress has been made this \nafternoon. I think that we have been able to report progress from time \nto time.\n  I think in all sincerity, some effort has been made on both sides to \ncontinue to narrow the differences, and we made significant progress \nover the course of the last several hours. The time that has been spent \nsince about 3 o'clock this afternoon has been well spent.\n  As it relates to this resolution, I think the recommendation made by \nthe majority leader and the majority whip is a good one. I think laying \nthe bill aside will accommodate the negotiations, and I think that it \nis safe to assume that we are going to continue to make progress over \nthe course of the next couple of days. We certainly do not relegate any \nrights to continue to object to closure on the legislation, should we \nfind that progress has not been sufficient. But I think we need to \nrecognize that, indeed, efforts are being made on both sides to try to \naccommodate the concerns. It is in that context that we want to allow \nthat process to continue.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we certainly appreciate the comments of the \ndistinguished Democratic leader.\n  I further ask unanimous consent then that the Senate resume S. 343 \nafter the disposition of S. 21, as amended, if amended, and no call for \nthe regular order serve to displace S. 21, except one made by the \nmajority leader after notification of the minority leader, and if a \ncall for the regular order is made, there be 1 hour for debate to be \nequally divided in the usual form to be followed by the third cloture \nvote on the Dole-Johnston substitute, and the mandatory quorum under \nrule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, again, reserving the right to object, now \nI simply want to state the two concerns I mentioned a moment ago. \nFirst, we have an understanding that over the course of tomorrow \nmorning and early afternoon that there be no votes on amendments or on \nthe resolution itself. A number of Senators have been invited down to \nthe White House to discuss this matter. I think it would be very \nhelpful if that discussion can take place prior to the time we are \ncalled upon to make any decisions.\n  Second, should we find the need to come back to S. 21, it would be \nvery helpful if we had plenty of notice. The majority leader and the \nmajority whip have both indicated that, indeed, it would be their \ndesire to give us plenty of notice.\n  So it is with those two understandings that we have no objection and \nencourage Senators to comply with this unanimous-consent agreement and \nget on with the debate relating to the Dole resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the entire request proposed?\n  Mr. LOTT. It has been propounded, and if the Chair would like to go \nahead and do the ruling, I have one further comment I would like to \nmake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the entire unanimous-\nconsent request?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi has the floor. \nDoes he yield for the purpose of----\n  Mr. LOTT. First, I was not aware that the Senator had a problem that \nhe wanted to discuss with the minority leader. While that is being \ndone, I would like to respond to a couple of points that the minority \nleader made.\n  First, as is always the custom, the majority leader would certainly \ngive notice to the other side, to the minority leader, before any votes \nwould occur. That is always done. Certainly, they would give them the \nusual courtesy that would be expected in that regard.\n  Second, I know, also, that the majority leader--while I have not \ndiscussed it with him--would want to honor any request for \nconsideration of a meeting that might be occurring on this particular \nmatter with the administration. So I know that the minority leader has \nalready been assured of that. I would like to reconfirm that.\n  Also, I would like to note, before the Chair rules, that I have been \nnotified that we do not expect any more recorded votes tonight. The \nmajority leader has sent that word. We had discussed that earlier with \nhim and with the minority leader. So the Members should be on notice \nthat there will be no more recorded votes tonight.\n  I have no further requests. I thank the minority leader for his \nindulgence. I would like to see if we can get a ruling on the \nunanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to notify the membership that if this \nagreement cannot be reached, it would be the intent of the leader to go \non with the pending legislation, and then we could expect additional \nrecorded votes tonight. I will be glad to yield to the minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I was not aware of the concern of the \ndistinguished Senator from Wisconsin with regard to the regulatory \nreform bill. We have an hour prior to the time we would go to the third \ncloture motion under this unanimous consent agreement. He would like to \nbe protected to offer a nongermane amendment relating to a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution prior to that time. I think if we could \naccommodate the Senator from Wisconsin, perhaps we could accommodate \nthis unanimous-consent agreement.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in view of this development and seeing the \nSenator from North Carolina seeking recognition, while some further \ndiscussion takes place, I will withhold that unanimous consent request \nfor now and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/18/senate-section/article/S10229-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10230-S10231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE ARMS EMBARGO AGAINST BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, my reaction to this agreement which may \nsoon be entered into is: At long last. On the first day that the Senate \nthis year accepted bills and resolutions to be introduced, this \nresolution was introduced by the distinguished majority leader with \nsome of the rest of us as cosponsors. The Foreign Relations Committee, \nof which I am chairman, has not acted on this resolution, at the \nspecific request of the majority leader and others. But I am delighted \nthat finally we are confronting the questions that have been raised \nabout the delay in the resolution.\n  In short, Mr. President, it is high time for the Senate to \nacknowledge what is already perfectly clear to any objective observer: \nThe U.N. peacekeeping effort in Bosnia is an abject failure.\n  The Bosnian Serbs have certainly known this for a long time, as has \nthe beleaguered Bosnian Muslim government. Yet, the United Nations \npersists in a policy that, at best, has given the appearance of action \nwhile, in fact, allowing the slow-motion genocide of Bosnian Muslims.\n  Lest the President of the United States need reminding, along with \nthe leaders of our European allies, Bosnia was recognized as an \nindependent nation 3 years ago. Commensurate with that status is the \nexplicit right of self-defense. For 3 years, the Bosnian Serbs have \npursued an aggressive campaign, aided and abetted by the Government of \nSerbia. Irrefutable evidence, such as the integrated air defense of \nthese two brutal forces, demonstrates that this is truly a war of \naggression being waged by Serbia. How any democratic government can \ncontinue to justify the arms embargo against Bosnia on either moral or \nlegal grounds escapes me. It absolutely escapes me.\n  So-called safe areas are being overrun, U.N. peacekeepers have been \ntaken hostage, humanitarian assistance convoys are either blocked or \nbeing looted by Bosnian Serb fighters, and Sarajevo airport has been \nclosed for 3 months. Despite this deteriorating situation, the U.S. \nGovernment persists in supporting the illusion of peacekeeping--as if \nthere is any peace to keep in that part of the world. Most recently, \nPresident Clinton has stated his intention to spend an additional $95 \nmillion on the U.N. so-called rapid reaction force in order to \nperpetuate this failed policy. Under the current rules \n\n[[Page S 10231]]\nof engagement, that force will do nothing to confront Serb aggression.\n  Mr. President, it would be an exaggeration to suggest that the \nsituation in Bosnia is at a diplomatic standstill. It is moving \nbackward. It appears that the closest the Western Powers can get to a \nnegotiated solution is to reward the Serbian dictator who started this \nentire war by easing the sanctions against his country. Even this \neffort--which is an embarrassment to the United States--has fallen \nshort.\n  So in recognition of this failure, and as chairman of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, I declare that it is time for us to take a \nstep which should have happened 3 years ago. We must approve this \nlegislation to lift the arms embargo against the Bosnians and allow \nthose people to defend themselves.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will repeat my earlier unanimous consent \nrequest. I understand that we need to start this whole routine over \nagain. I am going to have two unanimous-consent requests.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent that the pending bill, S. 343, be \ntemporarily laid aside and the Foreign Relations Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of S. 21, and the Senate turn to \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I further ask that the Senate resume S. 343 \nafter the disposition of S. 21, as amended, if amended, and no call for \nthe regular order serve to displace S. 21, except one made by the \nmajority leader, after notification of the minority leader--and he can \nbe assured that he would get proper notification on that--and if a call \nfor the regular order is made, there be 1 hour for debate, to be \nequally divided in the usual form, to be followed by the third cloture \nvote on the Dole-Johnston substitute, and the mandatory quorum under \nrule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I do not want to confuse the matter any \nmore, so I waited until after the unanimous consent request was \nproffered.\n  Let me make sure my colleagues are clear as to what the circumstances \nare now. I have had the opportunity to consult with the distinguished \nSenator from Wisconsin. It is my intention to protect his right to \noffer a sense-of-the-Senate resolution either before cloture or after \ncloture, if a cloture motion is required; or if no cloture motion is \nrequired, we will negotiate with the majority to ensure that the \ndistinguished Senator from Wisconsin has an opportunity to raise the \nissue that he hopes to address through this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. I appreciate his cooperation in this regard, and as a \nresult, we are now able to go forward.\n  I think this is a good solution to the matter, and I appreciate \neveryone's consideration and cooperation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to reiterate, in view of the \nunanimous consent agreement that we did reach, that was the last issue \nof the day in terms of recorded votes. There will be no recorded votes \nuntil tomorrow when an agreement is reached on when the next vote will \nbe scheduled. There will be no further recorded votes tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/18/senate-section/article/S10231-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10231-S10239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA SELF-DEFENSE ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I do think it is \nrelevant to this bill. I want to thank them for their cooperation.\n  Mr. LOTT. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I should like to take this occasion to \nspeak strongly in favor of S. 21, the majority leader's resolution on \nBosnia.\n  Mr. President, we have now, for more than 3 years, watched--and I use \nthat word advisedly ``watched''--the ongoing tragedy of Bosnia. The \naggressions, the rapes, the cold-blooded murders, the ethnic cleansing, \nwhich has accompanied the dismemberment of a nation, recognized as a \nnation, and a member of the United Nations.\n  We have an administration which has constantly threatened action, and \nevery bit as constantly walked away from that action when its bluff was \ncalled.\n  We have a U.N. protective force which has protected no one but the \naggressors. A force dispatched to Bosnia to provide some kind of safety \nfor the victims of aggression has shown itself unable to do so time \nafter time and place after place. Whether around Sarajevo, whether in \nthe isolated areas of refuge, whether in the northwest part of the \ncountry--its fate has been the same.\n  Its fate has either been to protect the Bosnian Serb aggressors \nagainst any kind of military action on the part of the United Nations, \nno matter how modest and ineffective by its very presence and by the \nease with which the Bosnian Serbs can take the U.N. personnel as \nhostage; or alternatively, as was the case just 10 days ago, as an \nentity which disarmed the defenders of these enclaves and then provided \nabsolutely no defense or support for essentially unarmed victims who \nnow, themselves, are the latest example of the victims of the Serbs' \nethnic cleansing.\n  Mr. President, the former President of the United States, George \nBush, was wrong in enforcing an arms embargo against the Bosnians. \nPresident Clinton has repeated that and has been wrong to enforce that \narms embargo against the Bosnians.\n  As recently as lunch time today, the caucuses of both parties \nlistened to the same tired presentation from the Secretary of State, \nand in this case from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that \nwe have heard for this entire 3 years. That somehow or another to do \nsomething, change our policy, to allow those who wish to defend \nthemselves to do so, would lead to some even worse disaster, the taking \nof more hostages among the U.N. forces, to more deaths and ethnic \ndisplacement on the part of the Bosnians.\n  Yet, the use of this excuse, Mr. President, has resulted in 3 years \nof violence and displacement and ethnic cleansing and an end to the \nbelief of the United Nations to act effectively in connection with a \ncatastrophe of this sort, and undercutting of the ability of NATO, and \nmost significantly, a lack of belief in the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, it is simply time to end that bankrupt policy. The \nproposal that the majority leader has brought to the Senate ends the \nembargo on one of two conditions:\n a decision by the United Nations or by the countries supplying troops \nto the United Nations in Bosnia to withdraw; or a request from the \nlegal Government of Bosnia that the United States lift the arms embargo \nand a notification to the U.N. Security Council that it has requested \nthat those forces leave.\n\n  Mr. President, that is putting the ultimate fate of the Republic of \nBosnia squarely in the hands of its own elected \n\n[[Page S 10232]]\nGovernment, which is exactly where it should be. There is a very real \npossibility that if the troops of that Government can obtain arms even \nremotely equivalent to those possessed by the aggressors, that they can \ndefend their independence and recover some of the country wrongfully \nlost to them. And it is way past time, way past time that we allow that \ndecision to be made by the people who have been the victims of this \naggression for 3 long years.\n  The U.N. protective force is not protecting anyone, including itself. \nIt should be gone. Our arms embargo punishes no one except for the \nvictims of aggression. It is simply time that it be brought to a close. \nThe partial and midlevel threats that are being made by this \nadministration will risk the loss of American lives but will not, under \nany circumstances, change the situation on the ground. What could be \nmore clear, Mr. President, than the proposition that we should not risk \nthe lives of our own men and women in uniform unless their goal is \nimportant to the United States and has some definite and worthy policy \nto be defended?\n  Nothing that we have heard from the administration about its plans \nmeets those simple tests. If we are willing to do nothing to end this \naggression ourselves, we at least should no longer be complicit to its \ncontinued success. We should be willing to allow the victims to defend \nthemselves. We should end the arms embargo. We should encourage the \npresent forces from the United Nations to leave. We should arm the \nBosnians. And I am convinced, under those circumstances, their chances \nof regaining the semblance of a country and reaching a peace through \nsome kind of strength will be greatly enhanced.\n  There is no perfect solution to this catastrophe. But the solution of \nallowing the victims to defend themselves, to fight for their own \nfreedom, is the least bad of all the solutions before us. And I am \nprofoundly convinced it is the only moral answer to this question.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for his \nstatement and for his support.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, and a long list of bipartisan \ncosponsors as we again try to lift the illegal and unjust arms embargo \non Bosnia and Herzegovina. The legislation we are bringing up today is \na modified version of the bill we introduced in January of this year. \nS. 21 is the number. This bill lifts the United States arms embargo \nafter the withdrawal of United Nations troops from Bosnia and \nHerzegovina.\n  Before we start to discuss this legislation I want to make clear: \nThis debate is not just about Bosnia. This is not just about a small \nEuropean country under attack. This debate is about American leadership \nand American principles, about NATO strength and credibility, about our \nplace in history.\n  It was just about a year ago that the Senate last voted to lift the \narms embargo on Bosnia. That vote was 58-42. However, in conference a \ncompromise was worked out by the distinguished Senator from Georgia, \nSenator Nunn, and the administration's representative Chuck Redman. It \nurged the President to introduce a resolution to lift the arms embargo \nin the U.N. Security Council if the Bosnian Serbs did not sign the July \n1994 contact group plan by October 15. The compromise language also \nprovided that if the Serbs did not sign the plan by November 15, the \nUnited States would cease enforcing the arms embargo. Finally, the \ncompromise urged that in the event of Bosnian Serb\n attacks on U.N. safe areas, the President introduce and support a \nresolution in the Security Council to provide the Bosnians with \ndefensive weapons to defend these areas.\n\n  Now it is a year later. The Bosnian Serbs have still not signed the \nJuly 1994 contact group peace plan; the administration has still not \ntaken up a resolution in the U.N. Security Council to lift the arms \nembargo; and the Bosnian Serbs are about to run over another U.N. safe \nhaven--the second in 2 weeks.\n  Mr. President, the administration argued last year that lifting the \narms embargo would lead to the fall of the three safe havens in the \neast. The first of these three enclaves has fallen under U.N. watch--\nwith NATO planes overhead. Today NATO planes are buzzing above Zepa, \nwhich is about to fall.\n  Mr. President, all this has occurred in the absence of lifting the \narms embargo. Indeed, it has occurred because the arms embargo is \npreventing the only people willing to fight to defend the Bosnian \npeople from being able to do so--and that is the Bosnians themselves; \nnot the U.N. forces, but the Bosnian Government Forces--Moslems, \nCroats, and Serbs are willing to die to defend their families, their \nhomes, and their multi-ethnic country.\n  Last year the administration also made the argument that lifting the \narms embargo immediately would endanger allied forces. In this modified \nDole-Lieberman legislation we are not lifting the United States embargo \nuntil after those countries contributing to UNPROFOR who want to leave, \nhave\n left.\n\n  The administration has also claimed that lifting the embargo would \nAmericanize the war. This is the most difficult argument to understand. \nThe Clinton administration has pledged 25,000 American troops for \nBosnia if there is peace. The Clinton administration has pledged 25,000 \nAmerican troops for Bosnia if there is withdrawal. And the Clinton \nadministration is considering escalating the American involvement for \ntransport and close air support of UNPROFOR forces. Let us not forget, \nand American Air Force pilot, Scott O'Grady, was recently shot down. In \nlight of such commitments, it is hard to take administration arguments \nover Americanization seriously. As the Prime Minister of Bosnia said, \nlifting the arms embargo will not Americanize the war, it will \nBosnianize the war--by putting the future of Bosnia back in Bosnian \nhands, where it should have been for the last couple of years or more.\n  A more recent concern raised by some is that the withdrawal may take \nmore than 12 weeks. In that regard, this legislation includes a \nrenewable Presidential waiver providing for an additional 30 days \nshould additional time be necessary for the safety and successful \ncompletion of the withdrawal operation.\n  As I mentioned earlier, each time the Senate has taken up this \nlegislation we have been told by the administration that this is not \nthe right time. We have waited. The Bosnians have waited--and they have \ndied.\n  The bottom line is that the approach pursued by the administration, \nlike that of the Bush administration, is a total failure. The question \nis whether or not we will continue to contribute U.S. dollars, \nprestige, and credibility to this catastrophe or change course.\n  Mr. President, there are no perfect options. There are no easy \nanswers. We now know what has not worked--relying on the U.N. forces to \nprotect the Bosnians. It seems to me that we owe it to the Bosnians and \nour own American principles of justice and fairness to let the Bosnians \ndefend themselves, and I believe the American people understand this \nand will support it.\n  Let me make it clear, as I attempted to do earlier today, we are not \ntalking about more American involvement. We are not talking about \nAmerican ground troops. We are talking about lifting the arms embargo--\nmaybe helping to train Bosnians, maybe helping to supply weapons, but \nthat could be done in safe areas. And if they secure Russian weapons, \nwhich they are already familiar with, there will be very little \ntraining necessary.\n  Also keep in mind that in many cases the Bosnians surrendered the \nonly heavy weapons they had because they were going to be in safe \nhavens. As I suggested, one of the safe havens has been overrun, and \nanother about to be overrun, and the third, Gorazde, is in peril.\n  I also want to make it clear, because I think there is always a \ntendency for some to say: Oh, this is politics, this is Bob Dole, \nRepublican, because we have a Democratic President, the record will \nreflect that during the Bush administration I think the same two \nSenators raised this question. We were critical of the Bush \nadministration. I remember talking to Ambassador Zimmerman time after \ntime. I remember calling him and discussing it with him when he was in \nYugoslavia, because we were told then that if we did not do something--\nand I am not talking again about military force; I am talking \n\n[[Page S 10233]]\nabout sending a word of caution to Mr. Milosevic, the leader of the \nSerbs, the President of Serbia--this is precisely what would happen.\n  So this is not a Dole resolution. This is not a Lieberman resolution. \nThis is an action by the Senate, Republicans and Democrats, such as the \ntwo of us, Mr. Helms, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Biden, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. McCain, \nMr. Feingold, Mr. Warner, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. \nStevens, Mr. Cochran, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Mack, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. \nPackwood, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Specter, and others, so there is strong, \nbroad bipartisan support.\n  It is not a conservative matter. It is not a liberal matter. It is a \nmoral issue of whether we will again in this century witness ethnic \ncleansing, genocide, call it what you will, and do nothing. In this \ncase, all we need to do, as we were reminded again by the Bosnian \nForeign Minister today, is to lift the arms embargo. As he said, ``We \nare willing to die for our country.'' They are not asking us to do \nthat, not asking anybody else to do that. And I know the British do not \nwant to lift the arms embargo. I know President Chirac, the new French \nPresident, has other ideas. The British and French cannot seem to get \ntogether.\n  I know the Secretary of State told the Democrat policy luncheon today \nthis is not the time, timing is terrible. Well, that is always the \ncase. It is never the time. It seems to me just the opposite. This is a \nperfect time. It would seem to me the administration would want us to \npass this resolution. It has to go to conference, has to be worked out. \nIt is going to take quite a while--10 days, 30 days, who knows--before \nit comes back and before it becomes law. And then the President could \ntell the French and the British that the options are fewer and fewer as \nfar as America is concerned and our involvement is concerned.\n  So I really hope that we can complete action on this resolution \ntomorrow. I know the White House will want to try to dissuade some from \nvoting for the resolution. That is certainly a right they have. But I \nwould also suggest this is precisely the very same action the President \nadvocated when he first came to the White House--even before he came to \nthe White House--lift the arms embargo. He also was supporting air \nstrikes.\n  So it is not that we have figured out some way to be on the other \nside of President Clinton and have brought this issue to the floor to \nembarrass the President. We are precisely where the President was \nbefore he was elected President, as a candidate, and where he was after \nhe was elected. And I recall a meeting in the White House in the spring \nof 1993 where Democrats and Republicans came together and we talked \nabout lifting the arms embargo and air strikes.\n  That has been a long, long time. I do not know how many thousands of \npeople have suffered, how many thousands have died, how many murdered \nand raped, how many children have gone without food because we did \nnothing. And then we said, well, this is a European problem; let the \nEuropeans handle it. And then we had the U.N. Protection Forces.\n  Again, I commend the courage and bravery of every one of those young \nmen, and maybe women in some cases, from all the different countries \nwho are there as U.N. Protection Forces. They are there with good \nintent. Unfortunately, their good intent has turned into in effect \nbeing a buffer for the Serbs. Now the U.N. Protection Forces have found \nthey cannot protect themselves, and they cannot protect the people in \nthe safe havens, and they cannot protect the refugees. In fact, if you \nwatched television the other night, they had a barbed wire entanglement \nseparating the U.N. forces from the refugees so they would not come \ntogether.\n  It seems to me that it is pretty clear. My own view is the British do \nnot want to be humiliated by withdrawing. I have talked to John Major \nin his office. He is very persuasive. Somehow he believes if we just \ncontinue to stay there, this is going to end. And with a new French \nPresident, he is being a bit more aggressive. He thinks they ought to \ndo something. So now he wants us to become involved with helicopter \ngunships and other ways we transport French and other U.N. Protection \nForces into the area.\n  In my view, that would be a mistake, but that may be debated. There \nmay be an amendment to do that before we complete action on the bill.\n  Finally, it just seems to me it is the right thing to do. It was a \nyear ago. It was before that. The House passed this--not the same \nlegislation--by a vote of 318 to 99, over 3 to 1. I hope we have at \nleast 70 votes or more in the Senate; bipartisan votes, nonpartisan, \nwhatever you like.\n  I believe we have made progress because we have been cautious. We \nhave respected the timing, and we have delayed from time to time to see \nif they could not complete negotiation, they could not reach some \nagreement. But I believe now is the time for us to proceed and to send \na signal to the Serbs and, yes, to the British, to the French, but more \nparticularly the Bosnians, that somebody in America, in this case the \nSenate and the House of Representatives, understands their concerns, \nand we are willing to support their request that an independent nation, \na member of the United Nations, has the right of self-defense as \nspelled out in article 51 of the U.N. Charter.\n  That is all this is about. It is not complicated. You can raise all \nthe horror stories. You can give us all the scenarios that might \nhappen. We were told by the foreign minister today there will be no \neffort by the Moslems to stop the U.N. Protection Forces from leaving. \nWe were also told that there are only 30 U.N. personnel in Serb \noccupied areas, so it should not take 25,000 American troops to help \nextricate members of the U.N. Protection Forces.\n  So as we begin the debate, I again commend my colleagues. I hope that \nthe distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, who I know maybe supports \nus in his heart, would find it in his heart to support us all the way \nbecause he is a very important Member of this body, and I know he \nfeels, as some, maybe he has some reservations, but this is, as he \ncertainly knows, not a partisan effort on behalf of the majority leader \nin this instance.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1801\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk in the \nnature of a substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Dole], for himself, Mr. Helms, \n     Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Biden, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. McCain, Mr. \n     Feingold, Mr. Warner, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. \n     Stevens, Mr. Cochran, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Mack, Mr. \n     Coverdell, Mr. Packwood, Mr. Murkowski, and Mr. Specter, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1801.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bosnia and Herzegovia Self-\n     Defense Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) For the reasons stated in section 520 of the Foreign \n     Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 \n     (Public Law 103-236), the Congress has found that continued \n     application of an international arms embargo to the \n     Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina contravenes that \n     Government's inherent right of individual or collective self-\n     defense under Article 51 of the United National Charter and \n     therefore is inconsistent with international law.\n       (2) The United States has not formally sought multilateral \n     support for terminating the arms embargo against Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina through a vote on a United Nations Security \n     Council resolution since the enactment of section 1404 of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 \n     (Public Law 103-337).\n       (3) The United Nations Security Council has not taken \n     measures necessary to maintain international peace and \n     security in Bosnia and Herzegovina since the aggression \n     against that country began in April 1992.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF SUPPORT.\n\n       The Congress supports the efforts of the Government of the \n     Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina--\n       (1) to defend its people and the territory of the Republic;\n       (2) to preserve the sovereignty, independence, and \n     territorial integrity of the Republic; and\n       (3) to bring about a peaceful, just, fair, viable, and \n     sustainable settlement of the conflict in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina.\n     \n[[Page S 10234]]\n\n\n     SEC. 4. TERMINATION OF ARMS EMBARGO.\n\n       (a) Termination.--The President shall terminate the United \n     States arms embargo of the Government of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina, as provided in subsection (b), following--\n       (1) receipt by the United States Government of a request \n     from the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina for termination \n     of the United States arms embargo and submission by the \n     Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in exercise of its \n     sovereign rights as a nation, of a request to the United \n     Nations Security Council for the departure of UNPROFOR from \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina; or\n       (2) a decision by the United Nations Security Council, or \n     decisions by countries contributing forces to UNPROFOR, to \n     withdraw UNPROFOR from Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       (b) Implementation of Termination.--The President may \n     implement termination of the United States arms embargo of \n     the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina pursuant to \n     subsection (a) prior to the date of completion of the \n     withdrawal of UNPROFOR personnel\n      from Bosnia and Herzegovina, but shall, subject to \n     subsection (c), implement termination of the embargo \n     pursuant to that subsection no later than the earlier of--\n       (1) the date of completion of the withdrawal of UNPROFOR \n     personnel from Bosnia and Herzegovina; or\n       (2) the date which is 12 weeks after the date of submission \n     by the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina of a request to \n     the United Nations Security Council for the departure of \n     UNPROFOR from Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       (c) Presidential Waiver Authority.--If the President \n     determines and reports in advance to Congress that the \n     safety, security, and successful completion of the withdrawal \n     of UNPROFOR personnel from Bosnia and Herzegovina in \n     accordance with subsection (b)(2) requires more time than the \n     period provided for in that subsection, the President may \n     extend the time period available under subsection (b)(2) for \n     implementing termination of the United States arms embargo of \n     the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina for a period of up \n     to 30 days. The authority in this subsection may be exercised \n     to extend the time period available under subsection (b)(2) \n     for more than one 30-day period.\n       (d) Presidential Reports.--Within 7 days of the \n     commencement of the withdrawal of UNPROFOR from Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina, and every 14 days thereafter, the President \n     shall report in writing to the President pro tempore of the \n     Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives on the \n     status and estimated date of completion of the withdrawal \n     operation. If any such report includes an estimated date of \n     completion of the withdrawal which is later than 12 weeks \n     after commencement of the withdrawal operation, the report \n     shall include the operational reasons which prevent the \n     completion of the withdrawal within 12 weeks of commencement.\n       (e) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     interpreted as authorization for deployment of United States \n     forces in the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina for any \n     purpose, including training, support, or delivery of military \n     equipment.\n       (f) Definitions.--As used in this section--\n       (1) the term ``United States arms embargo of the Government \n     of Bosnia and Herzegovina'' means the application to the \n     Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina of--\n       (A) the policy adopted July 10, 1991, and published in the \n     Federal Register of July 19, 1991 (58 FR 33322) under the \n     heading ``Suspension of Munitions Export Licenses to \n     Yugoslavia''; and\n       (B) any similar policy being applied by the United States \n     Government as of the date of completion of withdrawal of \n     UNPROFOR personnel from Bosnia and Herzegovina, pursuant to \n     which approval is denied for transfers of defense articles \n     and defense services to the former Yugoslavia; and\n       (2) the term ``completion of the withdrawal of UNPROFOR \n     personnel from Bosnia and Herzegovina'' means the departure \n     from the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina of substantially \n     all personnel participating in UNPROFOR and substantially all \n     other personnel assisting in their withdrawal, within a \n     reasonable period of time, without regard to whether the \n     withdrawal was initiated pursuant to a request by the \n     Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a decision by the \n     United Nations Security Council, or decisions by countries \n     contributing forces to UNPROFOR, but the term does not \n     include such personnel as may remain in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina pursuant to an agreement between the Government \n     of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the government of any country \n     providing such personnel.\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that a \nlegislative fellow in my office, Mr. Ronald A. Marks, be allowed on the \nSenate floor for the duration of the Senate action on S. 21, the Bosnia \nand Herzegovina Self-Defense Act of 1995.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his kind \nwords.\n  Mr. President, once again, the Senate is debating legislation to lift \nthe arms embargo against Bosnia-Hercegovina. Since the Senate first \ntook up this issue in January 1994, I have voted against every attempt \nto force the United States to lift the embargo unilaterally. I must say \nthat I now find this would be an extremely difficult vote to cast.\n  The fall of a U.N. protected safe haven--and the impending fall of a \nsecond--is a dreadful human tragedy. The terrible images of tens of \nthousands of Moslem refugees fleeing Serb aggression make us want to \nfind a quick and easy solution to the crisis, but I am afraid there are \nno easy answers. A Senate vote to lift the arms embargo unilaterally \nmay seem cost-free, but I believe there are serious downsides that \ncould actually make the situation worse.\n  The legislation before us says that the lifting of the embargo shall \noccur after UNPROFOR personnel have withdrawn or 12 weeks after the \nBosnian Government asks U.N. troops to leave, whichever comes first. We \nshould be honest about what we are debating here. This bill, if passed, \nwill actually trigger a U.N. withdrawal from Bosnia. I would remind my \ncolleagues that the United States has committed to helping our allies \nwithdraw from Bosnia as part of a NATO effort. So, in essence, by \npassing this bill, we are precipitating the commitment of up to 25,000 \nUnited States troops to Bosnia to help with that withdrawal.\n  It is indeed time for our President, along with our U.N. and NATO \nallies to consider the future of the United Nations in Bosnia. They \nknow that if the United Nations were to pull out altogether, many areas \nof Bosnia which are now stable and well supplied due to the U.N. \npresence would likely face a humanitarian disaster. This is \nparticularly true in central Bosnia where the U.N. presence has \nfostered a peaceful federation between the Bosnian Croats and Moslems, \nwho until February 1994, had been engaged in a fierce war. The \nPresident and our NATO allies must balance that potential catastrophe \nagainst the current tragedy which has led many to call for a complete \nU.N. pullout.\n  As we speak, the administration and our allies are grappling with \nthat difficult issue. General Shalikashvili met with his counterparts \nin London regarding this matter this past weekend; British Foreign \nSecretary Malcolm Rifkind is in Washington today to discuss this issue; \nand later this week, Secretary Christopher and Secretary Perry will \ntravel to London for negotiations with their European counterparts.\n  Clearly, I would have hoped we would wait to know the results of \nthese important meetings and await our President's recommendation on \nthe future of UNPROFOR and the role of the United States before \nembarking on this debate. I believe that Europe bears the brunt of the \nburden for dealing with the Bosnia crisis. Indeed the Europeans \nacknowledge this fact and are contributing the bulk of the troops to \nthe U.N. effort. We have no troops on the ground, and that is as it \nshould be. The U.S. Senate, therefore should not take unilateral action \nthat would actually precipitate a U.N. withdrawal. In the end, a \ndecision may have to be made to withdraw U.N. troops, but I do not \nbelieve the Senate should make that decision.\n  I would add that the Bosnian Government, if it wished, could ask the \nUnited Nations to leave at any time. But it has not done so. Yet this \nbill would put the U.S. Senate on record as endorsing, indeed hastening \na withdrawal.\n  A unilateral lifting of the arms embargo after U.N. troops are \nwithdrawn will inevitably be perceived as the beginning of a United \nStates decision to go it alone in Bosnia. It is naive to think we can \nunilaterally lift the arms embargo, and then walk away. We instead \nwould assume responsibility for Bosnia not only in terms of our moral \nobligation, but in practical terms as well. If we lift the\n embargo, who will supply the weapons? How will weapons be delivered? \nWho will train the Bosnians in using the weapons? The proponents of \nthis bill will argue that it places no obligations on the United \nStates, but everyone knows the Bosnian Government will look to us.\n\n[[Page S 10235]]\n\n\n  Lifting the embargo without international support would increase \nAmerican responsibility for the outcome of the conflict. Delivering \nweapons to Bosnia would likely require sending in United States \npersonnel. Granted, this legislation states that nothing should be \nconstrued as authorizing the deployment of United States forces to \nBosnia-Hercegovina for any purpose. But I want to emphasize that this \nwould be a U.S. decision to dismantle the embargo. I do not see how we \ncan lift the embargo on our own without sending in the personnel and \nwithout providing the wherewithal to carry out the policy.\n  A unilateral lifting of the embargo--be it now or after U.N. troops \nare withdrawn--would put the United States in the position of \nabrogating a U.N. Security Council resolution, and in essence, breaking \ninternational law. The embargo is in place as a result of a binding \nU.N. Security Council resolution and can only be abrogated by a \nsubsequent U.N. Security Council action. A unilateral lifting of the \narms embargo would set a dangerous precedent. Other countries could \nchoose to ignore Security Council resolutions that we consider \nimportant--such as the embargo against Iraq and sanctions against Libya \nand Serbia.\n  In April, the Washington Post reported that Iran was engaging in \nembargo-busting by supplying plane loads of weapons and military \nsupplies to Bosnian Government forces. If the United States were to \nlift the embargo unilaterally, we would joint Iran in embargo busting. \nI would ask my colleagues: Do you want to be in that company? Is Iran a \nresponsible player in the international community?\n  The answer, of course, is no. If the United States were to break the \nembargo on its own, we would destroy our credibility as a trustworthy \nleader in international affairs. A unilateral lifting of the arms \nembargo would undoubtedly strain our relations with our NATO allies and \nundermine our standing in other international negotiations completely \nunrelated to the Bosnian tragedy.\n  After U.N. troops are safely withdrawn, lifting the embargo \nmultilaterally may indeed be the best course of action. If and when \nUNPROFOR does withdraw, I believe we should make sure we know where our \nallies stand on lifting the embargo. Whether or not to lift the embargo \nshould be a multilateral decision. We should not go it alone.\n  I acknowledge that I see merit in some of the arguments of the \namendment's proponents. This is a difficult problem that cuts across \npartisan lines and that slices to the heart of issues related to U.S. \ninfluence and power abroad. We all want to do something in response to \nthe terrible pictures of the old people being wheeled out of eastern \nBosnia in wheelbarrows or the frightful sight of the 20-year-old \nBosnian hanging from a tree. I am just not convinced, however that \nvoting for this bill will alleviate that suffering. Indeed, I am afraid \nthat we might make matters worse.\n  We are, as public servants, called upon to exercise our best judgment \non this very difficult issue and this is what I intend to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the chair.\n  Mr. President, first I would like to request unanimous consent that \nFrederic S. Baron, a Pearson Fellow in my office, be permitted floor \nprivileges for the duration of the debate on S. 21?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am honored to join with the distinguished majority \nleader, the Senator from Kansas [Mr. Dole], and many others in both \nparties in introducing this substitute, S. 21.\n  I do want to indicate at the outset, though, this has been a \nfrustrating path that we have walked together. It has been an honor to \nwalk it with Senator Dole and to say that this is a path we have walked \ntogether in the interest of a strong policy in Bosnia and a fair \npolicy, which is to say one that will arm the Bosnians who have been \ndeprived of their right of self-defense by international action, in \nwhich we have participated. This effort, together with Senator Dole and \nothers, has been done, as he said a few moments ago, on a totally \nbipartisan, which is to say, nonpartisan, basis, which is the way in \nwhich American foreign policy has been at its finest hours.\n  I specifically point out that Senator Dole and I began this effort \nduring the previous Republican administration of President Bush, \nexpressing our frustration and opposition to the failure of leadership \nand the continued imposition of the arms embargo.\n  Mr. President, we have been here before. By my calculation, we have \nbeen here at least seven times before. Each time, excuses are given why \nthis is the wrong time to lift the arms embargo against the Bosnian \nGovernment. Explanations are given about what the consequences might \nbe, let alone why the whole idea of lifting the embargo is wrong.\n  We have continued to believe that the heart of any equitable policy \nin the former Yugoslavia is to allow both sides to be able to defend \nthemselves. History divided the former Yugoslavia in such a way that \nonly one side, namely, Serbia and its clients, its agents in Croatia \nand in Bosnia, were left with the warmaking capacity of the former \nYugoslavia. Bosnia was left with nothing.\n  This denial of this fundamental right of self-defense, which each of \nus can feel in a personal sense, certainly, as we watch the horrors, \nthe atrocities that have gone on once again in Bosnia in the last \ncouple of weeks and see families divided--mothers separated from \nchildren, husbands from wives, see women taken off without explanation \nwith God knows what being done to them, men being herded away, young \nmen, men of military age being herded away. These are the human \nhorrific results of this policy.\n  People have argued against the idea of raising the arms embargo each \ntime we have brought it to this floor, arguing more against it than for \nan alternative policy. Today we come back, as Senator Dole has said, \nnot saying that this is the perfect policy, not saying that any policy \nin a complicated situation is perfect or guaranteed to succeed, but \nsaying with clarity that the current policy has been a terrible \nfailure, has brought suffering and pain and death to the people of \nBosnia. But more than that, it has victimized, along with the people of \nBosnia, the world's best hopes for order and morality--the United \nStates, NATO, and the United Nations, each suffering significant, deep \ndamage to our credibility, to our status, to our legitimacy in the \nworld.\n  When the voices and institutions and nations of strength and \nauthority fail to act or act with ambivalence in a way that sends a \nmessage of weakness and outlaws continue to be aggressors, then the \nresults are obvious, and you do not have to be a Ph.D. in diplomacy to \nunderstand this. If outlaws are marauding in a city in our country and \nforces of law do not stop them, they will keep marauding until they \nreach each one of us. And that, in essence, I fear, is what has \nhappened over the last 3 years of inaction by the world communities in \nBosnia.\n  Mr. President, I have a point of view which I feel very strongly \nabout what Bosnia was before this conflict and what has brought us to \nthis point. I have spoken of it before on this floor, and I will just \nspeak to it briefly today.\n  There are those who like to dismiss or diminish the conflict in the \nformer Yugoslavia and, in some sense, thereby to wash our hands of any \nresponsibility, remove us from any involvement on the basis of this \nallegation: ``These people have been fighting for centuries.'' There is \na hint here that these people are somehow slightly less than human. \n``They continue to fight; why should we get involved?''\n  There are two realities. One is that civilizations, cultural and \nreligious, have met in the Balkans. That is the history over the \ncenturies, and there have been conflicts. But the reality is that, in \nBosnia particularly, a strong and healthy multiethnic culture and \nnationality developed.\n  Somebody said to me, in Sarajevo before this terrible war, it was \nthought to be offensive for one person to ask another in Sarajevo what \ntheir ethnic origin was: Are you a Moslem? Are you a Serb? Are you a \nCroat? No, they were \n\n[[Page S 10236]]\nBosnians. This was a great, flourishing multiethnic culture.\n  Second, there is a clear course that I see as I look at the history \nof this region over the last 6 or 7 years, and that is of an \nintentional, concerted effort through aggression by Serbians operating \nout of Belgrade under the leadership of Slobodan Milosevic to create a \ngreater Serbia.\n  Since 1988, beginning with the takeover of the political machinery in \nMontenegro and Vojvodina, the illegal suppression of the legal \nGovernment of Kosova, which has a large Albanian majority, suppressed, \ncontinuing to be victims of harassment and abuse and worse. That \noccurred in 1989.\n  Then the mobilization of nationalist feelings in Serbian public \npolls;\n  The slow-moving constitutional coup against the Federal Presidency;\n  The Serbian economic blockade against Croatia and Slovenia in late \n1990;\n  The theft by Serbia that year of billions of dinars from the Federal \nbudget, destroying the Federal economic reform program;\n  And then the incitement and arming by Serbia out of Belgrade of Serb \nminorities in Croatia and Bosnia during 1990 and 1991.\n  That is how we got to where we are. This is no accident. This is no \ncontinuation of centuries and centuries of constant fighting. This is a \ndecision made in Belgrade by a leader and a group around him to incite \nnationalism, to destroy the multicultural, multiethnic society in \nBosnia and to take advantage of the instability that existed after the \ncold war to create a greater Serbia.\n  What about the embargo that we are debating? Where did that come \nfrom? Mr. President, this is not, as some may think, an act of \ninternational law. It is an act of policy created and adopted by the \nSecurity Council of the United Nations.\n  The resolution introduced creating an arms embargo, No. 713, was \nconsidered by the Security Council at Belgrade's request. Why? Well, I \nbelieve it is obvious. Because the forces in Belgrade knew that they \nhad the monopoly and the warmaking capacity, the arms factories, and \nthe weapons that had already been constructed of the former Yugoslavia. \nApplying an arms embargo put their enemies, the targets of their \naggression, at a profound disadvantage.\n  So at Belgrade's request, in September 1991, the United Nations \nSecurity Council adopted this arms embargo, later to be carried out by \nthe member nations, including our own--in this case, by an Executive \norder issued by President Bush. The world satisfied itself that this \nwas a means to limit the conflict in the former Yugoslavia by stopping \nthe flow of arms. What innocence. What naivete.\n  In April 1992, Bosnia was recognized as a new state, independent and \nseparate from Yugoslavia. And on May 22, 1992, it was admitted as a \nmember state to the United Nations. Yet, still the embargo that had \nbeen applied on the former Yugoslavia, despite the glaring conflict \nbetween this application and Bosnia's right of self defense under \ninternational law, was applied to Bosnia. That is how we got on the \nroad to where we are now.\n  In 1992, international television crews gained access to what I could \nonly describe as concentration camps that were being operated by the \nSerbs, where they were herding Moslems into the camps. We witnessed the \nemaciated bodies, and we saw evidence of this incredible phrase--\n``ethnic cleansing.'' There were 200,000 killed in this war. A couple \nof million refugees. The world rolls up in horror at the sight of these \nfigures in the concentration camps and the stories of systematic rape--\nrape as an instrument of war. Serbs were coming into towns not only \nclearing them out of the Moslems, but grabbing women and raping them, \nand taking men off to the camps, or slaughtering them on sight.\n  The world cried out for a response. The Western nations were not \nprepared to really stand up to the aggression. So what did we do? We \nsent in the United Nations--which was not good, ultimately, for the \npeople of Bosnia, not good for the United Nations--presumably to \nperform a humanitarian role. But little by little, that mission crept, \nto enforce the denied flight zone, enforce and protect the safe havens, \nsending these brave soldiers wearing the blue helmets of the United \nNations in to keep a peace that never was, and putting them into combat \npositions without the weapons with which to defend themselves.\n  I heard the other day--and I have not had a chance to check this, but \nI believe it--that more soldiers wearing U.N. uniforms have been killed \nin Bosnia than in the gulf war. They are heroes. We sent them \neffectively on a mission impossible. Several times, confronting the \nfailure of this policy, the increasing way in which the U.N. troops \nbegan to be not only an excuse for Western inaction in the face of \nSerbian aggression, but began to be a cover for Serbian aggression \nwithin Bosnia. Every time we would come here in the early years in this \neffort to lift the embargo, people would say: You cannot do it. If we \nlift the embargo, the Serbs will seize the U.N. personnel as hostages.\n  Well, we have not lifted the embargo, and the Serbs have seized U.N. \npersonnel as hostages, and the killing of the Moslems in Bosnia \ncontinues.\n  Mr. President, when we came to the floor January 27, 1994, we passed \na sense-of-the-Senate resolution calling on the President to terminate \nthe arms embargo. That measure passed 87 to 9. It was only a sense of \nthe Senate. But the Senate spoke. The world sat idly by, the arms \nembargo was not lifted, and the people of Bosnia continued to be--using \nthat dreadfully sanitized term--ethnically cleansed, which is to say \nripped from their homes, raped, and murdered.\n  In May 1994, the Senate again considered, and this time passed, two \nmeasures. One was a measure that I cosponsored with Senator Dole, \nrequiring the United States to unilaterally terminate the arms embargo \nupon the request of the Bosnian Government. That passed 50 to 49. On \nthat day--I suppose in a way that only the Senate of the United States \ncould do--we also passed an amendment offered by Senator Nunn and the \nprevious majority leader, Senator Mitchell, requiring the President to \nsolicit a multilateral lift of the embargo and to consult with Congress \nif that did not occur. Again, the Senate spoke. The world sat idly by, \nthe arms embargo was not lifted, and the people of Bosnia were \nethnically cleansed, ripped from their homes, raped, and murdered.\n  Again, in July and August 1994, the Senate addressed the issue of \nlifting the arms embargo, voted and passed measures calling for its \ntermination. This time the votes rose. The last of these votes was 58 \nto 42, passing an amendment offered by Senator Dole and myself to the \ndefense appropriations bill, which called for the lifting of the \nembargo no later than November 15, 1994. On each of those occasions, \nthe Senate spoke. The world sat idly by, the arms embargo was not \nlifted, and the people of Bosnia were ethnically cleansed, ripped from \ntheir homes, raped, and murdered.\n  Here we are. It is July 1995. One of the other arguments that was \nmade to us in these many debates I have just described is that if we \nlifted the arms embargo, the Serbs would seize the safe havens, \nparticularly in the east of Bosnia. Well, we have not lifted the arms \nembargo and, as we know, the Serbs have seized the safe havens--at a \ndreadful human cost for the Bosnians.\n  Srebrenica has fallen. Zepa is under siege now. Failure of our policy \ncould not be clearer. It is time, finally, to act. Again, as in 1992 \nwhen the concentration camps were discovered, the world is aroused by \nthese painful sights of human suffering from Bosnia. This is the moment \nfor us, finally, to act--to act against aggression, against immorality, \nto give the people of this country--the victims--the weapons with which \nto defend themselves.\n  Mr. President, the Bosnians have been the greatest victims of the \ncurrent policy that the West has followed for the last 3\\1/2\\ years, a \npolicy of irresoluteness, at best, a policy of weakness, at worst.\n  But the Bosnians are not the only victims. We have suffered, as well. \nWhen aggression is met by ambivalence, and aggression is met by no \nresponse--which has been the case throughout the war in Bosnia--\nultimately, we are all going to suffer. We saw it happen just a short \nwhile ago directly to America, when Captain O'Grady's F-16 was shot \ndown. \n\n[[Page S 10237]]\n\n  I have gone over this event in some detail with the folks at the \nPentagon just to make clear that I understood exactly what happened. \nHere is what I have learned. We know that the Serbs in Bosnia were able \nto pick up the F-16 flying over Bosnia on an integrated radar air \ndefense system that has installations in Bosnia, controlled by the \nBosnian Serbs, but goes back to Belgrade and Serbia, as well. But what \nis most infuriating about this is that it is clear to those who are in \na position to know that when the Serbian air defense system sighted \nCaptain O'Grady's F-16, they knew it was an American F-16. This may not \nbe known to those who are not involved, and Members of the Chamber, and \nthose who may be watching this debate, but this is a sophisticated air \ndefense system which can look at this plane and determine that it is an \nAmerican F-16.\n And not just that. It was able to determine--the Serbs on the ground--\nthat this F-16 was not flying an aggressive flight mission. It was not \nout to drop weapons, bombs, on Serbian targets, as has happened all too \ninfrequently in this conflict. But that this plane was on a \nnonaggressive patrol mission, part of Operation Deny Flight, to keep \nSerb planes on the ground, not in the air.\n\n  Seeing it was an American plane, knowing it was on a nonaggressive \nmission, the Bosnian Serbs intentionally shot it down. It is only by \nthe grace of God and by the depth of his own extraordinary courage that \nCaptain O'Grady is alive today.\n  Understand the outrageous arrogance, the disrespect for law, the \ndisrespect for the greatest power in the world, the United States, that \nthey showed. These Bosnian Serbs shot down our plane.\n  What have they paid for that aggression? Nothing. What does that \ninvite? It invites them to attack and overrun a safe haven. Meanwhile \nBosnian Army weapons are being held in a U.N. compound. U.N. Dutch \nsoldiers--courageous, effectively unarmed--light arms is all they had. \nThen the Serbs followed with atrocities against the civilian \npopulation.\n  So we have suffered. We have suffered in the United States. We will \ncontinue to suffer, as will the rule of law and the rule of morality, \nif we stand by and allow this aggression of the Serbs to go unresponded \nto. Mr. President, that is what this S. 21 proposal is all about.\n  In 1992, President Clinton supported a policy of lifting the arms \nembargo and striking from the air. In 1993, Secretary Christopher, in \nthe spring of that year, May I believe, went to Europe to advocate this \npolicy. Apparently, our allies and Britain and France argued against \nit. That was the end of it.\n  I honestly believe if we implemented that policy at that point and \nemployed NATO air power, which we could have done against the Serbs \nwith minimal risk to NATO and American personnel, this war would have \nbeen over and there would have been a reasonable peace that both sides \ncould have accepted. That is history. It has not happened.\n  But now, though the hour is late in Bosnia and the situation ever \nmore difficult and complicated, there is no opportunity to get the \nwarring parties to the peace table, unless the Serbs pay some price for \ntheir aggression.\n  It seems to me that our last hope here, our last best hope, is to \nlift the arms embargo, give the Bosnians the weapons with which to \ndefend themselves, their families, their country, and use NATO air \npower to strike at Serbian targets. I would not rule anything out.\n  Let the Serbs worry about where and when we will strike. In Bosnia \nagainst Serbian targets or in Serbia, which continues to arm, equip, \nand actually send Serbian regular soldiers into Bosnia alongside the \nBosnian Serbs.\n  There is strong evidence that in the fall of Srebrenica there were \nspecial forces from the Serbian Army, the so-called Serbian Army \nfighting side by side with the Bosnian Serbs.\n  This is our last best hope, not just for the people of Bosnia who \npaid a terrible price, but for the rule of law and order in Europe and \nthroughout the world.\n  It is the last best hope for NATO to show that in a situation that is \ncomplicated and yet where aggression is clear, it will act outside the \ncontext of the Soviet-American cold war conflict; that there is still \nmeaning to NATO in this great alliance.\n  It is the last best hope for the United Nations to restore some \nmeasure of credibility to itself as an instrument of hope to victims of \naggression and oppression throughout the world.\n  Mr. President, there will be an extended debate tomorrow, I am sure, \non this amendment. I hope and pray that what we will have is the \nresounding bipartisan majority, the overwhelming majority that Senator \nDole referred to earlier.\n  Of itself, this is an event that occurs here on the floor of the \nSenate, far removed from the suffering on the ground in Bosnia, unable \neffectively to immediately, even it is passed overwhelmingly, bring \nassistance to the Bosnians, but it will bring them hope.\n  More than that, I hope that it will combine with what is happening on \nthe ground, which is to say the failure of the U.N. mission, to either \nlead to a more aggressive use of air power by NATO, as Secretary Perry \nhas spoken of, hopefully, encouragingly to me, in the last 3 or 4 days. \nIf not, then the withdrawal of the U.N. forces, the arming of the \nBosnians, and the continued use of NATO air power.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for his patience. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, when we see a photograph of a young woman \nwho has hanged herself in a forest in Bosnia, because she prefers death \nto the kind of violations which the Bosnian Serbs are inflicting on \nyoung women like herself who are Bosnian Moslems; and where we see \nconfirmed reports where the Bosnian Serbs walk into safe havens and \nroot out 11-year-old children who are males, and slit their throats and \npile them in heaps; and when we see documents filed by the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia where the \nindictments read--horrifying prose--about torture and sexual \nmutilation, in which a prisoner is forced to ``bite off the prisoner's \ntesticle,'' resulting in his death; as horrible as these events are to \nrecite, they are minuscule compared to the horror of what is going on \nin Bosnia today, and the acts of savagery, brutality, and atrocities \nbeing committed by the Bosnian Serbs on the Bosnian Moslems.\n  The words ``ethnic cleansing'' hardly begin to describe what is going \non in that atrocious situation.\n  Meanwhile, the democracies of the world, the West, have permitted \nthis atrocious situation to continue. I believe that the time has long \npassed when there has to be a change in United States policy on how we \ndeal with Bosnia. The time has long passed when there has to be a \nchange in NATO policy on how we deal with Bosnia.\n And the time has long passed when there has to be a change in U.N. \npolicy, on how we deal with Bosnia.\n\n  I believe that the resolution offered tonight is a minimal step \nforward to try to implement a new policy which is urgently required. It \nis a minimal step to lift the arms embargo, to let the Bosnian Moslems \ndefend themselves, as they have every right to do under article 51 of \nthe U.N. Charter.\n  Action by the Senate, by the Congress, by the Government of the \nUnited States--depending upon what happens here in the House, the \nPresident's reaction, the veto, a possible override or perhaps the \nimpetus of a strong statement by the U.S. Senate--will cause a marked \nchange in U.S. policy and what has to be U.S. leadership. There has \nbeen a vacuum in U.S. leadership and I think that is conceded on all \nsides. It is not a political matter. Republicans were critical of \nPresident Bush for the arms embargo. The Senator from Connecticut, \nSenator Lieberman, has been critical of the President, of his own \nparty. Senator Kerrey, of Nebraska, who is vice chairman of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, a committee which I chair, has been critical of \nhis own President and is quoted, ``The President's leadership has been \nawful. He campaigned criticizing President George Bush for not doing \nenough and \n\n[[Page S 10238]]\nimplied that we were going to take the side of the Bosnian Moslems.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this newsclip be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. So we are not talking about a matter that is political. \nThe reality is that our President is inexperienced and inattentive and \nindecisive and ineffective. It is time that leadership came from the \nUnited States Senate, as this body had to start the leadership to get \nthe United States forces out of Somalia when we passed a resolution \ncutting off the funds, as we have the authority to do under our \nappropriations power.\n  I submit that leadership by the U.S. Senate may well have the effect \nof profoundly changing, not only U.S. policy but NATO policy and U.N. \npolicy as well. U.N. peacekeepers have had a ``Mission Impossible'' in \nBosnia, because there is no peace to keep. I submit the U.N. \npeacekeepers ought to be withdrawn. That is indispensable before the \narms embargo is lifted, so that the UN peacekeepers are out of harm's \nway.\n  That would then put us in a position to have an option of massive \nbombing. There are arguments both ways, as to whether the bombing would \nbe sufficient. There is a substantial basis for saying if the bombing \nwere sufficiently intense and if the Bosnian Moslems were armed, that a \nbalance of power could be restored there. We subjected Baghdad to \nrelentless bombing during the gulf war, for months in advance of the \ninvasion.\n  A question is raised as to whether there ought to be consideration to \nretaliating against the cities of the Bosnian Serbs. I am not prepared \nto answer that question. That issue has been raised, as to whether the \ndoctrine of proportionality makes any sense when the only reaction to \nthe attacks of the Bosnian Serbs is a proportional counterattack. That \nleaves them to call the shots at every turn, because, under the \ndoctrine of proportionality, which has been adopted by the United \nNations, the Bosnian Serbs are not at risk. And there is a real \nquestion as to whether that policy ought to be abandoned.\n  Then you have the dual key issue, where every decision has to be \napproved by the United Nations and NATO. There is very strong reason to \nbelieve that the decisions ought not to be made by the United Nations \nfrom their record up to the present time. You have the courageous \nleadership of the French President, Chirac, who says he is prepared to \nact and he is prepared to take some forceful steps. He asks for support \nfrom the United States, with helicopters, for some air cover. I am not \nsure whether that is a wise course, but that is a request which ought \nto be considered.\n  I am opposed to United States participation in a ground war in \nBosnia. I do not think we should lend U.S. troops to any such effort. \nBut in terms of air strikes, which are not entirely without risk as we \nknow--one pilot, Captain O'Grady, was downed there--helicopters may or \nmay not be committed. There are also risks involved. But it is \nsomething which ought to be considered.\n  I believe, Mr. President, if we have forceful leadership coming from \nthe United States--and when I say ``Mr. President,'' those who may be \nwatching on C-SPAN2 should know that is our formal way of addressing \nthe Presiding Officer of this body, not the President of the United \nStates--but, if the Senate takes a forceful stand, that could have an \nimpact on leading President Clinton to change his position and it may \nwell be with leadership which comes out of the U.S. Senate that we will \nchange the policy of President Clinton and together we can change the \npolicy of NATO. We can change the policy of the United Nations. We can \nchange the policy of France and Britain, if we undertake what French \nPresident Chirac has wanted to accomplish.\n  Mr. President, when we see the genocide and the atrocities that are \ngoing on in Bosnia, we really wonder about America's response in \nanother era. I recall vividly my father recounting his experiences as \nan American doughboy in the American Expeditionary Force in France in \nWorld War I. My father came to this country from Russia to escape the \nczar's heel. He was not willing to go to Siberia to fight for the czar. \nBut he was ready, willing, able, and really anxious to go to France to \nfight for America, as he put it, as I remember hearing him talk about \nit growing up, ``to make the world safe for democracy.'' I know my \nbrother and brother-in-law served in World War II against the scourge \nof the Nazis and the Japanese after the attack on Pearl Harbor. And I \nserved stateside during the Korean war.\n  We have a different attitude today, Mr. President, in the United \nStates, as to the extent we are willing to stand up for honor and for \nvalues and to stop the kind of atrocities which are going on in Bosnia. \nBut I do believe that the entire policy of the Clinton administration \nneeds reevaluation from top to bottom, and the resolution which is \npending right now, to lift the arms embargo, is a step in the right \ndirection. I hope that this will start a debate in the United States \nSenate so that we can consider the very serious questions which are in \nissue here,\n and we can consider the values of the United States, which we so \nproudly proclaim, and consider acting upon those values and supporting \nthem when we see the kind of atrocities which are going on in Bosnia. \nAnd we know the values articulated by the NATO alliance, and we know \nthe values articulated by the United Nations. And it is time we put \nsome action behind those words.\n\n  The first step on the action is a step to unilaterally lift the arms \nembargo. If we move ahead with consultation--and it will take some \ntime--and there is a real question as to whether there would be \nsufficient votes to pass the resolution and a greater question as to \nwhether there would be sufficient votes to override a Presidential \nveto, perhaps we will find that we can change the policy of the United \nNations and that we will end up acting in concert with France, Great \nBritain, and the other NATO powers.\n  But there is a very important issue, Mr. President, which we cannot \nduck any longer. I am glad to see the resolution offered because I \nthink it is time we took a look at what is going on in Bosnia and look \nin the mirror to see how we feel about the kinds of values we \narticulate and the kinds of actions we are prepared to back up.\n  It is a matter which cries out for leadership. But it is a very \ndifficult matter because of the obvious reluctance and reticence of \nanyone to see ground troops deployed in Bosnia or to see any casualties \ninflicted on American fighting men and women. But these are issues \nwhich need to be considered. And the American people need to know what \nis going on there so there can be a public reaction to the kinds of \natrocities which are going on--where young women are hanging themselves \nrather than to be subjected to the atrocities of the Bosnian Serbs and \nlads taken out in great numbers and having their throats slit \napparently so that they will not grow into another generation to pose \nsome theoretical problem for the Serbs; to have the ethnic cleansing, \nand to have an entire genocide of an entire people.\n  So I support the pending resolution.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                    Kerrey Criticizes the President\n\n                          (By David C. Beeder)\n\n       Washington.--Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., accused President \n     Clinton Tuesday of a lack of leadership in Bosnia's civil \n     war.\n       ``The president's leadership has been awful,'' Kerrey said \n     in an interview. ``He campaigned criticizing (President \n     George) Bush for not doing enough and implied we were going \n     to take the side of the Bosnian Muslims.'' Since then, Kerrey \n     said, Clinton has been ``sending a message that's pretty \n     strong that the cavalry is coming up over the hill.''\n       In a press conference later, Kerrey said Senate Majority \n     Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., ``is closer to being right'' with \n     his plan to disregard a U.N. arms embargo that has \n     handicapped the Bosnian government.\n       Kerrey said he could support such a plan if it required \n     other countries' approval and if it first called for \n     withdrawal of all U.N. peacekeepers.\n       At the same time, Kerrey said, the United States must be \n     ``careful not to respond emotionally to scenes of violence \n     and atrocities'' against one side or the other in the civil \n     war, saying the conflict did not consist of ``a single issue \n     where the Muslims are right and the Serbs are wrong.''\n       Kerrey's fellow Nebraska senator, Democrat J.J. Exon, urged \n     caution in responding to events in Bosnia.\n\n[[Page S 10239]]\n\n       ``With all the atrocities that are taking place over there, \n     there is a tendency to come unglued,'' he said.\n       Exon said he was concerned about a request that the United \n     States send helicopters into combat zones to deliver U.N. \n     reinforcement troops.\n       ``The more people they put in there the more difficult it \n     will be to extricate them,'' Exon said, noting that Clinton \n     has pledged to send U.S. ground troops to help if the U.N. \n     decides it must withdraw from Bosnia.\n       Exon said he has always opposed sending U.S. ground troops.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/18/senate-section/article/S10231-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/18/senate-section/article/S10239-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10239-S10241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO--MESSAGE \n                       FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 67\n\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  On May 30, 1992, in Executive Order No. 12808, the President declared \na national emergency to deal with the threat to the national security, \nforeign policy, and economy of the United States arising from actions \nand policies of the Governments of Serbia and Montenegro, acting under \nthe name of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or the Federal \nRepublic of Yugoslavia, in their involvement in and support for groups \nattempting to seize territory in Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina by force and violence utilizing, in part, the forces of the \nso-called Yugoslav National Army (57 FR 23299, June 2, 1992). I \nexpanded the national emergency in Executive Order No. 12934 of October \n25, 1994, to address the actions and policies of the Bosnian Serb \nforces and the authorities in the territory of the Republic of Bosnia \nand Herzegovina that they control. The present report is submitted \npursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1641(c) and 1703(c). It discusses Administration \nactions and expenses directly related to the exercise of powers and \nauthorities conferred by the declaration of a national emergency in \nExecutive Order No. 12808 and Executive Order No. 12934 and to expanded \nsanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and \nMontenegro) (the ``FRY (S/M)'') and the Bosnian Serbs contained in \nExecutive Order No. 12810 of June 5, 1992 (57 FR 24347, June 9, 1992), \nExecutive Order No. 12831 of January 15, 1993 (58 FR 5253, Jan. 21, \n1993), Executive Order No. 12846 of April 25, 1993 (58 FR 25771, April \n27, 1993), and Executive Order No. 12934 of October 25, 1994 (59 FR \n54117, October 27, 1994).\n  1. Executive Order No. 12808 blocked all property and interests in \nproperty of the Governments of Serbia and Montenegro, or held in the \nname of the former Government of the Socialist Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia or the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, \nthen or thereafter located in the United States or within the \npossession or control of U.S. persons, including their overseas \nbranches.\n  Subsequently, Executive Order No. 12810 expanded U.S. actions to \nimplement in the United States the United Nations sanctions against the \nFRY (S/M) adopted in United Nations Security Council (``UNSC'') \nResolution 757 of May 30, 1992. In addition to reaffirming the blocking \nof FRY (S/M) Government property, this order prohibited transactions \nwith respect to the FRY (S/M) involving imports, exports, dealing in \nFRY-origin property, air and sea transportation, contract performance, \nfunds transfers, activity promoting importation or exportation or \ndealings in property, and official sports, scientific, technical, or \nother cultural representation of, or sponsorship by, the FRY (S/M) in \nthe United States.\n  Executive Order No. 12810 exempted from trade restrictions (1) \ntransshipments through the FRY (S/M), and (2) activities related to the \nUnited Nations Protection Force (``UNPROFOR''), the Conference on \nYugoslavia, or the European Community Monitor Mission.\n  On January 15, 1993, President Bush issued Executive Order No. 12831 \nto implement new sanctions contained in U.N. Security Council \nResolution 787 of November 16, 1992. The order revoked the exemption \nfor transshipments through the FRY (S/M) contained in Executive Order \nNo. 12810, prohibited transactions within the United States or by a \nU.S. person relating to FRY (S/M) vessels and vessels in which a \nmajority or controlling interest is held by a person or entity in, or \noperating from, the FRY (S/M), and stated that all such vessels shall \nbe considered as vessels of the FRY (S/M), regardless of the flag under \nwhich they sail.\n  On April 25, 1993, I issued Executive Order No. 12846 to implement in \nthe United States the sanctions adopted in UNSC Resolution 820 of April \n17, 1993. That resolution called on the Bosnian Serbs to accept the \nVance-Owen peace plan for the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and, \nif they failed to do so by April 26, called on member states to take \nadditional measures to tighten the embargo against the FRY (S/M) and \nSerbian controlled areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and \nthe United Nations Protected Areas in Croatia. Effective April 26, \n1993, the order blocked all property and interests in property of \ncommercial, industrial, or public utility undertakings or entities \norganized or located in the FRY (S/M), including property and interests \nin property of entities (wherever organized or located) owned or \ncontrolled by such undertakings or entities, that are or thereafter \ncome within the possession or control of U.S. persons.\n  On October 25, 1994, in view of UNSC Resolution 942 of September 23, \n1994, I issued Executive Order No. 12934 in order to take additional \nsteps with respect to the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. (59 FR \n54117, October 27, 1994.) Executive Order No. 12934 expands the scope \nof the national emergency declared in Executive Order No. 12808 to \naddress the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, \nforeign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the actions \nand policies of the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the \nterritory in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they control, \nincluding their refusal to accept the proposed territorial settlement \nof the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n  The Executive order blocks all property and interests in property \nthat are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United \nStates, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control \nof United States persons (including their overseas branches) of: (1) \nthe Bosnian Serb military and paramilitary forces and the authorities \nin areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of \nthose forces; (2) any entity, including any commercial, industrial, or \npublic utility undertaking, organized or located in those areas of the \nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb \nforces; (3) any entity, wherever organized or located, which is owned \nor controlled directly or indirectly by any person in, or resident in, \nthose areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control \nof Bosnian Serb forces; and (4) any person acting for or on behalf of \nany person within the scope of the above definitions.\n  The Executive order also prohibits the provision or exportation of \nservices to those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under \nthe control of Bosnian Serb forces, or to any person for the purpose of \nany business carried on in those areas, either from the United States \nor by a U.S. person. The order also prohibits the entry of any U.S.-\nflagged vessel, other than a U.S. naval vessel, into the riverine ports \nof those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the \ncontrol of Bosnia Serb forces. Finally, any transaction by any U.S. \nperson that evades or avoids, or has the purpose of evading or \navoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in \nthe order is prohibited. Executive Order No. 12934 became effective at \n11:59 p.m., e.d.t., on October 25, 1994.\n  2. The declaration of the national emergency on May 30, 1992, was \nmade pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the \nConstitution and laws of the United States, including the International \nEmergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the National \nEmergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of title 3 of \nthe United States Code. The\n emergency \n\n[[Page S 10240]]\ndeclaration was reported to the Congress on May 30, 1992, pursuant to \nsection 204(b) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 \nU.S.C. 1703(b)) and the expansion of that National Emergency under the \nsame authorities was reported to the Congress on October 25, 1994. The \nadditional sanctions set forth in related Executive orders were imposed \npursuant to the authority vested in the President by the Constitution \nand laws of the United States, including the statutes cited above, \nsection 1114 of the Federal Aviation Act (49 U.S.C. App. 1514), and \nsection 5 of the United Nations Participation Act (22 U.S.C. 287c).\n\n  3. There have been no amendments to the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) Sanctions Regulations (the \n``Regulations''), 31 C.F.R. Part 585, since the last report. The \nTreasury Department had previously published 853 names in the Federal \nRegister on November 17, 1994 (59 FR 59460), as part of a comprehensive \nlisting of all blocked persons and specially designated nationals \n(``SDNs'') of the FRY (S/M). This list identified individuals and \nentities determined by the Department of the Treasury to be owned or \ncontrolled by or acting for or on behalf of the Government of the FRY \n(S/M), persons in the FRY (S/M), or entities located or organized in or \ncontrolled from the FRY (S/M). All prohibitions in the Regulations \npertaining to the Government of the FRY (S/M) apply to the entities and \nindividuals identified. U.S. persons, on notice of the status of such \nblocked persons and specially designated nationals, are prohibited from \nentering into transactions with them, or transactions in which they \nhave an interest, unless otherwise exempted or authorized pursuant to \nthe Regulations.\n  On February 22, 1995, pursuant to Executive Order 12934 and the \nRegulations, Treasury identified 85 individuals as leaders of the \nBosnian Serb forces or civilian authorities in the territories in the \nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they control. Also on February \n22, Treasury designated 19 individuals and 23 companies as SDNs of the \nFRY (S/M). These designations include FRY (S/M)-connected companies \naround the world that are being directed from Cyprus, two Cypriot-owned \nfirms that have had a central role in helping establish and sustain \nsanctions-evading FRY (S/M) front companies in Cyprus, and the head of \nthe FRY (S/M)'s Central Bank who is also the architect of the FRY (S/M) \neconomic program.\n  Additionally, on March 13, 1995, Treasury named 32 firms and eight \nindividuals that are part of the Karic Brothers' family network of \ncompanies as SDNs of the FRY (S/M). Their enterprises span the globe \nand are especially active in former East Bloc countries. These \nadditions and amendments, published in the Federal Register on April \n18, 1995 (60 FR 19448), bring the current total of Blocked Entities and \nSDNs of the FRY (S/M) to 938 and the total number of individuals \nidentified as leaders of the Bosnian Serb military or paramilitary \nforces or civilian authorities in the territories in the Republic of \nBosnia and Herzegovina that they control to 85. A copy of the notice is \nattached.\n  Treasury's blocking authority as applied to FRY (S/M) subsidiaries \nand vessels in the United States has been challenged in court. In \nMilena Ship Management Company, Ltd. v. Newcomb, 804 F Supp. 846, 855, \nand 859 (E.D.L.A. 1992) aff'd, 995 F.2d 620 (5th Cir. 1993), cert. \ndenied, 114 S.Ct. 877 (1994), involving five ships owned or controlled \nby FRY (S/M) entities blocked in various U.S. ports, the blocking \nauthority as applied to these vessels was upheld. In IPT Company, Inc. \nv. United States Department of the Treasury, No. 92 CIV 5542 (S.D.N.Y. \n1994), the district court also upheld the blocking\n authority as applied to the property of a Yugoslav subsidiary located \nin the United States. The latter case is currently on appeal to the \nSecond Circuit.\n\n  4. Over the past 6 months, the Departments of State and Treasury have \nworked closely with European Union (the ``EU'') member states and other \nU.N. member nations to coordinate implementation of the U.N. sanctions \nagainst the FRY (S/M). This has included visits by assessment teams \nformed under the auspices of the United States, the EU, and the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (the ``OSCE'') to \nstates bordering on Serbia and Montenegro; continued deployment of OSCE \nsanctions assistance missions (``SAMs'') to Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, \nthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Hungary, Romania, and \nUkraine to assist in monitoring land and Danube River traffic; support \nfor the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia (``ICFY'') \nmonitoring missions along the Serbia-Montenegro-Bosnia border; \nbilateral contacts between the United States and other countries for \nthe purpose of tightening financial and trade restrictions on the FRY \n(S/M); and ongoing multilateral meetings by financial sanctions \nenforcement authorities from various countries to coordinate \nenforcement efforts and to exchange technical information.\n  5. In accordance with licensing policy and the Regulations, FAC has \nexercised its authority to license certain specific transactions with \nrespect to the FRY (S/M) that are consistent with U.S. foreign policy \nand the Security Council sanctions. During the reporting period, FAC \nhas issued 109 specific licenses regarding transactions pertaining to \nthe FRY (S/M) or assets it owns or controls, bringing the total as of \nApril 25, 1995, to 930. Specific licenses have been issued (1) for \npayment to U.S. or third-country secured creditors, under certain \nnarrowly-defined circumstances, for pre-embargo import and export \ntransactions; (2) for legal representation or advice to the Government \nof the FRY (S/M) or FRY (S/M)--located or controlled entities; (3) for \nthe liquidation or protection of tangible assets of subsidiaries of FRY \n(S/M)--located or controlled firms located in the U.S.; (4) for limited \ntransactions related to FRY (S/M) diplomatic representation in \nWashington and New York; (S) for patent, trademark and copyright \nprotection in the FRY (S/M) not involving payment to the FRY (S/M) \nGovernment; (6) for certain communications, news media, and travel-\nrelated transactions; (7) for the payment of crews' wages, vessel \nmaintenance, and emergency supplies for FRY (S/M) controlled ships \nblocked in the United States; (8) for the removal from the FRY (S/M), \nor protection within the FRY (S/M), of certain property owned and \ncontrolled by U.S. entities; (9) to assist the United Nations in its \nrelief operations and the activities of the U.N. Protection Force; and \n(10) for payment from funds outside the United States where a third \ncountry has licensed the transaction in accordance with U.N. sanctions. \nPursuant to U.S. regulations implementing UNSC Resolutions, specific \nlicenses have also been issued to authorize exportation of food, \nmedicine, and supplies intended for humanitarian purposes in the FRY \n(S/M).\n  During the past 6 months, FAC has continued to oversee the \nliquidation of tangible assets of the 15 U.S. subsidiaries of entities \norganized in the FRY (S/M). Subsequent to the issuance of Executive \nOrder No. 12846, all operating licenses issued for these U.S.-located \nSerbian or Montenegrin subsidiaries or joint ventures were revoked, and \nthe net proceeds of the liquidation of their assets placed in blocked \naccounts.\n  In order to reduce the drain on blocked assets caused by continuing \nto rent commercial space, FAC arranged to have the blocked personality, \nfiles, and records of the two Serbian banking institutions in New York \nmoved to secure storage. The personality is being liquidated, with the \nnet proceeds placed in blocked accounts.\n  Following the sale of the M/V Kapetan Martinovic in January 1995, \nfive Yugoslav-owned vessels remain blocked in the United States. \nApproval of the UNSC's Serbian sanctions Committee was sought and \nobtained for the sale of the M/V Kapetan Martinovic (and the M/V Bor, \nwhich was sold in June 1994) based on U.S. assurances that the sale \nwould comply with four basic conditions, which assure that both U.S. \nand U.N. sanctions objectives with respect to the FRY (S/M) are met: \n(1) the sale will be for fair market value; (2) the sale will result in \na complete divestiture of any interest of the FRY (S/M) (or of \ncommercial interests located in or controlled from the FRY (S/M) in the \nvessel; (3) the sale would result in no economic benefit to the FRY (S/\nM) (or commercial interests located in or controlled from the FRY (S/\nM)); and (4) the net proceeds of the sale (the gross proceeds less the \ncosts of sale normally paid by the seller) will \n\n[[Page S 10241]]\nbe placed in a blocked account in the United States. Negotiations for \nthe sale of the M/V Bar, now blocked in New Orleans, are underway and \nare likely to be concluded prior to my next report.\n  Other than the M/V Bar, the four remaining Yugoslav-owned vessels are \nbeneficially owned by Jugooceanija, Plovidba of Kotor, Montenegro, and \nmanaged by Milena Ship Management Co. Ltd. in Malta. These vessels have \nmany unpaid U.S. creditors for services and supplies furnished during \nthe time they have been blocked in the United States; moreover, the \nowner appears to have insufficient resources to provide for the future \nupkeep and maintenance needs of these vessels and their crews. The \nUnited States is notifying the UNSC's Serbian Sanctions Committee of \nthe United States's intention to license some or all of these remaining \nfour vessels upon the owner's request.\n  With the FAC-licensed sales of the M/V Kapetan Martinovic and the M/V \nBor, those vessels were removed from the list of blocked FRY entities \nand merchant vessels maintained by FAC. The new owners of several \nformerly Yugoslav-owned vessels, which have been sold in other \ncountries, have petitioned FAC to remove those vessels from the list. \nFAC, in coordination with the Department of State, is currently \nreviewing the sale terms and conditions for those vessels to ascertain \nwhether they comply with U.N. sanctions objectives and UNSC's Serbian \nSanctions Committee practice.\n  During the past 6 months, U.S. financial institutions have continued \nto block funds transfers in which there is an interest of the \nGovernment of the FRY (S/M) or an entity or undertaking located in or \ncontrolled from the FRY (S/M), and to stop prohibited transfers to \npersons in the FRY (S/M). Such interdicted transfers have accounted for \n$125.6 million since the issuance of Executive Order No. 12808, \nincluding some $9.3 million during the past 6 months.\n  To ensure compliance with the terms of the licenses that have been \nissued under the program, stringent reporting requirements are imposed. \nMore than 279 submissions have been reviewed by FAC since the last \nreport, and more than 125 compliance cases are currently open.\n  6. Since the issuance of Executive Order No. 12810, FAC has worked \nclosely with the U.S. Customs Service to ensure both that prohibited \nimports and exports (including those in which the Government of the FRY \n(S/M) or Bosnian Serb authorities have an interest) are identified and \ninterdicted, and that permitted\n imports and exports move to their intended destination without undue \ndelay. Violations and suspected violations of the embargo are being \ninvestigated and appropriate enforcement actions are being taken. There \nare currently 37 cases under active investigation. Since the last \nreport, FAC has collected nine civil penalties totaling nearly $20,000. \nOf these, five were paid by U.S. financial institutions for violative \nfunds transfers involving the Government of the FRY (S/M), persons in \nthe FRY (S/M), or entities located or organized in or controlled from \nthe FRY (S/M). Three U.S. companies and one air carrier have also paid \npenalties related to exports or unlicensed payments to the Government \nof the FRY (S/M) or persons in the FRY (S/M) or other violations of the \nRegulations.\n\n  7. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from November 30, 1994, through May 29, 1995, that are directly \nattributable to the authorities conferred by the declaration of a \nnational emergency with respect to the FRY (S/M) and the Bosnian Serb \nforces and authorities are estimated at about $3.5 million, most of \nwhich represent wage and salary costs for Federal personnel. Personnel \ncosts were largely centered in the Department of the Treasury \n(particularly in FAC and its Chief Counsel's Office, and the U.S. \nCustoms Service), the Department of State, the National Security \nCouncil, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Department of Commerce.\n  8. The actions and policies of the Government of the FRY (S/M), in \nits involvement in and support for groups attempting to seize and hold \nterritory in the Republics of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina by \nforce and violence, and the actions and policies of the Bosnian Serb \nforces and the authorities in the areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina under \ntheir control, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to \nthe national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United \nStates. The United States remains committed to a multilateral \nresolution of the conflict through implementation of the United Nations \nSecurity Council resolutions.\n  I shall continue to exercise the powers at my disposal to apply \neconomic sanctions against the FRY (S/M) and the Bosnian Serb forces, \ncivil authorities, and entities, as long as these measures are \nappropriate, and will continue to report periodically to the Congress \non significant developments pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).\n                                                  William J.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue \ncertificates of documentation and coastwise trade endorsements for the \nvessels Enchanted Isles and Enchanted Seas; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                     jones act waivers legislation\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I am introducing two bills to \nauthorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue certificates of \ndocumentation for certain vessels.\n\n\n                               hovercraft\n\n  The first bill would authorize the issuance of certificates of \ndocumentation with appropriate endorsements for employment in the \ncoastwise trade of the United States for 14 hovercraft formerly owned \nby the U.S. Army.\n  These hovercraft were built for the U.S. Army by Bell Aerospace Co. \nin Buffalo, NY, between 1982 and 1986.\n  The vessels are 76 feet in length and capable of hauling 30 tons of \ncargo each.\n  After being declared surplus by the U.S. Army in 1994, the hovercraft \nwere acquired by Champion Constructors, Inc., a subsidiary of Cook \nInlet Region, Inc., of Anchorage, AK.\n  The hovercraft are intended to be used for transporting cargo and \npassengers between points in Alaska.\n  It is my understanding that most of the major components of the \nhovercraft were constructed and assembled in the United States, but \nthat because some components were constructed in Canada, the hovercraft \nhave been determined by the Coast Guard to be ineligible to operate in \nthe coastwise trade of the United States.\n  The first bill I am introducing today would allow these vessels to be \noperated in the U.S. coastwise trade.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this bill be printed in the Record.\n\n\n                                vessels\n\n  Senator Hollings joins me as a cosponsor of the second bill I am \nintroducing today, which would authorize the Secretary of \nTransportation to issue certificates of documentation with appropriate \nendorsements for employment in the coastwise trade of the United States \nfor two cruise ships that were built in the United States but that are \ncurrently being operated under the Panamanian flag.\n  It is my understanding that the Enchanted Isle and Enchanted Seas \nwere built in the 1950's in Mississippi, and that they can carry \napproximately 1,000 passengers each.\n  The vessels left the United States coastwise trade and began flying \nthe Panamanian flag in 1972.\n  A U.S. flag company, International Marine Carriers, is in the process \nof acquiring the vessels, and would like to employ them in trade in the \nGulf of Mexico and along the east coast.\n   The vessels will provide jobs for U.S. seamen, and it is my \nunderstanding that U.S. maritime unions support waiving them into the \nU.S. trade. The Coast Guard authorization bill passed in the House \nearlier this year included waivers for the two ships.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1046\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     notwithstanding section 12106, 12107, and 12108 of title 46, \n     United States Code, and section 27 of the Merchant Marine \n     Act, 1920 (46 App. U.S.C. 883), as applicable on the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation may \n     issue certificates of documentation with appropriate \n     endorsements for employment in the coastwise trade of the \n     United States for the fourteen former U.S. Army hovercraft \n     with serial numbers LACV-30-04, LACV-30-05, LACV-30-07, LACV-\n     30-09, LACV-30-10, LACV-30-13, LACV-30-14, LACV-30-15, LACV-\n     30-16, LACV-30-22, LACV-30-23, LACV-30-24, LACV-30-25, and \n     LACV-30-26.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                                S. 1047\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     notwithstanding section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 \n     (46 U.S.C.

Mr. President, today I introduced the NASA \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996. NASA faces two challenges. The \nfirst is maintaining America's leadership in aeronautics and space. The \nsecond is accomplishing the leadership goal within the confines of a \nbalanced Federal budget. This authorization is intended to allow NASA \nto meet both of these challenges.\n  NASA started out this year with a plan to cut $5 billion over 5 years \nfrom its budget. Then, the Senate and House developed budget plans \nwhich require even deeper cuts. As a result, our bill authorizes a \ntotal of $13.8 billion for NASA in fiscal year 1996, a 3-percent \ndecrease from the current funding level of $14.26 billion.\n  Despite the funding cut, the bill manages to support a diverse and \nforward-looking space program. It authorizes all of NASA's major \ncurrent programs such as Mission to Planet Earth, Space Station, Space \nScience, and Aeronautics and, in almost all cases, at their requested \nfunding levels. At the same time, it prepares NASA for the future by \nauthorizing a number of new starts including the new Reusable Launch \nVehicle Technology Development Program aimed at providing private \nindustry the technology to eventually build a Shuttle replacement, and \na new radar satellite program to develop and make use of the latest \nadvances in satellite remote sensing technology.\n  Mr. President, I would now like to make special mention of certain \nportions of the bill.\n  I believe Mission to Planet Earth may be NASA's most important and \nrelevant program. The satellite data from Mission to Planet Earth will \ndeliver direct benefits to the taxpayer in contrast to the speculative \nspinoffs promised by other space activities. For this reason, the bill \nfully funds this activity at the requested level of $1.36 billion.\n  Using the latest satellite technology, Mission to Planet Earth will \nhelp researchers understand and predict the global climate trends that \naffect our lives. As a Senator representing an agricultural State, I \nhave a keen interest in this program's potential to provide detailed \ndata on soil conditions, topography, crops, and other information \ncritical to the farming and ranching community. I also take great pride \nin the selection of the EROS Data Center in Sioux Falls, SD as one of \nthe regional data centers that will collect and distribute this \nsatellite data.\n  I am very concerned that, under the new budget constraints in which \nwe find ourselves, some may seek to sacrifice Mission to Planet Earth, \nand space science in general, to fund Space Station. that would be a \ndisservice to the Nation and I will oppose any such move strongly.\n  I am pleased with the direction of the baseline plan for the Mission \nto Planet Earth Program and am concerned about the possibility of NASA \ntaking any imprudent and unnecessary efforts to restructure the \nprogram. Accordingly, the bill specifically prohibits NASA from \nchanging the program unless, 60 days before such action, NASA has \nreported to Congress on the nature and overall impact of the planned \nchanges.\n  The bill also provides the full $2.1 billion requested funding for \nspace station. However, this authorization should not be interpreted as \na ringing endorsement of that program. I am a longstanding supporter of \nthe program, but, in recent years, I have become concerned that it has \nbecome too expensive, too complex, and too dependent on the \ncontributions of Russia, the latest station partner.\n  In a June 1995 report, the General Accounting Office [GAO] estimated \nthat the total cost of the design, launch, and operation of the space \nstation will be $94 billion. That is almost seven times the entire \nannual budget for NASA. Given the history of past missions, it is fair \nto assume that $94 billion price tag for the program will increase over \ntime. If that happens, we may wake up to find the enormous space \nstation budget has crowded out every other NASA program and that space \nstation has become NASA's only mission. Because of my reservations \nabout space station, I may well reconsider my support in the future.\n  The bill also supports several new starts at NASA to extend its \nvision into the next century. The bill authorizes a reusable launch \nvehicle program, which will support the X-33 and X-34 activities to \npave the way for the later development by private enterprise of a \nreplacement for the shuttle in the next decade.\n  Employing 1970's technologies and costing $400 million per flight, \nthe shuttle may have outlived its usefulness. However, within today's \nbudget constraints, the Government cannot afford to foot the entire \nbill for a new multibillion spacecraft development program. That is why \nthe reusable launch vehicle program, with its emphasis on sharing \nfinancing with industry and its goal of moving our national space \ntransportation system toward privatization, seems a viable concept \nworth pursuing.\n  Also authorized are the New Millennium initiative to develop new \nmicrominiature technologies aimed at reducing the cost and development \ntimes for satellites and two infrared astronomy programs--the \nStratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy and the Space Infrared \nTelescope Facility. The bill also authorizes a new Radar Satellite \nProgram we call ``TopSat,'' and a third shuttle flight for the Shuttle \nImaging Radar-C satellite. Because radar satellites have the ability to \n``see'' through cloud cover, they will dramatically enhance the \ncapability of the Nation's existing optical-based satellite systems \nsuch as Landsat. With Japan and Europe already operating radar \nsatellite systems, and with Canada poised to deploy one later this \nyear, the United States cannot afford to be left behind in this \ncritical technology.\n  In my role as chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation, it has become apparent to me that small-city, rural \nStates like my home State of South Dakota are often forgotten in our \nvast $70 billion Federal science and technology enterprise. That part \nof America wants to be part of the technological revolution. More \nimportant, it wants to contribute.\n  It is in the national interest to strengthen the scientific talent, \nresources, and infrastructure in our rural States through appropriate \nresearch, education, and outreach activities. The bill attempts to \naccomplish this in several ways. It increases funding for the \nExperimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research Program [EPSCoR] \nfrom its current level of $4.9 million to $6.9 million. NASA's EPSCoR \nProgram, as well as similar programs in six other science agencies, \nhave been instrumental in providing Federal funding for academic \nresearch in rural States. Our bill also funds a Rural Teacher Resource \nCenter, a Rural Technology Transfer and Commercialization Center, and a \nregional science education and outreach center for the Plains States \nregion.\n  Mr. President, I believe NASA is up to the challenge of keeping \nAmerica preeminent in aeronautics and space despite the intense budget \npressure and despite the increasing competition from other spacefaring \nnations. It is my belief this authorization bill provides NASA with the \nsupport it needs to meet that challenge.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

proposed an amendment \nto amendment No. 1786 proposed by Mr. Ashcroft to the bill (S. 343) to \nreform the regulatory process, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be added, add the \n     following:\n\n               ``TITLE II--URBAN REGULATORY RELIEF ZONES\n\n     SECTION 201. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Urban Regulatory Relief Zone \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the likelihood that a proposed business site will \n     comply with many government regulations is inversely related \n     to the length of time over which a site has been utilized for \n     commercial and/or industrial purposes in the past, thus \n     rendering older sites in urban areas the sites most unlikely \n     to be chosen for new development and thereby forcing new \n     development away from the areas most in need of economic \n     growth and job creation; and\n       (2) broad Federal regulations often have unintended social \n     and economic consequences in urban areas where such \n     regulations, among other things--\n       (A) offend basic notions of common sense, particularly when \n     applied to individual sites;\n       (B) adversely impact economic stability;\n       (C) result in the unnecessary loss of existing jobs and \n     businesses;\n       (D) undermine new economic development, especially in \n     previously used sites;\n       (E) create undue economic hardships while failing \n     significantly to protect human health, particularly in areas \n     where economic development is urgently needed in order to \n     improve the health and welfare of residents over the long \n     term; and\n       (F) contribute to social deterioration to a such degree \n     that high unemployment, crime, and other economic and social \n     problems create the greatest risk to the health and well-\n     being of urban residents.\n\n     SEC. 203. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are to--\n       (1) enable qualifying cites to provide for the general \n     well-being, ealth, safety and security for their residents \n     living in distressed areas by empowering such cities to \n     obtain selective relief from Federal regulations that \n     undermine economic stability and development in distressed \n     areas within the city; and\n       (2) authorize Federal agencies to waive the application of \n     specific Federal regulations in distressed urban areas \n     designated as Urban Regulatory Relief Zones by an Economic \n     Development Commission--\n       (A) upon application through the Office of Management and \n     Budget by an Economic Development Commission established by a \n     qualifying city pursuant to section 205; and\n       (B) upon a determination by the appropriate Federal agency \n     that granting such a waiver will not substantially endanger \n     health or safety.\n\n     SEC. 204.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) For the reasons stated in section 520 of the Foreign \n     Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 \n     (Public Law 103-236), the Congress has found that continued \n     application of an international arms embargo to the \n     Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina contravenes that \n     Government's inherent right of individual or collective self-\n     defense under Article 51 of the United National Charter and \n     therefore is inconsistent with international law.\n       (2) The United States has not formally sought multilateral \n     support for terminating the embargo against Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina through a vote on a United Nations Security \n     Council resolution since the enactment of section 1404 of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 \n     (Public Law 103-337).\n       (3) The United Nations Security Council has not taken \n     measures necessary to maintain international peace and \n     security in Bosnia and Herzegovina since the aggression \n     against that country began in April 1992.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF SUPPORT.\n\n       The Congress supports the efforts of the Government of the \n     Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina--\n       (1) to defend its people and the territory of the Republic;\n       (2) to preserve the sovereignty, independence, and \n     territorial integrity of the Republic; and\n       (3) to bring about a peaceful, just, fair, viable, and \n     sustainable settlement of the conflict in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina.\n\n     SEC. 4. TERMINATION OF ARMS EMBARGO.\n\n       (a) Termination.--The President shall terminate the United \n     States arms embargo of the Government of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina, as provided in subsection (b), following--\n       (1) receipt by the United States Government of a request \n     from the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina for termination \n     of the United States arms embargo and submission by the \n     Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in exercise of its \n     sovereign rights as a nation, of a request to the United \n     Nations Security Council for the departure of UNPROFOR from \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina; or\n       (2) a decision by the United Nations Security Council, or \n     decisions by countries contributing forces to UNPROFOR, to \n     withdraw UNPROFOR from Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       (b) Implementation of Termination.--The President may \n     implement termination of the United States arms embargo of \n     the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina pursuant to \n     subsection (a) prior to the date of completion of the \n     withdrawal of UNPROFOR personnel from Bosnia and Herzegovina, \n     but shall, subject to subsection (c), implement termination \n     of the embargo pursuant to that subsection no later than the \n     earlier of--\n       (1) the date of completion of the withdrawal of UNPROFOR \n     personnel from Bosnia and Herzegovina; or\n       (2) the date which is 12 weeks after the date of submission \n     by the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina of a request to \n     the United Nations Security Council for the departure of \n     UNPROFOR from Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       (c) Presidential Waiver Authority.--If the President \n     determines and reports in advance to Congress that the \n     safety, security, and successful completion of the withdrawal \n     of UNPROFOR personnel from Bosnia and Herzegovina in \n     accordance with subsection (b)(2) requires more time than the \n     period provided for in that subsection, the President may \n     extend the time period available under subsection (b)(2) for \n     implementing termination of the United States arms embargo of \n     the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina for a period of up \n     to 30 days. The authority in this subsection may be exercised \n     to extend the time period available under subsection (b)(2) \n     for more than one 30-day period.\n       (d) Presidential Reports.--Within 7 days of the \n     commencement of the withdrawal of UNPROFOR from Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina, and every 14 days thereafter, the President \n     shall report in writing to the President pro tempore of the \n     Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives on the \n     status and estimated date of completion of the withdrawal \n     operation.

RAPID REACTION CAPABILITY\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I learned in reading a newspaper about \nCanada's \n\n[[Page S 10252]]\nleadership in providing a study on methods of improvement of the U.N. \nrapid reaction capability.\n  As many of my colleagues in the Senate know, I have had concerns in \nthis area for some time.\n  I wrote to Minister of Foreign Affairs Andre Ouellet, and he sent me \na letter, which I ask unanimous consent to insert at the end of this \nstatement.\n  Among other things, he enclosed a background paper, that I also \nrequest be inserted at the end of my statement, because it provides \npractical insights into our situation.\n  It is interesting that the background paper mentions Rwanda. Senator \nJeffords and I had the experience of calling a Canadian general, \nGeneral Daullaire, who was in charge of the small U.N. force in Rwanda \nwhen things first started getting difficult. This was in May 1994.\n  General Daullaire told us that if he could get 5,000-8,000 troops \nthere quickly, the situation in Rwanda could be stabilized.\n  Senator Jeffords and I immediately dispatched a message to the State \nDepartment and to the White House.\n  Nothing of significance happened until October, when the United \nNations Security Council authorized action; then the French, to their \ngreat credit, immediately sent 2,000 troops to provide a little \nstability, but the United Nations was slow to act.\n  We went through a similar situation in Somalia.\n  Bosnia presents another example of action that is much too slow.\n  My colleagues know that I have introduced legislation that would \nauthorize up to 3,000 American volunteers among our armed forces to be \navailable on short notice, if the Security Council acts, and the \nPresident of the United States approves. I assume other nations would \nbe willing to volunteer a similar, relatively small force.\n  If the Secretary General of the United Nations had such power at his \ndisposal when authorized by the Security Council, we would not have had \nsome of the difficulties that now threaten our world. And the great \nthreat to the world today is instability.\n  After the Security Council acted in Somalia, it took 6 weeks to get \n500 Pakistani troops to Mogadishu, and when I visited Somalia and found \nthe desperate situation and called the Secretary General about it, he \ntold me that the additional 3,000 troops then authorized would be sent \nby ship. When I urged that they be sent by plane and that an additional \n10,000 troops be sent, he said that our government--the U.S. \ngovernment--charges so much to send troops by plane that they could not \nafford it.\n  I will not go into the rest of the background, but it illustrates the \nwisdom of the Canadian leadership.\n  I commend Prime Minister Jean Chretien and Minister of Foreign \nAffairs Andre Ouellet for their leadership.\n  And I hope the United States will be an enthusiastic partner and not \nbe a nation that is dragging its feet on this issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to read the background paper from the Canadian \nGovernment. I ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n                                  Minister of Foreign Affairs,\n\n                                     Ottawa, Canada, June 8, 1995.\n     Hon. Paul Simon,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Simon: Thank you for your letter of February \n     6, 1995, regarding the Canadian study to improve the United \n     Nations (UN) rapid reaction capability. Your words of support \n     for our efforts are appreciated.\n       As you are aware, Canada has made UN reform a foreign \n     policy priority. A key element of our position is to ensure \n     that the UN operates with greater efficiency and \n     effectiveness. The Government is committed to the active, \n     continued and effective engagement of the Canadian Forces in \n     international peacekeeping operations.\n       The aim of the Canadian study is to make practical \n     proposals to enhance the UN's rapid reaction capability in \n     the field of peace operations. My officials are consulting \n     extensively with other interested states to ensure the widest \n     possible support for our initiative. The findings of the \n     study are scheduled to be tabled at the 50th anniversary of \n     the UN General Assembly in the fall of 1995.\n       For further details of the Canadian study, you may wish to \n     consult the enclosed copies of recent press releases and of \n     my address to the International Conference on Improving the \n     UN's Rapid Reaction Capability.\n       Once again, thank you for bringing your views to my \n     attention.\n           Yours sincerely,\n     Andre Ouellet.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n     Improving the UN's Rapid Reaction Capability: A Canadian Study\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       At the UN General Assembly in September 1994, Foreign \n     Affairs Minister Andre Ouellet proposed a concrete step \n     toward the goal of enhancing the UN's responsiveness in the \n     field of peace operations. In committing Canada to making a \n     direct contribution to this end, Mr. Ouellet said:\n       ``The experience of the last few years leads us to believe \n     that we need to explore even more innovative options than \n     those considered to date. Recent peacekeeping missions have \n     shown that the traditional approach no longer applies. As we \n     have seen in Rwanda, rapid deployment of intervention forces \n     is essential.\n       ``In light of the situation, the Government of Canada has \n     decided to conduct an in-depth review of the short-, medium- \n     and long-term options available to use to strengthen the UN's \n     rapid response capability in times of crisis. Among these \n     options, we feel that the time has come to study the \n     possibility, over the long term, of creating a permanent UN \n     military force. We will ask the world's leading experts for \n     their input and will inform all member states of the results \n     of the study.''\n       The Government of Canada has now begun this extensive \n     study.\n\n\n                                context\n\n       The rapid increase in the size, scope and number of peace \n     operations since the end of the Cold War reflects both the \n     ongoing transformation of the international system and the \n     new expectation that the United Nations can and should play a \n     pivotal role in the emerging global order. There have been \n     both startling successes and troublesome failures among the \n     over 21 new missions launched since 1988. However, no firm \n     consensus has developed regarding how and why UN peace \n     operations succeed, or on when the UN should avoid engagement \n     in a given situation that is not yet amenable to an effective \n     peace mission.\n       Certainly, there have been many recent improvements in how \n     the UN undertakes peace operations. These range from greater \n     political understanding of the mechanism itself in member \n     state capitals, to enhancement of the means available to the \n     Secretary-General in\n      the Secretariat, to a growing sophistication \n     organizationally and operationally at the level of field \n     missions. Many member states remain actively engaged in \n     promoting these improvements and in working incrementally \n     on the full spectrum of peacekeeping issues.\n       One particular, seemingly intractable issue that to some \n     extent reflects the broader problems outlined above, is that \n     of responsiveness. A review of several missions over the past \n     five years clearly indicates that a more rapid, coherent \n     response to an emerging crisis could have had a much more \n     dramatic impact on the evolving situation than that which \n     actually occurred. The example of Rwanda illustrates the \n     problem in bold relief. Despite various unco-ordinated \n     indications that a crisis was imminent, even a minimal \n     response had to await the onset of crisis. At this point, the \n     detailed planning and mounting of the operation were \n     excruciatingly slow, with deployment of troops taking place \n     months after they were officially committed.\n       Improving the UN's rapid reaction capability is not a new \n     theme. The first UN Secretary-General, Trygve Lie, raised the \n     subject as early as 1948. Considerable attention was devoted \n     to this issue as early as 1957 in the aftermath of the \n     successful deployment of UNEF I in the Sinai. The Special \n     Committee on Peacekeeping (Committee of 34) has also devoted \n     considerable energy to the concept in the intervening years. \n     Today, this topic is again near the top of the peacekeeping \n     agenda, with a particular focus on the idea of a UN force as \n     one means to achieve this end.\n       The resurgence of the theme of enhanced responsiveness \n     reflects a number of recent developments in the international \n     arena. With the end of the Cold War, there is no obvious \n     reason why the UN cannot react more quickly to crisis. The \n     absence of bipolar confrontation, and consequent minimal \n     recourse to the veto on the part of permanent members of the \n     Security Council, as well as the apparent end to rigidly \n     defined spheres of influence, suggest that improved Great \n     Power comity should lead to more effective and efficient \n     international co-operation. At the same time, human rights \n     and humanitarian concerns, once held hostage to the Cold War, \n     have surfaced in a compelling way. This has led to a shift in \n     political and strategic calculations from a strict emphasis \n     on order to a more subtle one, in which the idea of justice \n     enjoys priority. Finally, global media coverage continues to \n     generate domestic and international pressure to act quickly, \n     albeit on a selective basis.\n       These factors pose challenges to the international \n     community. Equally, they offer opportunities to act \n     constructively in developing the necessary instruments to \n     deal quickly and effectively with genuine threats to \n     international peace and security.\n                               objective\n\n       The aim of the study is to make practical proposals to \n     enhance the UN's rapid reaction capability in the field of \n     peace operations.\n\n\n                                 scope\n\n       The Canadian study will analyze the problem of rapid \n     reaction capability from the perspective of the UN system as \n     a whole. The \n\n[[Page S 10253]]\n     functions that need to be performed at the political, strategic, \n     operational and tactical levels will be identified. A key \n     component of this analysis will be a clear description of the \n     crucial interrelationships among these levels, based on the \n     premise that deficiencies and inadequacies in any one sphere \n     directly influence success or failure throughout the system. \n     For example, the ready availability of an operational element \n     remains dependent upon both the generation of political will, \n     and adequate ongoing strategic planning and direction for its \n     effectiveness.\n       The focus of the study will be at the operational and \n     tactical levels. The greatest challenges lie here, given the \n     virtually complete ad hoc nature of mounting today's peace \n     operations and the slow, inefficient assembly of disparate \n     tactical units in the theatre of operations. Even given \n     adequate warning and the existence of strategic plans to \n     react, there is a virtual vacuum at the operational level in \n     the UN system. At present, there is no standing headquarters \n     that is capable of organizing, integrating and directing \n     forces based on common doctrine and standards.\n       In keeping with the requirement to make practical \n     recommendations that respond to today's needs, as well as the \n     achievement of potential advances in the future, the study \n     will develop proposals for the short, medium and long terms. \n     In this context, the study of the concept of a UN standing \n     force will involve both its feasibility and modus operandi \n     once established over the long term, as well as the \n     relationship between short- and medium-term projects and \n     their possible cumulative contributions to its ultimate \n     creation.\n       Finally, the study will look at the impact of a standing \n     force on the activities of regional organizations and their \n     capabilities in this area. Regional actors and organizations \n     should have a high motivation to react quickly to emerging \n     crises in their own regions. Similarly, in some important \n     respects at least, they should be inherently more capable of \n     moving quickly into a theatre of operations. The comparative \n     advantages of operating at a global or regional level will be \n     addressed, and proposals will be developed to achieve a \n     balanced effort in accordance with\n      the intent of Chapter VIII of the UN Charter, and along the \n     lines recently advocated by Secretary-General Boutros \n     Boutros-Ghali.\n\n\n                               structure\n\n       The study will be guided by a steering group of senior \n     officials and military officers, co-chaired by the Department \n     of Foreign Affairs and International Trade and the Department \n     of National Defense. The steering group will oversee the \n     study and commission supporting technical studies as \n     appropriate.\n       In order to provide the broadest possible international \n     input into the study, an international consultative group is \n     being established. This group, drawn from well-known and \n     accomplished diplomats, government officials, soldiers and \n     academics, will review the work in progress and exchange \n     views as the study proceeds. Three conferences will also be \n     organized under the aegis of the study, to which various \n     member states, non-governmental authorities and specialists \n     will be invited. The first two conferences will draw \n     primarily on Canadian experts, and will focus on the \n     operational/technical and the strategic/political levels, \n     respectively. The third conference will be international in \n     scope, and will be organized around a meeting of the \n     international consultative group in April 1995. The results \n     of all of these conferences will be incorporated into the \n     final report.\n       Throughout the study process, Canada will consult on a \n     bilateral basis with member states interested in monitoring \n     the progress of and exchanging views on the study. Canada \n     would also hope to collaborate with other member states \n     pursuing similar or complementary ideas.\n       A key consultative partner during the study will be the UN \n     Secretariat. The steering group will keep the Secretary-\n     General informed of the progress of the study, seek his views \n     as appropriate, and invite relevant Secretariat officials to \n     the conferences.\n\n\n                                content\n\n       The study is intended to focus on enhancing the UN's rapid \n     reaction capability. It is not a study on how to improve UN \n     peacekeeping generally. Nonetheless, these two themes have \n     much in common that must be taken into account in the overall \n     context of the study. Therefore, the study will review past \n     experience relevant to the aim of this project, including a \n     review of major concepts and initiatives that represent \n     significant milestones on the road to the present. Particular \n     attention will be paid to developments since the end of the \n     Cold War. Furthermore, the study will be guided by the \n     orientation and concepts articulated\n      by the Secretary-General in An Agenda for Peace. Due regard \n     will be accorded to non-military aspects of peace \n     operations, such as prevention diplomacy, the political \n     component of all such operations and peacebuilding. \n     Peacekeeping will be treated in its broadest context.\n       The study will focus on the specific issue of improved \n     responsiveness, given the structure and nature of \n     contemporary peacekeeping. This will take account of the \n     interrelationships among the political, strategic, \n     operational and tactical components of any peace operation, \n     as well as the relevance for rapid reaction of the \n     integration of political, humanitarian, police and military \n     elements, including non-governmental organizations (NGOs). \n     Similarly, the study will address the question of command and \n     control systems and their contribution to an improved rapid \n     reaction capability. The conditions under which nations are \n     willing to make their resources available to the UN are \n     crucial to their political commitment and readiness to act. \n     Paramount among these concerns is the nature and competence \n     of command and control structures and relationships. The role \n     of the Security Council in mobilizing political support and \n     providing ongoing guidance is essential.\n       The study will elaborate the component elements of a rapid \n     reaction capability in a generic sense. This section of the \n     study will address the requirement for, and provision of, \n     among other things, early warning, integrated planning \n     capability, command and control systems, logistics capability \n     and doctrine/standards/interoperability. An important element \n     will be the nature of standing forces, options for their \n     development and a discussion of their potential utility.\n       Having established the basis for rapid reaction, the study \n     will address in concrete terms what can be done to achieve \n     this capability. The study will outline proposals that \n     logically fit into one of the three time frames envisaged. \n     The implications of a given proposal at one of the four \n     levels (political, strategic, operational and tactical) for \n     the remaining levels will be explored. For example, the \n     establishment of regional stocks in two or more locations has \n     direct implications for how these stocks will be allocated \n     and co-ordinated at the strategic level in New York.\n       In many cases, short-term proposals will suggest additional \n     measures that might logically follow in the medium and long \n     terms. For example, virtually all proposals for the medium \n     and long term imply an increased capability in the UN \n     Secretariat to cope with additional responsibilities. \n     Therefore, reform and enhancement of the UN Secretariat, a \n     necessary stand-alone requirement to enhance the UN's rapid \n     reaction capability, will also cumulatively establish the \n     necessary strategic apparatus to handle a series of \n     additional medium- and long-term improvements.\n       Any plan to operate a standing force presupposes \n     adjustments at the political, strategic and tactical levels, \n     which in many cases must be put in place on an incremental \n     basis, starting as soon as possible.\n       The study will arrive at recommendations and conclusions \n     regarding the desirability and feasibility of implementing a \n     variety of potential measures. It will also make observations \n     and recommendations as to their associated costs.\n       The study will be submitted to the membership of the UN at \n     the General Assembly in September 1995, and presented to the \n     Secretary-General for his consideration.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/18/senate-section/article/S10251-4", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10253-S10254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n NOTICE OF DETERMINATION BY THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS UNDER RULE \n             35, PARAGRAPH 4, REGARDING EDUCATIONAL TRAVEL\n\n Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, the Chicago Tribune carried a remarkable \nstory from Timbuktu, Mali by Liz Sly on what is happening in Africa. \nReally, it is two stories that are intertwined.\n  I wish it were possible to put into the Record the maps and color \nshadings to provide a more accurate picture of some of the things that \nare illustrated in this article.\n  But those who read the article will note that Africa is a place of \nhope and promise and despair.\n  The little-known story of the spread of democracy in Africa is the \nstory of progress that could be reversed easily.\n  Africa needs our helping hand.\n  I ask that the Liz Sly article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n                [From the Chicago Tribune, July 9, 1995]\n\n   Metamorphosis of a Continent--Democracy Seeks Hold Amid Poverty, \n                                Violence\n\n                              (By Liz Sly)\n\n       Timbuktu, Mali.--Not all of the news out of Africa is bad.\n       For the first time in its long history, this remote town on \n     the edge of the Sahara has a mayor elected by the people, \n     Harber Sabane, 51, who has high hopes that democracy will \n     help Timbuktu reclaim its status as one of the world's great \n     cities.\n       First, he acknowledged, there are a number of problems to \n     be ironed out.\n       ``We have problems of development,'' Sabane said. ``We \n     don't have roads. We have a problem of water. We don't have \n     infrastructure. Our ecological system is destroyed because of \n     a lot of droughts and we have a problem of deforestation.\n       ``Another problem is unemployment. We have no industry. We \n     are very, very, very poor. Most people are illiterate and 60 \n     percent of our children don't go to school.''\n       Unfortunately, Sabane could have been describing just about \n     anywhere in sub-Saharan Africa. Once synonymous with \n     everything that was exotic and alluring about the continent, \n     Timbuktu today is typical of everything that is wrong with \n     it--even down to the ethnic fighting last year that killed an \n     estimated 600 people and scared away the tourists, the town's \n     only source of outside income.\n       By 1990, it had long been clear that sub-Saharan Africa was \n     torn by crises. Poverty, conflict and underdevelopment were \n     compounded by corrupt dictators who enjoyed the backing of \n     rival superpowers concerned more with their own strategic \n     agendas than with human rights or economic progress.\n       This, however, was supposed to be Africa's ``democracy \n     decade'' in which the dictators, bereft of their Cold War \n     relevance, would be replaced by elected, accountable \n     governments heralding a new era of freedom and prosperity.\n       Halfway through the 1990s, those goals are elusive as ever \n     for most parts of the continent. Instead, Africa's democracy \n     decade risks becoming yet another decade of disappointment. \n     Millions of Africans are still waiting for life to improve \n     after more than three decades of freedom from colonialism.\n       A woeful array of collapsed states, hijacked elections and \n     ethnic conflicts litter the landscape south of the Sahara. \n     And even where democracy is taking root, Africa's hopes of a \n     brighter future are in danger of being buried under the \n     weight of its multiple problems, as Sabane is discovering in \n     Timbuktu.\n       ``The world around Africa is fast coming together and this \n     continent risks being the odd man out,'' warned U.S. National \n     Security Adviser Anthony Lake on a recent visit to the \n     continent, summing up the world's growing impatience with \n     Africa's failure to find its way in the post-Cold war world.\n       Chaotic Liberia, Somalia and Rwanda stand out as worst case \n     examples of that failure. The 1990s saw Cold War-inspired \n     conflicts in Ethiopia and Mozambique come to and end. But 2 \n     million Africans have died since the collapse of the Berlin \n     Wall as a result of new wars unleashed directly or indirectly \n     by pressures from the democratic reforms that were supposed \n     to bring them new hope--10 times the number who have died in \n     the war in Bosnia.\n       A recent report from the London-based International \n     Institute of Strategic Studies found some form of conflict in \n     26 of sub-Saharan Africa's 48 countries, offering a gloomy \n     assessment for the future. ``The potential for sudden \n     outbursts of violence exists in most [African] countries as \n     rising populations meet falling living standards and weak \n     governments confront regional or ethnic movements,'' it said.\n       But is Africa's outlook really that bleak? It is just 50 \n     years since the world ended a war that killed 60 million \n     people, and many Africans plead that it is unfair to write \n     off Africa now just because it is going through a period of \n     upheaval.\n       ``From the outside, the universal view is one of despair, \n     and it must be tempting to repudiate the whole continent,'' \n     said political scientist Mahmood Mamdani, director of the \n     Center for Basic Research in Uganda's capital, Jampala. ``But \n     when one lives here, one recognizes the extent of the \n     problems but also the small improvements that are taking \n     place.''\n       For better or worse, the 1990s already have proved \n     revolutionary for Africa. Until 1990, Africa had only three \n     governments that could be considered authentically \n     democratic. Since then, multiparty elections have been held \n     in 35 of sub-Saharan Africa's 48 nations.\n       From the sandswept streets of Timbuktu to the stately \n     monuments of Cape Town, South Africa, new leaders are \n     experimenting with new ways to address Africa's problems, and \n     new freedoms are flourishing in places that once knew only \n     repression and dictatorship.\n       Some have proved unexpected success stories, such as South \n     Africa, where the leadership of President Nelson Mandela and \n     the spirit of reconciliation that he represents shine like a \n     beacon of hope for the rest of the continent. Benin, Malawi, \n     Zambia and Namibia are among other countries that have \n     peacefully managed the transition to democracy.\n       Africa's seeming tendency toward violence should be seen in \n     the context of these seismic changes, argues Gen. Amadou \n     Toumani Toure. He helped bring democracy to Mali, \n\n[[Page S 10255]]\n     the modern state of which Timbuktu is a part, by overthrowing its hated \n     dictator in a military coup and then handing over power to an \n     elected civilian government.\n       ``Africa is in the throes of a radical transformation,'' \n     Toure said. ``After 30 years of military dictatorship or one-\n     party rule, we are moving to democracy. Sometimes that \n     process is violent, and it gives the impression Africa is in \n     crisis.\n       ``Rwanda, Somalia, Liberia, these are all struggles for \n     power in the new order. Some leaders are resisting change. \n     But take Senegal, Mali, Zambia, where people have chosen the \n     ballot over the bullet.\n       ``Africa does have a future. But each country in history \n     has gone through crisis in arriving at its future. America \n     had a revolution. Europe had many wars. Africa also is in the \n     process of finding its future.''\n       But where does Africa's future lie? With South Africa, \n     which also underwent violence before peacefully embracing \n     change? Or with Somalia and Liberia, which have disintegrated \n     into chaos?\n       The prognosis for most African countries seems to be \n     hovering precariously between these extremes. Just 17 of the \n     continent's 35 elections have heralded genuinely democratic \n     forms of government, according to a study by the Center for \n     Strategic and International Studies.\n       In countries such as Burkina Faso, Ghana and Kenya, \n     dictators were voted back into power in questionable \n     elections, and they continue to rule with little regard for \n     democratic principles. In others, such as Nigeria and Zaire, \n     corrupt regimes continue to resist change, making these \n     nations candidates for possible future upheaval.\n       Mali is typical of those new democracies that are genuinely \n     trying to improve the lives of their people. But they are \n     doing so against a backdrop of poverty, ethnic rivalry and \n     falling Western aid budgets, all of which threaten to \n     confound even the best-intentioned efforts.\n       Do-or-die economic reforms, ordered by the World Bank as a \n     prerequisite for continued international aid, have produced \n     economic growth in some countries that previously had known \n     only stagnation or decline. But the reforms are causing \n     considerable hardship among ordinary people, threatening \n     these fragile new systems with popular discontent.\n       Poverty is already a key dynamic fueling conflict in \n     Africa, something overlooked by Toure's interpretation of \n     Africa's crises as the inevitable byproduct of political \n     transformation.\n       In Mali, which the United Nations ranked the world's \n     seventh poorest country, 1992's peaceful democratic elections \n     coincided with an eruption of hostilities between Tuareg \n     nomads and local Malians in the desert region around \n     Timbuktu.\n       Although these two groups have fought one another in the \n     past, both sides blame the recent fighting not on ethnic \n     differences but on the country's desperate economic \n     situation. Along the fringes of the Sahara, poverty has been \n     deepened by harsh droughts in the 1970s and 1980s that turned \n     former arable land into desert.\n       ``It's poverty and bad economic conditions that cause this \n     antisocial behavior,'' said Timbuktu's Mayor Sabane of the \n     fighting, which has subsided.\n       ``The causes of the fighting are economic,'' agreed Mohamed \n     Ag Ahmed, a leader of one of the Tuareg factions, the \n     Movement and United Fronts of Azawad, which is demanding \n     development aid for Tuaregs in peace talks with the \n     government.\n       ``We could all live on the same land without conflict. But \n     the useful space has shrunk over time. The population of Mali \n     increases 3.5 percent a year, and now there is less land \n     available for an increasing number of people year after \n     year.''\n       The simple logic applies to many parts of the continent. \n     Falling living standards, environmental degradation and high \n     population growth rates risk pushing already impoverished \n     communities to the brink of their capacity to survive, and \n     into competition for scarce resources. It is perhaps no \n     accident that Africa's worst crises of the 1990s all have \n     occurred in nations ranked among the continent's poorest \n     half.\n       Yet there is no reason why Africa should be as poor as it \n     is. A recent International Monetary Fund survey notes that \n     Africa's ``overall low level of economic growth is anything \n     but foreordained.''\n       Sub-Saharan Africa's 540 million people account for 10 \n     percent of the world's population, living on about 15 percent \n     of the Earth. Their land is potentially some of the world's \n     richest, blessed with half the world's gold, most of its \n     diamonds, 40 percent of its platinum and rich reserves of \n     other minerals, oil and natural gas.\n       But Africans share only 1.3 percent of the world's actual \n     wealth, and a disproportionate burden of the world's \n     suffering. According to the CIA, two-thirds of those in the \n     world risking starvation this year live in Africa. Africa \n     contains 62 percent of the world's AIDS cases and one-third \n     of its refugees.\n       Africa's entire gross domestic product is smaller than that \n     of the Netherlands, with a population of just 15 million.\n       Also, Africa is the only part of the developing world where \n     living standards have fallen over the past decade. Despite \n     receiving nearly half the world's total annual aid--$20 \n     billion a year in the 1990s--the average African is no better \n     off today than he or she was at independence from colonialism \n     more than three decades ago.\n       What brought Africa to this sorry point in its history? \n     Colonialism undoubtedly played a part in setting independent \n     Africa off on the wrong foot, said professor George Ayittey, \n     a Ghanaian national and professor of economics at the \n     American University in Washington.\n       Independence also proved a hollow word for Africans, for no \n     sooner had they cast off their colonial rulers than Cold War \n     politics intervened to create a new form of foreign \n     interference. Western powers and the Soviet bloc poured \n     billions of dollars into propping up unsavory dictators--$100 \n     billion in the 1980s alone--long after it was apparent that \n     they had no popular support.\n       But increasingly, Africans are starting to realize that \n     their own leaders are to blame for their plight, Ayittey \n     said.\n       ``The basic reason why we're having all this chaos in \n     Africa is because we had bad leadership,'' Ayittey said. \n     ``The colonial state was very authoritarian but those who \n     took over made things worse.''\n       Uncounted billions of those aid dollars, which could have \n     gone toward building roads or educating children, were \n     squirreled away into Swiss bank accounts for Africa's leaders \n     or spent on weaponry to keep them in power, while ordinary \n     Africans grew steadily poorer.\n       With the lifting of outside support for Africa's dictators, \n     many of their nations have been exposed as hollow shams, as \n     personal piggy-banks for narrow elites who had failed to \n     unite their multiethnic populations behind them.\n       In finding its future, Africa therefore has not only to \n     battle harsh new economic realities, but also cope with the \n     burdensome legacy of its past mistakes.\n       And it can no longer count on the largesse of the outside \n     world to help it through. The West already has given notice \n     that African leaders who fail to heed the new rules of fair \n     play and accountability will have their aid suspended. Yet \n     even those who do can expect no democracy bonanza; in the \n     U.S., a Republican congress is threatening to slash overall \n     aid levels to Africa, and Europe is also cutting aid.\n       In Timbuktu, a city that lured countless European explorers \n     to their deaths in their quests for its wealth, Mayor Sabane \n     pleads with the world not to forsake Africa now.\n       ``In Africa, we are apprentices in democracy. We need \n     help,'' he said.\n       ``The current generation is very worried about our \n     situation and wants to lift us out of this malaise and \n     improve our lives. But we must have friendship so that Africa \n     can renew itself and find itself in the modern world.''\n       But could it be too late for a continent that, time and \n     again, has failed to seize opportunities? Will the legacy of \n     mistakes prove insurmountable? Are ordinary Africans, \n     betrayed so many times by past leaders, in the process of \n     being betrayed again?\n       Or is the continent merely witnessing the death throes of \n     the old order and the birth pangs of a new era, as most \n     Africans would like to believe?\n       ``There is a saying in Africa, `never lose hope,''' Sabane \n     said.\n       ``We don't lose hope.''\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/18/senate-section/article/S10254-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10255-S10256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY FEEDS FREE MARKET\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, Tom Roeser of the Chicago Sun-Times \nis someone I disagree with frequently, even though I respect him.\n  On the whole question of assistance for minority businesses, he had a \ncolumn in the Chicago Sun-Times recently that spoke candidly about \nsomething that provides real insight.\n  As we discuss affirmative action and what should be done to assist in \nproviding opportunities for minorities, I recommend required reading of \nthe Tom Roeser column, and I ask that it be printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  The column follows:\n               [From the Chicago Sun-Times, July 7, 1995]\n\n               Governmental Subsidy Feeds ``Free Market''\n\n                         (By Thomas F. Roeser)\n\n       Not long after I became an assistant secretary of commerce \n     under President Richard Nixon, I stumbled upon an amazing \n     discovery.\n       The big business community (mostly white-owned), which had \n     long extolled ``free'' enterprise since the founding of this \n     republic, was hooked far more than I realized on government \n     subsidies.\n       The Cato Institute has just cataloged 125 programs in the \n     federal budget designed to assist ``business''--meaning, of \n     course, mostly white-owned businesses. When I was sworn in, \n     in 1969, I counted roughly $13 billion worth of subsidies. \n     Cato's figure today is $53.7 billion.\n       The gist of Cato's recommendation is that these subsidies \n     be cut. Very well. But recall that it is mostly white-owned \n     industries that have thus profited since the founding of the \n     republic.\n       It was clear that I was picked as assistant secretary for \n     minority enterprise because, as a white conservative, I could \n     be fired by a mostly white administration without prompting a \n     racial furor. One recommendation I made lasted: Take a \n     percentage of federal contracts--I called them ``set-\n     asides''--\n\n[[Page S 10256]]\n     and give them to minority-owned businesses. I recommended a 10-year \n     program, after which it would be terminated. It has just now \n     been challenged by the Supreme Court 25 years later.\n       It was the second proposal, however, that got me fired: \n     Take a tiny percentage of the federal subsidies given to \n     white industry and apportion them to qualifying minority \n     enterprises. The strategy paper containing this \n     recommendation, when sent to the president, resulted in my \n     termination.\n       No problem. I went back to private industry, happier and \n     wiser than when I had left it. All my life I have been judged \n     a conservative. But I must tell you that whenever big \n     business pays tribute to its growth by mistily referring to \n     itself as ``private enterprise,'' I am impelled to raise the \n     window sash for fresh air. As a government official, I \n     learned too much.\n       Let's remember, when we wonder what happened to minority \n     enterprise, that white-owned business has leaned heavily on \n     government as on a crutch while its leaders pretend, in \n     speeches to chambers of commerce, that they do not.\n       This has meant that, for the most part excluding my set-\n     asides, only minority-owned businesses have been expected to \n     practice what white pro-business executives so eagerly \n     trumpet as ``free market capitalism.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/18/senate-section/article/S10255-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10256-S10257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              PUBLIC BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION VIOLENCE\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, today, I would like to draw my \ncolleagues' attention to two recent articles from Current magazine \nabout public television.\n  One story details the positive contributions of public television in \nthe important area of children's programming. Many have long argued \nthat in addition to its entertainment value, television can be used as \na powerful educational resource, particularly for children. Public \ntelevision has consistently set the standard for putting television to \nuse for this purpose.\n  ``Sesame Street,'' one of public television's most successful shows, \nis a favorite for many American children, and indeed for children \naround the world. Its goals, however, are much loftier than merely \nentertaining, or marketing to, children. ``Sesame Street'' works to \nteach children and prepare them for school. And it is succeeding. In \nfact, a 4-year study of more than 250 low-income households conducted \nby the Center for Research on the Influence of Television on Children \nat the University of Kansas concluded that preschoolers who watch \n``Sesame Street'' regularly score higher on school readiness tests as \nlong as 3 years later.\n  I am also pleased to report that the American people recognize the \nvalue of public television as a public resource. The second Current \narticle examines the high level of public support that public \nbroadcasting enjoys across the country. According to the article, a \nRoper poll taken in March revealed that Americans ranked public \ntelevision and radio among the services that provide the best value for \nthe tax dollars. In fact, over 50 percent of those polled rated public \ntelevision and radio as either excellent or good value.\n  In this age of television's appeal to the lowest common denominator, \npublic broadcasting generally succeeds in broadening, edifying, and \nchallenging its viewers, and influencing the television medium for the \ngood. Most importantly, public television reaches 99 percent of \nAmerican households--for free.\n  I ask that these two articles be printed in the Record.\n  The articles follow:\n                     [From Current, June 19, 1995]\n\n            Public Ranks Pubcasting High in Value Per Dollar\n\n       In a Roper Poll taken in March, Americans ranked public TV \n     and public radio among the services that provide the best \n     value for the tax dollar.\n       Only military defense of the country and the police had \n     higher percentages of the sample calling them an ``excellent \n     value'' or a ``good value.'' Highways, public schools, \n     environmental protection and the court system ranked lower.\n       ``Quite frankly, I was really surprised,'' said CPB \n     researcher Janice Jones. ``I know that people value public \n     television, but there are a lot of core services on that \n     list.''\n       CPB received the poll results as a regular subscriber to \n     the Roper Poll last month, but the survey firm had added \n     pubcasting to the annual question without CPB asking it to do \n     so, Jones said.\n       Other tax-supported services had been rated in the poll for \n     many years. The biggest changes between 1986 and 1995 showed \n     environmental protection up 14 points, public transportation \n     up 12, roads and bridges up 11, the police up 9 and military \n     defense up 8 points. Even social welfare programs rose 4 \n     points during that period.\n       In the poll, public TV was scored an ``excellent value'' by \n     13 percent, ``good'' by 44 percent, ``fair'' by 24 percent \n     and ``poor'' by just 10 percent. Eight percent said ``don't \n     know.''\n       Public radio got similar scores: ``excellent value,'' 10 \n     percent; ``good,'' 43 percent; ``fair,'' 28 percent; \n     ``poor,'' 10 percent, and ``don't know,'' 10 percent.\n       Public TV's ``excellent value'' rating (13 percent) was \n     exceeded only by military defense (17 percent) and the space \n     program (14 percent).\n       The percentage of respondents who rated public TV and radio \n     as a ``poor value'' for the tax dollar, 10 percent, was lower \n     than all other services except defense and international \n     intelligence gathering.\n                        value for the tax dollar\n\n       Here is a list of some different services that the \n     government provides using tax dollars it collects from the \n     public. Thinking of what you get for what you pay in taxes, \n     would you read down that list and for each one tell me \n     whether you feel you get excellent value for the dollar, or \n     good value, or only fair value for the dollar, or poor value \n     for the dollar?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                Percent \n                                                               excellent\n         Rank and services provided with tax dollars            or good \n                                                                 value  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.

Wright and Aletha C. Huston of the \n     Center for Research on the Influence of Television on \n     Children (CRITC) at the University of Kansas.\n       Wright and Huston's report, released May 31, was meant to \n     provide the first overall evaluation of Sesame Street since \n     the groundbreaking program's second season, in 1971.\n       The children studied were either two or four years old at \n     the beginning and five or seven at the study's end. About 40 \n     percent were African-American, 40 percent were European-\n     American, and 20 percent were Hispanic.\n       Key findings from the report:\n       As early as age two, preschoolers who watched Sesame Street \n     and other educational programming scored higher on \n     standardized tests of verbal and math abilities. The more \n     they watched the show, the better they did on the tests, even \n     two to three years later.\n       The younger the child was when viewing, the stronger Sesame \n     Street's positive influence on school readiness.\n       Children who watch Sesame Street spent more time reading \n     and pursuing other educational activities than non-viewers.\n       Children who regularly watched adult and children's non-\n     educational programming performed less well on school \n     readiness tests and spent less time reading or pursuing other \n     educational activities.\n       The findings held true even after researchers used \n     statistical controls to account for effects of income level, \n     parental education, English-speaking ability, and other \n     factors on the scores.\n       ``Television is a marvelous medium for education that is \n     vastly untapped. . . . The more you watch good programming, \n     the better you do when you get to school. That's news; that's \n     important,'' said Wright.\n       Although the study looked at all educational children's \n     programming--not just Sesame Street--the Children's \n     Television Workshop production so dominated preschoolers' \n     viewing it was analyzed separately in Wright and Huston's \n     report.\n       Because the period studied was 1989-93, newer programs like \n     Barney and Friends and Lamb Chop's Play-Along hadn't been \n     around long enough to make the most-viewed list, and PBS had \n     not yet initiated its PTV Ready to Learn service.\n       Wright and Huston's report reinforced the findings of a \n     less detailed study with a much larger sample size (10,000 \n     children) released in April.\n       The CPB--commissioned study, prepared by Westat Inc., found \n     that four-year-old preschoolers who watched one or more PBS \n     programs were more likely to be able to identify colors, \n     count to 20, recognize letters of the \n\n[[Page S 10257]]\n     alphabet, and tell connected stories when pretending to read.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/18/senate-section/article/S10256-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, JULY 19, 1995\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.
