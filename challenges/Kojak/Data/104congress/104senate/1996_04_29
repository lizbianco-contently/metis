Mr. President, first I would like to speak briefly on \nJapanese trade and the President's recent trip to Japan.\n  Mr. President, we must now declare President Clinton's trade policy \nwith Japan a spectacular failure, a fiasco.\n  The capstone of this almost unbelievable 3-year fiasco occurred \nrecently. The White House has an electronic home-page on the Internet, \nwhere Americans can go for the latest statement of administration \npolicy on any issue. Recently, Americans reading the official White \nHouse electronic home-page on the Internet would have found documents \ndescribing the United States-Japan trade policy. But it was a \ndescription that no one would have recognized. The documents described \nin glowing detail how all disputes between the two countries had been \nresolved, how there was no longer any need for any of the agreements \nthat had been reached between the United States and Japan, and how the \nUnited States should just drop its complaints against Japan.\n  Mr. President, a closer look revealed that these documents on the \nWhite House home-page had been written by the Japanese Foreign \nMinistry.\n  I understand the Japanese materials have now been deleted.\n  I guess that just about sums up the Clinton record on trade. This is \nthe point we have reached--the most powerful economic force in history, \nthe United States of America--after 3\\1/2\\ years of stewardship by Bill \nClinton and his advisers, and it is the Japanese who are writing the \ntrade policy papers for the Clinton White House.\n  Mr. President, this is a sad, and dangerous, state of affairs. Yet it \nis merely the logical conclusion of a trade policy that has emphasized \nappearance over reality, talk over substance, and politics over \nnational interest.\n  President Clinton returned a few days ago from a trip overseas that \nincluded a stop in Japan. Every American probably expected that this \ntrip would shed at least a little additional light on the question of \ntrade with Japan. After all, President Clinton and his advisers never \ntired of talking about their grand plan to deal with Japan. Last year, \nClinton took this country to the brink of a trade war with Japan. Most \npeople reasonably anticipated some progress, or at least discussion, of \nsome of our massive trade problems with Japan.\n  But that is not what happened. It now appears that Clinton did \nvirtually nothing to raise any of these serious problems. This trip \nmight have been the best opportunity in years for the American Chief \nExecutive to raise--at the highest level--issues that mean real jobs in \ntowns and communities across America. Issues that mean economic growth \nand a higher standard of living for Americans. Clinton's trip might \nhave been the best opportunity in years to fix a serious and \ndestabilizing problem--the massive trade deficit with Japan--and \nPresident Clinton squandered it.\n\n  Most Americans probably would simply find this hard to believe. Most \nAmericans are charitable, they want to believe the best about people, \nespecially their President. They do not want to think that he would so \nprofoundly misunderstand the opportunity\n\n[[Page S4270]]\n\nthat presented itself to help America and working people at home.\n  Yet, this is the hallmark of the Clinton trade policy. Actual \nsubstantive achievement means nothing--only appearances matter. For \nexample, how else was it possible for Clinton to declare victory in the \nauto dispute with Japan when all the evidence showed nothing less than \na full retreat and surrender to the Japanese?\n  In the auto dispute, President Clinton went to the brink of a trade \nwar with Japan, but came away with almost nothing to show for it. When \nthe so-called agreement was reached last July, high-level Japanese \nofficials immediately and publicly disavowed the import targets that \nPresident Clinton hailed as his great achievement. It turns out those \nnumbers were simply not part of the agreement. The agreement was just \nanother political publicity stunt, designed to convey the appearance of \ntoughness. Unfortunately, creating this appearance for Clinton and his \nadvisers cost the United States much credibility with Japan, not to \nmention with other countries looking for instruction on how to deal \nwith American demands on future trade issues.\n  The consequence of this massive retreat by the Clinton administration \nwas serious and damaging for American companies and American jobs. The \nJapanese quickly realized that they had been dealing with a paper \ntiger. Suddenly, on all other fronts, negotiations with Japan came to a \nhalt. U.S overtures even to begin a dialog on other issues were \nrebuffed. United States trade negotiators were told by their Japanese \ncounterparts to find some other agency to address their complaints. \nThis mocking of U.S. officials by a major trading partner is \nunprecedented--and prior to the Clinton years would have been \ninconceivable.\n  And so, Mr. President, it is easier to understand why serious trade \ndisputes with Japan were ignored by Clinton during his summit with Mr. \nHashimoto. Clinton brought back nothing on the dispute over Japanese \ndiscrimination against Kodak film. He brought back nothing on the \ndispute over access to Japan for American semiconductors, one of our \nmost competitive industries. Clinton brought back nothing on the \ndispute over access to the Japanese market for American insurance \ncompanies, another industry where the United States has a strong \ncompetitive advantage.\n\n  Mr. President, how can people put all of this in perspective? There \nis one simple way to express the damage to America of Clinton's botched \ntrade policy. I believe the American people would be astonished to know \nthat today, the United States trade deficit with Japan is higher than \nit was when Clinton took office. That is right, it is higher. The \nmerchandise trade deficit with Japan is now a staggering $60 billion--\nthis is $10 billion higher than when Clinton became President.\n  Furthermore, figures were released last week showing that the trade \ndeficit with Japan continues to climb, growing over $100 million from \nJanuary to February of this year.\n  Candidate Clinton talked a lot about trade deficits. He knew that \ntrade deficits siphon our wealth and our jobs, to other countries. The \ngiant trade deficit with Japan constitutes a massive transfer of wealth \nout of American communities into the hands of the Japanese. Under \nPresident Clinton, our trade deficit with Japan has gone up. Clinton \nhas presided over the highest trade deficits with Japan in history. In \nfact, another shocking achievement of the short Clinton era is that the \nU.S. trade deficit with the world also hit a record high. He has \nignored, or sought to divert attention from, these harmful acts. He has \ndone nothing to reverse it, change it or improve it. Oh, yes, he has \ndone plenty of talking, but he has done nothing to save the jobs that \ncontinue to be in danger.\n  I believe the American people deserve to know about President \nClinton's failed trade policy. The American people need to know about \nhis new policy of camouflaging the truth. I hope that he will abandon \nthis new policy that only seeks to hide his failures. Too many \nimportant decisions lie ahead for President Clinton to continue to \nsubstitute appearances for reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/29/senate-section/article/S4269-4", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JERRY ROBERTSON\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, as the American people know all too well, \nFederal judges can play an enormous role in our daily lives. Through \ntheir rulings, Federal judges help determine whether criminals walk the \nstreets or stay behind bars; whether racial quotas or merit govern in \nhiring decisions; whether businesses can function, prosper, and create \njobs without being subject to baseless litigation; and whether parents \ncan control the content of their children's education.\n  Today, Federal judges micromanage schools, hospitals, fire and police \ndepartments, even prisons. According to one estimate, a staggering \nthree-fourths of all State prisons and one-third of the 500 largest \njails are under some form of Federal court supervision.\n  One notorious example of judge-acting-as-legislator is Carl Muecke, \nappointed to the Federal bench by President Johnson. Judge Muecke has \nbecome the de facto administrator of the Arizona State Prison System.\n  In a textbook example of judicial activism run amok, Judge Muecke has \ndeclared that Arizona prison libraries must be open at least 50 hours \neach week, that the State of Arizona must grant each of its 22,000 \nprisoners the opportunity to make at least three 20-minute phone calls \nevery week to an attorney; that Arizona must provide lengthy legal \nresearch classes to inmates; and that Arizona prison officials must \ngive each indigent inmate 1 pen and 1 pencil, 10 sheets of typing \npaper, 1 legal pad, and 4 envelopes upon request.\n  Not surprisingly, Arizona's attorney general, Grant Woods, has \nchallenged the judge's misguided rulings, appealing all the way up to \nthe Supreme Court. Unbelievably, Attorney General Woods has found \nhimself at odds with a powerful adversary: the Clinton administration. \nIn a friend of the court brief filed with the Supreme Court, the \nClinton administration's top lawyer--Solicitor General Drew Days--sided \nnot with Attorney General Woods and the taxpayers of Arizona but with \nJudge Muecke and the State's litigious inmates.\n  Let's put this in perspective: while the Justice Department should be \nworking overtime to save the taxpayers money by reducing the number of \nfrivolous inmate lawsuits, the Clinton administration--through its \nlawyers--is actually contributing to the litigation explosion.\n  In other cases, the Solicitor General has shown that being tough on \ncrime is apparently not part of his justice department portfolio. In \nthe now-famous Knox case, the Solicitor General's office actually \nargued for a weakening of our Federal laws against child pornography. \nAnd in another case--United States versus Hamrick--the Solicitor \nGeneral's office decided not to seek a rehearing of a fourth circuit \nruling overturning the conviction of someone who mailed a defective \nletter bomb to a U.S. attorney. Since the letter bomb failed to \ndetonate--although it scorched the packaging in which it had been \nmailed--a fourth circuit panel\n\n[[Page S4271]]\n\nreasoned that the bomb could not be a dangerous weapon or a destructive \ndevice under the relevant Federal statute. Of course, had it detonated, \nI think probably they might have had a different indication.\n  The Solicitor General would normally intervene in such a case, \nparticularly since the recipient of the letter bomb was a U.S. \nattorney. Yet Solicitor General Drew Days declined to do so. As Prof. \nPaul Cassel of the University of Utah has explained:\n\n       The . . . decision [by the Solicitor General's office] is \n     truly hard to fathom. A ruling that otherwise dangerous bombs \n     with defective igniters are not ``dangerous weapons'' could \n     be expected to have serious effects on the Government's \n     ability to prosecute a number of serious criminals under the \n     relevant Federal statutes.\n\n  Fortunately, the Reagan-Bush judges on the entire fourth circuit \nstepped in, and on their own initiative, reversed the crazy panel \ndecision. And yes, President Clinton's appointment to the fourth \ncircuit, Judge Blaine Michael, joined a dissent insisting that the \nletter bomb was nonoperational.\n\n  In yet another case--United States versus Cheely--a panel of Carter-\nappointed judges on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the \nFederal death penalty statute. Despite the Clinton administration's \nprofessed support for the Federal death penalty, Solicitor General Days \ndeclined to appeal the ninth circuit panel decision.\n  Unfortunately, the Solicitor General's actions in the Knox, Hamrick, \nand Cheely cases appear to be part of a pattern. As Senator Hatch \nexplained last week, and I quote:\n\n       The Clinton administration's Solicitor General generally \n     has ceased the efforts of the Reagan and Bush administrations \n     to vigorously defend the death penalty and tough criminal \n     laws.\n\n  So, what is the lesson here? The lesson is this: Talk is cheap. The \nPresident may talk a good game on crime, but the real-life actions of \nClinton judges and Clinton lawyers often don't match the President's \ntough-on-crime rhetoric.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my leader's time. I yield \nthe floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/29/senate-section/article/S4270-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the real world, when one of us makes a \npromise, he is expected to keep it. Politicians are held in low repute \nprecisely because people do not expect them to keep their promises, and \nherein lies the heart of President Clinton's problem.\n  The people elected him President in 1992 because of his promises and \nnow find that he has repudiated them. President Clinton promised to \n``end welfare as we know it.'' He broke that promise. He failed to keep \nhis promise to give the middle class a tax cut. He failed to keep his \npromise to reduce the size of Government. He failed to keep his promise \nto balance the budget in 5 years.\n  The consequences of the President's broken promises are grave, not \njust because the country is still stuck with a broken welfare system, a \nTax Code that makes it hard for workers and their families to get by, \nand a rising national debt that threatens the future of our children \nand grandchildren but also because in failing to keep his promises the \nPresident undermines the public trust.\n  President Clinton, I fear, does not understand that when he breaks a \npromise, he contributes to the cynicism and anger of the public. The \nAmerican people are by nature neither cynical nor angry, but who can \nblame them for their distrust of politicians in Washington, DC, when \nthey are forever being disappointed by broken promises.\n  The people have demonstrated to us time and time again that they want \nwelfare reform, they want a balanced budget, and they want tax relief. \nMost people, unfortunately, are not aware that Congress has passed all \nthree, and President Clinton has vetoed every one. Welfare reform, \nindeed, he has vetoed twice.\n  I am reminded of T.S. Eliot's eloquent poem ``The Hollow Man.'' In it \nhe paints a dismal picture of politicians whose talk means nothing and \nactions meaningless:\n\n       Between the idea\n       And the reality\n       Between the motion\n       And the act\n       Falls the Shadow\n\n  There is, indeed, a shadow between the President's words and his \nactions. He can work wonders in front of a camera or before a live \naudience. When he is performing, he is good. But when the time comes to \nact to keep his commitments and make tough decisions, sadly, he comes \nup short.\n  Of course, the picture is not irredeemably bleak. There has been \nprogress. Two years ago, most Washington, DC, politicians were talking \nmore and bigger Government programs, not a balanced budget; midnight \nbasketball, not welfare reform, and tax hikes, not tax cuts. Today, the \npicture is different. This Congress has changed the debate. We have not \nwon on every point but progress, especially when one is dealing with \nsuch issues, is bound to be slow and a certain amount of time and \npatience required, but we are doing our level best to keep our \npromises.\n\n  So, we can ask that age old question: Is this glass half empty or is \nit half full? It is half empty if you want a balanced budget and do not \nhave it. It is half full if you recognize that Republicans in Congress \nhave accomplished what no Congress did for 30 years--we passed a \nbalanced budget. President Clinton vetoed it.\n  The glass is half empty if you expected tax cuts for families and \nsmall businesses. It is half full if you remember that Republicans \npassed a bill to give just such relief but the President vetoed it. The \nglass is half empty if you see an unreformed welfare system continuing \nto undercut the American ideal of family responsibility and hard work, \nbut it is half full if you credit a Congress that took seriously its \ncommitment and the President's to end welfare as we know it. But Bill \nClinton vetoed welfare reform--twice.\n  Republicans passed a balanced budget for the sake of our children and \ngrandchildren. Knowing that every American's personal share of the debt \nis $18,000, and that continued unrestricted growth in Government will \nadd so much more to our national debt that a child born today can \nexpect to pay $187,000 in interest on that debt in his or her lifetime, \nCongress acted. We made some tough choices and hard decisions to cut \nGovernment spending, and we came up with a plan for a balanced budget. \nPresident Clinton vetoed it. He says he favors a balanced budget, and \nhe uses all the fine words his political consultants advise him to use, \nbut the bottom line is President Bill Clinton vetoed the only balanced \nbudget Congress has passed in 30 years.\n  Republicans reformed Medicare to preserve and strengthen it for older \nAmericans and for those who expect it when they retire, but President \nClinton vetoed it. Just last week, his own Medicare trustees reported \nthat Medicare's hospital insurance fund is approaching bankruptcy even \nmore rapidly than we feared, but President Clinton will not budge.\n  Republicans also voted tax relief to American families and to those \nwho provide jobs and opportunity for all Americans. President Clinton \nvetoed this tax cut as well. With hundreds of thousands of working \nfamilies just barely making ends meet, with small businesses--the \ndriving force of the American economy--increasingly burdened by heavy \ntaxes and regulations, the President sent the message to taxpayers that \nthe Federal Government wants more and more of their hard-earned \ndollars.\n\n  Republicans twice passed welfare reforms to require able-bodied \npeople to work and to instill responsibility and dignity into the lives \nof those who are subjected to the destructive forces of the current \nsystem. President Clinton vetoed welfare reform bills not once but \ntwice.\n  It is unfortunate but true that Bill Clinton is the President of the \nstatus\n\n[[Page S4272]]\n\nquo. He is the President of big Government, high taxes, and an \nunreformed welfare system.\n  We all must admit, of course, that President Clinton has some of the \nattributes of a great leader. He does an outstanding job when he makes \na speech or brings the Nation together in times of tragedy. But there \nis much more to leadership than giving speeches, shaking hands, and \nacting well before the camera lens. Being a leader is not just \neloquence. Being a leader is acting on that eloquence and keeping your \nword even when it is tough to do so.\n  Do the American people trust the President's word? Do we in Congress, \neven some in the President's own party, trust the President's word when \nhe says something? When he makes a commitment, can we be sure that he \nmeans it now and will mean it in a week, a month, or a year?\n  One of my colleagues said recently, more in sorrow than anger, ``My \nproblem is I believe 90 percent of what he says and disagree with 90 \npercent of what he does.''\n  When we look at the glaring difference between what the President \nsays and what he does, our reaction can only be one of profound \ndisappointment. So many chances we have had to set America on a new \ncourse, to change the way the Government works, and so many chances \nlost because the President will not stick to his word.\n  The President of the United States holds a special elevated place in \nthe minds of the people. More than Congress, more than any other \ninstitution, the people look to the President for leadership. His words \nand his actions are of great importance, and have an immense impact.\n\n  The learned historian Donald Kagan, writing about the first great \ndemocratic leader who lived more than 2,000 years ago, Pericles of \nAthens, said:\n\n       Every leader who makes any impression at all acts as an \n     educator for good or ill, knowingly or not. His people pay \n     attention to his words and deeds as to few others, and he \n     contributes to their vision of the world, their nation, and \n     themselves and their relations among them.\n       The leader's vision may be confusing and chaotic, or it may \n     be . . . clear and orderly; it may encourage or discourage; \n     it may degrade or elevate the people.\n\n  How shall we assess the President's leadership by this standard? I am \nsaddened, I am disappointed to say it has been confusing and chaotic--\nto the American people, and to us in Congress. It has been discouraging \nas well. The President has lifted our hopes by promising he is for \nwelfare reform, tax relief, and a balanced budget, only to discourage \nus by going back on his word. Time and time again, the President has \nchanged his mind. Things have come to such a sad state that we are no \nlonger surprised when the President breaks a promise. We expect him to \nbe inconsistent more than we expect him to be reliable.\n  I hope the President will decide that keeping his promises is better \npolitics than repudiating them. If he does, we can work with him on a \nbalanced budget, tax relief, and welfare reform--all the changes the \nAmerican people want, changes, indeed, they have wanted for a long \ntime, and that will be of enormous help for the country.\n  I wish I could be optimistic in this hope, but based on his past \nrecord, I doubt President Clinton will sign a balanced budget, tax \nrelief measures, or welfare reform legislation. I doubt he will work \nwith Congress to reduce the size of the Federal Government or to get \nGovernment off the people's backs.

VIRGINIA N. FOSTER\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a woman, \nVirginia N. foster, who, through her 50 years of service to our Nation, \nhas helped to keep the United States safe and secure, and is someone \nwho is worthy of our thanks.\n  Many of you may already know Mrs. Foster from your dealings with the \nAir Force's Directorate of legislative Liaison, where she has worked \nfor the past 21 years. Through 12 Congresses, the 93d to the 104th, she \nhas dutifully and faithfully assisted Members and their staffs in \nresolving issues and questions concerning the Air Force. Due to her \nlong tenure, she has become more than a valued employee, she has become \nan important asset to the Air Force, providing her superiors and co-\nworkers with an encyclopedic knowledge of Air Force policy, and an \ninstitutional memory that is unmatched by anyone else working in \nLegislative Liaison Directorate.\n  What is perhaps most amazing about Mrs. Foster is not necessarily her \nimpressive abilities as an employee, but that her 23 years of working \nwith Congress does not comprise even half of her civil service career, \nwhich began in 1944 when she went to work at a German Prisoner of War \nCamp in Texas. In subsequent years, she has held many positions, though \nsince 1951, she has lived in the Washington, DC area where she has \nnever been too far from either the U.S. Congress or the headquarters of \nthe Air Force, both institutions which she has served with devotion and \nunflagging competence.\n  Mr. President, Mrs. Foster will mark her fifth decade of Government \nservice on May 1 of this year. On that day, the Air Force will present \nher with the ``Exceptional Civilian Service Award'' in recognition of \nher dedicated work and support, a recognition of which she is truly \ndeserving and in which she can take great pride. I know that those in \nthis Chamber who know Mrs. Foster will want to join me in expressing \nour gratitude for her assistance to us over the years, and in \ncongratulating her on celebrating 50 years of service to our Nation. We \nwish her great health and happiness in the years to come, and hope that \nshe continues to be an important part of life on Capitol Hill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/29/senate-section/article/S4272-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4272-S4276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TEXT OF EULOGY TO DR. I. BEVERLY LAKE, SR., BY DR. NORMAN ADRIAN \n                                WIGGINS\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, a couple of Sunday afternoons ago, several \nhundred of us gathered at the Baptist Church on the campus of what, \nuntil mid-20th century, was Wake Forest College, the marvelous \ninstitution that I attended and of which I shall always be proud. (Wake \nForest College moved to Winston-Salem in 1954 and is now one of the \nNation's prominent universities.)\n  The multitude came on April 14 to pay our last respects to a great \nAmerican, Dr. I. Beverly Lake, Sr., who had passed away a couple of \ndays earlier.\n  At the April 14 services for Dr. Lake, a eulogy was delivered by one \nof North Carolina's most prominent present-day citizens, Dr. Norman \nAdrian Wiggins, who, to all of us who know him, is simple Ed Wiggins, \nour friend.\n  Mr. President, as Ed Wiggins spoke that afternoon, I was both touched \nand inspired, yes, but I was also grateful for the blessings of having \nknown both Dr. Lake and Ed Wiggins and for having them as treasured \nfriends.\n  Dr. Norman Adrian Wiggins is president and professor of law at the \nrapidly growing Baptist institution in North Carolina, Campbell \nUniversity, of which years ago, I was honored to serve as trustee.\n  But, Mr. President, my purpose today is to enter into the \nCongressional Record the beautiful, caring eulogy to Dr. Lake delivered \nby Ed Wiggins on Sunday, April 14. I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the eulogy was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                   Eulogy to Dr. I. Beverly Lake, Sr.\n\n                     (By Dr. Norman Adrian Wiggins)\n\n       He is in His presence! He is in His presence! Dr. Isaac \n     Beverly Lake is in the presence of the Master he served \n     during life! All is well.\n\n[[Page S4273]]\n\n       This is the day the Lord hath made, let us rejoice and be \n     glad in it!\n       The apostle Paul said, ``I have fought the good fight. I \n     have finished my course, I have kept the faith'' (II Timothy \n     4:7).\n       This towering figure and one of North Carolina's most \n     outstanding sons whose life we honor today never made such a \n     claim. But we who have known him best can testify to the \n     appropriateness of this description. Few, if any, have fought \n     the fight, finished the course or kept the faith better than \n     the one we honor today. And today we come to celebrate his \n     victory and final graduation.\n       I count it a great honor to participate in this service of \n     my teacher, mentor, colleagues and longtime friend. What a \n     wonderful gathering of family and friends. It is a splendid \n     testimony to the life of one who could talk with crowds and \n     not lose his virtue and walk with kings and not lose the \n     common touch.\n       When asked by a mother what advice he could give her for \n     the rearing of her infant son, General Robert E. Lee, then \n     President of Washington and Lee, replied, ``Madam, teach him \n     to deny himself.''\n       So it was with the life of the one we remember today. Few \n     were ever so dedicated to the principle of self denial and \n     duty.\n       It accounts in part for his outstanding success as \n     practicing lawyer, brilliant legal scholar, both in the \n     classroom and on the Bench of the North Carolina Supreme \n     Court, outstanding Deputy (then Assistant) Attorney General \n     in a critical time in the life of our state and as a \n     dedicated Churchman.\n       If time permitted, we could study, with profit, the many \n     facets of Dr. Lake's career. But these have been recalled \n     frequently in the news media in recent days. They are well \n     known. I shall not repeat them. Instead, I want to speak \n     about what I have observed of this man of Impeccable \n     character and invincible integrity.\n       In addition to his devotion to duty and self denial, the \n     guiding light of the life of Dr. Issac Beverly Lake was his \n     belief in and devotion to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. \n     Whenever he spoke, he almost always used the occasion to \n     advance the Kingdom of God here on earth. Although \n     conservative in philosophy with a brilliant mind that could \n     cut through and define an issue with great clarity when \n     explaining ``truth,'' he would go back to that greatest \n     teacher in history who told his students, ``If you continue \n     in my word . . . ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall \n     make you free,'' and again he said, ``I am the way, the truth \n     and the life,''\n       And then Dr. Lake would lead us to see that truth is a \n     seamless web, woven together by God, that there are no \n     inconsistent truths or portions of truth. And then he would \n     strongly declare: ``Jesus's definition stands alone, \n     uncontradicted and complete--``I am the truth.'' This was his \n     north star!\n       In addition to his faith in God and his passion for truth, \n     Dr. Lake had an unshakeable faith in the importance of \n     Christian higher education. This personified his education at \n     ``Dear Ole Wake Forest'' where his father was a great teacher \n     of Physics and where he was surrounded by loving parents and \n     great Christian teachers. Always willing to acknowledge with \n     gratitude the education he received at two other great \n     universities, he reserved his greatest appreciation for that \n     school where students, without sacrificing the knowledge \n     of material things and values, were encouraged to learn \n     and appreciate the values of the spirit and character. It \n     was there where students were taught that as the poet \n     said, ``one must know, but to know is not enough. One must \n     will, but to will is not enough. One must act!'' (Goethe)\n       In William Ellery Channing's charge on the ordination of \n     the Reverend J. S. Dwight, he urged the young minister to \n     remember that: ``The fewer the voices on the side of truth, \n     the more distinct and strong must be your own.'' Dr. Lake \n     always had a distinct and a strong voice for truth, even when \n     others chose to remain silent.\n       Like John Ruskin, Dr. Lake believed that education was not \n     so much teaching the young to learn what they previously did \n     not know, but to teach them to behave in a way they did not \n     previously behave. In other words, academic achievement and \n     Christian commitment were expected to go hand in hand. And it \n     was the teaching of these principles that elevated him to the \n     class of the four or five greatest classroom teachers of his \n     day.\n       It was bad for physics but good for law when Dr. Lake \n     decided to study law. He said, ``I had no higher ambition \n     than to be a member of the Wake Forest Law School faculty. In \n     speaking of the great ``faculty of Gulley, Timberlake and \n     White,'' he could say ``I was grandson of Gulley and son of \n     Timberlake and White.'' The faculty proved that you could \n     have a great law school notwithstanding modest facilities \n     (one room) and a weak library.\n       In speaking of the Wake Forest College faculty he described \n     them as the finest collection of scholars, teachers and men \n     with whom he was ever associated.\n       In traditional Christian fashion, the family came next to \n     Dr. Lake's devotion to God. His first wife and the mother of \n     his son, Associate Justice Beverly Lake Junior, was Gertrude \n     Bell. Some years after her death, he married Kathleen \n     Robinson Mackie, the widow of Dr. George Mackie. Dr. Mackie \n     was and still is known as Wake Forest's most famous college \n     physician. Mrs. Lake was and Mrs. Kathleen Lake is a complete \n     homemaker. Beautiful in appearance, highly capable \n     intellectually, the lives of both ladies have been \n     characterized by a sense of calling and duty. Without their \n     inspiration, daily encouragement and wise counsel, Dr. Lake \n     could not have accomplished so much. It is a great credit to \n     both ladies and to his devoted and distinguished son, Beverly \n     Junior, who followed his father as Associate Justice of the \n     North Carolina Supreme Court, that they sensed Dr. Lake was \n     called to perform a special service and were willing to help \n     him render it.\n       As you know, Dr. Lake was tremendously proud of his son. \n     Early in Beverly Junior's life he and his father were in \n     Raleigh to view a political parade. Dr. Lake turned to \n     Beverly and said, ``I want you to promise me that you will \n     stay out of politics and I will promise you I will do the \n     same.''\n       Later on I questioned Dr. Lake about this advice and asked \n     him how he came to get involved in politics. He replied, ``I \n     guess I just drifted into it.'' Notwithstanding the humorous \n     reply, I realized that like the late Justice Arthur \n     Vanderbilt, he came to see that the holding of political \n     office and service to country is the lawyer's most noble \n     service.\n       Speaking of family, in characteristic humor, when \n     receiving the Medal of Honor from the National Society of \n     the Daughters of the American Revolution for leadership, \n     trustworthiness, service and patriotism, he stoutly \n     disclaimed his worthiness, but declared he would take it \n     so the ``grandchildren and great grandchildren might \n     possibly see that there were some good qualities about the \n     old man after all.'' This was typical of the good humor \n     and wit he exhibited all during his life.\n       Dr. Lake's entire life was characterized by his love for \n     God, family and country. He often spoke about how his mother \n     taught him ``to love and honor his country and to learn about \n     his country and its heritage.''\n       ``A person with no pride of heritage is a pathetic \n     individual,'' said Dr. Lake.\n       Time and time again, as he expressed concern about the \n     political direction of our country, he made it clear that \n     ``Whatever may have been true of Tsarist Russia, this country \n     (the USA) needs no new foundation.'' He wanted everyone to \n     know the noble purposes upon which the government was \n     founded. While we have yet to attain them (the founding \n     purposes) he strongly contended that ``no nation on earth, \n     past or present, ever got closer to them.''\n       Dr. Lake wanted the Supreme Court of the United States to \n     return to its original moorings--the Constitution. Twice Dr. \n     Lake sought the office of Governor without success. Of \n     course, he, the family, and all of us and especially ``his \n     boys'' who supported him were disappointed. Did it impair his \n     enthusiasm for his country? You be the judge.\n       Speaking at one ODK meeting held at Campbell some years \n     after the unsuccessful campaigns and with a Supreme Court \n     that was continuing to move from the foundation upon which \n     the country had been founded, it could have been ``pay back \n     time.'' He could have weakened the faith of the young people \n     in their country. What did he tell them?\n       ``So often I hear thoughtful people say `It's too late. We \n     have already lost our way. America has passed beyond the hope \n     of rescue.' ''\n       ``I do not believe that,'' said Dr. Lake with that strength \n     of conviction for which he was famous.\n       But then he went on to say, ``But if you are going to be a \n     leader and going to change things, you must be willing `to \n     speak to your contemporaries truths they do not perceive and \n     often do not want to hear.' ''\n       Dr. Lake's life was characterized by enthusiasm, happiness, \n     optimism, courage and deep faith in a risen Lord. One of the \n     Nation's finest classroom teachers, he demanded much of his \n     students. But love them he did. He called them ``my boys.'' \n     He visited with them when he met us on campus. When time \n     permitted, he loved to join the students for a round of golf \n     or a ball game. He and Mrs. Lake went far beyond the call of \n     duty to make the students and other guests ``feel at home'' \n     when they came calling on a visit.\n       If I had time to relate to you the stories that we remember \n     and something of the good times we had, you could better \n     appreciate why his students admired, respected, and yes, \n     loved their teacher. Until the very end, he constantly \n     dedicated his books, articles and lectures to ``my students'' \n     to whom I owe so much.\n       When God sent angels to bring Dr. Lake home last Thursday, \n     I suspect they said: ``Come ye, Beverly, blessed of our \n     father, enter thou into the joys of the Lord.''\n       It is hard to imagine anyone more deserving of such a \n     Divine invitation than Dr. I. Beverly Lake who spent his life \n     in service to the people of North Carolina and the Nation!\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as if in morning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much.\n\n[[Page S4274]]\n\n\n\n    REMOVE THE BARRICADES, REOPEN PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE TO THE PEOPLE\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I don't know how or why it developed, but \none trait most humans share is a deep interest in chronicling the \npassage of time. And so we attach a special significance to the \nobservance of anniversaries--those anniversaries marking celebration \nand achievement, and those marking solemn events of remembrance and \npassage.\n  On May 20, 3 weeks from today, we'll have an opportunity to observe \nboth. We'll be celebrating the 88th birthday of actor Jimmy Stewart, \nthe 64th anniversary of Amelia Earhart's solo flight across the \nAtlantic, the patenting of the fountain pen in 1830, and Levis' \nriveted-pocket blue jeans in 1873.\n  But on May 20, we'll also be observing a much more troubling event, \nbecause unless the Government takes action in the next 3 weeks to stop \nit, we'll be marking the 1-year anniversary of the closing of \nPennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House.\n  Mr. President, we have an opportunity--an obligation--to prevent this \nanniversary from ever happening.\n  The city has certainly grown up around it, but Pennsylvania Avenue \nhas changed surprisingly little since 1791, when George Washington gave \nhis approval to Pierre L'Enfant's innovative city plan. They envisioned \nthe avenue as a bold, ceremonial stretch of boulevard physically \nlinking the U.S. Capitol Building and the White House, and symbolically \nlinking the legislative and executive branches of government.\n  By the early 1800's, Pennsylvania Avenue had become a busy \nthoroughfare. The people of Washington went about their daily business \nin the shadow of the White House, which for much of the 19th century, \nwasn't set off from the street by as much as a fence. Believe it or \nnot, folks used to pull their carriages up to the front door of the \nPresident's house to ask for directions.\n  By 1995, carriages had been replaced by station wagons and tour \nbuses, and Pennsylvania Avenue--America's main street--had grown up. \nOver 80 feet wide, the modern, six-lane boulevard was being used by \nmore than 26,000 vehicles every day. Families on vacation would travel \ndown Pennsylvania Avenue past the White House on the same route their \nancestors might have taken, and it gave a lot of people goosebumps. \nWhen ordinary citizens could drive by the President's home or walk by \nhis front gate, well, that said something important to them about \nliving in a country where freedom is valued above all else.\n  As the home to every President since John Adams, the White House had \nbecome one of Pennsylvania Avenue's crown jewels, a primary destination \nof visitors to the Nation's Capital. The People's House was hosting \n1\\1/2\\ million tourists annually. Given its prominent location on \nPennsylvania Avenue and its proximity to the people, the White House \nwas a powerful symbol of freedom, openness, and an individual's access \nto their Government.\n  That is, until May 20 of last year, when the Treasury Department shut \ndown two blocks of Pennsylvania Avenue. For the first time in its 195-\nyear history, all traffic in front of the White House came to a halt.\n  The President ordered the avenue closed to vehicles in the wake of \nthe tragic Oklahoma City bombing a month earlier, citing possible \nsecurity risks from trucks carrying terrorist bombs. At the time, the \nPresident said the decision wouldn't change very much except the \ntraffic patterns in Washington--but it has. By barricading a symbol of \ndemocracy and access which dates back to nearly the birth of this \nNation, we've surrendered to fear. Without striking a single match in \nthe vicinity of Washington, the terrorists have won.\n  Have you been to the White House lately, Mr. President? You'll see \nwhat fear looks like. With all the guards, the guns, the cement \nbarriers, the police cruisers, Pennsylvania Avenue now looks like what \nsome are calling a war zone. Or a bunker. This is not the White House \nof leaders like John Adams and Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln, \nwho defined freedom's essence and took deep pride in being its \nstewards.\n  In fact, I don't know whose White House this is anymore. But I do \nknow that it no longer seems to belong to the people.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues had an opportunity to read the \neditorials on the subject of Pennsylvania Avenue published in the \nWashington Post over the last several months. The newspaper has focused \non fear, and what happens when that fear is allowed to take hold and \nfester until it dictates and clouds the decisions made every day here \nin Washington.\n  ``This is a concession to terrorism that should not be made \npermanent,'' wrote the Post last December. ``Two world wars did not \nclose Pennsylvania Avenue. Neither did the Civil War or past attempts \non Presidents' lives, as the White House itself has noted. The avenue \nstayed open despite a British invasion, and despite street riots in the \n1960's. But now, because of the devastation in Oklahoma City, the \nhistory of Pennsylvania Avenue may be erased by bulldozers.''\n  Mr. President, it would be a second tragedy if a capital city steeped \nin fear is among the lasting legacies of the Oklahoma City bombing. \nThat is not how we should honor the explosion's innocent victims.\n  In their rush to close Pennsylvania Avenue down, officials apparently \ngave little thought to the long-term consequences of their action. \nAfter all, Pennsylvania Avenue is far more than just a decorative patch \nof roadway, reserved for parades and official functions. It's a living, \nvital spoke of the city. For almost 200 years, Washington's workers and \nfamilies have lived along Pennsylvania Avenue, shopped along it, dined \nalong it, done their shopping at its corner markets, traveled on it to \nand from the office. The knee-jerk closing of such a major artery has \nhad a devastating cost for the District of Columbia and its businesses, \nits commuters, its tourists, its residents.\n  With the avenue closed for two blocks, and several surrounding \nstreets blocked off as well, the people who live, work, and visit here \nand give life to this city are feeling choked off from it.\n  Nearby businesses are no longer as accessible to employees and \nclients, now that daily traffic hassles tie up the downtown area. City \nofficials are worried that commercial development will eventually \nsuffer: with the city's east and west sides artificially separated, \npotential tenants may decide to skip the headaches of dealing with \nthe closed avenue and opt to locate outside Washington.\n\n  A great deal of parking space has been eliminated, too. Add up the \nlost parking revenue, the cost of changing street signs and signals, \nhigher Metrobus subsidies, and police overtime, and just 6 weeks into \nthe closing, the District estimated the cost of closing Pennsylvania \nAvenue had already reached nearly $750,000. I'm afraid the cost after \nan entire year will be staggering.\n  And that doesn't begin to take into account the other indirect costs \nof the closing. Tour bus operators can no longer drive their \ncustomers--many of whom are strapped for time, or unable to walk the \nextra three or four blocks--past the White House.\n  What about the public transportation system? In order to provide the \nsame services it offered before the Pennsylvania Avenue shutdown, \ntransit officials have estimated they'll need to spend up to $200,000 \nmore every year by adding new buses and drivers.\n  And the increased bus traffic on streets not meant to bear such a \nheavy load is threatening historic buildings like Decatur House on H \nStreet and St. John's Episcopal Church on Lafayette Square. Both have \nsurvived more than 175 years of political turbulence, but neither was \nbuilt to endure the rumbling they've been subjected to over the last 12 \nmonths. Buses now pass by at a rate of more than 1,000 trips a day--\nexperts are afraid the traffic will reduce the structures to rubble.\n  What's most troubling about all of this is the fact that the Federal \nGovernment carried out the closing of Pennsylvania Avenue without any \nconsultation with the District, without any direct public input from \nthe people their decision would most disrupt.\n  Mr. President, the people of this city who depend on open access to \nPennsylvania Avenue say they've accepted the present closure, but \nthey're not going along with the idea that the avenue must be blockaded \nforever. That\n\n[[Page S4275]]\n\ncase has simply not been made, they say. And I agree.\n  I was pleased to learn that the National Park Service recently \nscrapped what they called their interim beautification plan for the \n1,600-foot strip of the avenue between Lafayette Park and the White \nHouse. The plan involved replacing large sections of the asphalt with \ngrass, but architects called it off when they realized that something \nas drastic as digging up the asphalt would be too hard to change in the \nfuture, once a final plan of action is decided upon.\n  The Park Service is still going ahead with plans to bring in 115 \nconcrete barriers disguised as planters to ring the closed-off avenue. \nMost of these new roadblocks are almost 3 feet high; the largest is 7 \nby 13 feet and weighs 36 tons. ``It will really dress the area up,'' \nsaid a Park Service official. Mr. President, I don't believe Martha \nStewart herself could dress up a 36-ton, concrete traffic barricade.\n  And the cost of these new measures? About half a million dollars--a \ngreat deal of taxpayers' money, especially considering it's only \nsupposed to be temporary.\n  Last December, 14 top architects, planners, and sculptors met to \nbrainstorm about the future of Pennsylvania Avenue. They didn't \npublicly announce any final decisions--that won't happen until later \nthis year. But they are expected to release five proposals later this \nmonth on how to proceed. Most of the plans are said to center around \nthe idea of keeping the avenue closed and turning the area surrounding \nthe White House into some sort of President's park, something they say \ncould become a shrine of democracy. But a pretty name can't disguise a \nterrible idea.\n  Mr. President, Washington doesn't need another ceremonial park, \nespecially around the White House. Kings live in park enclaves, as they \nsay, while Presidents live along streets. Washington doesn't need \nanother shrine to democracy, either. This city itself is a shrine to \ndemocracy. I would suggest that returning Pennsylvania Avenue to the \nway it was before May 20, 1995, would be the greatest tribute to \ndemocracy we could offer.\n  We all need to stop, catch our breath, and put aside the fear. If we \ndon't, where will it stop? One year after Oklahoma City, the Government \nhas already increased its national security force by more than 800 \nguards, at a cost to the taxpayers of $32 million.\n  New security equipment is being installed in Federal buildings to the \ntune of $77 million, and another $174 million is slated to be spent on \nadditional security measures over the next 20 months.\n  Then what? There are 8,100 Federal buildings in the United States--do \nwe turn each and every one of them into a fortress? Already, the \ndrastic security measures undertaken on Pennsylvania Avenue have set a \nprecedent and have been mirrored on Capitol Hill. Access to streets on \nthe Senate side of the Capitol have been shut off and parking has been \neliminated or restricted in many places. Security at the Capitol itself \nhas been tightened dramatically.\n  How much of Washington, DC, are we going to have to rope off before \nthe public begins thinking we simply don't want them here? As tragic as \nit sounds, that's the message we're sending.\n  Mr. President, all Americans are deeply concerned about the safety of \ntheir President. The security measures used to protect him must be well \nreasoned, appropriate, and thorough. I don't question the desire to \nafford him every ounce of security available, but I do question whether \nwe can satisfy that desire without sacrificing the people's freedom.\n  The sad truth is that we can't protect the President--or any Federal \nworker, for that matter--by sealing them off from the world. A \ndetermined terrorist will not be stopped. But there will always be \nrisks in a free and open society.\n  I received a letter from a California man who wanted to share his \nthoughts as an occasional visitor to this city. ``I am in Washington \nabout 10 times a year,'' he wrote, ``and I feel an oppression there \nthat I feel in no other city, either in the United States or abroad. I \nreally feel the oppression around the White House.'' He wrote that any \nblack or white minivan parked in the vicinity will have a policeman in \nit. That's in addition to the policemen with dogs, and the vast number \non foot and in Secret Service cars in the area, all behind those ugly, \nconcrete barriers. ``Closing off Pennsylvania Avenue seems to be going \na bit overboard,'' he concluded.\n  In the year since the closure of Pennsylvania Avenue, the calls for \nits reopening have grown louder. There's a deep perception among many \nAmericans that the closing was an emotional reaction--a judgment \nrendered too quickly, and initiated out of fear. It's time for \nPresident Clinton to reconsider a decision made amidst such emotion, \nand replace it with one of reasoned courage.\n\n  And so I am sending today a letter to the President requesting the \nreopening of Pennsylvania Avenue no later than May 17, 1996. I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of my letter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, on behalf of the American people who aren't \nhere to stand up for themselves, I ask my colleagues to stand with me \nin taking back Pennsylvania Avenue from the fear to which it has been \nsurrendered. It's time to halt these efforts to close off the people's \nhouse, on America's main street, from the people themselves. We don't \nneed to wait for the reports and recommendations of another government \ncommission to know that this is wrong.\n  By ordering the immediate reopening of Pennsylvania Avenue, President \nClinton has the power to return the avenue to the people. He has the \npower to undo a costly mistake. He has the power to ensure that the \nclosure of Pennsylvania Avenue does not mark its first anniversary.\n  We must not allow fear to claim the victory. Dismantle the \nbarricades, Mr. President, and may the souls of the patriots who \nfounded this Nation in freedom's name take pity on us if we don't.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 1996.\n     Hon. Bill Clinton, \n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As you are no doubt aware, May 20, 1996 \n     will mark the passage of one year since the closing of \n     Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House. To eliminate \n     the need for observing this somber anniversary, I am writing \n     to respectfully request the reopening of Pennsylvania Avenue \n     by a date no later than May 17, 1996.\n       Within the history of Pennsylvania Avenue can be traced the \n     history of this great nation. In 1791, President George \n     Washington commissioned Pierre Charles L'Enfant to draft a \n     blueprint for America's new capital city. They envisioned \n     Pennsylvania Avenue as a ceremonial boulevard physically \n     linking the U.S. Capitol and the White House, and \n     symbolically linking the Legislative and Executive branches \n     of government. As an integral element of the District of \n     Columbia, Pennsylvania Avenue stood for 195 years as a vital, \n     working, unbroken roadway, elevating it into a place of \n     national importance as ``America's Main Street.''\n       As the home to every president since John Adams, the White \n     House has become one of Pennsylvania Avenue's ``crown \n     jewels'' and a primary destination of visitors to the \n     Nation's Capital; today, ``the People's House'' is host to \n     1.5 million tourists annually. Given its prominent location \n     on Pennsylvania Avenue and its proximity to the People, the \n     White House has become a powerful symbol of freedom, \n     openness, and an individual's access to their government.\n       And so you can imagine the disappointment of many when your \n     order of May 20, 1995 closed Pennsylvania Avenue to vehicular \n     traffic for two blocks in front of the White House. By \n     impeding access and imposing hardships upon tourists, \n     residents of the District, commuters, and local business \n     owners and their customers, the closure of Pennsylvania \n     Avenue has drastically altered L'Enfant's historic city plan, \n     replacing the openness of the area surrounding the White \n     House with barricades, additional security checkpoints, and \n     an atmosphere of fear and distrust.\n       The closure has come with not only an emotional cost, but a \n     financial cost as well--both to the taxpayers, who have been \n     asked to bear the burden of funding new security measures \n     along Pennsylvania Avenue near the White House, and for those \n     who are dependent upon access to the avenue for their \n     livelihood.\n       I acknowledge that the security of the President of the \n     United States is paramount and a matter not to be taken \n     lightly, but I ask you to recognize that the need to ensure \n     the president's safety must be balanced with the expectation \n     of freedom inherent in a democracy. I believe the present \n     situation is tilted far to heavily toward security at \n     freedom's expense.\n       In the year since the closure of Pennsylvania Avenue, the \n     calls for its reopening have grown louder. There is a deep \n     perception among many Americans that the closing was\n\n[[Page S4276]]\n\n     an emotional reaction--a decision rendered too quickly, \n     initiated out of fear fueled by the terrible disaster in \n     Oklahoma City. I ask you to reconsider a decision made amidst \n     such emotion, and replace it with one of reasoned courage.\n       By ordering the reopening of Pennsylvania Avenue by May 17, \n     1996, you have the power to undo a costly mistake, return the \n     avenue to the people, and guarantee that its closure will not \n     mark its first anniversary.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Rod Grams,\n                                                      U.S. Senate.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 100 years from now, I have no doubt \nthat when historians look back, the remarkable rise of China as a world \npower will be considered one of the most important international events \nin the latter half of the 20th century. Even more than the tragic war \nin Bosnia, more than the fragile attempts at peace in the Middle East, \nmore than the collapse of the Soviet Union, I believe that China's \nascendance as a great power and its impact as such--and the content and \nquality of the United States relationship with China--will shape the \ndirection of global history in the Pacific century.\n  In recent months, Sino-American relations have reached perhaps their \nlowest level since President Nixon's historic trip to China in 1972. \nOur relationship has been plagued by tensions in nearly every area in \nwhich we interact--trade, nuclear nonproliferation, concerns about \nTaiwan, Hong Kong, and Tibet to name just a few. But most often the \nSino-American relationship has been buffeted by clashing visions of \nhuman rights. And it is that which I wish to speak about today.\n  Last month, the State Department issued its annual report on human \nrights which contained a highly critical section on China. Having read \nthe report and the attendant media coverage that interpreted its \ncontents, I wish to address what I perceive to be a number of grave \nmisjudgments and, frankly, a double standard in American foreign policy \nwhen it comes to China.\n  Let me begin with some examples of that double standard. The \nliberation of Kuwait following the Persian Gulf war is viewed as a \ntriumph of freedom and a high point in recent American foreign policy. \nYet, how many Americans are aware of the fact that upon their return \nthe Kuwaitis expelled thousands of Palestinians and denied repatriation \nof thousands more who had fled during the war for their suspected--and \nI say suspected--support of Iraq. Before the war, there were over \n400,000 Palestinians in Kuwait. Now there are 33,000, according to the \nHuman Rights Watch/Middle East.\n  What happened to them, and who cares? At times, it seemed that there \nwas more attention in the American press given to the number of wives \nof certain members of the Kuwaiti royal family than of how many \nPalestinians were expelled in political reprisal.\n  There has been, however, some media coverage and American criticism \nof Russia's brutal suppression of Chechnya's move toward independence. \nThe Russian military decimated the city of Grozny with tremendous loss \nof life among civilians and the Chechnyan rebels alike. And the battle \ngoes on today. Conservative estimates are that 30,000 people have been \nkilled. Yet, our President just visited Russia, and our relations with \nRussia have never been better.\n  The cover story in the April 22 Washington Post puts America's blind \neye in perspective: ``Clinton, Yeltsin Gloss Over Chechen War.''\n\n       . . . [the two leaders] declared their admiration for each \n     other and brushed off criticism of Russia's war against \n     Chechen separatists.\n\n  Our relationship with the former Soviet Union is of such \nunquestionable importance that, muted criticism aside, American support \nof the Russian President has never really been in question. So how can \nChina's importance be any the less?\n  Recent tragic events in Liberia, where an unknown number of people \nhave been killed, is only the latest slaughter to emerge from that \ncontinent. Not long ago, the news media recounted the massacre of \nhundreds of thousands of Tutsi and Hutus in Rwanda, and the regime of \nGen. Sani Abacha in Nigeria continues to suppress political dissent \nwith lethal force. And yet, each of these countries enjoys the most-\nfavored-nation trading status with the United States.\n  Even some of our closest allies have deeply flawed human rights \nrecords.\n  In Egypt, a legitimate effort to crack down on Islamic extremists has \nat times crossed the line into abuse, such as extended detention \nwithout charge, torture, and even summary executions.\n  In Brazil police just 2 weeks ago killed 19 people who were \nprotesting the slow pace of land reform.\n  Turkey, a close NATO ally, has made considerable progress on human \nrights in recent years, but freedom of expression is still suppressed, \ntorture is still widespread, and there have been numerous documented \ncases of the excessive use of force against the Kurds in recent years, \nabout which we are all familiar.\n  I do not mean to suggest that human rights should not occupy an \nimportant place in our Nation's foreign policy. In each of the cases \ncited above we have, rightly, protested to the governments involved and \nworked with them to improve their human rights records.\n  The status of human rights in the countries I have just mentioned is \nor has been questionable, yet our relations with them do not fluctuate \nwildly based on human rights violations. We are able to recognize that \nthe United States also has other important interests that must be taken \ninto account, and we must constantly weigh these interests and values \nas we try to construct an effective foreign policy.\n  No one, for example, would suggest that we cut off relations with \nKuwait, Russia, Egypt, Brazil, or Turkey based solely upon their record \nof human rights abuses. The United States simply has too many security, \ndiplomatic, economic and other interest at stake to contemplate such a \ncourse of action.\n  And yet, that is exactly the case with what is probably our most \nimportant bilateral relationship in the world today.\n  Fundamental to the instability in the relationship between the United \nStates and China is the lack of any conceptual framework or long-term \nstrategy on the part of the United States for dealing with China. \nInstead, U.S. policy has been reactive and event-driven, responding to \nwhatever happens to be the current revelation--generally about human \nrights. Each time we lurch from crisis to crisis, we call into question \nour entire relationship with China.\n  A whole host of events has contributed to the current deterioration \nin Sino-American relations, but it is important to recognize the role \nplayed by the media in this process.\n  I recognize that the Chinese government does not treat the \ninternational press well. But virtually everything we read, hear or see \nin the American press about China is negative. Yes, there is much that \nhappens in China that is worthy of scrutiny and criticism, but there is \nalso much that is positive as well, and it is largely ignored. The real \ndanger in this is Americans know so little about China. They know only \nwhat they read and, particularly since Tiananmen, most of it is \nnegative.\n\n  The most blatant example of this unbalanced reportage of China was \nevident when the State Department released its human rights report last \nmonth. I read the newspapers. The coverage of the section on China was \n100 percent negative.\n  Then I read the report itself, and I am deeply troubled by what can \nonly be described as America's blind eye when it comes to China.\n  Let me read you some of the press coverage following the release of \nthe\n\n[[Page S4277]]\n\nState Department's Human Rights report.\n\n       China's economic reforms have failed to alter the \n     government's pattern of systematic disregard for basic human \n     rights, according to the State Department's annual report . . \n     .--Washington Post (3/6/96).\n       The State Department outlined Wednesday what it described \n     as a nightmarish human rights situation in China. . .--Dallas \n     Morning News (3/7/96).\n       The U.S. report released Wednesday found Chinese \n     authorities guilty of widespread and well-documented human \n     rights abuses--San Francisco Examiner (3/7/96)\n       China Dismal on Human Rights, U.S. Admits--Chicago Tribune \n     (3/7/96).\n\n  Reading these articles, one could only conclude that there have been \nvirtually no changes or improvements on human rights in China in \ndecades, save for a modest increase in the standard of living among \nsome.\n  But anyone who has any knowledge of China can see that in fact \ndramatic changes have taken place in that country over the course of \nthe last 20 years, and that those changes, by their very nature, have \nopened the door to major improvements in human rights.\n  Let me read you sections of the unbound version of the State \nDepartment's report supplied to the Foreign Relations Committee that \nwere not widely reported on:\n  On page 3 it notes that:\n\n       In many respects, Chinese society continued to open up: \n     greater disposable income, looser ideological controls, and \n     freer access to outside sources of information have led to \n     greater room for individual choice, more diversity in \n     cultural life, and increased media reporting.\n\n  On page 13 it says that:\n\n       Economic liberalization is creating diverse employment \n     opportunities and introducing market forces into the economy, \n     thus loosening governmental monitoring and regulation of \n     personal and family life, particularly in rural areas.\n\n  On page 9 it notes that, ``Chinese legal scholars and lawyers \nacknowledge the need for legal reform,'' and notes that development \ntoward a system of due process--the most fundamental guarantee for \nhuman rights is due process of law--a system of due process and other \nlegal reforms are under way.\n\n       For example, an experimental trial system tested in 1994 \n     has now been approved for use in Shanghai and for most civil \n     cases. The new system introduces an adversarial element into \n     trials by giving attorneys more responsibility for presenting \n     evidence and arguing facts.\n\n  On page 5 it says:\n\n       In December 1994, China enacted a new prison law designed, \n     in part, to improve treatment of detainees and respect for \n     their legal rights.\n\n  Farther down on the same page it says:\n\n       In February, the National People's Congress passed three \n     new laws designed to professionalize judges, prosecutors, and \n     policemen.\n\n  On page 2:\n\n       In October the Ministry of Justice promulgated implementing \n     regulations for 1994 legislation that allows citizens to sue \n     government agencies for malfeasance and to collect damages.\n\n  Where do we see any of this reported? We do not.\n  Page 3:\n\n       The Government has also drafted a lawyers law that would \n     clarify the nature of the attorney-client relationship, \n     improve professional standards, separate most lawyers from \n     state employment, and improve the ability of citizens to \n     defend their legal interests.\n\n  The report also cites some positive development in religious freedoms \nin China. On page 19, it says:\n\n       After forcefully suppressing all religious observances and \n     closing all seminaries during the 1966 to 1976 cultural \n     revolution, the government began in the late 1970's to \n     restore or replace damaged or confiscated churches, temples, \n     mosques and monasteries and allowed seminaries to reopen. \n     According to the government, there are now 68,000 religious \n     sites in China and 48 religious colleges. The government has \n     also adopted a policy of returning confiscated church \n     property.\n\n  Where is any of that reported?\n  On page 17, the report cites the growth and development of two \nspecific areas of a freer press:\n\n       Despite official admonitions, China's lively tabloid sector \n     continued to expand in 1995. Radio talk shows remained \n     popular and, while generally avoiding politically sensitive \n     subjects, they provided opportunities for citizens to air \n     grievances about public issues.\n\n  The report characterizes a nascent movement toward democracy in China \non page 24:\n\n       Direct election for basic level or village government is \n     legally sanctioned for all China's 1 million villages. \n     Foreign observers estimate that more than one-third of \n     China's 900 million rural residents--which is three times the \n     population of the United States--have already participated in \n     elections for local leaders. . . Successful village elections \n     have included campaigning, platforms and use of secret \n     ballots. . . There were credible reports that candidates most \n     favored by the authorities were defeated in some local, \n     village elections.\n\n  Where is this reported?\n  And although the Chinese Government, like any government, is \nreluctant to accept criticism of its human rights record, on page 25, \nthe report notes that:\n\n       Since 1991, the government has promoted limited academic \n     study and discussion of concepts of human rights. Research \n     institutes in Shanghai and Beijing, including the Chinese \n     Academy of Social Sciences, has organized symposia on human \n     rights, established human rights research centers, and \n     visited other countries to study human rights practices in \n     those nations.\n\n  Some may view these changes as modest and limited in scope, and \nperhaps they may be, but one has only to look back 30 years to the \nCultural Revolution to understand how enormous these changes truly are.\n  We must understand these changes in context: China is a nation which \nhas been ruled by man for 5,000 years, by emperors in the most despotic \nsystem, by the national government in the most despotic manner. \nChanging to the rule of law will not happen overnight or even in a \ndecade, but it is happening.\n  Thirty years ago--just 30 years ago--20 to 30 million people died \nduring the Cultural Revolution and Great Leap Forward. Millions lost \ntheir jobs, their families and were falsely imprisoned. The human \nrights and political situation in China has changed dramatically for \nthe better over the last 20 years.\n  When I first went to China in 1979, shortly after the end of the \nCultural Revolution, no one would talk freely. You could not have a \npolitical conversation. It was a totally centrally controlled \ngovernment. Now all of that has changed.\n  So change in a country as huge as this, as different as this, where \nthe urban eastern cities are very different from the isolated western \nareas, does not happen overnight, and sometimes it is even difficult to \nevaluate it on a year-to-year basis.\n  As I think recent history and this State Department report indicates, \nChina is changing and Americans need to recognize this. They need to \nknow it and they need to encourage China's continued modernization.\n  I should note for those in this body who consider themselves to be \nfriends of Taiwan, as I do also, that the Taiwan whose democracy we \ncelebrate in 1996 was not so very long ago considered to be one of the \nmost egregious violators of human rights, during which we kept all \ncontact with Taiwan.\n\n  Beginning on February 28, 1947, thousands of political dissidents \nwere killed and imprisoned by the nationalist government on Taiwan in a \nmatter of weeks--the infamous ``2-28 incident.''\n  In 1948, a state of emergency was declared allowing the President to \nrule by decree, and from 1950 to 1987, Taiwan was ruled by martial law. \nDuring this time, it is estimated that over 10,000 civilian cases were \ntried in military courts. Citizens were subjected to constant \nsurveillance, individual rights and freedoms were compromised, and \npolitical opposition was silenced.\n  To our credit, during this same period, the United States engaged \nTaiwan politically and economically, working to encourage the growth of \ndemocracy. Today, Taiwan is a democracy.\n  To be sure, China has a long way to go, but China is growing so \nrapidly--with a 10-percent annual growth in gross domestic product. \nToday, China, as an export power, is where Japan was in 1980, the 11th \nlargest exporter in the world, and it is growing much more rapidly than \nJapan was growing.\n  To this end, the report also contains a number of constructive \nsuggestions that I feel we should seek to develop as we encourage China \nto modernize. I believe we should work with the Chinese to develop \nnational legislation governing organ donations, so as to bring to an \nend any question about current policies, but work with them, engage \nwith them, discuss with them, counsel with them.\n  We should encourage the Chinese to let the International Committee of \nthe Red Cross monitor prisoners to assure\n\n[[Page S4278]]\n\nthat their rights, under these new Chinese laws just now going in \nplace, are not being abused. We should encourage the Chinese to allow \nthe establishment of truly independent Chinese nongovernmental \norganizations to monitor and discuss the human rights situation.\n  I also add to this list the development of a legal system that \nguarantees an independent judiciary, due process of law, and new civil \nand criminal codes. This will do more in protecting and advancing human \nrights than any other single thing the United States can do, and the \nChinese have asked for help in this regard.\n  In releasing the report, Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy \nand Human Rights, John Shattuck, stated at the press conference on \nMarch 6:\n\n       There is no question that economic integration enhances \n     human rights.\n\n  As Secretary Shattuck also stated, isolating China will not enhance \nhuman rights--just the opposite. The continued improvement in the \neconomic well-being of China's citizens is critical to the continued \ngrowth of human rights. And continued trade with the United States is \ncritical for the continued development of China's economy.\n  I do not mean to suggest that the free market by itself will improve \nhuman rights records. Assistant Secretary Shattuck once again was so \nright when he said--and I quote--\n\n       Economic growth is not in and of itself the ultimate \n     sufficient condition for the full flowering of human rights.\n\n  We must also pursue other forms of engagement with China.\n  So it is in this context that I urge my colleagues to read in full \nthe State Department's human rights report on China, but to do so not \nwith a jaundiced eye and a focus only on those areas that still require \nimprovement, but with a sense of appreciation for how far in 20 short \nyears China has come, and with continued United States engagement, how \nmuch farther China can go in the next 20 years.\n  That is our challenge today. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, under the previous order I am to be \nrecognized during morning business for a period of 90 minutes.

Mr. President, over the last several months we have \nheard a growing crescendo, so to speak, about a new national epidemic. \nAnd make no mistake about it, Mr. President, the United States is once \nagain revisiting a drug epidemic.\n  This epidemic took hold of our Nation in the 1960's and 1970's. By \n1979, Mr. President, somewhere in the neighborhood of 55 percent of our \nyouth--importantly here--age 17 to 21, were involved in drugs, an \nalarming crisis for the Nation. From 1979 to 1992, this usage was cut \nin half.\n  For all the naysayers that said you could not do anything about \ndrugs--wrong. This Nation did. It cut drug use in half. It took it down \nto 24, 26, 27 percent. But in 1992, as I am sure will be alluded to \nhere repeatedly on the floor, something went wrong, something changed. \nPolicies changed, and drug use took off like a rocket. It is now \napproaching the 40 percent level.\n  Over the weekend there was a lot of discussion about drug abuse \nbecause the President had a much heralded press conference in Miami \nthis morning. But, Mr. President, this is one we cannot win with press \nconferences. This is one that will be exceedingly difficult to turn \ninto some political gambit for the 1996 Presidential campaign.\n  Somebody will have to be responsible for what happened between 1992 \nand 1996. And what happened is a very ugly picture.\n  Over the various talk shows this quote surfaced. ``This President is \nsilent on the matter. He has failed to speak.'' That was Senator Joseph \nBiden, Jr., of Delaware. Or we have Mr. Rangel, Congressman Rangel, who \nhas previously said, he has never seen a President care less about \ndrugs. That is Congressman Rangel. These are Members of the President's \nown leadership, party.\n  The point is, that there are ramifications for the policies we have \nset, Mr. President. In his first 3 years in office, President Clinton \nabandoned the war on drugs. He slashed the staff of his drug office 83 \npercent, he decreased the number of Drug Enforcement Agency agents, cut \nfunding for drug interdiction efforts and abandoned the bully pulpit. I \nwill mention this again. But out of 1,680 statements by the President, \nthe word ``drugs'' was only used 13 times in the first 3 years. We \nturned away from the message that drugs are very harmful.\n\n  You know, Mr. President, President Reagan and President Bush deserve \na lot of credit. They engaged this war as the Nation would expect them \nto, and indeed they contributed to saving millions of lives and harm to \nmillions of families all across the land because they engaged the \nbattle.\n  Yes, she was made fun of at the time, but Nancy Reagan, our First \nLady, when she said, ``Just say no,'' it made a difference. Who knows \nthe number of families that were spared the devastation of drugs just \nbecause she led the way. She is going to be remembered very favorably \nfor the role she played in our drug dispute.\n  I see, Mr. President, I have been joined by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Michigan, who has been a leading advocate in the drug war. I now \nyield up to 10 minutes of my time.\n  Is that enough, I ask the Senator?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. That would be fine.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield 10 minutes of my time to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I first thank the Senator from Georgia for having come here today to \nhelp lead this discussion. I think the role he is playing in trying to \nfocus public attention on problems in the area of crime and drugs is to \nbe commended. We are grateful to have leadership like that on these \nissues because we have not had enough of it, either in the Congress or \nparticularly in the administration.\n  So today I will talk a little bit more specifically about some of the \nproblems we are contending with as a society as they relate to the \nbroadly defined topic of drug use in America.\n  After steadily declining for a number of years, through the \nadministrations of Presidents Reagan and Bush, drug use has been \nskyrocketing in recent years. It is increasing at a very alarming rate. \nAccording to the 1994 ``Monitor of the Future'' study, drug use in \nthree separate categories--use over lifetime, use in past year, use in \npast month--has shown a remarkable surge during the last 2 years, for \nyoung people in particular.\n  Lifetime drug use went from a high in 1981 of about 65 percent to a \nlow of just over 30 percent in 1992. Recently, though, the trend has \nbeen in a different direction. In both 1993, and again in 1994, after \nover a decade of uneven, but steady, decline, drug use has shot up \nagain. It has shot up not just among high school seniors either, Mr. \nPresident.\n  According to the 1995 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, drug \nuse among children from as young as the age of 12 through 17 years of \nage, went up by 28 percent from 1993 to 1994. That is not just \npercentages we are talking about. It is human lives, Mr. President.\n  To make it a little more specific, and to really, I think, dramatize \nthe alarming changes we are talking about, these statistics indicate \nthat in 1994, 1 million more children between the ages of 12 and 17 \nwere using drugs than had been the case in 1993.\n  Mr. President, I would like to state very clearly that the decisions \npeople make to abuse drugs or any other similarly abused substance of \nany type is an individual decision. This is not a partisan decision. \nThis is a not a decision that can be blamed on any one individual in \nWashington.\n\n  I think what is critical and what we need to assess is the response \nthat we, as Government leaders, are making to this alarming increase. I \nthink that is where we have to take focus here\n\n[[Page S4279]]\n\ntoday. I think we should specifically look at what this administration \nhas done, because I think in examining it we will get a feel for the \ndifferent types of priorities that can be established and give the \nAmerican people a chance to decide which priorities they prefer.\n  In terms of the Clinton administration, the first thing that we \nshould note is the dramatic drop in drug prosecutions, both in 1993 and \nagain in 1994. Despite the country's increasing drug problem in those \nyears, Federal drug prosecutions fell from a high of over 25,000 \nprosecutions in 1992 to fewer than 22,000 in 1994. It just 2 years, \nFederal drug prosecutions dropped 12 percent. In addition, this \nadministration made the decision to dramatically reduce the budget of \nthe drug czar's office. The war on drugs conducted through the drug \nczar's office, has been cut by approximately 83 percent.\n  Mr. President, reducing the number of prosecutions and reducing the \nsize of the budget of the drug czar's office, in my mind, at least, is \nthe wrong set of priorities to deal with an increasing rate of drug \nabuse, particularly when much of the increase can be found among young \npeople.\n  Third, I think the administration has changed priorities in terms of \nthe message it is sending, particularly the message young people are \nhearing. The Senator from Georgia has already identified, and I think \naccurately, and very positively talked about the impact of the ``just \nsay no'' program. Mr. President, for the better part of a decade, the \nwords ``just say no'' meant the same thing pretty much to everybody in \nAmerica, and especially young people. It meant ``say no to drugs.'' \nWith a theme like that resonating whether through the airwaves or in \nspeeches of the public officials and the leadership of the First Lady, \nNancy Reagan, young people heard clearly one continuous message. I \nthink that that pervasive message helped to change the direction of \ndrug use in this country. I think that message has been blurred a lot \nin recent years.\n  Indeed, unfortunately, I think mixed signals have been sent \ninadvertently that have at least suggested a certain condoning of the \nuse of drugs. I do not think that those are the kind of signals we want \nto send. For example, I note the Department of Health and Human \nServices has sponsored commercials on MTV proclaiming, ``If you use \ndrugs, don't share a needle.''\n  Now, I realize that ``just say no'' may have sounded hackneyed to \nsome, but it works and it is true. In my judgment, sending any kind of \nsignal to our children that suggests that any form of drug use is \npreferable to other forms, rather than as a society we are opposed to \nall drug use, will confuse, and I think contribute to their reluctance \nto follow the message to avoid the use of drugs altogether.\n  In addition, I think we have sent a mixed message in terms of what \nthe leading messengers of the administration have been saying about \ndrugs. As we know, Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders talked at length \nabout even going so far as to legalize drug use in this country. It \njust seems to me, Mr. President, if young people reach the conclusion \nthat an administration or Washington or public officials think that \ndrug legalization is an acceptable alternative, their willingness to \nbegin experimenting or to use drugs will increase. Indeed, Mr. \nPresident, those seem to have been the results.\n  Again, according to the former ``drug czar'' in my State of Michigan, \njust a few weeks ago, the Centers for Disease Control jointly sponsored \na conference in Atlanta with one of the country's leading pro-drug \nlegalization organizations, the Drug Policy Foundation. The conference \nagenda was to promote needle exchanges and healthy drug use messages.\n  These kinds of mixed messages, combined with a drop in prosecutions \nand a reduction in spending on the drug czar's office, I think, Mr. \nPresident, demonstrate the wrong priorities. I think we should have a \nhealthy debate this year over this country's priorities. I happen to \nthink that the investment of funds in the drug czar's office, the \nincreased prosecution of drug offenders, and the sending of one clear \nunmistakable message that we should say no to drugs is the only way to \nseriously and effectively deal with the drug abuse problems we face in \nthis country, and particularly with youthful drug offenders. I think to \ndivert resources from that approach is to invite increases in drug use.\n  I think the American people should understand that there are two very \ndifferent courses, a course that was followed with great success for \nover a decade, and a new course that has blurred the message, invested \nfewer dollars and generated fewer prosecutions. That clear choice, I \nthink, is one that we in Congress now should effectively try to \naddress. I will be working hard to do that in my State, to try to make \nsure at least in Michigan we send an unequivocal message to just say no \nto drugs and I will do my best here to support efforts to beef up the \nforces that will crack down on drug abuse, those in both prosecutorial \nranks and providing the drug czar's office and others with the adequate \nresources they need to combat this on the front lines.\n  Last year, Mr. President, I was involved in sponsoring a bill which \nultimately became law and was signed into law to try to make sure we \ndid not liberalize the sentences that crack cocaine dealers would \nreceive. We have to remain vigilant and tough. I think the sentences \nfor those who use powder cocaine should be tougher as well. We have to \nmake clear that young people in this country, and really to all \nAmericans, that the war on drugs has not been won. Progress that was \nmade in the 1980's can be reversed if we are not vigilant.\n  I intend to come to the floor often, joining my colleague from \nGeorgia and others, to make sure those are the messages we send. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from \nMichigan. As I said, he has been a stalwart on this kind of work, on \ncrime in general, and the United States and his State are all \nbenefactors of his good work. I appreciate his coming to the floor.\n  Just to mention again or reinforce a comment I made, when I began in \n1993 and 1994, President Clinton made seven addresses to the Nation. \nNone mentioned illegal drugs--none. The President's official 1993 \nPresidential papers reveal 13 references to illegal drugs as a total, \nin a total of 1,628 Presidential statements, addresses, and interviews.\n  Of course, no wonder, Mr. President, if the bully pulpit is not used \nin whatever form it is chosen, I do not think you have to replicate \nwhat First Lady Reagan said, but you do have to use that pulpit. It got \nturned off.\n  Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to my colleague from Arizona, \nalso a Senator who has come here with enthusiasm and energy on the \ntopic of making American citizens safer. I yield to the Senator from \nArizona.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator from Georgia for his work on this issue \nand for yielding the time to me relative to the comments that he just \nmade.\n  I note as recently as yesterday on the ``Meet the Press'' television \nprogram, Senator Joseph Biden said: ``The President is silent on the \nmatter. He has failed to speak.'' Of course, we are talking about the \nmatter of drug abuse and, more broadly, the war on drugs.\n  Actually, I am very heartened that the President has rediscovered his \nenthusiasm to fight this war on drugs. When he campaigned for the \nPresidency in 1992, candidate Bill Clinton said, ``President Bush \nhasn't fought a real war on crime and drugs. I will.'' During the first \n3 years in office, the President virtually ignored the drug problem. \nThe moving trucks had barely arrived from Little Rock when the \nPresident slashed the office, the so-called drug czar's office, by 80 \npercent. The drug problem received little attention thereafter from his \nadministration.\n  Whatever the motivation, some might say election year politics, I \nassume it is an obvious realization that the policy has not worked and \nhas had a disastrous effect. The President has now reversed course and \nis exercising very needed leadership in our efforts to combat drugs.\n  During his State of the Union Address, the President announced the \nappointment of General McCaffrey as the next drug czar, a welcome \nappointment, because General McCaffrey has a very fine reputation, and, \nof course, the energy and enthusiasm to deal with this problem.\n\n\n                clinton's abdication on the war on drugs\n\n                       a. slashing ondcp's budget\n\n  As mentioned before, one of the first official acts by President \nClinton was\n\n[[Page S4280]]\n\nto slash the drug czar's staff by more than 80 percent. The number of \nworkers fell from 146 to just 25--half of the size of the White's \nHouse's communication staff. The President also cut the budget from \n$185.8 to $5.8 million--a 90-percent cut.\n  After drastically reducing the size of the drug czar's office, the \nPresident took nearly a year to select a drug czar, finally settling on \nLee Brown.\n  Lee Brown was not an effective drug czar. Instead of focusing efforts \non getting cocaine and other drugs off of our streets, Mr. Brown \nlaunched an effort to have ``Big League Chew'' bubble-gum removed from \nconvenience store chains. The drug czar's office was concerned that the \npackaging resembled some chewing tobacco products, although its Deputy \nDirector admitted that the agency didn't have any hard data to show \nlook-alikes lead to use of the real thing.\n\n\n     b. appointing a surgeon general who proposed legalizing drugs\n\n  Lee Brown was not the only Clinton administration official to set \nback efforts to combat drug use. While serving as the Nation's top \nhealth official, Jocelyn Elders commented that, ``[I] do feel that we \nwould markedly reduce our crime rate if drugs were legalized.''\n\n\n              c. dramatically reduced interdiction efforts\n\n  Under President Clinton, interdiction has been dramatically scaled \nback.\n  Keeping drugs out of the country was an important and successful \nelement of the Reagan-Bush drug war. Successful interdiction leads to \nless drugs reaching our streets, and poisoning our children. \nInterdiction raises the price of drugs, and lowers their purity, which \ntranslates into less people using drugs, and those who do, ingesting \ndrugs of lower potency. As a candidate for the Presidency, Clinton \nrecognized the importance of interdiction:\n\n       [W]e need an effective, coordinated drug interdiction \n     program that stops the endless flow of drugs entering our \n     schools, our streets, and our communities. A Clinton-Gore \n     Administration will provide cities and states with the help \n     they need.\n\n  The President's fiscal year 1996 request represented a 37-percent cut \nfrom 1991 interdiction funding levels. And in Clinton's first year in \noffice, the National Security Council downgraded the drug war from one \nof three top priorities to number 29 on a list of 29.\n  Between 1993 and the first half of 1995, the transit zone disruption \nrate--which measures the ability of the United States to seize or turn \nback drug shipments--dropped 53 percent. The President has cut the \ninterdiction budgets of the U.S. Customs Service, the Department of \nDefense, and the Coast Guard. Not surprisingly, these agencies are \nshowing a downturn in statistical measures of interdiction.\n  The administration's cuts to the Customs Service interdiction budget \ncoincided with a 70-percent decline in Customs-supported cocaine \nseizure in the transit zone.\n  Between fiscal years 1992 and 1995, the Defense interdiction budgets \nwere reduced by more than half.\n  The Coast Guard operating budget for drug missions fell from $449.2 \nmillion in fiscal year 1991 to a projected $314.2 million in fiscal \nyear 1996. Cutter and aircraft resource hours for drug missions are \nprojected to fall 23 and 34 percent, over the same period.\n\n\n                 d. reduced emphasis on law enforcement\n\n  The President has also reduced the emphasis on law enforcement.\n  If the President's fiscal year 1995 budget proposal had been passed, \nthe DEA, FBI, INS, U.S. Customs Service, and the U.S. Coast Guard would \nhave lost a total of 621 drug enforcement agents.\n  While Congress reversed many of the Clinton cuts, the DEA has lost \nover 200 agents during the President's tenure. No DEA special agents \nwere trained in 1993, nor were any budgeted to be trained in either \n1994, or 1995.\n  Although drug use is going up, the number of individuals prosecuted \nfor Federal drug violations is going down. Between 1992 and 1994 drug \nprosecutions dropped 12 percent.\n\n\n                       e. abandoned bully pulpit\n\n  President Clinton has failed to use the bully pulpit.\n  Criticism of the President's lack of leadership on the drug issue is \nbipartisan. Representative Charles Rangel, a Democrat from New York, \nsaid: ``I've been in Congress for over two decades, and I have never, \nnever, never seen a President who cares less about this issue.''\n  And yesterday on ``Meet the Press,'' Senator Biden said: ``This \nPresident is silent on the matter. He has failed to speak.''\n\n\n                         f. treatment strategy\n\n  The de facto strategy of the Clinton administration in fighting drugs \nwas to deemphasize interdiction, law enforcement, and prevention, and \nconcentrate on treatment.\n  But even though Federal treatment spending was 230 percent greater in \n1995 than in 1989, the number of persons served in treatment decreased \n144,000.\n  The President has continued to pursue his treatment strategy, even \nthough reducing hard-core drug use through treatment is generally \nfutile. A 1994 study by the Rand Corp. prepared for the drug czar's \noffice studied the effects of treatment of hard-core cocaine users. The \nstudy found that 27 percent of hard-core drug users continued hard core \nuse while undergoing treatment. And 88 percent of hard-core users \nreturned to hard-core use immediately after treatment.\n\n\n               results of president's lack of leadership\n\n                           a. drug use is up\n\n  As a measure of President Clinton's lack of leadership, drug use is \nup.\n  The Clinton administration's abdication of the war on drugs has \nalready had a devastating effect on all Americans--especially our \nNation's children.\n  Last year, the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research \nfound that, after a decade of steady decline, drug use by students in \ngrades 8, 10, and 12 rose in 1993.\n  More bad news: In September 1995, the Department of HHS released the \nNational Household Survey on Drug Abuse, which showed that marijuana \nuse had increased by an average of 50 percent among young people.\n  One in three high school seniors now smokes marijuana. We are \napproaching the point where a student is just as likely to drink a soft \ndrink than use an illicit substance\n  The increase in marijuana use among young people is frightening, not \nonly because so many of our young people are using this dangerous \nnarcotic, but also because, according to surveys by the Center on \nAddiction and Substance Abuse, 12- to 17-year-olds who use marijuana \nare 85 times more likely to graduate to cocaine than those who do not \nuse marijuana.\n  Hard-core drug use is also up.\n  The treatment strategy is failing. Far from decreasing the number of \nhard-core uses as Clinton predicted, the number is increasing.\n  The Drug Abuse Warning Network [DAWN], which monitors the number and \npattern of drug-related emergencies and deaths in 21 major metropolitan \nareas across the country is used as a bellwether of hard-core use \nbecause so many emergency room cases involve hard-core addicts. The \nmost recent DAWN results: Cocaine-related episodes hit their highest \nlevel in history in 1995. Marijuana-related episodes increased 39 \npercent, and methamphetamine cases rose 256 percent over the 1991 \nlevel.\n  Clearly, it makes far more sense to spend resources that will prevent \npeople from using drugs in the first place. Once people are damaged by \ndrugs, at most, treatment can prevent further harm. As some have said, \nyou can't fight a war by focusing only on the treatment of the wounded.\n\n\n                     B. WHAT THESE STATISTICS MEAN\n\n  These statistics show that more kids are becoming hooked on dope. \nPromising young lives are being derailed.\n  It is tough to imagine that American children will be equipped to \ncompete with foreign competitors when one-third of high school seniors \nare smoking pot. The President can talk about education and all of the \nprograms he wants, but if we don't work to keep kids off drugs, all \nthe rhetoric and good intentions will be worthless.\n\n  Drug abuse is a major contributing factor to child abuse and \nhomelessness. All Americans bear the costs of the abuse--through \nincreased crime and increased taxes to pay for welfare and other social \nprograms. According to the drug czar's office, the social cost of drug \nuse is $67 billion annually.\n\n\nwhat can be done to return to the successes achieved during the reagan-\n                                bush era\n\n  President Clinton needs to do many things to recapture the advance \nmade during the Reagan-Bush years.\n\n[[Page S4281]]\n\n  First, it needs to be recognized that the war on drugs can be won. It \nis not just the President who has waived a white flag--at least before \nhis welcome change of heart--some prominent conservatives have also \nsurrendered.\n  According to statistics compiled by the National Household Survey on \nDrug Abuse, between 1979 and 1992, overall drug use declined about 50 \npercent. Between 1985 and 1992, monthly cocaine use dropped by 78 \npercent.\n  If we turn from overall narcotics use to the crucial 14- to 18-age \nbracket, we see that the results of the Reagan-Bush efforts were just \nas encouraging. According to the monitoring the future study, illicit \ndrug use by high school seniors dropped from 54.2 percent in 1979 to \n27.1 percent in 1992, and cocaine use fell from an annual rate of 13.1 \npercent in 1985 to 3.4 percent in 1992.\n  I believe that we should return to the strategies that were proven \neffective during the Reagan-Bush administrations. These include:\n  Interdiction: Renewed efforts by the Federal agencies responsible for \nfighting drugs to spend greater resources identifying sources, \nmethods, and individuals involved in trafficking.\n\n  Enforcement: As I mentioned before, drug prosecutions under the \nClinton administration have significantly decreased. Those violating \nour drug laws must be prosecuted. Additionally, we must make sure that \nthose who are profiting from the drug trade are severely punished.\n  Bully Pulpit: the intellectual elite laughed at the Reagan \nadministration's ``Just Say No'' campaign. But it was clearly an \nimportant part of its successful efforts to reduce drug use. The ``Just \nSay Nothing'' approach of the Clinton administration has softened the \nattitudes of students toward marijuana. Peer disapproval of marijuana \nhas dropped from 70 percent in 1992 to 58 percent in 1994.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I would like to say that efforts to \nfight drugs can and should be bipartisan. For example, earlier this \nyear, Senator Feinstein introduced a bill--which I have cosponsored--to \nmake it more difficult to peddle the ingredients use to make \nmethamphetamine. Senator Feinstein recognized that further controls \nwere necessary to stop a drug which is currently ravaging the Southwest \nfrom turning into the next crack epidemic.\n  I am glad that the President is finally putting some energy into \nfighting the Nation's drug problem. His recent actions are appreciated, \nand should be at least somewhat helpful. It is time to resume the drug \nwar. America's future is at stake.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \nhis remarks and contribution to this effort.\n  I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague, Senator \nCoverdell, from Georgia and also Senator Kyl from Arizona. I want to \necho the comments of the Senator because they are right on target. I \nhope the American people have had a chance to listen to what the \nSenator from Arizona said.\n  Whatever happened to the war on drugs?\n  In 1981, Americans were calling the drug epidemic the gravest \ninternal problem facing our society. So Ronald Reagan issued a clarion \ncall. He said, ``The United States has taken down the surrender flag \nand run up the battle flag. And we are going to win the war on drugs.'' \nThat was in 1982.\n  In 1992, candidate Clinton sounded out an all-out drug war charge. It \nis now 1996, an election year.\n  Today, more than 3 years into his term, President Clinton is \nannouncing his drug policy. Maybe it is better late than never. But to \nthis Senator it sounds a lot like an election conversion.\n  Under the Clinton administration, drug use amongst teenagers is up \nsharply, and drugs are more readily available and more cheaply \navailable than at any time in our Nation's history. The surrender flag \nhas been run up the pole once again.\n  This is not a partisan point of view. Look at what some leading \nDemocrats said about Clinton's lack of leadership in combating drug \nuse.\n  ``The President is silent on the matter. He has failed to speak.''\n  That was not made by Don Nickles or Paul Coverdell. It was made by \nJoe Biden on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' on the 28th of April, yesterday.\n  Here is another quote:\n  ``I have never seen a President care less about drugs.'' Again, not \nby a partisan Republican but by Charles Rangel, Democrat from New York.\n  Many Americans, I think, are startled to realize these facts. ``What \nhappened to the war on drugs? I thought we were winning.'' Well, we \nwere.\n  Between 1979 and 1992 the number of Americans using illicit drugs \nplunged from 24.7 million to 11.4 million. The so-called casual use of \ncocaine fell by 79 percent between 1985 and 1992, and monthly cocaine \nuse fell by 55 percent between 1988 and 1992 alone; an enormous \ndecline.\n  We were winning the war. We were on the way. The war was not over, to \nbe sure, but we had won a lot of battles, and significant progress had \nbeen made. So what has happened?\n  Part of the answer must lie in the fact that the bully pulpit used so \noften and so forcefully by President Reagan and President Bush, and by \ntheir appointee, Bill Bennett, our former drug czar, and Nancy Reagan \nand Barbara Bush, has been vacated by this administration.\n  The strategy of ``just say no'' that Nancy Reagan used was laughed at \nby many of the persons in this administration. But it has turned into a \npolicy not of ``just say no'' but ``just say nothing'' by this \nadministration.\n  It could be that the administration's silence has been by design \ncreated by a need to cover up the backsliding that has resulted from \nthe administration's failed policies.\n  Whatever happened to the war on drugs?\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Chairman Orrin Hatch, issued a \nreport in December of last year, and it provides several good clues.\n  Clue No. 1: President Clinton slashes the Office of Drug Control \nPolicy.\n  President Clinton had been in office almost a year before he finally \nappointed his drug czar, and that was Lee Brown.\n  After receiving his appointment, Mr. Brown was not greeted with the \nsupport one would expect from a President who is dedicated to an all-\nout war on drugs.\n  While reminding America that drug abuse is ``as serious a problem as \nwe have in America,'' President Clinton greeted his Cabinet-level drug \nczar with a decimated budget and radically reduced staff. Staff size at \nthe Office of Drug Control Policy was reduced from 146 employees to 25 \nunder President Clinton. That is less than one-half the size of the \nWhite House communications staff. That is about one-sixth. He did not \ncut it in half. He did not cut it by a third. He cut from 146 \nindividuals to 25.\n  He cut the budget from $185.8 million to only $5.8 million. It does \nnot even show up. He cut it from $185 million to less than $6 million.\n  That was the President's war on drugs. That looks like a surrender to \nme. It looks like he gave up.\n  Clue No. 2: President Clinton downplays the domestic law enforcement \nefforts.\n  President Clinton's budgets have resulted in a loss of 227 agents \nfrom the Drug Enforcement Administration between September 1992 and \nSeptember 1995.\n  The number of individuals prosecuted for Federal drug violations \ndropped 12 percent over this same period of time; no big surprise. If \nyou cut the number of agents by 227 in 3 years, you are going to have a \nsignificant number of individuals prosecuted.\n  Clue No. 3: President Clinton scales back efforts for drug \ntrafficking prevention.\n  The overall proportion of the Customs Service budget devoted to drug \ncontrol fell from 45.5 percent in 1991 to projected 33.9 percent in \n1996, again a significant reduction in Custom's budget.\n  Department of Defense airborne detection and monitoring assets were \ncut back from 3,400 to 1,850 hours between 1992 and 1995--again almost \nhalf.\n  The use of Navy vessels measured in so-called steaming days was cut \nfrom 420 to 170--less than half.\n  We are doing a lot less interdiction.\n  The Coast Guard operating expense budget for drug missions fell from \n$449 million in fiscal year 1991 to projected $314 million in 1996.\n\n[[Page S4282]]\n\n  What is the result of these actions? Between 1993 and the first 6 \nmonths of 1995, the transit zone ``disruption rate''--which measures \nthe ability of the United States to seize or otherwise turn back drug \nshipments--dropped 53 percent.\n  The number of drug trafficking aircraft seized by Customs in the \ntransit zone fell from 37 to 10 between 1993 and 1995.\n  The Coast Guard cocaine seizures remain 73 percent below the peak of \n1991.\n  Marijuana seizures fell even more drastically--more than 90 percent \nover the same period.\n  Mr. President, I look at many of the things that President Clinton \nhas done, and I see a real lack of leadership--almost a surrender on \nthe war on drugs. Maybe this is best exemplified by the some of his \nappointees.\n  I think of Dr. Elders, who was President Clinton's first Surgeon \nGeneral, a candidate whom many of us opposed because of her positions \non a lot of issues. After she was confirmed, she made a couple of \nstatements of note. One, she said ``I think we should consider \nlegalizing drugs.'' This was not anybody. This was the Surgeon General, \nthe No. 1 public health officer appointed by this administration who \nsaid that we should ``consider legalizing drugs.''\n  What did President Clinton do? He said, ``Well, I am not sure I agree \nwith her.'' He asked her not to say it again. A couple of months later \nshe said it again. ``I think we should seriously consider legalizing \ndrug use.''\n  This is not a war on drugs. This is a capitulation. This is \nsurrender. This is not using the bully pulpit to combat drug use. This \nis saying maybe top officials in Government think we should legalize \ndrugs. Maybe drugs are not so bad after all.\n  She was wrong. Was she removed for those statements? No, she was not. \nShe might have been reprimanded for the first.\n  The second statement she made was almost ignored, and, frankly, she \nwas removed from office for other statements she made talking about \nteaching kids things on sexual tendencies and so on in the classroom. \nShe was not removed for her discussion before the press that we should \nlegalize drugs. Again, this is the Nation's No. 1 health officer. Is \nnot drug use unhealthy? Certainly.\n  Again, what about example? President Clinton's own admission that he \nhas used drugs--and then he came back and said, ``Well, I never broke \nthe laws of this country.'' Well, it was in some other country. But he \nsaid he did not inhale. What kind of example is that?\n\n  Again, we want to discourage the use of drugs, and when we talk about \nstatistics and we see drug use is up sharply amongst teenagers, what \nkind of example do we have by the President himself?\n  Sadly, like so many other things, the war on drugs fell victim to a \nPresident who lacks conviction to back up his promises.\n  I am glad the President made a speech today talking about we need to \nstand up and fight the war on drugs. Again, it sounds to this Senator \nlike an election conversion. For 3 years where has his leadership been? \nIt has been actually vacant. It has been silent. It has not existed. It \nis surrender.\n  Now we have an election, and I think pollsters informed the \nPresident, ``Hey, this is an important issue, and drug use is up \namongst teenagers.'' So, finally, we have a speech 6 months before \nelection time.\n  So what now? On December 13, Majority Leader Bob Dole and Speaker of \nthe House Newt Gingrich convened a bicameral Leadership Task Force on \nNational Drug Policy. The task force was chaired by Senators Grassley \nand Orrin Hatch, as well as House Members William Zeliff and Henry \nHyde.\n  They were asked to develop principles for coherent, national \ncounterdrug policy as well as supporting strategy for future actions. \nOn March 28 of this year, the task force released a five-point national \ndrug strategy.\n  Sound interdiction strategy. We must stop the enemies' attack by \nprotecting our borders from the pestilence of drugs. On land, air, and \nsea, our Nation's enforcement officers must have the commitment and the \nresources from our Nation's leader's so they can do their job.\n  Serious international commitment to the full range of counter-\nnarcotics activities. We must support renewed efforts by the U.S. \nCustoms Service, Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, Department of Defense, and Coast Guard to \nidentify sources, methods, and individuals involved in drug \ntrafficking.\n\n  Effective enforcement of the Nation's drug laws. The Clinton \nadministration's revolving door justice is making innocent Americans \nprisoners in their own communities. Our policy must be simply: If you \ncommit the crime, you do the time.\n  We must also commit to nominating and confirming judges who are tough \non crime, unlike President Clinton's judicial nominees --and primarily \nI think of Judge Baer, who basically said, no, we will not use the \nevidence of pounds and pounds of cocaine; it was seized illegally. \nUnder pressure, President Clinton pressured the judge and the judge \nchanged his mind. Maybe that is good. But the better aspect of that \nwould have been not to have Judge Baer a Federal judge. He was \nPresident Clinton's nominee and, unfortunately, has lifetime tenure.\n  We need a united commitment toward prevention and education. A key \ncomponent of any coherent, sustained drug program must be a public \neducation program. This means ensuring that the bully pulpit is not \nempty and that national leadership is not AWOL. The antidrug message \nmust be clear, consistent, and repeated often, not just in election \nyears.\n  Mr. President, we need treatment returning to a proper balance. We \nmust realize that emphasizing treatment alone addresses the wrong end \nof the problem. Treatment is most effective for those who are motivated \nand face substantial penalty if they do not achieve and maintain \nsobriety.\n  Mr. President, I thank again my colleague, Senator Coverdell, and \nSenator Grassley, Senator Hatch, and others for their work on combating \ndrugs. We need to do this every year. It needs to be done by the White \nHouse, through the bully pulpit, appointees--appointment of good \njudges--and we need a consistent effort, not just in an election year. \nUnfortunately, I think we have not had that from this administration.\n  I urge my colleagues to be forceful. I urge my colleagues to speak \nout because the war on drugs needs to be fought, and for the sake of \nour children the war on drugs needs to be won.\n  I thank my colleague from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for his important \nremarks and observations made about the situation on the drug war.\n  Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to the senior Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we are talking basically today about crime, \nthough I heard Senator Gorton speak on another subject, and obviously \nan important one. He mentioned Pericles of Athens and, I would only \nadd, O that the Lord would send us a Pericles now that we really need \none. But we are here today basically talking about crime, and I want to \ntouch on three issues. I want to express frustration about two of them. \nFor the last 6 years, as we have debated crime bills, I have offered \ntwo amendments that have passed the Senate with overwhelming votes. \nThey both relate to mandatory minimum sentencing.\n  The first amendment addresses the same issue the President addressed \nthis morning in Florida, and that is the problem we have with children \nand drugs. The amendment I have offered recognizes the fact that there \nis a drug pusher almost literally standing at the doorway of every \njunior high school in America. In addition, increasingly drug pushers \nuse children to deliver the drug and to take the cash, because it is at \nthat point of transaction, where the exchange between money and drugs \nactually occurs, that you have the strongest possibility of \nprosecution. And so, what is increasingly happening in our country is \nnot only are drug pushers exploiting our children by selling drugs \noutside the doorway--and sometimes inside the doorway--of what would \nseem to be every junior high school in America, but increasingly our \nchildren are being used in drug conspiracies to actually transfer the \ndrug and take the money.\n\n[[Page S4283]]\n\n  Recognizing this incredible tragedy, I have repeatedly offered an \namendment to require 10 years in prison without parole for selling \ndrugs to a minor or for using a minor in drug trafficking or a drug \nconspiracy. Two years ago I strengthened that amendment to add life \nimprisonment without parole on a repeat offense.\n  The thing I think would be most stunning for people to know is that \nwhile we have adopted my amendment on minimum mandatory sentencing for \nselling drugs to children or using our children in drug sales, every \ntime we have debated a crime bill this decade, that amendment has been \nadopted, and yet it has never become the law of the land. In fact, in \nPresident Clinton's so-called crime bill, in 1994, Congress overturned \nminimum mandatory sentencing for drug felons and, by giving discretion \nto judges, in essence, guaranteed that the minimum sentencing \nprovisions we had, were largely eliminated.\n  This spring and summer we are going to debate crime again. I want to \nput my colleagues on notice. I am going to offer this amendment again: \n10 years in prison without parole for selling drugs to a minor or using \na minor in drug trafficking; life imprisonment without parole on the \nsecond offense. I am not going to stop until, this year, we make that \namendment the law of the land.\n  The second provision, which I have offered now for the better part of \na decade--and it normally gets an overwhelming majority in the Senate, \nbut it never becomes law--is 10 years in prison without parole for \npossessing a firearm during the commission of a violent crime or a drug \nfelony; 20 years for discharging the firearm; life imprisonment without \nparole for killing somebody, and, in aggravated cases, the death \npenalty. That provision has consistently been adopted, but what always \nhappens is in the conference committee, where we work out the \ndifferences between the Senate bill and the House bill, it ends up \nbeing dropped. I do not intend to see that happen this year.\n  We have proven in the District of Columbia and all over the planet \nthat gun control does not work. But if we add 10 years in prison \nwithout parole for simply possessing a firearm during a violent crime \nor drug felony, in addition to the penalty for the violent crime and \ndrug felony, if we add 20 years for discharging the firearm, if we had \nthe death penalty for killing somebody, we could begin to do something \nabout gun violence in America. I am ready. The Senate has been ready, \nat least in terms of the public votes we cast. But in the private \nvotes, in conference committee, this provision, year after year after \nyear, has been dropped. It is time for that to stop.\n  Finally, I want to put prisoners to work in America. It seems that \nevery year somebody offers an amendment--normally, our dear colleague \nfrom North Carolina, Senator Helms--to ban trade with some country that \nuses prison labor, and every year I wonder why we cannot use prison \nlabor. We have 1.1 million people in prison in America, yet we have \nthree Federal statutes, all arising out of the Depression era, that \ncriminalize prison labor in America: the Hawes-Cooper Act, the Sumners-\nAshurst Act, and the Walsh-Healey Public Contracting Act. Each \neffectively limits our ability to have people work in prison to produce \ngoods for sale.\n  One bill says it is a felony if you produce something in prison and \nsend it across State lines; another bill limits the transport of such \ngoods; another limits the use of prison labor in regard to Federal \ncontracts. Converted into English, what that says it that it is illegal \nto make prisoners work. I do not understand that.\n  I want to repeal these three statutes. I want to turn our prisons \ninto industrial parks. I want to make prisoners work 10 hours a day, 6 \ndays a week, and I want to make them go to school at night. We spent \n$22,000 a year last year to keep somebody in the Federal penitentiary. \nIf we stop building prisons like Holiday Inns, if we make prisoners \nwork, I believe we could cut that cost by 50 percent in 5 years, and \ncut it by three-quarters in 10 years, and I think that ought to be our \nobjective.\n  So I think it is time to stop talking about the crime problem and \nstart doing something about it.\n  I remind my colleagues that last year in the Commerce, State, Justice \nappropriations bill, the committee adopted an amendment that I authored \nthat would repeal these three laws. But guess what happened? It was not \nin the final version of the bill. The same thing that has happened on \nminimum mandatory sentencing for selling drugs to children, the same \nthing that has happened on minimum mandatory sentencing for gun \nviolence. We cast votes in the Senate--in public everybody says, \n``Great,'' they are really serious about this problem--and then some of \nour most senior Members meet in the dark, dingy corners of some room \nhere in this magnificent building and these great proposals die.\n  I believe the time has come for that to stop. I think these are three \nchanges that need to be made, and I intend to continue to fight for \nthem. It is our Republican agenda. I want to make it happen.\n  I thank our colleague from Georgia for his great leadership, and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Texas, \nand I wish him well on the efforts to secure the adoption of his \namendments.\n  We have been joined by the Senator from New Mexico. I yield, if he is \nprepared, up to 10 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, I want to thank the distinguished \njunior Senator from Georgia, a Republican, for arranging this floor \ntime, to give us an opportunity to talk to the issue of drugs and \ncrime.\n  The remarks that the President made in Miami today concerning the \nadministration's new drug control strategy--and I underline the word \n``new''--come as a great surprise to me. Accompanying the President was \nthe new drug czar, General McCaffrey. He has been a rather outstanding \nAmerican general, and while he has only been on this job a little more \nthan a month, he is already having an impact on the policies of this \nadministration.\n  But in the past 3 years, since the President took office, drug use by \nchildren between the ages of 12 and 17 has increased 50 percent. \nCocaine used by high school students has increased 36 percent during \nthat same period of time. Juvenile crimes have increased dramatically \nduring this same period, and studies show that drug use is closely \nlinked to juvenile crime. According to the Justice Department, in 1994, \none out of three juvenile offenders was under the influence of drugs at \nthe time of their arrest.\n  There are several aspects to the drug and crime problem that I would \nlike to touch upon today. They include drug use, interdiction, and \njuvenile crime as it relates to drugs.\n  As you know, Mr. President, my home State is in the southwestern part \nof America. In fact, New Mexico and Mexico share 175 miles of common \nborder. I say that looking directly at the Senator from Georgia, \nbecause some Olympic organizers got confused and did not think there \nwas a border. They thought New Mexico was Mexico. We have straightened \nthat out, at least temporarily.\n  But to show that, seriously, we understand this issue, we have 175 \nmiles of common border, and without an effective drug control \ninterdiction strategy involving help from the Mexican Government, that \n175 miles can and, I might say does, serve as a huge segment of the \npipeline through which illegal drugs flow to these United States.\n  It is not uncommon for contra-bandistas to cross the border at El \nPaso or Santa Teresa into New Mexico. Incidentally, some of these \nindividuals are human mules. Others are actually accompanied by donkeys \nor other animals that have been fit with packets of illegal drugs and, \nin many cases, have been fed the illegal drugs--literally ingested \nthem.\n  Mexican drug gangs also are responsible for large quantities of \nmethamphetamine, or speed, as we commonly know it, as well as other \ndrugs which have begun to pose particularly difficult problems in the \nWestern States.\n\n  When the FBI and the DEA appeared before the Senate Banking Committee \nin March, their prepared statements included the following information:\n\n       Of three dominant Mexican drug gangs, one is located in \n     Juarez, just an hour by car\n\n[[Page S4284]]\n\n     from a city in New Mexico called Las Cruces. This Juarez \n     cartel is headed by Amado Carillo Fuentes, the most powerful \n     figure in the Mexican drug trade. He is known as ``the lord \n     of the skies'' because he owns several airplanes and, indeed, \n     several airline companies which enable him to fly 727 jet \n     airplanes from Colombia into Juarez.\n       We used to wonder about interdicting twin engine Piper Cubs \n     and Cessnas and single engines. We cannot catch this fellow, \n     this ``lord of the skies,'' because he is so big, strong and \n     rich that he has his own airlines. His group is directly \n     associated with the Rodriguez Orejuela drug mafia in Cali, \n     Colombia, and through a cousin to the Ochoa brothers of the \n     Medellin cartel as well.\n       This Juarez cartel acts as the transportation agent for the \n     Colombia-based distribution organizations, and the cartel's \n     operations include the use of 18-wheelers to transport money. \n     Murders in Juarez have increased and have been associated \n     with Carillo Fuentes. For instance, in July of 1995, the \n     leader of the juvenile gang Carillo Fuentes used to smuggle \n     drugs across the border, was found shot 23 times in the head.\n       These Mexican transportation organizations are full \n     partners with the Colombians in the drug trade. They are full \n     and total partners--it is customary for them to split 50-50 \n     the drug profits.\n\n  I was shocked by this information, but it is accurate. As I said, it \nwas excerpted from the testimony of the FBI and the DEA before the \nSenate Banking Committee on Mexican-American cooperation with reference \nto stopping the flow of drugs into this country.\n\n  My State, because of its proximity, has been particularly affected by \nthe inability of the Republic of Mexico to deal with the illegal trade. \nA group, which I helped establish, called New Mexico First, recently \npublished a report on crime in New Mexico. The results of the report \nshow that there is a direct link between drug use and crime in my \nState. The report notes, and I quote, ``A common and reoccurring \ncharacteristic [of those committing crime in New Mexico] is substance \nabuse.''\n  According to the report, 75 percent of those arrested in 1994 and \n1995 admitted to using illegal drugs. Sixty percent of the criminals in \nNew Mexico tested positive for at least one illegal drug at the time of \ntheir arrest, and 18 percent of females arrested were under the \ninfluence of three or more illegal substances.\n  New Mexico first, in its report, also notes that the use of cocaine \nby criminals has doubled from 1992 to 1994. Amphetamine use was up \nfourfold during the same period.\n  In his speech today, the President asked Congress to increase funding \nfor the drug war by 9.3 percent to give schools, hospitals, and \ncommunities the tools they need to fight the war on drugs, however, he \noffered few specific details on how this money was to be used.\n\n  The President is correct to emphasize the methamphetamine threat, \nwhich is growing every day. Nationwide that threat has risen 256 \npercent over the 1991 level. We are seeing it as a growing problem in \nNew Mexico schools, and much of it is manufactured in Mexico.\n  Not too long ago 700 pounds of speed was intercepted in Las Cruces, \nNM. I just told you that is 1 hour from the Juarez headquarters of the \nvery major gang that I described. That drug, which causes \nhallucinations, paranoia, and wrecks a lot of lives, is in abundance in \nmy State. And it is becoming more abundant in America, not just in the \nborder States.\n  In the city of Albuquerque, we saw a group of young girls aged 10 to \n13 breaking into homes to steal jewelry, that they would sell to kids \ndoing drugs. The kids doing drugs would sell the stolen property to pay \nfor their drug habits. Several of the young girls have been charged \nwith as many as 30 felonies. It is a real problem.\n  But, actions speak louder than words. The day after taking office the \nClinton administration cut the Office of National Drug Policy staff by \nmore than 80 percent. Soon after taking office the Attorney General \nannounced that she wanted to reduce the mandatory sentences for drug \ntrafficking and related Federal crimes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask the Senator, can I have 3 additional minutes?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Consequently, Federal drug prosecutions dropped 12 \npercent in the first 2 years of the Clinton administration. From 1992 \nto 1995, 227 agent positions were eliminated from the DEA. And \nPresident Clinton's 1995 budget proposed cutting 621 enforcement \npositions for DEA, FBI, INS, and Customs.\n  Fortunately, in the Subcommittee of Appropriations which I was \nprivileged to serve on, we restored most of these positions. The \nClinton administration also has shifted funding priorities away from \ndrug interdiction to treatment of hardcore users.\n  The President asked for an increase, but gave no specifics about what \nto do with the money. I have some specifics. Reintroduce the drug \neducation program for our youth that was developed in the 1980's. \nPrograms like ``just say no'' had a visible impact on reducing drug \nuse.\n  Adopt a policy of treating violent juvenile offenders in the same \nmanner as we treat violent adult offenders. The current system fosters \na lack of respect for law and the courts and encourages the commission \nof more crimes by more juveniles. We are reluctant to hold them \naccountable. As a matter of fact, we wait until they have been arrested \ninnumerable times, incarcerated innumerable times, before we decide \nthat they must truly be held accountable.\n  A survey of judges showed that 93 percent thought that juvenile \noffenders should be fingerprinted, which they are not. And 85 percent \nsaid that juvenile arrest records should be available to adult \nauthorities. They are not. I believe both should become a part of \ncommon practice. While the State's business is the State's business, I \nbelieve that if we are going to supply more and more aid to fight \ncrime, we ought to begin to ask States to do these kinds of things.\n  The judges want to fingerprint juveniles so we have permanent records \nof their criminal acts. They want the arrest records to be available, \njust as adult records. Perhaps there should be a time limit, maybe not \n13 years of age, but starting maybe at 12. But essentially we must act \nand act quickly in this regard.\n  So I come to the floor of the Senate to say that the President's \nspeech today was long past due. It is almost too late for the President \nto have credibility on this issue. Actually, if the distinguished \ngeneral that recently was hired after the drug policy office was \nrendered a nullity, if the office would have been funded and had \nsomebody like the general in charge 3 years ago, just look at the \nresults we might be expecting today. For he has already taken charge \nand is doing some very positive things.\n  Let me say to the distinguished Senator from Georgia, I welcome the \nopportunity to speak on this subject and again thank him for arranging \nthe time. I hope it is educational. I hope the people of our country \nlearn from it, as the Senator expects them to. Most of all, I hope we \ndo some very constructive things with reference to this issue. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from New Mexico. I would remind \nhim, as he spoke of what has not happened over the past 3 years, that \nthere are consequences of that, the most specific of which is that \nwhere we had 1.5 million teenagers caught up in this vicious cycle, we \nnow have 3 years later 3 million. So 1.5 million teenagers have been \nsteered to this problem because of our lack of attention, each one of \nthose a personal tragedy in and of itself.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his eloquent remarks on this \nsubject. I now yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I come to the floor to echo the words of the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Mexico, as well as Georgia. We just heard the statistics on \nteenagers and drug abuse, misuse. I had the pleasure this morning of \nsitting around the breakfast table with my youngest son, who is now 9 \nyears of age, and had the opportunity to wish him happy birthday. And \nacross the table at breakfast this morning, I was thinking about what \nto say and how to express it, and I looked in the eyes of my 12-year-\nold son, whose birthday is in 8 days, and he will be 13 years of age.\n  We just heard the statistics. But the backdrop of what I had to say, \nas I looked at my children, who are a part of that generation, sitting \naround the breakfast table, was that survey done by the Department of \nHealth and\n\n[[Page S4285]]\n\nHuman Services, where drug use among teenagers rose from 2.4 million 4 \nyears ago to 3.8 million in 1994. Marijuana use increased 137 percent \namong 12- to 13-year-olds--the exact age of my son--since 1992. \nMarijuana use increased 200 percent among 14- to 15-year-olds during \nthis same period.\n  This, I might add, sharply contrasts with the Reagan-Bush record \nwhere between 1979 and 1992, overall drug use declined more than 50 \npercent.\n  So that is the backdrop. It is the concern for the current young \ngeneration, the generation of our children.\n  President Clinton referred to action over the last 3 years, as we \nheard his words this morning, but the action has not been there. Ever \nsince the start of 1996, President Clinton has been shouting about law \nand order. He capped his efforts today by unveiling in Miami a new drug \nstrategy. But what you are seeing now, I am afraid, is no more than yet \nanother demonstration of President Clinton's lack of candor with the \nAmerican people. And all you have to do is go back and look at what has \nhappened over the last 3 years.\n  President Clinton, in spite of his rhetoric, has been soft on crime. \nHe has appointed judges who favor the rights of criminals over law-\nabiding citizens. He abandoned, as we have heard, the war on drugs. \nOnly now in this election year does he rediscover the crime and drug \nissue.\n\n  As the old saying goes, ``Shame on you for fooling me once, but shame \non me for being fooled twice.'' So, before we are fooled once again by \nPresident Clinton's law and order rhetoric, we should take a closer \nlook at the actual--I call it ``dismal'' --record of law enforcement \nand drug policy over the past 3 years.\n  Going back to 1992, when Clinton claimed, in an effort to win the war \non drugs, he would put a premium on drug interdiction, at that time he \nstated: ``We need an effective, coordinated drug interdiction program \nthat stops the endless flow of drugs entering our schools, our streets, \nand our communities.'' He further stated he would provide cities and \nStates with the help they need. It sounds good. Who could possibly \ndisagree with this strategy?\n  If you look at the actual record of President Clinton, once he was \nelected, not only did he not pursue new efforts to stop drugs from \nentering this country, he gutted existing drug interdiction efforts.\n  First, the newly elected President Clinton cut--cut--his drug policy \noffice staff by 83 percent. He cut the staff from 146 employees to 25 \nemployees. Then he had his National Security Council drop the drug war \nfrom one of its top three priorities to No. 29, and there were only 29 \npriorities on the list.\n  In 1993, President Clinton stopped the training of new DEA agents. \nWhat a contrast this was to the drug interdiction record of President \nBush, who trained 347 DEA agents in 1992 alone.\n  Does President Clinton's commitment to fighting drugs sound bad? \nUnfortunately, there is more when we look at the record. President \nClinton cut Federal spending on drug interdiction by 14 percent during \nhis first 2 years as President. Now, in the fiscal year 1996 budget \nrequest, he wants to cut drug interdiction spending by 37 percent from \n1991 levels. His misguided efforts to gut drug interdiction programs \nhave resulted in America losing its war on drugs.\n  With fewer DEA agents, there have been fewer drug prosecutions and \nfewer convictions. Between 1992 and 1994, Federal drug prosecutions \ndropped by 12.5 percent. Furthermore, fewer drugs are being stopped at \nthe border. From 1993 to the 6 months of 1995, the transit zone so-\ncalled ``disruption rate'' --that is the ability of U.S. forces to \nseize or turn back drug shipments--dropped 53 percent from 435 \nkilograms per day to 205 kilograms. This means that in all probability, \napproximately 84 metric tons of additional illegal drugs may be \narriving on the streets of America.\n\n  With fewer drugs being stopped at the border, drugs are more readily \navailable. Under President Clinton, the supply of drugs has increased \nso much that between February 1993 and February 1995, the price of \ncocaine fell by 20 percent and the price of heroin fell by 37 percent.\n  Clinton's soft-on-crime approach to drug interdiction has paralleled \nthe increase that I opened with, drug abuse among our children, with \nthose children who, at the age of my 12- to 13-year-old Harrison, \nmarijuana use has increased 137 percent.\n  We should resume, not desert, the war on drugs. So, face it, we have \nto look at the actions. The actions do speak louder than words. I \ncommend President Clinton for coming forward today, but we should look \nat what he has done those last 3 years. While President Clinton plays \nlip service to the rights of law-abiding citizens, his abandonment of \ndrug interdiction efforts has left children all over America vulnerable \nto drug-dealing thugs. To make matters worse, President Clinton has \nsprinkled his judicial appointments with judges who go out of their way \nto put criminals back on the streets.\n  Mr. President, in closing, after looking at President Clinton's crime \nrecord over the past 3 years, there is only one conclusion that anyone \nwith common sense can have about it: President Clinton has been soft on \ncrime and drugs, and he is trying to conceal this fact through rhetoric \nduring this election year. It is time to be tough on crime for the \nfuture of our children.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Tennessee. I \nwill ask unanimous consent--we negotiated with the other side--for an \nadditional 5 minutes on our time, and then I will yield up to 5 minutes \nto the distinguished Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COVERDELL). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me thank my colleague from Georgia for yielding and in \nassuming the Chair so I could speak for a few moments on this very \nimportant issue.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Tennessee for relating, I think, the \nkind of concerns that all of us have today about the future of our \nyoung people and the kind of environment in which they live and survive \nin. I use the word ``survive'' because I think when the Presiding \nOfficer and I were growing up, the kinds of stresses in the \ncommunities, the kind of peer pressure we had, was so significantly \ndifferent than it is today. There is no doubt that access to drugs, the \navailability of drugs, the kind of statistics that we have heard quoted \nhere in the last little while prey heavily upon young people and \nprovide them not only with unique opportunities, but with tremendous \ncourses toward disaster if they choose to make themselves available to \nthese drugs.\n\n  I must say that when I look at the statistics today, when I see there \nwas an effort begun in this country in 1979 and early 1980 and \nthroughout the 1980's by Members of the Senate and Members of the \nHouse, the administrations of that time, to focus Federal law \nenforcement and dollars to the interdiction of drugs coming into our \ncommunities and into our economy, and in doing so, we found out that it \nwas working. We found out that illicit drugs plummeted in their usage \nfrom 24 million in 1979 to about 11.4 million by 1992. The so-called \ncasual use of cocaine fell by 79 percent between 1985 and 1990, while \nmonthly cocaine use fell 55 percent between 1988 and 1992.\n  It was not by accident, Mr. President, that that was happening. It \nwas happening because this country, its Government and its law \nenforcement community, was focused. We recognized the crisis in urban \nAmerica and the crisis on the streets that was dragging our young \npeople into it. It was a drug crisis. That is why Americans told us, \n``Something has to be done. We are concerned about the future of our \ncountry and the future of our young people.''\n  As recently as December of this past year, in a Gallup poll, an issue \nthat had begun to slide on the polling of Americans as to a No. 1 issue \nwas up again, to show that 94 percent of Americans viewed illegal drug \nuse, again, as a crisis and a very serious problem for our society, and \nthat something must be done about it.\n  That is what was going on out there. Of course, you have heard \nspeakers here on the floor today speak of the President's initiatives \nannounced today in a backdrop of something or nothing having been done \nfor the first 3 years of his administration--or, I should say, a great \ndeal being done, but none of it right: a near collapse of the drug \nprogram in this Government, the laying off of employees and personnel \nin the area of drug enforcement, and\n\n[[Page S4286]]\n\nthe focus of this administration largely disappearing from a high \npriority to a very low priority, showing very clearly that when you \nfocus and when you direct resources on a problem of this nature, you \ncan have a substantial impact. We were beginning to show the real \nresults of the availability of these drugs on the streets, and, of \ncourse, if they are on the streets, then there is an opportunity for \nour young people to have access to them.\n  Perhaps 820,000 of the new crop of youthful marijuana smokers will \neventually try cocaine. That is a statistic that has just come from a \nstudy done by the Senate Judiciary Committee, published by the \nchairman, Orrin Hatch--a horrible statistic, in light of the fact that \nwe are now being told by the criminologists of our country, ``Get \nbraced, America, for the greatest juvenile crime wave in the history of \nour country.'' What is it driven by? In part, it is driven by drugs, or \nthe desire to have access to them and, therefore, the willingness to \ncommit crimes to have the resources to pay for them. These are horrible \nstatistics that we must become aware of.\n  I am so pleased today that the Senator from Georgia has taken this \nspecial order to speak to this issue. I say, Mr. President, thank you \nfor waking up. But shame on you for turning your back, in the last 3 \nyears, on an initiative that was working well and removing drugs from \nour streets and was creating a better environment for our youth.\n  Better late than never? I hope so, because I think the American \npeople want it, and I certainly hope this President will focus the \nresources of our Government, once again, toward aggressive interdiction \nand a program worthy of this country in getting drugs off of our \nstreets and making the environment in which our children live a safer \nplace. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  (Mr. CRAIG assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nIdaho for his remarks on this terribly important issue. If we can just \nstep back for a moment and try to put this situation into perspective, \nit began with the inauguration of President Clinton. The first sign \nfrom the White House was the suspension of the preemployment drug \ntesting program at the White House of the United States. From that \nmoment on, the message became clearer and clearer. We have heard all \nthe statistics that have emanated since--a shutting down of the policy \nof interdiction, law enforcement, and education saying to America's \nyouth that drugs are harmful.\n  The result of these changed policies are these: America's youth today \nno longer think drugs are dangerous. That statistic has plummeted. So \nit should come as no surprise to any of us that usage has skyrocketed. \nThey no longer are afraid because of signals like no more drug testing \nor, ``Let us legalize drugs,'' or, ``Let us shut the drug czar's office \ndown,'' or do not mention drugs at all in 3 years. So that pulpit is \nshut off, the resources are shut off, our youngsters no longer think it \nis a problem, and they start exploring drugs. The result is that we \nhave gone from just under 2 million using them to almost 4 million. So \nthat means that 2 million American families and 2 million teenagers' \nlives are stunted or put at risk as a result of these policies that \nhave been changed.\n\n  Mr. President, in closing, the ripple effect of this is stunning. I \nwas with President Zedillo of Mexico a couple of weeks ago, and he said \nthat the drug lords' attack on his country is the single greatest \nthreat of national security to that nation. I say, further, Mr. \nPresident, that drugs in the narco operations are the single greatest \nthreat to the security of the democracies in our hemisphere.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I say that this is the first time a war \nhas ever been declared on children age 8 to 12 years old. What a \ndisgusting, evil force we stand against. This is a war we cannot afford \nto lose.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk continued calling the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 1664, and under a previous order, at the \nhour of 5 p.m., the clerk will report a motion to invoke cloture.\n  The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1664) to amend the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act to increase control over immigration to the United States \n     by increasing border patrol and investigative personnel and \n     detention facilities, improving the system used by employers \n     to verify citizenship or work-authorized alien status, \n     increasing penalties for alien smuggling and document fraud, \n     and reforming asylum, exclusion, and deportation law and \n     procedures; to reduce the use of welfare by aliens; and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n\n       Dole (for Simpson) amendment No. 3743, of a perfecting \n     nature.\n       Dole (for Simpson) amendment No. 3744 (to amendment No. \n     3743), of a perfecting nature.\n       Dole motion to recommit the bill to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary with instructions to report back forthwith.\n       Lott amendment No. 3745 (to the instructions of the motion \n     to recommit), to require the report to Congress on detention \n     space to state the amount of detention space available in \n     each of the preceding 10 years.\n       Dole modified Amendment No. 3746 (to amendment No. 3745), \n     to authorize the use of volunteers to assist in the \n     administration of naturalization programs, port of entry \n     adjudications, and criminal alien removal.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was wondering if we could ask my friend \nfrom Arizona if we could divide the time between now and then between \nthe two parties. I do not know how many other speakers we are going to \nhave, but there may be some at the end. Just as a way of proceeding, \nmaybe we can do that. If there is a reservation about it, I will \ncontinue to inquire of the Senator about some evenness in time. We \nmight not approach that as an issue, but, more often than not, just \nbefore we get to the debate, a number of Senators would like to speak. \nI would like to see if we can reach some kind of way of allocating the \ntime fairly and perhaps permitting Senators on both sides to make \nincreasingly brief comments as we get closer to the time.\n  Mr. KYL. I do not have any objection to that. I know the Senator from \nNevada wants to speak on unrelated matters now. Perhaps as we get \nfurther into that, the precise nature in which we can proceed may be \nmore apparent to us later than it is now. I have no objection.\n\n[[Page S4287]]\n\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, I want to speak on immigration \nmatters. So it is a related matter.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will visit with the Senator in another \nhour and see where we are.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want this afternoon to talk about two \namendments that I am hopeful will be allowed to be disposed of by a \nvote in this Chamber at some time during the discussion of this \nimmigration bill.\n  As we all know, the parliamentary procedure is such that I do not \nthink anyone knows at this time what the future of amendments like \nthose that I intend to offer by 4 o'clock today will be. But I wanted \nto have the opportunity to talk about one or two matters in light of \nthe unknowns that lie ahead.\n  Mr. President, first of all, I want to talk about a subject that, \neven though I have spoken about it many times on the Senate floor--I \nhave spoken about it in other forums--it is still difficult to speak \nabout because it is an issue about, no matter how many times you speak \nabout the unfairness, the brutality of the procedure which is something \nthat you never get used to.\n  In the fall of 1994 I introduced a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \ncondemning the cruel practice of female genital mutilation, and at that \ntime I applauded the Government of Egypt for taking quick action \nagainst two men who performed this illegal act on a 10-year-old girl. \nThis act had been performed hundreds of thousands of times. But on this \noccasion television cameras hidden in nature were watching this brutal \nact by a man with his 10-year-old daughter. Dressed in the finest \nclothes, she had came for a celebration. The little girl was excited, \nand happy because the attention was focused on her. And then, Mr. \nPresident, she was held down, her legs spread apart, and she was \nbrutally mutilated.\n  This little girl was screaming, ``Daddy, why did you do this to me?\"\n  My being the father of a daughter, it brought tears to my eyes.\n  This resolution passed on September 27, 1994. At that time I \ncommitted myself to continue to talk about this issue and informing my \ncolleagues, and others that would listen, of the dangers it poses to \nthe physical and emotional health of young ladies, and how basically \nimmoral it is.\n  I felt it was important, and believe it is important, to inform the \nAmerican public of its prevalence in immigrant communities in the \nUnited States.\n  That next month, in October, I came to the floor to introduce \nlegislation to make the practice of female genital mutilation against \nthe law in the United States. I have tried on numerous occasions to do \nthat. I have been unable to succeed.\n  The latest failure was when the conferees on the omnibus \nappropriations bill that we just passed--and which was signed into law \nby the President--was stripped from that bill for procedural reasons.\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee from the House--when I \nexplained to him the procedure--said, ``You will have no objection from \nme.'' Henry Hyde, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, \nrecognizes brutality, and said he would not oppose it. But, of course, \nin the confines of the conference people look for all kinds of excuse \nand reasons to do things. And, no matter the times I spoke to people, \nthey said, ``Well, we do not want to pass any criminal law in an \nappropriations bill.''\n  I do not think this is something that calls for formalities. I \nthought that we should have passed the law previously. I think it is \nwrong that we have waited so long. And, as we speak, this practice is \nbeing performed all over the world. And it is being performed in the \nUnited States.\n  I, Mr. President, think it is a shame that organizations like the \nUnited Nations are mute about this particular procedure. They say \nnothing.\n  In October 1994 I came to the floor to introduce legislation. The \nbill also directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nidentify and compile data on the immigrant communities in this country \nthat continue this practice, and to develop recommendations for the \neducation of medical school students so that they can treat women that \nhave been mutilated by this ritual.\n  I am pleased to say that we have been successful in having the \ndirectives to the Secretary of Health and Human Services accepted in \nthe omnibus appropriations bill which passed last week. We have made \nthat progress. I think that is important. We know that out of Santa \nClara County in California recently we heard of seven cases being \nreported there of this brutal act being performed on girls and young \nwomen.\n  I would like to thank those that made it possible to get that part of \nthe bill passed.\n  But this language is only a small step in acknowledging this practice \nthat takes place so often--this torture which has been performed on 100 \nmillion girls and young women in over 30 countries worldwide--over 100 \nmillion human beings.\n  Mr. President, again, as I said, I have spoken about this subject on \na number of occasions. It does not become easier to speak about it in \nrepetitive cases. But it is important to inform those who are within \nthe sound of my voice what this barbaric procedure is.\n  Normally, if anything can be normal that is associated with this \npractice, it is performed on young girls between the ages of 4 and 10 \nyears of age. But, if they happen to slip by some way, many teenagers \nand women in their twenties have had this performed on them. This \nprocedure is often referred to as circumcision, but it has more in \ncommon with castration. Excision and infibulation are the most common \npractices.\n  Infibulation, Mr. President, is practiced in many countries. It \nentails the excision of all female genitalia with a razor, a piece of \nglass, or just a knife. The remaining tissue is stitched together \nleaving only a small opening for urine, and menstrual fluid. This \npractice has no medical justification for being performed on healthy \nyoung girls, and certainly not on women. And it is usually performed \nwith crude, unsterile instruments without anesthesia. These young girls \nare many times tied down, or held down. And I have watched the one that \nI talked about initially where this young little girl was screaming as \nno one can scream. The aftereffects of this act include shock, \ninfection, emotional trauma, hemorrhaging, debilitating scarring, \ninfertility, and death.\n  If there were ever an example of sexism, this is it.\n  A young woman from Togo was recently called to our attention because \nthis woman, a 20-year-old woman, was going to have this procedure. \nFauziya Kasinga fled Togo and came to America in order to escape the \ntorture of female genital mutilation. She is now seeking asylum based \non the threat of this procedure being performed on her and she deserves \nit. She fled Togo, left behind people, and her family. She has been in \nthe United States prisons for 2 years in order to escape this \nprocedure. Women and children should not be forced to face this pain, \npotential death, and emotional scarring.\n  An amendment will be offered today to the pending immigration bill \nthat would allow female genital mutilation to be the basis of asylum in \nthis country, as well as to criminalize the act in the United States. \nWe must join other countries in legally banning female genital \nmutilation. As immigrants from Africa and the Middle East travel to \nother nations, this practice travels with them. The United Kingdom, \nSweden, and Switzerland have passed laws prohibiting this practice. \nFrance and Canada maintain that their laws will prevent this from \nhappening. The United States is faced with the responsibility, I \nbelieve, of abolishing this specific practice within its borders as \nwell as providing safe refuge for those in fear of having this torture \ninflicted upon them.\n  Mr. President, I think we should be very clear and precise in what we \nallow for asylum. I think we have been too lax in asylum cases. I do \nnot think we have had the personnel to adequately handle these cases. \nPeople come and claim political asylum, and are lost in the vast bowels \nof this country.\n  Having said that, though, I believe there is no case clearer for \ndemanding asylum than a woman or a girl saying I am here because if I \nstay in my country, they are going to rip out my genitalia.\n  This practice is brutal, systematic, and it is a cultural practice. \nIt has been endured by millions of young girls and women and its \nprevalence is just now being revealed to the world.\n  Last month, the Pulitzer Prize was given to Stephanie Welsh, a \nSyracuse\n\n[[Page S4288]]\n\nUniversity student who photographed the procedure that was being \nperformed on a 16-year-old girl in Kenya. These pictures show the world \nhow horrific and real this practice is. Many nations have made efforts \nto deter the practice with legislation. We should do the same.\n  Sudan has the longest record of efforts to combat the practice of FGM \nand has legislated against the procedure, but it has been for show \nonly: 80 percent of Sudanese women continue to be infibulated, \naccording to the 1992 Minority Rights Group report.\n  I commend Senator Simpson for his work on immigration generally and \nfor supporting me on this very important issue.\n  On one other issue before I give the floor back to the managers, it \nwas brought to my attention recently that a couple in Henderson, NV, a \nsuburb of Las Vegas, had experienced cries for legislation.\n  Mr. President, I practiced law and did a lot of domestic relations \nwork. I have been an attorney for hundreds of people who have been \ninvolved in divorce proceedings. I have been involved in many, many \ndivorce cases involving child custody. They are heart-wrenching cases, \nwhere a mother and father fight over the custody of their children. I \nhave had experiences where it is difficult to believe that parents \ncould do to their children what they do in order to spite their former \nhusband and wife, but they do it. I have had cases where custody has \nbeen awarded where I thought the judge was wrong, but I have witnessed \nhow difficult it is for a husband, wife, father and mother to lose \ncustody of their children. That is really a heart-wrenching situation.\n  But what has been one of the low points of my emotional stability has \nbeen when a father or mother steals the child and then you have this \nmother or father coming to you, saying: What am I going to do? Will I \never get to see my little girl again, or my little boy again?\n  It is a difficult divorce case in Nevada, and they run off to \nTennessee or Maine, and it is very expensive and difficult to get that \nwork out. But in the United States, with rare exception, judges from \none jurisdiction recognize the decrees of another jurisdiction, so if \nwe find where that child is in Tennessee we can bring the Nevada \njudgment and the court in Tennessee will recognize that.\n\n  What this amendment is about is when a parent takes a child to \nanother country, which happens very often--and that is what happened to \nBarbara Spierer, the mother of Mikey Spierer. What happened is her \nhusband, the father of the child, a Croatian, in the dead of the night, \ntook this child to Croatia, his place of birth, the father's place of \nbirth. It was a war-torn country. It was 1993.\n  The mother of this baby wakes up, recognizing that her child is in \nCroatia, a country that is at war. I will not go into all the details, \nbut she was finally able, after tremendous expense and exhausting \nemotions, to get her child back.\n  I believe we have to look at why that was allowed to take place. Much \nof the debate on immigration legislation involves complex issues and \narcane areas of the law. The amendment that will be offered this \nafternoon is a commonsense legislative solution to a simple but \nextremely troubling issue. The issue is an attempt by me to resolve \ninternational parental abductions. The amendment does not attempt to \nright a wrong, but it does attempt to prevent future wrongs from \noccurring. And without this amendment future wrongs will occur.\n  I have indicated the nightmare forced upon this family in Henderson, \nNV. Few would disagree that parental consent should be given before a \npassport is issued to a minor child. This problem that Barbara Spierer \nhad would not have taken place if our laws did not permit such easy \nprocurement of passports for minors, and in short what this amendment \nwill require is that both parents will have to sign before you can get \na visa granted to a child, or if not both parents the parent with the \ncustody of the child would have to sign and allow the child to get the \npassport.\n  Current law is an invitation to engage in the grossest of misbehavior \nby a scurrilous parent and usually, not for any reason that relates to \nthe child, they want to get back at the husband or the wife or the \nmother or the father.\n  I wish the situation of Barbara Spierer and her son Mikey were an \nisolated incident, but it is not. In 1994, the last year we have \nrecords, over 600 cases, over 600 cases of children abducted from the \nUnited States were reported. Thousands of parents are attempting, as we \nspeak, to bring home their children who were taken from this country by \na disgruntled mother or father.\n\n  While these cases are tracked by the State Department and by children \nadvocates, it is believed that many, many of the cases go unreported. \nSo if we have 600 reported cases, most experts believe hundreds and \nhundreds more occur every year.\n  This usually takes place where a parent has strong ties to a foreign \ncountry like the Spierer boy whose father was Croatian, but sometimes \nan American-born mother or father will take off for an unfamiliar \nnation or flee United States law.\n  I had a case where I represented the father, and he was not going to \nbe awarded those children so he just took them to Mexico and just \nbasically lived down there. I thought it was so unfair what he had \ndone, but it took us a couple years to get him to come back, and, of \ncourse, by then the children had been from their mother for almost 2 \nyears. It happens often.\n  Why does this happen so easily? Because under present law one parent \ncan procure the child's passport without the other knowing. Left-behind \nparents are faced with wading through a maze of foreign laws and \ncustoms in their efforts to secure their child's return.\n  Imagine how difficult it is to find a missing child in the United \nStates. Multiply that times 1,000 to find a missing child outside our \nborders. Finding the child is only the start. Once you find the child, \nyou have to submit yourself to the foreign country's legal system, and \nmost nations do not recognize custody orders of the United States. Even \nwhen criminal charges have been filed against the abducting parent in \nthe United States, many nations will not honor a United States request \nfor extradition. Some countries simply discriminate against women. The \ndecision to fight for a child's return consumes enormous amounts of \ntime and money. Many parents are simply without the financial \nwherewithal to engage in a protected international legal dispute, and \nthat ends it.\n  For a variety of reasons, the Government is able to do very little to \nassist these parents, and it is becoming more difficult all the time as \nthe State Department moneys are being squeezed and squeezed.\n  So I hope my amendment, which takes cost-effective steps toward \npreventing future abductions, would be adopted. It provides a series of \nchecks prior to the time of the issuance of a minor child's passport. \nBoth parents would be required to sign an application. If the child \nwere under the age of 16 or if the divorce were already granted, the \napplication would have to be signed by the parent of the child having \nprimary custody. If such a law had been in place in 1993, Barbara \nSpierer's ex-husband would not have been able to abduct Mikey to \nCroatia. The passport would not have been issued, because a written \npermission had not been given. I believe this legislation is drafted in \nsuch a manner as to give the State Department the discretion to \nimplement a reasonable and flexible rule.\n  This amendment is not just about parental rights and preventing these \ntragic international abductions. It is about protecting the rights of \nchildren. Nobody disagrees that the rights, freedoms and liberties \nprovided in our country make it the best country in the world. No child \nshould be forced to lose those rights. No American child, regardless of \nage, should be abducted to the middle of a war-torn part of the world \nor any other part of the world. American parents should not be forced \nto endure the living nightmare that Barbara Spierer was forced to go \nthrough.\n  If my amendment prevents only one family from having to endure this \nnightmare, it will be judged a success. I believe we have to pass this \namendment and the one on the terrible procedures performed on women, \nand do it as expeditiously as possible.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S4289]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, while we are waiting for some other Members \nto come to the floor and discuss their proposed amendments, let me talk \nabout an amendment which I had planned to offer but which I understand \nmay not be considered germane--it is relevant but not germane, and \ntherefore, presumably, I would not be able to offer it--but which is \nincluded in the House-passed bill and therefore will be a subject of \nthe conference committee, and, therefore, I hope our Senate colleagues \nwill be able to study and, hopefully, concur in it.\n  This is an amendment to restrict section 245(i) of the Immigration \nand Nationality Act. By way of explanation, prior to 1994, if an \nillegal alien residing in the United States became eligible for an \nimmigrant visa through a family relationship or other means, then the \nalien could adjust to lawful, permanent resident status without any \nfinancial or other penalty.\n\n  In order to obtain the visa, the alien was required to depart from \nthe United States, obtain a visa at the foreign consulate, and then, of \ncourse, return and acquire the legal status here. Section 245(i) of the \nImmigration and Nationality Act was added by section 505 of the fiscal \nyear 1995 State appropriations measure. Under this new section, an \nillegal alien who becomes eligible for an immigrant visa may adjust to \nlawful permanent status without departing the United States, but only \nif the individual pays a penalty of five times the normal application \nfee. The penalty fee is approximately $750. Some have referred to this \nas, ``buying your way in.'' Those who are wealthy enough simply pay \nthis fee, this five times the normal penalty fee, and thereby are able \nto convert an illegal status to legal status and never have to return \nhome to obtain a visa to arrive here legally.\n  Under the proposed amendment, which I will not be able to offer but, \nas I said, which is included in the House-passed version of the bill \nand which I hope our Senate conferees will look kindly upon, under this \namendment, the aliens present in the United States illegally will no \nlonger be able to stay here and buy their way into permanent resident \nstatus. They would have to return to their home country, obtain a legal \nvisa, and return just as they did prior to 1995.\n  The amendment would take effect on October 1, 1996. There are a \ncouple of exceptions that are worth noting, because we do not want to \npenalize anyone who is already here and who would be acting under \nappropriate color of law.\n  First, all aliens currently eligible for lawful permanent resident \nstatus under section 245(i) of the act may, under our proposal, upon \npayment of the full penalty fee, apply for legal status until October \n1, 1996.\n  After October 1, 1996, those aliens, and only those aliens in the so-\ncalled ``family fairness'' category, would be eligible to change their \nstatus under section 245(i). The people protected under that section \nare those under section 301 of the Immigration Act of 1990. They are \nexempt from this change.\n  Those in the family fairness category would be able to stay in the \nUnited States and would not be faced with this penalty fee. It includes \nthose children and spouses of aliens granted asylum on May 5, 1988. In \norder to be eligible, the spouse or the child must have been present in \nthe United States on that date. Those are the people who, in some way, \nwere grandfathered in, and, as a result, they would not be required to \ngo back and obtain a visa in order to obtain legal status here.\n\n  But, except for those two categories, people would no longer be able \nto buy their way into the United States. The amendment takes effect at \nthe end of the fiscal year, in order to give INS and the State \nDepartment an opportunity to adjust their resources. After September \n30, 1997, this whole section 245(i) would expire.\n  Just a word. The Immigration and Naturalization Service and the \nDepartment of State oppose the amendment, primarily on fiscal grounds \nbecause of their costs inherent in processing the visa applications. We \nare in the process of working out the possibility where a fee would be \npaid which would cover their expenses and alleviate that particular \nconcern.\n  They also pose the argument that, regardless where an illegal alien \napplies for legal status, either in the United States or a consulate in \ntheir home country, the waiting period to achieve the visa is the same. \nThe point I make, however, is that the illegal alien is already in the \nUnited States illegally and that is not something we should reward, at \nleast for those who are able to pay for it, by simply having them pay a \nspecial fine.\n  I also think what the agencies fail to appreciate is that once an \nillegal alien applies for legal status in the United States, he may be \nconsidered to be permanently residing in the United States under color \nof law, the so-called PRUCOL status. The PRUCOL standard is frequently \nused as a transitional status for aliens who are becoming permanent \nresidents of the United States. If an alien is considered under PRUCOL, \nthen that alien is eligible for numerous Federal assistance programs, \nincluding AFDC, SSI, Medicaid, unemployment insurance, housing \nassistance and other unrestricted programs. So, in this manner, aliens \nwho enter the United States illegally would be rewarded if they are \nallowed to reside in the United States while they are waiting for a \ndecision on their application.\n  The amendment I have offered but will not reask for a vote on \neliminates this reward and the accompanying drain on federally funded \nprograms by requiring illegal aliens desiring to apply for permanent \nstatus to return to their home country.\n  Just to summarize it, again, if you were here illegally, you would \nneed to go back home and get a visa to apply for permanent legal \nstatus. You would not be able to pay a five-times-the-usual-amount fee \nand thereby buy your way into the country, as they say.\n  Again, the House has adopted this. Hopefully, on the conference \ncommittee we will agree with the House proposal and we can make that \nchange in our immigration law.\n\n\n   Craig-Gorton Amendment Reforming the H-2A Temporary Agricultural \n                            Workers Program\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have filed an amendment at the desk on \nbehalf of myself and the Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton].\n  Let me start by publicly thanking my good friend, Al Simpson. The \nsenior Senator from Wyoming has been tireless in his efforts to \nmaneuver this legislation through the 104th Congress. While, I am very \nappreciative of his efforts in general, I want to address an issue that \nis of utmost importance to this country's farmers and ranchers.\n  That issue is the impact of immigration reform on the supply of \nagricultural labor. There is very real concern among Idaho farmers and \nthroughout the countryside that these reforms will reduce the \navailability of agricultural workers.\n  Farmers need access to an adequate supply of workers and want to have \ncertainty that they are hiring a legal work force. In 1995, the total \nagricultural work force was about 2.5 million people. That equates to \n6.7 percent of our labor force that is directly involved in production \nagriculture and food processing.\n  Hired labor is one of the most important and costly inputs in \nfarming. U.S. farmers spent more than $15 billion on hired labor \nexpenses in 1992--one of every $8 of farm production expenses. For the \nlabor-intensive fruit, vegetable and horticultural sector, labor \naccounts for 35 to 45 percent of production costs.\n  The competitiveness of U.S. agriculture, especially the fruit, \nvegetable and horticultural specialty sectors, depends on the continued \navailability of hired labor at a reasonable cost. U.S. farmers, \nincluding producers of labor-intensive perishable commodities, compete \ndirectly with producers in other countries for market share in both \nUnited States and foreign commodity markets.\n  Wages of U.S. farm workers will not be forced up by eliminating alien \nlabor, because growers' production costs are capped by world market \ncommodity prices. Instead, a reduction in the work force available to \nagriculture will force U.S. producers to reduce production to the level \nthat can be sustained by a smaller work force.\n\n[[Page S4290]]\n\n  Over time, wages for these farm workers have actually risen faster \nthan nonfarm worker wages. Between 1986-1994, there was a 34.6-percent \nincrease in average hourly earnings for farm workers, while nonfarm \nworkers only saw a 27.1-percent increase.\n  Even with this increase in on-farm wages, this country has \nhistorically been unable to provide a sufficient number of domestic \nworkers to complete the difficult manual labor required in the \nproduction of many agricultural commodities. In Idaho, this is \nespecially true for producers of fruit, sugar beets, onions, and other \nspecialty crops.\n  The difficulty in obtaining sufficient domestic workers is primarily \ndue to the fact that domestic workers prefer the security of full-time \nemployment in year round positions. As a result the available domestic \nwork force tends to prefer the long-term positions, leaving the \nseasonal jobs unfilled. In addition, many of the seasonal agricultural \njobs are located in areas where it is necessary for workers to migrate \ninto the area and live temporarily to do the work. Experience has shown \nthat foreign workers are more likely to migrate than domestic workers. \nAs a result of domestic short supply, farmers and ranchers have had to \nrely upon the assistance of foreign workers.\n\n  The only current mechanism available to admit foreign workers for \nagricultural employment is the H-2A Program. The H-2A Program is \nintended to serve as a safety valve for times when domestic labor is \nunavailable. Unfortunately, the H-2A Program isn't working.\n  Despite efforts to streamline the temporary worker program in 1986, \nit now functions so poorly that few in agriculture use it without \nrisking an inadequate work force, burdensome regulations and potential \nlitigation expense. In fact, usage of the program has actually \ndecreased from 25,000 workers in 1986 to only 17,000 in 1995.\n  Our amendment will provide some much needed reforms to the H-2A \nProgram. I urge my colleagues to consider the following parts of our \namendment as a reasonable modification of the H-2A Program.\n  First, the amendment will reduce the advance filing deadline from 60 \nto 40 days before workers are needed. In many agricultural operations, \n60 days is too far in advance to be able to predict labor needs with \nthe precision required in H-2A applications. Furthermore, virtually all \nreferrals of U.S. workers who actually report for work are made close \nto the date of need. The advance application period serves little \npurpose except to provide time for litigation.\n  Second, in lieu of the present certification letter, the Department \nof Labor [DOL] would issue the employer a domestic recruitment report \nindicating that the employer's job offer meets the statutory criteria \nand lists the number of U.S. workers referred. The employer would then \nfile a petition with INS for admission of aliens, including a copy of \nDOL's domestic recruitment report and any countervailing evidence \nconcerning the adequacy of the job offer and/or the availability of \nU.S. workers. The Attorney General would make the admission decision. \nThe purpose is to restore the role of the Labor Department to that of \ngiving advice to the Attorney General on labor availability, and return \ndecisionmaking to the Attorney General.\n  Third, the Department of Labor will be required to provide the \nemployer with a domestic recruitment report not later than 20 days \nbefore the date of need. The report either states sufficient domestic \nworkers are not available or gives the names and Social Security \nNumbers of the able, willing and qualified workers who have been \nreferred to the employer. The Department of Labor now denies \ncertification not only on the basis of workers actually referred to the \nemployer, but also on the basis of reports or suppositions that \nunspecified numbers of workers may become available. The proposed \nchange would assure that only workers actually identified as available \nwould be the basis for denying foreign workers.\n  Fourth, the Immigration and Naturalization Service [INS] will provide \nexpedited processing of employers' petitions, and, if approved, notify \nthe visa issuing consulate or port of entry within 15 calendar days. \nThis will ensure timely admission decisions.\n\n  Fifth, INS will also provide expedited procedures for amending \npetitions to increase the number of workers admitted on 5 days before \nthe date of need. This is to reduce the paperwork and increase the \ntimeliness of obtaining needed workers very close to or after the work \nhas started.\n  Sixth, DOL will continue to recruit domestic workers and make \nreferrals to employers until 5 days before the date of need. This \nmethod is needed to allow the employer at a date certain to complete \nhis hiring, and to operate without having the operation disrupted by \nhaving to displace existing workers with new workers.\n  Seventh, our amendment will enumerate the specific obligations of \nemployers in occupations in which H-2A workers are employed. The \nproposed definition would define jobs that meet the following criteria \nas not adversely affecting U.S. workers:\n  1. The employer offers a competitive wage for the position.\n  2. The employer will provide approved housing, or a reasonable \nhousing allowance, to workers whose permanent place of residence is \nbeyond normal commuting distance.\n  3. The employer continues to provide current transportation \nreimbursement requirements.\n  4. A guarantee of employment is provided for at least three-quarters \nof the anticipated hours of work during the actual period of \nemployment.\n  5. The employer will provide workers' compensation or equivalent \ncoverage.\n  6. Employer must comply with all applicable Federal, State and local \nlabor laws with respect to both U.S. and alien workers.\n\nThis combination of employment requirements will eliminate the \ndiscretion of Department of Labor to specify terms and conditions of \nemployment on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the scope for \nlitigation will be reduced since employers--and the courts--would know \nwith particularity the required terms and conditions of employment.\n  Eighth, our amendment would provide that workers must exhaust \nadministrative remedies before engaging their employers in litigation.\n  Ninth, certainty would be given to employers who comply with the \nterms of an approved job order. If at a later date the Department of \nLabor requires changes, the employer would be required to comply with \nthe law only prospectively. This very important provision removes the \npossibility of retroactive liability if an approved order is changed.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and avoid \nactions that would jeopardize the labor supply for American \nagriculture.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. At this time, I ask unanimous consent that \na summary of our amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Summary of the Craig-Gorton Amendment Reforming the H-2A Temporary \n                      Agricultural Workers Program\n\n       The following proposed changes to the H-2A program would \n     improve its timeliness and utility for agricultural employers \n     in addressing agricultural labor shortages, while providing \n     wages and benefits that equal or exceed the median level of \n     compensation in non-H-2A occupations, and reducing the \n     vulnerability of the program to being hamstrung and delayed \n     by litigation.\n       1. Reduce the advance filing deadline from 60 to 40 days \n     before workers are needed.\n       Rationale: In many agricultural operations, 60 days is too \n     far in advance to be able to predict labor needs with the \n     precision required in H-2A applications. Furthermore, \n     virtually all referrals of U.S. workers who actually report \n     for work are made close to the date of need. The advance \n     application period serves little purpose except to provide \n     time for litigation.\n       2. In lieu of the present certification letter, DOL would \n     issue the employer a domestic recruitment report indicating \n     that the employer's job offer meets the statutory criteria \n     (or the specific deficiencies in the order) and the number of \n     U.S. workers referred, per #3 below. The employer would file \n     a petition with INS for admission of aliens (or transfer of \n     aliens already in the United States), including a copy of \n     DOL's domestic recruitment report and any countervailing \n     evidence concerning the adequacy of the job offer and/or the \n     availability of U.S. workers. The Attorney General would make \n     the admission decision.\n       Rationale: The purpose is to restore the role of the Labor \n     Department to that of giving advice to the AG on labor \n     availability,\n\n[[Page S4291]]\n\n     and return the true gatekeeper role to the AG. Presently the \n     certification letter is, de facto, the admission decision.\n       3. DOL provides employer with a domestic recruitment report \n     not later than 20 days before the date of need stating either \n     that sufficient domestic workers are not available, or giving \n     the names and Social Security Numbers of the able, willing \n     and qualified workers who have been referred to the employer \n     and who have agreed to be available at the time and place \n     needed. DOL also provides a means for the employer to contact \n     the referred worker to confirm availability close to the date \n     of need. DOL would be empowered to issue a report that \n     sufficient domestic workers are not available without waiting \n     until 20 days before the date of need for workers if there \n     are already unfilled orders for workers in the same or \n     similar occupations in the same area of intended employment.\n       Rationale: DOL now denies certification not only on the \n     basis of workers actually referred to the employer, but also \n     on the basis of reports or suppositions that unspecified \n     numbers of workers may become available. These suppositions \n     almost never prove correct, forcing the employer into costly \n     and time wasting redeterminations on or close to the date of \n     need and delaying the arrival of workers. The proposed change \n     would assure that only workers actually identified as \n     available would be the basis for denying foreign workers. DOL \n     also interprets the existing statutory language as precluding \n     it from issuing each labor certification until 20 days before \n     the date of need, even in situations where ongoing \n     recruitment shows that sufficient workers are not available.\n       4. INS to provide expedited processing of employer's \n     petitions, and, if approved, notify the visa issuing \n     consulate or port of entry within 15 calendar days.\n       Rationale: The assure timely admission decisions.\n       5. INS to provide an expedited procedures for amending \n     petitions to increase the number of workers admitted (or \n     transferred) on or after 5 days before the date of need, to \n     replace referred workers whose continued availability can not \n     be confirmed, who fail to report on the date of need, or who \n     abandon employment or are terminated for cause, without first \n     obtaining a redetermination of need from DOL.\n       Rationale: To reduce the paperwork and increase the \n     timeliness of obtaining needed workers very close to or after \n     the work has started.\n       6. DOL would continue to recruit domestic workers and make \n     referrals to employers until 5 days before the date of need. \n     Employers would be required to give preference to able, \n     willing and qualified workers who agree to be available at \n     the time and place needed who are referred to the employer \n     until 5 days before the date workers are needed. After that \n     time, employers would be required to give preference to U.S. \n     workers who are immediately available in filling job \n     opportunities that become available, but would not be \n     required to bump alien workers already employed.\n       Rationale: A method is needed to allow the employer at a \n     date-certain close to the date of need to complete his \n     hiring, and to operate without having the operation disrupted \n     by having to displace existing workers with new workers.\n       7. Create a ``bounded definition'' of adverse effect by \n     enumerating the specific obligations of employers in \n     occupations in which H-2A aliens are employed. The proposed \n     definition would define jobs that meet the following criteria \n     as not adversely affecting U.S. workers:\n       7a. Offer at least the median rate of pay for the \n     occupation in the area of intended employment or, if greater, \n     an Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR) of 110 percent of the \n     Federal minimum wage, but not less than or $5.00 per hour.\n       7b. Provide approved housing or, if sufficient housing is \n     available in the approximate area of employment, a reasonable \n     housing allowance, to workers whose permanent place of \n     residence is beyond normal commuting distance.\n       NOTE: Provision should also be made to allow temporary \n     housing that does not meet the full set of Federal standards \n     for a transitional period in areas where sufficient housing \n     that meets standards is not presently available, and for such \n     temporary housing on a permanent basis in occupations in \n     which the term of employment is very short (e.g. cherry \n     harvesting, which lasts about 15-20 days) if sufficient \n     housing that meets the full standards is not available. \n     Federal law should pre-empt state and local laws and codes \n     with respect to the provision of such temporary housing.\n       7c. Current transportation reimbursement requirements (i.e. \n     employer reimburses transportation of workers who complete 50 \n     percent of the work contract and provides or pays for return \n     transportation for workers who complete the entire work \n     contract).\n       7d. A guarantee of employment for at least three-quarters \n     of the anticipated hours of work during the actual period of \n     employment.\n       7e. Employer-provided Workers' Compensation or equivalent.\n       7f. Employer must comply with all applicable federal, state \n     and local labor laws with respect to both U.S. and alien \n     workers.\n       Rationale: The objective is to eliminate the discretion of \n     DOL to specify terms and conditions of employment on a case-\n     by-case basis and reduce the scope for litigation of \n     applications. Employers (and the courts) would know with \n     particularity, up front, what the required terms and \n     conditions of employment are. The definition also reduces the \n     cost premium for participating in the program by relating the \n     Adverse Effect Wage Rate to the minimum wage and limiting the \n     applicability of the three-quarters guarantee to the actual \n     period of employment.\n       8. Provide that workers must exhaust administrative \n     remedies before engaging their employers in litigation.\n       Rationale: To reduce litigation costs.\n       9. Provide that if an employer complies with the terms of \n     an approved job order, and DOL or a court later orders a \n     provision to be changed, the employer would be required to \n     comply with the new provision only prospectively.\n       Rationale: To reduce the exposure of employers to \n     litigation seeking to overturn DOL's approval of job orders, \n     and to retroactive liability if an approved order is changed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3789\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk that \nseeks to protect legal immigrant children from being denied access to \nfoster care. Under the deeming provisions of this bill, children who \nwould otherwise be eligible to be placed in foster care, due to abuse \nand neglect for example, could be denied this benefit. The Murray \namendment protects these children from being forced to remain in an \nabusive situation because they are deemed ineligible to receive AFDC \nbenefits, and therefore do not qualify for foster care assistance. This \napplies to any situation which would result in the child being placed \nin a foster care, transitional living program, or adoption assistance \nunder current law.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have found ourselves on Monday in the \nearly afternoon anticipating a vote on cloture at approximately 5 \no'clock. Generally, the motion for cloture is a way to terminate debate \non a measure that is put before the body which is apparently being \nfilibustered. That means a group generally does not want the measure to \npass and, therefore, is using the rules of the Senate to frustrate, in \nthis case, 60 Members of the Senate--more than a majority--so that they \ncannot work their will.\n  Under the time-honored process, in terms of the cloture motions, we \nhave to have a 60-vote margin that says after a period of time, which \nis 30 hours, and after due notification, that the roll will be called \nand Senators will be make a judgment about whether there should be a \ntermination of the debate. Then there is a reasonable period of time \nfor amendments which have to be germane, and then there is the final \noutcome of an up-or-down vote on the matter before the Senate.\n  That was used in the early history of our country rarely but it has \nbecome more frequent in recent times. Certainly, there have been some, \ndepending on how individuals look at the matter that is before the \nSenate, justifiable reasons for that procedure to be followed.\n  Today, we are in rather an extraordinary situation because there is \nno real desire to hold up the measure that is before the U.S. Senate. \nWe are going to have a cloture vote at 5 o'clock, and then have a \ncertain number of hours to debate. There has to be a germaneness issue \nfor each of the amendments, and then there will be a certain amount of \ntime to debate those measures. And depending on the outcome of the \nrollcall, they will either be attached to the measure or not attached \nto the measure, and they will have to follow some additional rules of \nthe Senate. They will have to be germane.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Arizona, for example, that is \nrelated to the whole issue of immigration, which I find has some merit, \nis not going to be able to be considered on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate because it does not meet the strict requirements of germaneness.\n  But now we are back, Mr. President, in a situation where we have to \nask ourselves, why are we here? Why are we here? I think there are some \nvery important measures that ought to be debated and voted on. We will \nhear more about those from the Senator\n\n[[Page S4292]]\n\nfrom Florida, the Senator from Illinois, myself with regard to the \nfact, in many instances, under this legislation we are treating illegal \nimmigrants better than legal immigrants. There will be some other \namendments with regard to how we are going to treat expectant mothers \nof American citizens and how we are going to treat veterans, because \nyou can be a permanent resident alien and serve in the Armed Forces. We \nhave 20,000 of them, but under this bill, they will be shortchanged \nbecause of the hammer-like punitive provisions which have been included \nin the legislation.\n\n  So those we can debate. On those we should enter into a time \nagreement. I am certainly glad to enter into a time agreement so we can \ndispose of this measure. This legislation could have been disposed of \nin 2 days. We are in the fifth day now. We are going to conclude this \nphase of the debate on it at 5 o'clock, in the late afternoon on the \nfifth day. There is probably every probability it will go for 2 more \ndays. That will be 7 days on a bill that should have lasted no longer \nthan 2 days with relevant, germane amendments considered and those that \nI consider to be germane, perhaps not the Parliamentarian, but measures \nlike Senator Kyl's amendment should have been debated and discussed. It \nis worthwhile. We talked about those measures in the Judiciary \nCommittee during that period of time. That is virtually foreclosed.\n  So we are voting this afternoon on a cloture motion to end debate on \nthe immigration issue. Right? Wrong. Wrong. There is no filibuster on \nthat. What there is a filibuster on is bringing up the minimum wage. \nThat is what the filibuster is on. That is what the issue is. It is not \nabout closing debate on illegal immigration, even though the measure \nthat will be called up at that particular time and the proposal will be \nlet us cut off the debate on the illegal immigration. No one is \nfilibustering that.\n  What they are filibustering, by using the illegal immigration bill, \nis consideration of increasing the minimum wage for working families in \nthis country. That is what the issue is. It is not illegal immigration. \nIt is the issue about whether the Senate of the United States is going \nto be given an opportunity to vote on increasing the minimum wage 90 \ncents--45 cents a year over a period of the next 2 years--to give \nworking families a livable wage so that they can move out of poverty.\n  Respect work. We hear a great deal about how important it is we are \ngoing to honor work. We are attempting to honor work by saying men and \nwomen in our country who work 40 hours a week 52 weeks out of the year \nought to be able to have a livable wage. That has not been a partisan \nissue. We have had Republican Presidents who voted for it. George Bush \nvoted for an increase in the minimum wage. Richard Nixon voted for an \nincrease in the minimum wage. Dwight Eisenhower voted for an increase \nin the minimum wage. President Clinton will vote for it, but we are \ndenied an opportunity to even vote on it. We are denied, even when we \nhave demonstrated on other occasions that a majority of the Members, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, want it.\n\n  The American people are overwhelmingly for it. They cannot understand \nwhy the Congress of the United States cannot allocate 30 hours of its \ntime. Here we are at 3:15 on a Monday afternoon. We could take 30 \nminutes on a side and debate this and vote at 5 o'clock on the minimum \nwage issue. It is not complicated. Everyone understands what this \nprovides. It is 45 cents an hour for this year and 45 cents an hour for \nthe next year. More important, it is 8 or 9 months of groceries for a \nworking family that depends upon it. It is the utilities for 8 months \nfor a family that is working at a minimum wage level. It is the \npremiums on a health care program for a family. That is what it is. \nThat is what 45 cents an hour is. And it is the tuition for a son or \ndaughter who wants to go to a fine State university for 1 year. That is \nwhat an increase in the minimum wage is.\n  Why are we not prepared to call the roll on that issue? Why are we \nnot prepared to do it? We are not prepared to do it because we hear \nthose on the other side say, ``Well, it's going to mean a loss of a \nnumber of jobs out there.'' The interesting fact is, of those \nindividuals who are on the bottom rung of the economic ladder, 90 \npercent of them are for it. Why? Because they see a 20-percent increase \nin their wages and possibly a 5-percent reduction in the total number \nof hours they might have to work. It is a good deal for them. But our \nRepublican friends will not let us have the opportunity to make a \njudgment and a decision on that.\n  That is why, Mr. President, many of us are frustrated. We know we are \ncaught in the gymnastics of the parliamentary workings of the U.S. \nSenate. We know we are caught in that. We have a difficulty trying to \nexplain to people back home, in my State or in other States, even \nthough my State has raised the minimum wage now and has seen a \nreduction in unemployment--a reduction in unemployment.\n  It is difficult to say to the 7 million recipients of the minimum \nwage who are women, that we are not going to give the opportunity to \ndebate that or to make a judgment on that. Of the 7 million who are \nwomen, 5 million of them are adult women, 2 million of them are the \nheads of households trying to make it on the minimum wage.\n  We cannot say to the 100,000 children who would be lifted out of \npoverty with an increase in the minimum wage, ``We cannot schedule it \nin the U.S. Senate. We have just been in a quorum call for 45 minutes, \nbut we haven't got time to schedule that question about whether you get \nan increase in the minimum wage. We haven't got time. We haven't got \ntime all this afternoon.''\n  Of course we have time this afternoon. We have time tonight to do it. \nWe have time tomorrow to do it. It would not take very long because we \nunderstand the issue. It is difficult to tell those 100,000 children \nthat would move out of poverty with an increase in the minimum wage or \nthe 300,000 families that would move out of poverty, ``We haven't the \ntime to schedule this, we haven't the time. We have to spend 7 or 8 \ndays on the issues of illegal immigration in order to deny you the \nopportunity. We have to go to that extent to ensure you don't get a \nvote. Why? Because a majority of the Members of the U.S. Senate feel \nthat you should get an increase.''\n  So we take advantage of the Senate rules, their use. I do think it is \ntaking advantage of them. You are advancing interests of the companies \nand industries and corporations that refuse to pay the minimum wage. \nThat is who you are advancing and helping. People just do not \nunderstand it. They see the 30-percent increase in the salaries of \nCEO's in this country last year. They see the Senate salary increasing \nby $30,000 over the period of the last 6 years--$30,000--and yet we \nhave not had an increase in the minimum wage.\n  None of our people in here would deny themselves that kind of \nincrease. Maybe we have some Members who are not accepting the full \nincrease. We heard a great deal about that previously. Maybe they are \nnot. I apologize to them if I am mistaken. But we have not seen much \nevidence of it, of anyone not willing to take those five increases that \nCongress has had. But we are not just going to say to hard-working \nAmericans that work is that important. So we are denying it.\n  We are denying that to working people. We are denying it to children. \nWe are denying it to women. It is a women's issue. It is a children's \nissue. It is a family issue. Yet look at what we have had to go through \nhere in the U.S. Senate.\n  Let me just take a moment of time to tell you about what we had to go \nthrough here in the U.S. Senate in order to avoid--avoid--any kind of \nconsideration. Effectively, the unique situation where, unless you had \nyour amendment cleared, so to speak, by the majority and effectively \nthe majority leader, you never had a chance to get recognized around \nhere, even during the previous debate. That was an extraordinary \nsituation where the U.S. Senate, allegedly--and it is--the most \nimportant, deliberative body for public policy issues and questions, \nthere is no mistake about it, effectively it has been handcuffed, been \nhandcuffed from considering measures that these Members felt were \nimportant to have debate and discussion on and to be disposed of, as we \nhave for 200 years on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n\n[[Page S4293]]\n\n  But what did we find out last week? We found that we went through \nthis incredible kind of a trapeze act. As a result of going through \nthese parliamentary procedures, we have delayed the illegal immigration \nbill.\n  Last week we were dealing with the spectacle of a rarely used motion \nto recommit, but only to recommit to the committee of jurisdiction for \nan instant, a nanosecond, an instant, and then to report back to the \nfloor. In other words, it was a sham motion to recommit.\n  This was to avoid some Member of the Senate rising and saying, \n``Let's have 30 minutes on the increase in the minimum wage, divide the \ntime up between those who are for it and those who are opposed to it, \nand let the Senate go.'' This is the procedure that was used \neffectively by the leadership.\n  On top of the motion to recommit, there had to be two separate \namendments to fill what they call the ``amendment tree'' on one side of \nthe bill. Then back on the bill itself, Senator Dole had to maintain \ntwo amendments, a first-degree amendment and a second-degree amendment. \nTherefore, we were in the absurd position last week where Senator \nSimpson had to offer a Simpson second-degree amendment to the Simpson \nfirst-degree amendment to the Simpson motion to recommit to the \nunderlying illegal immigration bill.\n  Look at what they had to go through from a parliamentary point of \nview. So you are not going to get a chance. These are the uses and \nabuses, I would say, of Senate rules to deny what is a clear majority \nposition on an issue that has been understood, debated, discussed, and \nwhich over 80 percent of the American people support.\n  We also ended up with a Dole second-degree on illegal immigration, a \nDole second-degree to the first degree, a Dole first-degree amendment \nto the illegal immigration bill. Then after each of these amendments \nhad been adopted, we had to go through a half dozen unnecessary votes \nto adopt amendments to fill each of these slots.\n  Senator Dole had to then undo each of the amendments that had been \nadopted. So we were then in the position of Senator Simpson moving to \ntable the Simpson second-degree amendment. This is effectively the \nperson who offered the amendment trying to table or effectively remove \nhis second-degree amendment to the Simpson first-degree amendment to \nthe Simpson motion to recommit the underlying bill. After that was \ntabled, Senator Simpson was in the position of offering the Simpson \nmotion to table the Simpson first degree to the Simpson motion to \nrecommit the underlying illegal immigration bill.\n  Then when that charade had been completed, we had to readopt all of \nthe underlying first- and second-degree amendments, and then Senator \nDole had to go back and fill the tree again by adding five new \namendments.\n  Then Senator Dole has to get cloture, which some Democrats will \nsupport, some will oppose. Then, finally, there may be the chance, \nafter the cloture vote, to offer amendments on the immigration bill. \nHowever, only germane amendments will be allowed after the cloture vote \nwhen the amendment is adopted sometime tomorrow perhaps.\n  Senator Dole will then have to go through this whole process all over \nagain on the underlying bill. We will then have a Dole motion to \nrecommit, again a sham because it is only a motion to recommit for a \nnanosecond and then report back to the floor. We will have the Dole or \nSimpson first-degree amendment to the motion to the Dole motion to \nrecommit. Then we will have the Simpson or Dole second-degree amendment \nto the Simpson or Dole first-degree amendment. This is truly an \nextraordinary parliamentary procedure. Its only purpose is to avoid a \nvote on the minimum wage. The result is to delay the passage of the \nillegal immigration bill.\n  This is a matter of great importance to many of those who have spoken \neloquently and passionately about trying to deal with the problems of \nillegal immigration.\n  I have supported the essential aspects of the bill, the enhancements \nof our Border Patrol and putting in place the tamper-free cards that \nhave been the subject of so much abuse. I worked with Senator Simpson \non that issue. I know we will have a chance to revisit that because \nthere will be those who will try to strike those provisions later on.\n  But all of Senator Dole's parliamentary machinations on this bill, as \nI stated, are for the express purpose of denying Democrats their right \nto offer an amendment to increase the minimum wage.\n  So, Mr. President, we will be shut out on this particular vote prior \nto this afternoon. At 5 o'clock, we will be shut out from the \nopportunity of any debate. We are being denied an opportunity to say, \n``All right, we will not offer that measure on this particular \nlegislation, but at least give us a time in these next couple of weeks \nwhere we can get a clear vote up or down on a clean bill on the \nincrease in the minimum wage.''\n  We are denied that opportunity. There cannot be an agreement on that, \nalthough 80 percent of the American people are for that. We are left in \nthis situation where, when these other measures come up in the U.S. \nSenate, we have to, as we have for the better part of the previous \nyear, tried to offer this measure on those measures so at least we have \nthe chance of giving the Senate an opportunity to vote up or down and \nget some accountability, get some accountability in here about who is \ngoing to stand for those working families and who is against them.\n  I can understand why you would not want to be for that position \nagainst working families, even though Senator Dole and Congressman \nGingrich supported the last increase that we had on the minimum wage.\n  I can understand why they do not want to face the music on this, but \nat some time in a democracy and some time in this body, and at some \nplace here, this measure cries out for action. We are committed to try \nto get that action. That is why we, under the leadership of Senator \nDaschle, my friend and colleague, Senator Kerry, Senator Wellstone, and \nothers, have stated that we will be forced into a situation where, at \neach and every legislative opportunity, we are going to offer this \nmeasure. We do not do it, in a sense, to try and obstruct the current \nlegislative process. As we mentioned, we are at day 5 and counting on a \nmeasure, following Senate procedures. But we do not have all that \namount of time to deal with the country's business, Mr. President.\n  We have important measures. We have the budget coming up. We still \nhave important measures in the budget about determining where we are \ngoing on education. We have important measures on health care, and to \ntry and get conferees, to go to conference, to get a decent health care \nbill, which passed 100 to 0. That is important. Senator Kassebaum and \nmyself ought to be over there this afternoon trying to work out a good, \nclean measure that can go to the President's desk and be enacted, like \nthe one we passed here by 100 to 0--Republicans and Democrats. We \nshould get that passed and get it down to the President so he can sign \nit, and do something for 25 million Americans this afternoon.\n  Instead, we are over here on an amendment to an amendment to the \nmotion to recommit to proceed, denying the opportunity to do that. That \nis not the way to do the Nation's business. We ought to be about health \ncare, about increasing the minimum wage. We ought to be out here trying \nto give consideration to what we are going to do about pension reform, \ntrying get stability and protection for pension funds for working \nfamilies so they are not going to be plundered by the corporate \nraiders. We had a vote, 94-5, I think, to provide that protection. That \nlegislation had not even gotten into the doors over there in \nconference, and it was dropped so quickly, exposing those pension funds \nfor working families.\n  We ought to deal with those measures and provide additional \nopportunities for education, which is the backbone to everything this \ncountry is about, and demonstrate our priorities. We ought to be about \nthose measures and trying to close down some of the tax loopholes that \ngive preferences to moving jobs overseas, and bring good jobs back to \nthe United States. Those are the things people are talking about. \nInstead, we had a pause even in the immigration bill to go on to the \nquestion of term limits. Then, once\n\n[[Page S4294]]\n\nagain, they filled up that tree so it was not making anything \nretroactive, moving the procedures of the Senate, jamming the various \nprocedural parts of Senate rules, so that we were going to be denied an \nopportunity to address those measures.\n  So, Mr. President, it is important that even though we will come back \nat 5 o'clock to address the questions of illegal immigration, let us \nunderstand what this filibuster is about. It is a filibuster against \nthe increase in the minimum wage. That is what the issue is. That is \nwhat is wrong. That is what the Republican leadership insisted on in \norder to deprive working families that are out there working. Instead \nof respecting their work and giving them a livable wage so they can \nmove out of poverty, we are running through these gymnastics here in \nthe U.S. Senate, and we are going to continue in the next couple of \ndays dealing with legislation that should have been long since \naddressed, finalized, and on its way to conference.\n  So that is the point we have to keep repeating. There are those who \ndo not like us to keep repeating it. They wish we would not keep \nrepeating it. Those are the facts, and that is what the American people \nought to understand, because those families that are hard pressed out \nthere today and hardly able to make ends meet, we are their best hope, \nwe are their last hope. We are still being denied the opportunity to \nhelp them.\n  I look forward to the debate on a number of these issues, about \nwhether this dislocates workers. We will have a good opportunity to \nreview what happened. We spent a few moments of the Senate's time going \nback, historically, where we provided an increase in the minimum wage \nand what happened in terms of the work force.\n\n  One of the best illustrations is in my own State of Massachusetts, \nwhich saw an increase in the minimum wage in January opposed by our \nRepublican Governor up in Massachusetts. Unemployment is still going \ndown, and the debate will show that a number of other States out there \nare affected by it. We will have an opportunity to talk about the \nimpact on jobs. We will talk about what effect, if any, it has on \ninflation. Hopefully, we will have a chance to work out some process \nfor those Americans, because I find that every day that goes by that we \ndeny this institution the opportunity to express itself up or down, \npeople wonder what we are all about.\n  Why are we not addressing the real concerns of working families, \nwhich is income security, job security, pension security, education for \ntheir kids, and take an opportunity to do something about the \nincentives that exist in the Internal Revenue Code that drive good \nAmerican jobs out? That is what they want. They want us to do something \nabout our borders as well. But to take it up when we could have used \nseveral days and made progress on all those other issues, certainly we \nshould be about those measures.\n  Mr. President, I want to go into, for just a moment this afternoon, \nthe principal areas that are germane and that I think we will have to \naddress. I know Senator Graham identified some of these measures, and I \nthink they are very important, and we are going to have an opportunity \nto vote on them. We have not yet had the opportunity. We were not able \nto get these measures that were even germane and where we wanted to get \na serious vote on these measures previously because of the way that the \nfloor action proceeded. Now under the measure, when we get eventually \ntoward cloture, we will address them.\n  Let me just mention a few of these measures here this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, the first of these measures will be on looking at the \noverall legislation, what we are doing about the illegal immigration. \nFirst, if we are to make headway in the controlling of illegal \nimmigration, we need to find new and better ways to help employers \ndetermine who is authorized to work in the United States and who is \nnot. We must shut off the job magnet by denying jobs to illegal \nimmigrants.\n  As the late Barbara Jordan reminded us, we are a country of laws, and \nfor immigration policy to make sense, it is necessary to make \ndistinctions between those who obey the law and those who violate it. \nIllegal immigration takes away the jobs and lowers the wages of working \nAmerican families on the lowest rung of the economic ladder.\n  Make no mistake about it: That is happening today in many of our \ncommunities, our major cities, in a number of different geographical \nareas around the country today. The illegal immigrants that come in, \nunskilled and untrained, are exploited on the one hand and are used by \nunethical employers in so many different instances. This has the effect \nof driving wages down for real working Americans and also displacing \nthe jobs for real Americans who want to work and provide for their \nfamilies.\n  These are the working families in America that survive from paycheck \nto paycheck and can least afford to lose their jobs to illegal aliens. \nSenator Simpson and I agree on this issue. We urge our colleagues to \nsupport provisions in the bill to require pilot programs to improve \nverification of employment eligibility. These are contained in sections \n111, 112 and 113, and require the President to conduct several pilot \nprograms over the next 3 years. After that, the President must submit a \nplan to Congress for improving the current system based on the results \nof the pilot programs. This plan cannot go into effect until Congress \napproves it by a separate vote in the future.\n  The current confusing system of employment verification is not \nworking. It is too easy for people to come in legally as tourists and \nstudents and stay on and work illegally after their visas expire. It is \ntoo easy for illegal immigrants who impersonate local or even American \ncitizens by using counterfeit documents.\n  Far too often employers seek to avoid this confusion by turning away \njob applicants who look or sound foreign. This employment \ndiscrimination especially hurts American workers of Hispanic and Asian \norigin. But it harms many other Americans in the job market as well. \nSome in the Senate will seek to eliminate the provisions that Senator \nSimpson and I have placed in the bill to authorize the pilot programs \nto find new and better ways of verifying job status. Our ability to \ndeal with illegal immigration should not be derailed by misinformed and \nmisguided notions that this bill would result in Big Brother abuses, or \na national ID card. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  The pilot programs are the core reforms in this bill. Without them \nthis bill will accomplish very little in controlling illegal \nimmigration.\n  We have to deal with the job magnet. That is the key. Every study--\nthe Hesburgh studies of over 10 years ago, the Barbara Jordan studies--\nevery comprehensive review of the problems with illegal immigrants; you \nhave to deal with the job magnet. You deal with the job magnet and you \nare going to have a dramatic impact on illegal immigrants coming to \nthis country. And, if you do not, then you can put up the fence all the \nway across the southern border and fences around this country. You are \nstill not going to be able to adequately deal with this issue.\n  I support the increase in the Nation's border patrols contained in \nthe bill. I support stepped-up efforts to combat smugglers and modern-\nday slave traders who risk the lives of desperate illegal immigrants, \nand who place them in sweatshop conditions. I support increased \npenalties against those who use counterfeit documents to enable illegal \nimmigrants to pose as legal workers and take away American jobs by \nfraud. But without the pilot programs our ability to stem the tide of \nillegal immigration would be hamstrung.\n  The Immigration and Naturalization Service has limited authority to \nconduct pilot programs under current law. Under the few pilots that can \nbe conducted there will be no assurances that they would have \nsignificant impact on business. There would be no privacy protection. \nIn fact, there would be no standards at all other than those the \nImmigration Service would impose on itself.\n  This debate seems to have forgotten that since 1986 employers are \nrequired to check the documents of everyone they hire to make sure they \nare eligible to work in the United States. That means everyone--whether \nthey are citizens or not. Those who think we do not need change should \nlook at the ineffectiveness of the current system.\n\n[[Page S4295]]\n\n Job applicants can produce any of the 289 different documents to prove \ntheir identification and eligibility to work in the United States. Most \nof these documents are easily counterfeited, such as Social Security, \nor school records. Even though this bill would reduce the number of \ndocuments from 29 to 6--6 that are the most secure--there is no \nassurance that this will be sufficient.\n  So the choice is clear. We will either keep the current system with \nits flaws and limit deterrence to illegal immigration, or require the \nPresident to find a new and better way of controlling illegal \nimmigration and also avoid discrimination.\n  Second, we must retain a safety net for legal immigrant families. \nThis bill is supposed to be about illegal immigration. Title I provides \nmany needed reforms, employment verification, pilot projects, increased \nmoney for border patrols, all of which aim to control the flow of \nillegal immigrants into the country. But the welfare provisions in \ntitle II do just the opposite. They provide illegal immigrants with \nbenefits that legal immigrants cannot get.\n  Let me repeat that. Under this legislation, title II provides illegal \nimmigrants with benefits that legal immigrants cannot get, and they \nerode the safety net for legal immigrant families.\n  In the current law, as well as under this bill, illegal immigrants \nare ineligible for public assistance except where it is in the national \ninterest to provide the assistance to everyone such as preventable \ncommunicable diseases. This bill says that illegal immigrants are \nineligible for all public assistance programs except emergency \nMedicaid, school lunches, disaster relief, immunization, communicable \ndisease treatment, and child nutrition. This is the way that it should \nbe.\n\n  We want to make sure that, if the children are going to be here, they \nare going to at least get immunization so that they can effectively \nprotect other children that might be exposed when these children have \nsocial contact with each other. That makes a good deal of sense. That \nis in the public health interest. I think we ought to be doing it with \nchildren, and I support the fact we will be doing it with these \nchildren in any event. But you have to get down to the hard line of \ndollars and cents of it, which is so often the final criteria here, \nwhat makes sense from a dollars and cents point of view. But this bill \nmakes it much harder for legal immigrants to participate in these same \nprograms. The same ones that illegal immigrants qualify for \nautomatically, no questions asked, and this result is preposterous.\n  Legal immigrants play by the rules and come in under the law. They \nwork, raise their families, pay taxes, and serve in the Armed Forces. \nThey are here legally. Legal immigrants do not seek to cross the \nborder, or overstay their visas. They come here the right way. They \nwaited in line until a visa in the United States was available. And, by \nand large, they are here as the result of reunifying families--\nfamilies.\n  Legal immigrants should not have to jump through a series of hoops \nwhich do not apply to illegal immigrants. This bill discriminates \nagainst those who play by the rules. Under the current law, legal \nimmigrants have restricted access to the need-based programs--the AFDC, \nSocial Security, SSI, and food stamps.\n  Their sponsor's income is deemed under these programs. Deeming means \nthat the welfare offices consider both the sponsor's and the \nimmigrant's income in determining whether the immigrant meets the \nincome guidelines for the particular assistance for which the immigrant \nmay apply. For example, if an immigrant sponsor earns $30,000 per year \nand the immigrant earns $10,000 per year, the immigrant is deemed to \nmake $40,000 per year which pushes the immigrant above the income \nguidelines to qualify for particular assistance programs.\n  For legal immigrants, the deeming provisions in this bill affect not \nonly the AFDC, SSI, and food stamps, but every other need-based \nprogram--everything from lead paint screening for immigrant children to \nmigrant health centers, veterans' pensions, and nutrition programs for \nthe elderly. The effect of these provisions is to bar legal immigrants \nfrom receiving virtually any means-tested Government assistance. This \nbar lasts at least 5 years. The practical effect of these deeming rules \nis almost the same as banning the benefit.\n  We have seen what happens in deeming. The deeming effectively causes \ncrashing reductions in all of these programs for those that might have \notherwise been eligible.\n  For future immigrants, deeming applies for the last 40 quarters of \nwork. For immigrants who are already here, deeming applies until they \nhave been here for 5 years. This means that every program must now set \nup a bureaucracy to carry out immigration checks on every citizen and \nnoncitizen to see who is entitled to assistance. They have to find out \nif there is a sponsor.\n  Listen to this. I know that Senator Graham will speak eloquently \nabout this. But this means effectively that every city and town--\nwhether in Texas, in Florida, or in Massachusetts--is going to have to \nfind out who the sponsor is. If someone comes into a local hospital and \nneeds emergency assistance, and they say that this person is legal, \nthey are going to have to find out who that sponsor is and be able to \nget the resources from that sponsor. You and I know what is going to \nhappen. Those hospitals are going to be left holding the bag. They are \ngoing to be the major inner city hospitals. They are going to be the \nPublic Health Service clinics. They are going to be the health delivery \nsystems that deliver the health services to the neediest and the poor \nin this country. And to expect that they are going to set up a whole \nsystem to find out who is deemed and who is not deemed, and then to \nexpect that they are going to be able to collect the funds from those \nfamilies on it is absolutely beyond thinking.\n\n  Not only are the local communities and the local hospitals going to \ndo it, but the counties are going to have to do it and the States are \ngoing to have to do it. That is going to cost hundreds of millions of \ndollars. It will not be participated in by the Federal government. We \nare not sharing in that responsibility. We are not matching that 40 or \n50 or 60 percent as we do for welfare problems. Oh, no. That is going \nto be the States and the local communities. They are the ones that are \ngoing to have to set up that process to be able to judge about deeming; \nnot the Federal Government. The local communities and the schools are \ngoing to have to do it. The hospitals are going to have to do it. The \ncounties and the States are going to have to do it. They will have to \nfind out if there is a sponsor. They will have to get copies of the tax \nreturns. They will have to determine the sponsors' income, and this is \nan immense burden.\n  For example, the National Conference of State Legislatures, which \nstrongly opposes the welfare provisions, estimates that the States will \nhave to hire at least 24,000 new staff just to implement four of the \nvast number of programs that this bill would cover--24,000. Those four \nprograms are school lunch, child and adult care, social service block \ngrants under SSI, and vocational rehabilitation.\n  Simply hiring the additional staff needed to run these programs will \nresult in unfunded mandates to the States of $722 million. This is not \nthe only cost for the poor programs. Imagine the cost of States hiring \nstaff to run all of the means-tested programs.\n  We were asked earlier during the whole debate about where the \nCongressional Budget Office was. They said, ``We do not have the \nfigures on it.'' You have them now. You have the figures now. Just in \nthese four programs you are going to find it is going to be costly--\nhundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  This bill also upsets the basic values of our social service system \nafter years of community assistance. Outreach clinics, day care \ncenters, schools, and other institutions will now become the menacing \npresence because they will be seen as a branch of the INS to determine \nwho is here illegally. This is going to have a chilling effect on those \nimmigrants again that are legally here. They are going to be members of \nfamilies. They are not going to want to go out and risk getting \ninvolved in terms of the INS and put their principal sponsors at any \nkind of disadvantage.\n  We are talking primarily about the public--in this instance public \nhealth kinds of issues that have a common interest with all of us in \nmaking sure\n\n[[Page S4296]]\n\nthat their health care needs are going to be satisfactorily addressed.\n  Mr. President, there are many misconceptions about immigrants' use of \npublic assistance. Here are just a few facts.\n  The Urban Institute says that legal immigrants contribute $25 to $30 \nbillion more in taxes each year than they receive in services. That is \nalmost $2,500 per immigrant, and this figure is confirmed by almost \nevery other study. The majority of legal immigrants--over 93 percent--\ndo not use welfare as it is conventionally defined; that is, AFDC, SSI, \nand food stamps. The poor immigrants are less likely to use welfare \nthan poor native Americans. Only 16 percent of immigrants use welfare \ncompared to 25 percent of native born Americans. Working age legal \nimmigrants use welfare at about the same rate as citizens--about 5 \npercent. The only immigrant populations where welfare use is higher \nthan by citizens is by elderly immigrants and refugees on SSI. We all \nunderstand why indigent refugees need help, so the only real issue is \nelderly immigrants on SSI. We ought to address those issues.\n\n  We have seen deeming go into effect and that has a positive impact. \nThat ought to be the focus, that ought be the area where we are looking \nat various alternatives that are going to be responsive to protecting \nthe interests of the taxpayers and are humanitarian, to make sure that \npeople who are parents are going to be treated decently in our society.\n  Instead of addressing the specific problem of elderly immigrants, \nthis bill broadly restricts the eligibility of all legal immigrants for \nany governmental help.\n  When it comes to public assistance, the consequences of this bill are \nthreefold. First, it provides an inadequate safety net for legal \nimmigrants. We ask legal immigrants to work and pay taxes just like \nAmerican citizens. Immigrants must also serve in the military if they \nare called. We have more than 20,000 of them in the Armed Forces today, \na number of them in Bosnia. In fact, we expect legal immigrants to put \ntheir lives on the line for the safety of our country, but the safety \nnet we provide for them and their families in return is all but gone \nunder this bill. We expect immigrants to make the ultimate sacrifice on \nthe battlefield but under this bill America will not be there for them \nif they need medical care, school lunches for their children, or even \ntheir veterans' pensions.\n  Second, this bill passes the buck to the State and the local \ngovernments.\n  Mr. President, I have gone through that in some detail.\n  Third, this bill will be an administrative and bureaucratic nightmare \nfor Federal, State, local and private service providers. They will be \nburdened with determining which immigrants have sponsors, what the \nsponsor's income is, what the immigrant's income is, and who is \nentitled to benefits. These providers will have to do this for every \nneeds-based program from school lunches to Medicaid. That makes no \nsense.\n  Let me give you an example or two. On school lunches, teachers and \nschool officials have their hands full as they work for the education \nof children but under this bill, when school starts next September, \nevery school in America must document--listen to this--every school in \nAmerica must document whether their pupils are American citizens or \nimmigrants. Teachers must figure out whether the immigrant has a \nsponsor. The income of the sponsor must be determined before legal \nimmigrant children can get school lunches, but illegal immigrant \nchildren do not have sponsors so they get the school lunches on the \nsame basis as American citizen children.\n  Under medical care, suppose an immigrant child has a chronic medical \ncondition. The parents are legal and working but have been unable to \nget insurance. Their sponsor's income is just high enough that it \ndisqualifies the child for Medicaid under the bill so the child goes \nwithout care until her condition becomes an emergency. She runs up an \nexpensive medical bill under the emergency Medicaid for a condition \nthat could have been treated at a low cost earlier, and this result \ndoes not make any sense.\n  Child care. Like many American families, some immigrant families \nstruggle to make ends meet. They rely on child care in order to stay on \ntheir jobs. These children receiving child care are American citizens. \nBut by deeming child care programs as this bill does, it removes \nAmerican citizen children from child care programs and jeopardizes the \nemployment of their immigrant parents. That is true with regard to Head \nStart as well.\n  Finally, the United States must continue to provide the safe haven \nfor refugees fleeing persecution, yet so-called expedited exclusion \nprocedures in the legislation will cause us to turn away many true \nrefugees. Under this procedure, persons arriving in the United States \nwith false documents but who request political asylum would be turned \naway at our airports with little consideration of their claims, no \naccess to counsel, and no right to an interpreter. It is often \nimpossible for them to obtain valid passports or travel documents \nbefore they flee their home-lands. Many times, even trying to get a \npassport from their governments, the very governments that are \npersecuting them, could bring them further harm. They have no choice \nbut to obtain false documents to escape.\n\n  This reality has long been recognized under international law. In \nfact, the U.N. Refugee Convention, to which the United States is a \nparty, says governments should not penalize refugees fleeing \npersecution who present fraudulent documents or have no documents. If \nit were not for the courageous efforts of Raoul Wallenberg providing \nfalse documents to Jews fleeing Nazi Germany during World War II, many \nthousands of fleeing refugees would have had no means of escape.\n  Mr. President, we spent time on this issue. We reviewed those \norganizations, church-based, human rights-based organizations. Most of \nthem pointed out the trauma that is affecting individuals who have been \npersecuted, the distrust they have for governments even coming to the \nUnited States, their estimate that it takes anywhere from 19 to 22 \nmonths generally to get those individuals who have been persecuted, who \nhave been tortured, who have been subject to the greatest kinds of \nabuses to be willing to try and follow a process of moving toward \nasylum here in this country.\n  The idea that this is going to be able to be decided at an airport \nmakes no sense, particularly with the extraordinary progress that has \nbeen made on the issue of asylum over the period of the last 18 \nmonths--just an extraordinary reduction in the total number of cases \nand the percentage of cases because of the new initiatives that have \nbeen provided by the Justice Department and Doris Meissner.\n  Finally, there are provisions in here that can work toward \ndiscrimination against Americans whose skin is of different color and \nwho speak with different accents and languages. We have seen too often \nin the past in the great immigration debates where we have enshrined \ndiscrimination. We had the national origins quota system that \ndiscriminated against persons being born in various regions of the \ncountry, the Asian-Pacific triangle provisions that said only 125 \nindividuals from the Asian-Pacific region would come to the United \nStates prior to the 1965 act. We eliminated some of those provisions. \nBut we have always seen that if it is possible to discriminate and use \nthese laws to discriminate against American citizens as well as others, \nthat has been the case.\n  I am hopeful we can work some of those provisions out during the \nfinal hours of consideration.\n  In conclusion, I commend my colleague, Senator Simpson, for his \ncontinuing leadership on this issue. He has approached this difficult \nissue with extraordinary diligence and patience. As I have mentioned, \nduring the markup, even though we have areas of strong difference, he \nhas been willing to consider the views of each member of the committee, \nthe differing viewpoints that have been advanced in committee. He has \ngiven ample time for the committee to work its will. We had good debate \nand discussions during the markup, and in the great tradition of the \nSenate legislative process. We have areas, as I mentioned, of \ndifference but every Member of this body knows, as I certainly do, as \nthe ranking minority member, that he has addressed this with a \nseriousness and a knowledge and a belief that the positions that he has \nproposed represent his best judgment at the time.\n\n[[Page S4297]]\n\n  The comments I made in the earlier part of my statement about our \nparliamentary situation have nothing to do with his willingness to get \na strong bill through and his desire to engage in full debate and \ndiscussion on these issues and I believe any other issue that Members \nof the Senate would want to address as well.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield up to 5 minutes to my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from \nPennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the introduction of S. 1715 \nand S. 1716 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an \namendment that Senator Kyl and I will introduce on the bill that is \npending before us.\n  I appreciate the argument of the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts earlier on the minimum wage, and, in fact, I look forward \nto debating the minimum wage with the Senator from Massachusetts, \nbecause I have great concerns about the impact that this could have on \nour small business people of this country. But this is not the time to \nbring up the minimum wage issue.\n  We have been trying for years to make a better law on illegal \nimmigration. This is of great concern to my State and all of the States \nthat are absorbing so many illegal immigrants in our country, because \nour laws do not do enough to stop illegal immigration. The States that \nhave the illegal immigrant problems are absorbing so much of the costs \nof these illegal immigrants that it is time for the Federal Government \nto step up to the line and take its responsibility for closing our \nborders to illegal immigrants. That is separate from the legal \nimmigrants who have done so much to build our country, and I am very \npleased we separated those two in the bill before us today, so that \ntoday we are talking about the problem of illegal immigration.\n  The way we treat illegal immigrants reminds me of the distracted \nmother who says, ``I said maybe, and that's final,'' because when \nsomeone does violate our illegal immigration laws, in fact, there is \nhardly any penalty. They can be deported on Monday, and on Tuesday \napply for legal status. That is hardly a clear message from America \nabout our illegal immigrant laws and status.\n  So, what we are trying to do with our amendment is to say very \nclearly, if you violate the laws of America, if you come into our \ncountry without taking the proper legal steps, or if you are in our \ncountry legally and overstay a visa by as much as a year, you will be \nbarred from legal entry into our country for 10 years.\n  We have had laws that have penalized employers on the books for \nseveral years now. If we are going to say to employers we will penalize \nyou if you hire an illegal immigrant, I think we should also try \nsomething else. We should make it a penalty for the person who is \nviolating the law and coming into our country as well. Let us try a new \napproach. Let us make there be a penalty if you break this country's \nlaws. If you are a citizen of our country and you break the laws, there \nis a penalty. If you are not a citizen of our country and you break our \nlaws, there should be a penalty.\n  A 10-year ban on legal entry into our country is a penalty. It says \nto the illegal immigrant: Our laws are serious. We care about the legal \nstatus of aliens in our country. If they are legal, we welcome them. If \nthey are illegal, they are breaking our laws. They may be taking jobs \nfrom our own people.\n  We need to control our borders. We must have control of our borders. \nThat way, of course, we can make sure that we are using the assets of \nour taxpayers to help the people who are legal in our country.\n  This addresses a serious problem for border States. In 1994, the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service returned 1.1 million illegal \naliens from the United States--1.1 million illegal aliens from the \nUnited States. Of those, 350,000 were from Texas. In California, in San \nDiego alone, 490,000 illegals were returned.\n  Many of those illegal aliens are caught within 45 days more than \nonce. In fact, in San Diego, one in five apprehended in a 45-day period \nhad been apprehended once before.\n  Mr. President, that just shows you that there is not a penalty that \npeople recognize for coming into our country illegally. So now we want \nto change the accountability to the person who is breaking our laws. If \na person comes into our country and consciously violates our laws, \nthere must be a penalty for that.\n  The amendment that Senator Kyl and I are offering will say there is \nan accountability. If you decide that you are going to break the laws \nof this country, there will be a penalty and you will have to \nacknowledge that. Mr. President, this is only fair. If we do not do \nsomething to say that the borders of our country are inviolate, we are \ngoing to continue to have problems, especially on the border States \nwhere we have infrastructure costs that are sapping our taxpayers of \ntheir strength.\n  This is a Federal issue, and the Federal Government must step up to \nthe line. The amendment that we have before us today will add one more \noption for us to have to make sure that people know it is a serious \nviolation of our laws to come into our country illegally. If we are \ngoing to penalize employers, we should penalize the person who is \nperpetrating the crime.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that we can clear up the signal that we are \nsending. We welcome legal immigrants into our country; they have made a \nhuge contribution to our country. But we do not welcome illegal \nimmigrants into our country, and we must stop it. That is what this \nbill will do.\n  I want to commend Senator Simpson for the work he has done through \nthe years on this issue and Senator Kennedy, working with him, and \nSenator Kyl, one of our new Members who is from a border State who \nuniquely understands, as I do, what this costs the taxpayers of a \nborder State.\n  They are providing great leadership on this issue. We have a chance \nto do something that puts teeth into the laws of this country. I do not \nwant us to get sidetracked on issues that are not relevant to the issue \nof illegal immigration. It is too important to the economy of our \ncountry and the taxpayers of our country and to the law-abiding \ncitizens of our country.\n\n  I thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thought I would use a few moments to \noutline one of the amendments that I intend to offer once we, again, \nget to the substance of the illegal immigration bill. I will outline \nit, not knowing whether we will have a chance to offer it later this \nevening or tomorrow.\n  This amendment will be relevant to the Medicaid deeming to title II \nof the bill. My amendment exempts children, mothers, and veterans from \nthe Medicaid restrictions in the bill as long as they are legal \nimmigrants.\n  I am deeply concerned that for the first time in the history of the \nprogram, we will begin sponsor deeming for Medicaid for legal \nimmigrants. I recognize that this is a high-cost program, some $2 \nbillion, for helping legal immigrants over the next 7 years, but the \npublic's health is at stake, not just the immigrants' health.\n  The restrictions on Medicaid place our communities at risk. It will \nbe a serious problem for Americans and immigrants who live in high-\nimmigrant areas. If the sponsor's income is deemed and the sponsor is \nheld liable for the cost of Medicaid, legal immigrants will be turned \naway from the program or avoided altogether. These legal immigrants are \nnot going to go away and can get sick like everyone else, and many will \nneed help. But restricting Medicaid means conditions will go untreated \nand diseases will spread.\n  If the Federal Government drops the ball on Medicaid, our communities \nand States and local governments will have\n\n[[Page S4298]]\n\nno choice but to provide this medical care and pick up the cost.\n  In addition to veterans, my amendment exempts children and prenatal \nand post partum services from the Medicaid deeming requirements for \nlegal immigrants. The bottom line is, we are talking about children, \nlegal immigrant children who will likely become future citizens.\n  The early years of a person's life are the most vulnerable years for \nhealth. All of us are familiar with the various Carnegie studies that \nhave been out in the last 3 years which reinforce that, if there was \never any question about it.\n  If children develop complications early in life, complications which \ncould have been prevented with access to health care, society will pay \nthe costs of a lifetime of treatment when that child becomes a citizen. \nChildren are not abusing Medicaid. When immigrant children get sick, \nthey infect American citizen children.\n  The bill we are discussing today effectively ensures that children in \nschool would not be able to get school-based care under the early and \nperiodic screening, detection, and treatment program. This program \nprovides basic school-based health care.\n  Under this bill, every time a legal immigrant goes to the school \nnurse, the nurse will have to determine if the child is eligible for \nMedicaid. This bill turns school nurses into welfare officers. The end \nresult is that millions of children will not receive needed treatment \nin early detection of diseases.\n  Consider the following example: A legal immigrant child goes to her \nschool nurse complaining of a bad cough. The nurse cannot treat the \nchild until it has been determined that she is eligible for Medicaid. \nMeanwhile, the child's illness grows worse and the parents take her to \na local emergency room, where it is discovered that the little girl has \ntuberculosis. That child has now exposed all of her classmates, \nAmerican citizen classmates, to TB, all because the school nurse was \nnot authorized to treat the child until her Medicaid eligibility was \ndetermined.\n  Or consider a mother who keeps her child out of a school-based \nprogram because she knows her child will not qualify for the program. \nThis child develops an ear infection, and his teacher notices a change \nin his hearing ability. Normally, the teacher would send the little boy \nto the school nurse, but she cannot in this case because he is \nineligible for Medicaid. The untreated infection causes the child to go \ndeaf for the rest of his life.\n  In addition to the basic school-based health care programs, it also \nprovides for the early detection of childhood diseases or problems such \nas hearing difficulties, even lice checks.\n  Prenatal and post partum services to legal immigrants must also be \nexempt from the Medicaid deeming requirements. Legal immigrant mothers \nwho deliver in the United States are giving birth to children who are \nAmerican citizens. These children deserve the same healthy start in \nlife as any other American citizen.\n  In addition to providing prenatal care, it has been proven to prevent \npoor birth outcomes. Problem births, low-birth-weight babies, and other \nproblems associated with the lack of prenatal care can increase the \ncost of delivery up to 70 times the normal cost. According to a Baylor \nUniversity Hospital report in 1994, the cost for the delivery of babies \nwhere there has been prenatal care averages $1,000; those without \nprenatal care over $2,000. That is double the cost.\n  In California, the common cost of caring for a premature baby in a \nneonatal unit is $75,000 to $100,000. The lack of prenatal care can \nresult in developmental disabilities, chronic problems for American \ncitizen children. Many children in such circumstances end up costing \nthe taxpayer $40,000 to $100,000 annually to cover medical and special \neducation needs.\n  Many things can go wrong during pregnancy and in the delivery room. \nMany more things will go wrong if the mother has not had adequate \nprenatal care. Without prenatal care, we will allow more American \ncitizen children to come into this world with complications that could \nhave been prevented.\n  This is not an expensive amendment. According to CBO, the cost of \ncare for children and the prenatal care services is less than the cost \nfor elderly persons, whose Medicaid eligibility would continue to be \nrestricted under this amendment. Furthermore, the cost of providing a \nhealthy childhood to both unborn American citizens and legal immigrant \nchildren is far less than the cost to society of treating health \ncomplications at delivery and throughout the lives of these children.\n  Finally, many legal immigrants serve in the Armed Forces. Many have \nfought and even evidenced their willingness to sacrifice their lives \nfor the Nation. How would we reward this sacrifice under this bill? By \nmaking it harder for them and their families to receive benefits. We \nshould hold these people as heroes. Instead, we will not ensure their \nfamilies receive basic medical services upon their return to the States \nfrom duty. Most veterans benefits are means tested.\n  If the sponsor-deeming provisions in the bill are applied to the \nveterans benefits, some veterans will find themselves ineligible for VA \nbenefits because their sponsor makes too much money, and they are too \npoor to purchase health insurance. My amendment allows these veterans \nto receive the health care they need under Medicaid.\n  Mr. President, the fact of the matter is, we should, in this \nparticular proposal, support the care for expectant mothers because it \nis the right thing to do. We ought to be supporting the care for the \nchildren because it is the right thing to do. These children did not \ncause the problem with illegal immigration. It may be their father and \ntheir mother, their parents. Why did their parents come here? To get \njobs. We ought to be able to deal with that aspect of the problem \nwithout taking it out on the children.\n  It seems to me it is that simple. I mean, why are we taking it out on \nthe children? Why are we being bullies to children when we know what \nthe real facts are? We have to deal with the issues of jobs and the \nmagnet of jobs, deal with those issues.\n  This measure that is before us has programs to try to do that by \nenhancing the Border Patrol and by the other pilot programs and the \nother aspects which Senator Simpson outlined in terms of tamper-proof \nwork cards. But the fact of the matter is, Mr. President, when we come \non down on legal--legal--American children and put all kinds of blocks \nin their way in order to be able to obtain essential kinds of services \nthat will protect their health and their fellow children's health, who \nare American citizens, it just makes no sense at all. It is hardhearted \nand cruel.\n  Mr. President, at the appropriate time I will offer that amendment. I \nhope the Senate will support it.\n  Mr. President, I will just take a few moments now, as we are coming \ndown to 4:20, where we are reminded once again that the real filibuster \nis not on the issue of the illegal immigration bill--we are on day 5 \nand counting on that issue. There are many of us who would like to move \ntoward being able to offer amendments. I have outlined one. Senator \nGraham, others, Senator Feingold, and Senator Abraham have other \namendments.\n  We will have an opportunity to do that in the very near future. But \nwe are on day 5, with perhaps 2 more days on this bill, when actually \nthe real reason that we are spending 5 to 7 days on it is so we will \navoid the consideration of the increase in the minimum wage.\n  It is as plain as that. I outlined earlier during the course of the \nday the various gymnastics that we have gone through to try to get a \nvote on the minimum wage or at least to get a time certain to consider \nthe minimum wage.\n  Mr. President, I will just take a few moments of the Senate's time \nnow to mention and include in the Record some of the religious leaders' \nsupport for the minimum wage reflecting the broad religious community \nthat recognizes this as a moral issue, out of respect for individuals \nand their willingness to work, and also for their necessity to provide \nfor children and the essential aspects of life. They believe this is a \nmoral issue, to make sure that working families are going to have \nsufficient resources to be able to provide for themselves with a sense \nof dignity as children of God.\n  So, Mr. President, we have discussed some of the economic issues \nearlier and also some of the other reasons for increasing the minimum \nwage. I find it so difficult to explain to people in my\n\n[[Page S4299]]\n\nState and around this country why we should not raise it for families \nthat are working, playing by the rules, trying to provide for their \nfamilies and escape poverty.\n  I find it, particularly when we have a majority of the Members of the \nSenate that support that measure, difficult to comprehend why we \ncontinue to go through these gymnastics here on the floor of the Senate \nto pretend that there is a filibuster on illegal immigration, when the \nreal filibuster is on the minimum wage. That is what the real \nfilibuster is. If we were able to get a vote on that, I do not know why \nthere would not be an early disposal of the underlying measure. That \nwas true last week. But nonetheless, Mr. President, let me just speak \nbriefly to this issue.\n  Assuring that hard-pressed minimum wage workers get the 90-cent \nincrease they deserve is not a mere tussle for political advantage or \nan abstract debate over economics. The right to earn a living wage and \nsupport a family lies at the heart of this Nation's commitment to \nbuilding and maintaining a moral society.\n  At its core, the struggle for a higher minimum wage is a battle over \nmorality--a struggle over family values.\n  There are some who would have us believe that there are two types of \nfamilies in America--the responsible and the ripoff artists. One kind \nof family works hard and plays by the rules. The other kind runs wild \nand lives off the dole. But the facts are quite different. Almost all \nfamilies work. Single mothers with small children are working. Fathers \nare working, often at two jobs or even three jobs. Most poor families \nwork. Most immigrant families work. Most families on food stamps work. \nAnd millions of Americans working today at the minimum wage--a minimum \nwage that has reached its lowest buying power in 40 years--are working \nand living in poverty.\n  These Americans are our neighbors and friends. They sit at the \nkitchen table at night, figuring out how to pay this month's bills. \nThey pray their kids do not get sick, because the doctor bills are \ngetting more expensive each year. They are not on welfare, although \nsome come perilously close. Some may even have depended on it for a \ntime in a crisis, but now they wake up early in the morning, bundle \ntheir children off to day care or a relative, and spend their days \ntending for our parents in nursing homes, caring for our children in \nday care centers, sweeping floors and cleaning carpets in our offices, \nand making clothes that they often cannot afford themselves.\n  These families are doing what we have asked them to do. They are \nworking. They are contributing to our society. They are not asking for \na handout. They are asking for what any decent society should provide: \nA living wage that will adequately support a family.\n  A moral society cannot ask its citizens to work 40 hours a week and \nstill relegate them to live in poverty. A moral society cannot ask its \ncitizens to work 40 hours a week and then leave them to watch their \nchildren go hungry. A moral society cannot ask its citizens to work 40 \nhours a week and then deny them the ability to support a family without \nrelying on the charity of others. Surely, that is not family values.\n  To those who claim to support family values but oppose this 90-cent \nincrease in the minimum wage, I urge you to listen to a sampling of \nletters I have received from the religious leaders of our Nation who \nhave spoken out in support of a higher minimum wage.\n  This letter comes from the Most Reverend William Skylstad, the Bishop \nof Spokane, chair of the domestic policy committee of the U.S. Catholic \nConference:\n\n       Dear Senator: The United States Catholic Conference, the \n     public policy agency of the Catholic bishops, supports the \n     efforts to raise the minimum wage. I urge you to support \n     legislation that helps restore the minimum wage to a living \n     wage that respects the dignity of workers and recognizes the \n     economic realities facing low-income families.\n       Work has a special place in Catholic social thought it is \n     more than just a job, it is a reflection of human dignity and \n     way to contribute to the common good. Most importantly, it is \n     the ordinary way people meet their material needs and \n     community obligations. In Catholic teaching, the principle of \n     a just wage--a living wage--is integral to our understanding \n     of human work. Wages must be adequate for workers to provide \n     for themselves and their families in dignity. Our bishops' \n     Conference has supported the minimum wage since its \n     inception.\n       Recently, the bishops pointed out in their statement, \n     ``Putting Children and Families First,'' that ``decent jobs \n     at decent wages--what used to be called a `family wage'--are \n     the most important economic assets for families.'' As \n     pastors, the bishops see the tragic human and social \n     consequences on individuals, their families, and society when \n     workers cannot support dignified lives by their own labor. \n     The minimum wage needs to be raised to help restore its \n     purchasing power, not just for the goods and services one can \n     buy but for the self-esteem and self-worth it affords.\n       People of goodwill can and will differ over specific \n     economic arguments. The U.S. Catholic Conference believes, \n     however, that the technical economic debate should not \n     overshadow the pressing human concern and moral question of \n     whether or not our society will move toward a minimum wage \n     that reflects principles of human dignity and economic \n     justice. We renew our support for an increase in the minimum \n     wage.\n\n  Another letter comes from Kay Dowhower of the Evangelical Lutheran \nChurch in America:\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Evangelical Lutheran Church \n     in America, I urge you to support legislation that raises the \n     minimum wage.\n       The church is committed to adequate income and believes \n     that vast disparities of income and wealth are both divisive \n     of the human community and demeaning to its members. \n     Unfortunately, the United States has the largest wage gap of \n     any industrialized country. The fact that the minimum wage \n     has dropped to its lowest level in 40 years only exacerbates \n     the problem.\n       This church also believes that making it possible for \n     people to move from welfare to work is important. Work is \n     important because employment is a means by which people \n     become contributing participants in society. However, moving \n     welfare recipients into employment is hindered in a labor \n     market increasingly dominated by low-wage, part-time or \n     temporary jobs that cannot support a family. A single mother \n     with two children who works full time at $4.25 per hour will \n     find that her family remains nearly 30 percent below the \n     federal poverty level.\n       We urge an immediate supportive vote on an increase in the \n     minimum wage.\n\n  This is a letter from Dr. Thom White Wolf Fassett of the Methodist \nChurch:\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the General Board of Church and \n     Society, the social justice advocacy agency of the Methodist \n     Church, I strongly urge you to support S.413. This \n     legislation . . . will aide the minimum wage to $5.15 over \n     two years. By increasing the minimum wage, Congress will send \n     a message to the American people that it is addressing the \n     growing wage gap between the rich and the poor as well as the \n     increasing economic anxiety.\n       The Book of Resolutions of The United Methodist Church \n     represents the social justice position of our approximately 9 \n     million [member] denomination. Our policy clearly states, ``. \n     . . we have the obligation of work with others to develop the \n     moral foundation for public policies which will provide every \n     family with minimum income needed to participate as \n     responsible and productive members of society.'' Raising the \n     minimum wage would help those at the bottom of our society \n     meet their family needs.\n       It has been nearly seven years since the federal minimum \n     wage has increased. The buying power of the minimum wage will \n     soon reach it lowest level since 1955, when the minimum wage \n     was 75 cents an hour. Nearly 60 percent of the workers who \n     would benefit from an increase are women. Nearly two-thirds \n     are adults struggling to support families, as opposed to the \n     stereotype of a teenager flipping hamburgers.\n       Again, I urge you to vote for the passage of S. 413. It \n     tells people working at the minimum wage that their work is \n     important and appropriately rewarded.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I commend the Senator from Massachusetts for bringing to \nthe attention of the Senate the thousands of pieces of correspondence \nthat have been coming into our offices over the last several weeks as a \nresult of the leadership by the able Senator from Massachusetts. It is \nclear that this has resonated. The letters that the Senator from \nMassachusetts is reading are indicative, I think, of the correspondence \nthat comes in on the e-mail, that comes in on fax machines, that comes \nin through the regular mail routes.\n  I think that the Senator does a real service to the Senate in sharing \nthose with us. I know he has a number of others, and I do not want to \npreclude him from finishing what has been a very informative and \nhelpful session, but I do believe, and I ask the Senator from \nMassachusetts whether he shares the view, as this issue becomes better \nunderstood and as it becomes clear to the American people just what \nthis is all\n\n[[Page S4300]]\n\nabout, there appears to be a momentum that has been brought to this \ndebate that I did not witness before, given the increase in the number \nof letters and pieces of correspondence we have received.\n  Has it been the experience of the Senator from Massachusetts that the \nnumber of letters that have come in on this in recent days has actually \nincreased?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Very much so, Senator, not only in the volume but also \nin the support that is out there from virtually the unanimous Judeo-\nChristian community. As the Senator knows, the principal debate that we \nhave around here on the increase in the minimum wage is what its \nimpacts will be on the economy and what will be the impact in terms of \njobs and job losses.\n  As the Senator is a strong supporter of the increase, he knows we \nhave addressed those and will welcome the opportunity to address them \nin the debate. I find so moving the fact that here are the \nrepresentatives of the great Judeo-Christian ethic--really, of most of \nthe great religious groups in our country that are talking about this \nas a moral issue.\n  I think none of us, perhaps, want to be out here putting forward that \nwe have the moral position on a particular issue, and we can all \nunderstand that all of us have differing views about it. We respect \neach other's differing views. What I found very, very powerful is the \nunderlying, continuing, strong, strong, overwhelming support, \noverwhelming support of the religious groups across the spectrum, what \nmight be considered some of the most conservative of the various \nreligious groups--others, as well--that are uniformly, universally and \nstrenuously urging, on the basis of the dignity of the individual, the \ndignity of the family, the dignity of work, the dignity of service in \nthe human condition, that this is a moral issue of importance and \nvirtually every one of the various churches, through their own means \nand mechanisms, have virtually gone on record in terms of the support \nfor this measure.\n  I appreciate the Senator's comments. I ask the Senator a question \nmyself. As we move now 20 minutes away from the cloture vote, would he \nnot agree with me that the Senate is not in a filibuster about illegal \nimmigration, but basically we are in a filibuster on the minimum wage. \nI tried to point out that we are in day No. 5 now on the questions of \nillegal immigration. Most of us have supported the increase in the \nBorder Patrol, although there has been some difference on the various \npilot programs being developed to try and deal with the issues of jobs \nand the job-pull issue and amending the various numbers of cards to \nmake them tamperproof and other factors.\n  Would the Senator not agree with me, as he is the Democratic leader, \nI do not detect that there is a desire of any Member on our side to \nhave a filibuster. We are prepared to address those issues in a timely \nway and move forward. That we are here this evening on a procedural \nvote to close down the debate is really about the unwillingness of the \nmajority to permit a simple vote on the increase in the minimum wage, \nan issue which more than half of the Senate has indicated they wanted \nto address and that they did support.\n  Does the Senator, as a leader and as someone who knows the Senate \nwell, find it a rather extraordinary circumstance where most Americans \nsay, ``They are voting on a filibuster on illegal immigration; why are \nthey doing that when that really has nothing to do with it at all''?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am pleased to be able to respond to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, that was really the reason I wanted to come out, to \naddress that very point. Obviously, there are some of our Republican \nfriends who would like to make this current debate out to be a choice \nbetween having a vote on minimum wage or having a debate on minimum \nwage and having an opportunity to vote on immigration. That is a false \nchoice, as the Senator knows.\n  There is absolutely no desire on the part of our Democratic \ncolleagues to hold up the vote on the very legitimate question of how \nwe address more effectively illegal immigration in this country. That \nis the purpose of the bill. I have heard the Senator from Massachusetts \nsay on several occasions we could complete work on that bill in a day \nand a half. There was not any need to extend out this debate. There was \nnot any need to fill parliamentary trees in an elaborate fashion to \ndeny the opportunity to raise these questions.\n  We were prepared to vote on minimum wage with a half hour of debate. \nWe could have done it last week. That was not done. So it is a false \nchoice.\n  The false choice is that we are being told it is either one or the \nother. Well, they can delay a vote on minimum wage, but they cannot \ndeny it. Sooner or later, this Senate will have the opportunity, as we \nknow we must, to vote on this moral issue of minimum wage, to vote on \nthis very important, critical opportunity to provide people with a \nworking wage, a realization that it is those economic pressures that \ndrive families apart and give them the kind of extraordinarily \ndifficult challenges that they have to face on a daily basis, because \nthey do not have the economic wherewithal to pay their bills on rent, \ngroceries, heat, and all of the things that every one of us face.\n  So this is a moral issue. The Senator is absolutely right to point \nthis out so ably and eloquently as he has. So it is not a choice we are \nwilling to accept. It is a false choice. We will vote on immigration. \nWe will vote for cloture this afternoon on the amendment. We will \nensure that we get to the key issues relating to how we resolve the \ndifferences we have with regard to illegal immigration. We will vote on \nthat, and, ultimately, we will have our vote on one of the most \nimportant moral and family issues of the day--minimum wage.\n  So I only answer the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts that we \nrecognize the importance of this bill. We recognize the importance of \ngetting on with a debate about the amendments pending, and we will do \nthat. And one day we will have our vote on minimum wage as well. If it \nis not today, it will be tomorrow, this week, or next week. But we will \nhave our vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the leader for that reassurance, because it has \nbeen under his leadership that this issue has come forward, and his \nstrength and resolution has to be a reassurance to working families. We \nwill be in the situation now, Mr. President, as the leader knows, where \nwe will have cloture and we will have the time to dispose of amendments \nthat will be related. We have some important ones. Then what happens is \nwe will have a vote on cloture sometime in the next day or day and a \nhalf. And then that does not even end the bill. Then the bill will be \nopen to further amendment. So we will have an opportunity to offer the \nminimum wage. But I will bet that the majority leader, or the \nspokesman, would try effectively to fill up the tree again, and then \nthey will put cloture on that, and we will have to deal with that \nparticular issue.\n  All that time--would the Senator not agree with me--we could have \ndisposed of this issue and moved forward with it, and still we are \nbeing effectively denied. Does the Senator not agree with me, as the \nminority leader, he at least would do the best he could to find time \nthat would not interfere with other kinds of scheduled legislative \nmatters, so that we could have a fair debate in representing our side, \nto ensure that there would be a fair, but limited, debate on this, so \nthat at least we could move this issue, which has been supported by a \nmajority of Republicans and Democrats alike, through the Senate and \nmove that process forward so there could be focus and attention on the \nHouse? I note that the House failed to realize that, but not by all \nthat number of votes, in recent time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I respond to the Senator that, yes, indeed, we would be \nprepared to enter into any short time agreement. We would not have to \nhave amendments. We have had the opportunity to debate this issue, to \ntalk about it. In 1990, when this issue came to the Senate floor, the \noverwhelming majority of Democrats and Republicans voted for an \nincrease in the minimum wage, overwhelmingly. It was, ironically, the \nsame amount of money we are talking about now.\n  Now, unfortunately, we have lost more purchasing power than at any \ntime in the last 40 years. We are forced, again, to face the issue. How \ndo we address it if we cannot put it on a calendar in a way that will \naccommodate a bill in normal parliamentary circumstances? We have no \nrecourse but\n\n[[Page S4301]]\n\nto offer it as amendments. That is what we will do. We will keep doing \nit, whether it is on immigration or any one of a number of other bills.\n  Certainly, we would be prepared to enter into any time agreement that \nwill accommodate the schedule of our Republican colleagues, as well as \nthe legislation pending.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for those assurances. We have all \nheard them expressed at different forums, but stating it here on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate so all Americans and our colleagues can \nunderstand it is about as clear and fair a position on what he is \nprepared to do as it can be. The assurance that we are going to keep \ncoming back to this issue is, I think, very reassuring for working \nfamilies.\n  I just ask, finally, of the Senator--and I will make some brief \ncomments, because I see my friend and colleague on the floor here. It \nhas been interesting to me--I know the Senator has been following this \nissue--that we have not had, since 2 o'clock or so, or even before that \nduring the morning--one Senator that has come out to the floor and \nsaid, ``No, we should not vote for cloture.'' There has not been one \nthat said, ``No, do not go ahead on that.'' The silence is deafening on \nthis matter.\n  We are back into this sort of sham process and procedure, which \neffectively denies working families the kind of increase that they \nneed. I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  I just mentioned to the Senator that I will include in the Record an \nexcellent statement from Jane Motz at the American Friends Service \nCommittee, a letter from Timothy McElwee, and a letter from Michael \nNewmark.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator: We are writing to urge you to vote in support \n     of raising the minimum wage. . . . This is crucial to the \n     livelihood of millions of people who, through changes in \n     global economic processes over which they have no control, \n     are finding it increasingly difficult to support their \n     families.\n       The American Friends Service Committee is a Quaker \n     organization committed to social justice, peace, and \n     humanitarian service. Our experience has shown us the \n     incredible hardships and suffering caused by poverty, as well \n     as the disproportionate numbers of women, people of color, \n     and children living in poverty. The decline in the real value \n     of the minimum wage is a major factor in the ever-widening \n     gap between the rich and poor in this country. The value of \n     the current minimum wage is at its lowest in 40 years, and \n     the United States now has the largest gap in wage levels of \n     any industrialized country.\n       Raising the minimum wage to $5.15 per hour is a much-needed \n     step toward addressing these inequities. It would provide \n     relief for 4 million families trying to survive on the \n     current minimum wage, as well as for 8 million more who work \n     now for less than $5.15 per hour. . . . Such an increase can \n     only help those who are struggling to feed their families. It \n     is all the more crucial in light of current budget cuts that \n     will reduce access to social services in times of need.\n       We urge you, therefore, to adopt an increase in the minimum \n     wage to $5.15.\n                                                        Jane Motz,\n     American Friends Service Committee.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       Dear Senator: The Church of the Brethren is very concerned \n     about the growing gap between the rich and the poor in this \n     country, the largest wage gap of any industrialized country. \n     Sixty-nine percent of minimum wage workers are adults, not \n     teenagers, and women comprise sixty percent of minimum wage \n     workers. At a time when Congress seeks to limit the time \n     during which a person may receive welfare, it is \n     counterproductive and dangerous to force people into jobs \n     that pay $4.25 an hour. A single mother of two children who \n     earns this wage finds that her family is trapped nearly \n     thirty percent below the federal poverty level. The minimum \n     wage must be raised to ensure that families can support \n     themselves with adequate food, shelter, clothing, and health \n     care.\n       The Church of the Brethren 1988 General Board Resolution \n     states that we must ``work for public policies at the \n     federal, state, and local levels that would provide wages \n     that enable persons to live in dignity and in freedom from \n     want.''\n       Please vote in favor of raising the minimum wage and \n     support those who work hard to sustain their families.\n                                               Timothy A. McElwee,\n     Church of the Brethren.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Jewish Community \n     Relations Advisory Council, we urge you to support upcoming \n     legislation to increase the minimum wage. The NJCRAC is the \n     national coordinating and advisory body for the 13 national \n     and 117 community agencies comprising the field of Jewish \n     community relations. . . . Consistent with long-standing \n     NJCRAC policies regarding poverty and welfare reform, we have \n     supported legislative proposals which enable individuals to \n     move from dependency to economic self-sufficiency, including \n     an increase in the minimum wage.\n       Erosion in wages, especially for low-paying jobs, is a \n     major factor underlying persistent poverty and a steadily \n     widening income gap. Adjusted for inflation, the value of the \n     minimum wage has fallen nearly 50 cents since 1991, and is \n     now 27 percent lower than it was in 1979. As a result, the \n     income of a worker in a full-time, year-round minimum wage \n     job is not sufficient, at the present time, to sustain a \n     family of three above the Federal poverty level.\n       For these reasons, the NJCRAC urges you to support \n     legislative action to increase the minimum wage.\n\n                                       Michael Newmark, Chair,\n\n                                         National Jewish Community\n                                       Relations Advisory Council.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, that has been the ongoing and enduring \ntheme of each one of these measures, which are typical, and it is \nexpressed so well in those simple words that all of the great religions \nhave stated clearly--that they believe this increase in the minimum \nwage is a moral issue. The basic reason for it is that we must ``work \nfor public policies at the Federal, State, and local levels that would \nprovide wages that enable persons to live in dignity and in freedom \nfrom want.''\n  That says it all, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to take a minute or two \nbecause I have heard the arguments about minimum wage for 20 years now. \nAs a matter of fact, when I was chairman of the Labor Committee, or \nranking member to the distinguished former chairman, Senator Kennedy, \nwe got into a lot of battles over minimum wage.\n  I come at it maybe from a different perspective. I understand that \nSenator Kennedy believes he is fighting hard for poor people. I commend \nhim for the efforts he has made through the years to do that. I have a \nlot of respect for some of the things he has done. On the other hand, I \nfeel that many things he has argued for have been detrimental to poor \npeople.\n  I was raised in an environment where I knew what it was really like \nto be hungry, to not have quite enough food. We did not have indoor \nfacilities in our home when I was raised in the early years. Gradually, \nmy dad was able to, by fighting and scratching, get us indoor \nfacilities. But I can remember that, as a high school kid, I had to \nwork my way through high school. I did not have a chance. If I could \nnot have earned money going to high school, I do not know that I could \nhave finished. I had to work my way through college and law school. In \ncollege, I was a janitor. I earned 65 cents an hour. I was so grateful \nfor that job, I cannot begin to tell you. I was grateful in high school \nto work in a gas station where I worked very hard. I was captain of the \nbasketball team. I would go to basketball practice, and afterward I \nwould go work in the gas station so that I could buy some of the shoes \nand clothes that I had to have to be able to just go to school. But I \nnever had the clothes most of the kids in that school district had.\n  As a matter of fact, we lived in the poor end of the borough. There \nwas a very wealthy end of the borough. So I really saw the contrast \nbetween those who were wealthy and those who were poor.\n  I have to tell you. Speaking for those who maybe do not have the \nskills and do not have the opportunities that others had, every time \nthe minimum wage goes up those people are left in the cold. And there \nare hundreds of thousands of them that are left in the cold because \npeople just simply will not pay the higher minimum wage. They will do \nwithout the people, or they will quit their businesses. That happens \nall over America. You cannot ignore it.\n  It would be far better for us to find other mechanisms than a phony \nmechanism that raises the floor so that those in the union movement can \nmake higher demands at the top. This has been a fiction for years. If \nthe minimum wage goes up 10 percent or 15 percent, then the unions come \nin and say, ``We deserve 10 or 15 percent.'' We wonder why we have \nthese intermittent but very sustaining cycles of inflation.\n  It would be far better to do other things for the poor and for those \nwho\n\n[[Page S4302]]\n\nare at that lower end of the ladder. As we all know, not many total \nsupporters of their households are on minimum wage. For a lot of these \nkids that take these minimum-wage jobs, it is only a matter of time \nuntil with the incentives and with their own desires to get ahead that \nthey can move on, having acquired some skills for jobs that pay more \nthan the minimum wage. That is what really has happened.\n  I do not want to continue this debate because I know that the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts is very sincere, and I commend \nhim for that. But all the sincerity in the world does not make it \nnecessarily right.\n  I would like to put it in the Record, but at this particular point \nlet me just make a few comments from the Wall Street Journal editorial \ntoday.\n  It said:\n       It is true that it's now possible to get a few economists, \n     including a couple of Nobel laureates such as Robert Solow, \n     to stand up in public and advocate a higher minimum wage. \n     This is supposed to reflect a study or two that fetched up no \n     job losses from higher minimums; our own suspicion is that it \n     has much more to do with the intellectual bankruptcy of the \n     Democratic Party such economists largely support. As the \n     symposium on this page last week demonstrated, the general \n     consensus of the profession remains firm.\n       James Buchanan, the 1986 laureate for his work on public \n     choice, said it best: ``The inverse relationship between \n     quantity demanded and price is the core proposition in \n     economic science.'' To assert that raising the minimum wage \n     would actually increase employment, he continued, ``becomes \n     equivalent to a denial that there is even minimal scientific \n     content in economics.'' Merton Miller, a 1990 laureate for \n     work on capital markets, asks of the notion that a minimum \n     wage boost is costless, ``Is all this too good to be true? \n     Damn right. But it sure plays well in the opinion polls. I \n     tremble for my profession.''\n\n  The fact of the matter is that the article goes on to point out that:\n\n       The minimum wage, however, points all of the incentives in \n     the wrong direction. Yes, some Republicans have themselves \n     defected for their own personal reasons, and it's conceivable \n     that if the GPO resists, the increase will pass. But so what? \n     It is more important that the Republicans start to assert \n     principles, as they did when they dominated the Congress and \n     the national discussion. That is, they need to get the ball \n     and go back on the offensive.\n       What the public above all wants is for politicians to stand \n     for something, to give voters a clear choice. Our own view is \n     that voters are pretty smart, and can understand the doleful \n     effect of minimum wages if someone starts to explain it to \n     them. If Republicans do this, we predict, they will come back \n     next year with plenty of votes not only to roll back any \n     increase but end the minimum wage charade once and for all.\n\n  Those are harsh words, but I think they are true and accurate.\n  Frankly, I think we have to get back to the real bill at hand, and \nthat is the illegal immigration bill and get over these side political \nshows and do what really ought to be done on immigration. And then let \nus face this problem on the minimum wage up and down with full-fledged \ndebate. And, if that is what it takes, I think we should make the \npoints that I think I personally can make as somebody who did not have \nmuch of a chance when I was younger, who had to work at the minimum \nwage, and who worked for peanuts to be able to go through but gradually \nwas able to work out of it because of the chance I had to have a job to \nbegin with.\n  Frankly, that is what we ought to be more concerned about--the chance \nto have jobs to begin with, because once these kids start working and \nlearn the value of working and the importance of working and the \nbenefits from working, it is not long until they do not earn whatever \nthe minimum wage is. They make far beyond that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full Wall Street \nJournal article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 29, 1996]\n\n                        Repeal the Minimum Wage\n\n       The past two years confirm Bill Bennett's observation that \n     politics is a ball control game; if you're not on offensive \n     you're on defense. The House Republicans dominated Washington \n     until they'd passed most of their Contract, but the Clinton \n     Administration managed to grab the ball, and now dominates \n     the game even with a crackpot idea like the minimum wage.\n       The Republicans many be learning. With their decision to \n     block a House vote of the minimum wage increase, they have \n     already staunched the talk of a GOP rout. They should now \n     throw down the gauntlet to House Democrats and the few \n     Republican turncoats: We are not going to schedule a vote now \n     or ever. Two years ago, we won a big battle with the Inhofe \n     resolution, revitalizing the discharge petition, in which \n     Members can force release of legislation the leadership has \n     stalled. If you democrats are serious about wanting vote, get \n     up your discharge petition.\n       We Republicans are going to fight you every inch of the way \n     because we believe the minimum wage hurts poor people, \n     killing jobs on the first rung of the career ladder for the \n     most vulnerable members of society. Since we believe this we \n     are not going to compromise; no matter what other goodies may \n     be attached, we will never vote for an increase. Especially, \n     we will not buy the argument that since this increase is a \n     modest one, it won't destroy many jobs. Indeed, when we take \n     firmer control of the Congress next year, we are going to \n     vote for a big change, repealing the minimum wage kit, kat \n     and caboodle.\n       It is true that it's now possible to get a few economists, \n     including a couple of Nobel laureates such as Robert Solow, \n     to stand up in public and advocate a higher minimum wage. \n     This is supposed to reflect a study or two that fetched up no \n     job losses from higher minimums; our own suspicion is that it \n     has much more to do with the intellectual bankruptcy of the \n     Democratic Party such economists largely support. As the \n     symposium on this page last week demonstrated, the general \n     consensus of the profession remains firm.\n       James Buchanan, the 1986 laureate for his work on public \n     choice, said it best: ``The inverse relationship between \n     quantity demanded and price is the core proposition in \n     economic science.'' To assert that raising the minimum wage \n     would actually increase employment, he continued, ``becomes \n     equivalent to a denial that there is even minimal scientific \n     content in economics.'' Merton Miller, a 1990 laureate for \n     work on capital markets, asks of the notion that a minimum \n     wage boost is costless, ``Is all this too good to be true? \n     Damn right. But it sure plays well in the opinion polls. I \n     tremble for my profession.''\n       With intellectual firepower such as that on their side, why \n     are Republicans so cowed by the minimum wage debate? Too much \n     attention to the polls and the Beltway press corps, neither \n     of them good barometers of the real mood of the country or \n     especially eventual election returns, in which campaigns and \n     debates typically change the first-blush poll numbers. And \n     most especially, decades-long moral intimidation by Democrats \n     waving bloody shirts about ``the poor.'' The minimum wage \n     hurts the poor, and the more so the higher it's raised.\n       Now, that is not to say there aren't problems to be dealt \n     with. Republicans are right to think about ways to put more \n     money in the pockets of beginning workers, particularly by \n     taxing them less heavily. Under the incentives now in place, \n     employers are shifting more beginning workers to \n     ``independent contractor'' status, where these workers bear \n     both sides of the payroll tax. Then they are trying to help \n     their lowest paid with daycare and other in-kind benefits not \n     subject to the payroll tax. For older workers, Republicans \n     should be repealing earnings limitations on Social Security \n     recipients. It is indeed important to look to incentives for \n     work, efficiency and production.\n       The minimum wage, however, points all of the incentives in \n     the wrong direction. Yes, some Republicans have themselves \n     defected for their own personal reasons, and it's conceivable \n     that if the GOP resists, the increase will pass. But so what? \n     It is more important that the Republicans start to assert \n     principles, as they did when they dominated the Congress and \n     the national discussion.

If Republicans do this, we predict, they will come back \n     next year with plenty of votes not only to roll back any \n     increase but end the minimum wage charade once and for all.\n\n                     Temporary Agricultural Workers\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have filed, and have been prepared to \noffer, an amendment on behalf of myself and Senator Gorton.\n  Mr. President, there is an old joke about the tombstone engraved with \nthe words, ``I told you I was sick.''\n  There are many of us in this body who do not want to come down to the \nfloor of the Senate in October and say: We told you so. We told you the \nH-2A temporary agricultural worker program was broken. And now there \nare crops rotting in the fields and supermarket bins are empty or \nproduce prices are going through the roof.\n  There is no satisfaction in being able to say ``I told you so,'' when \nwe have an opportunity to fix a problem before it becomes a crisis.\n  This is the first Congress in my memory that has made some real \nattempts to do just that--practice preventive legislating--most notably \nin our attempts to enact the first balanced budget in a generation.\n\n[[Page S4303]]\n\n  We have an opportunity to prevent a crisis this year by reforming the \nH-2A temporary agricultural worker program in our immigration law.\n  The H-2A program was created because agriculture has a need, in many \ncases, for workers on a seasonal basis. This creates a unique \ncombination of opportunities and problems for employer and employee.\n  Most growers are able to employ employees who are citizens or \notherwise in this country legally.\n  And many growers earnestly believe they are doing exactly that. But, \nwhen a job applicant shows up with apparently valid documents showing \nthe applicant is a citizen or is here legally, the employer has no \nchoice but to accept those documents. This usually means he or she has \nno choice but to hire that applicant, for at least two reasons: First, \nto avoid costly and lengthy litigation or prosecution over an alleged \ncivil rights violation. And, second, because there is no other \nqualified applicant for that job.\n  This Senate should and will, under the leadership of the chairman, \nMr. Simpson, pass legislation that tightens up our borders and stems \nthe tide of illegal immigration.\n  When that happens, many innocent employers are going to be surprised \nwhen their labor pool contracts or disappears.\n  When that happens, as early at this fall, American agriculture--that \nsector of the economy that puts the food on all our tables--will face a \ncrisis.\n  Therefore, we are offering today a compromise amendment that would \nhelp prevent that crisis.\n  I note that our amendment is a compromise. The House considered and \nrejected a broader, new program. Our amendment merely reforms the \ncurrent H-2A program. It would--\n  Streamline and simplify administrative procedures; expedite \nprocessing; and provide basic worker protections that both ensure that \ntemporary immigrant workers do not displace American workers and \nprotect those workers from exploitation.\n  I want to emphasize: The original H-2A program was needed, and these \nreforms are needed, because there simply are not enough American \nworkers who are available to take these seasonal, temporary jobs. We \npropose to allow the legal employment of a legal, temporary immigrant, \nonly when there is not an American worker available for that job.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I appreciate and recognize the concerns of the Senator \nfrom Idaho [Mr. Craig] and our other colleagues in this area.\n  I commend my colleagues for coming here with a concrete, compromise \nproposal and respectfully suggest the most appropriate next step would \nbe to fully consider this proposal in the Immigration Subcommittee.\n  The H-2A program was intended to fulfill all the purposes my friend \nmentions and I do want to work with my colleagues to make certain this \nprogram is workable and meets the needs it is intended to meet.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the chairman for his willingness to look into and \naddress this problem. I look forward to working on this issue with the \nchairman and our other colleagues in the coming weeks and months.\n  Senators Wyden, Kyl, Leahy, and others, including this Senator, also \nhave filed an amendment, which I understand will be included in the \nmanagers' amendment. That amendment:\n  Expresses the sense of the Congress that--\n  The potential impact revising our immigration laws will have on the \navailability of an adequate agricultural work force should be assessed; \nand any needs in this area should be met through a workable H-2A \nprogram; and provides for the GAO to promptly conduct a study and \nreport back to Congress.\n  I commend that amendment to my colleagues' attention and strongly \nurge adoption. If that amendment is adopted, then I do not intend to \npursue the Craig-Gorton amendment at this time, and will continue to \nwork further with the chairman and the committee on this issue.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I understand this has been cleared on both \nsides.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending motion and amendments \nthereto on amendment No. 3744 be temporarily set aside for the \nconsideration of a manager's amendment that I understand has been \ncleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3866 to Amendment No. 3743\n\n          (Purpose: To make manager's amendments to the bill)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for Mr. Simpson, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3866 to amendment numbered \n     3743.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Simpson and \nSenator Kennedy for working with me and my cosponsors to craft a \nbipartisan amendment to commission a GAO study on the effectiveness of \nthe H-2A Guest Worker Program.\n  It seems to me that the H-2A Program works for no one. From what I \nhave heard from growers and from farmworker advocates on this program: \nFirst, it does not effectively match up American workers with employers \nwho need labor; second, it is administratively unwieldy for growers, \npotentially leaving them at the date of harvest without sufficient \nlabor; and third, there are cases where the labor protections under the \nprogram have been poorly enforced and some growers have driven out \ndomestic laborers in favor of foreign labor through unfair employment \npractices.\n  It seems to me that this program can use a good, hard look on a \nnumber of fronts, and this is why I am proposing a GAO report so that \nan outside agency can take a balanced look at the effectiveness of this \nprogram.\n  I am concerned about this issue because agriculture is one of \nOregon's largest industries. It generates more than $5 billion in \ndirect economic output and another $3 to 5 billion in related \nindustries.\n  According to the Oregon Department of Agriculture, roughly 53,000 \njobs in Oregon are tied to the agricultural industry. Let me clarify: \nthese are not seasonal or temporary jobs, these are good, permanent, \nAmerican jobs. If we add on seasonal workers, we are talking about \n76,000 to 98,000 jobs in Oregon.\n  When we are talking about this many jobs in my State of Oregon, I \ndon't want to be flip or careless about any changes to any statute that \nmight adversely affect these jobs or this industry. At the same time, I \ncertainly don't want to see the creation of a new Bracero Program.\n  In my mind I set some simple goals for looking at the H-2A Program: \nFirst, we have to make sure that the U.S. agriculture industry is \ninternationally competitive, and second, we have to make sure that \nAmerican farmworkers are not displaced by foreign workers and that they \nhave access to good jobs, where they can earn a fair day's wage for a \nfair day's work.\n  With these goals in mind, I think that we can design a reasonable \nsystem to meet labor shortages, if and when they occur.\n  It is an understatement to say that the issue of the H-2A Program for \nbringing in temporary guest workers is polarized. Labor unions and \nadvocates for farmworkers feel that the H-2A Program is barely a notch \nabove the old, abusive Bracero Program. Growers feel that far from \ngiving them access to cheap labor, the H-2A Program is extraordinarily \ncostly and almost totally unusable and that the Department of Labor is \nopenly hostile to their interests.\n  Given the passions surrounding this issue, I think that it's \nimportant that we begin any process of redesigning this program by \nbringing in an independent, outside agency to take a look at H-2A to \ntry to sift out what is actually happening, and what can be done to \nmake this program an effective safety valve, if indeed, after \nimmigration reform legislation passes, there ends up being a shortage \nof American workers who are able and willing to take temporary, \nagricultural jobs.\n\n[[Page S4304]]\n\n  I and my cosponsors, along with Senator Kennedy and Senator Simpson, \nhave agreed that it is important for the GAO to look at four issues:\n  First, that able and willing American workers are efficiently matched \nup with employers seeking labor.\n  I have heard criticism of the H-2A Program from both the growers and \nfrom farmworker advocates. According to the testimony by John R. \nHancock, a former Department of Labor employee, before the House \nCommittee on Agriculture December 14, 1995,\n       Only about 10-15 percent of the job openings available with \n     H-2A employers have been referred by the Employment Service \n     in recent years, and the number of such workers who stay on \n     the job to complete the total contract period has been \n     minimal.\n\n  Similarly, a briefing book sent to me from the Farmworker's Justice \nFund cited the Commission on Agricultural Workers' finding that ``the \nsupply of workers is not yet coordinated well enough with the demand \nfor workers.''\n  So, it seems that we all can agree that we seriously need to evaluate \nhow we match up workers with employers who are experiencing labor \nshortages.\n  Second, if and when there is a shortage of American workers willing \nto do the necessary temporary, agricultural labor, there will be a \nstraightforward program to address this shortage with temporary foreign \nworkers.\n  I have been assured that across the country there are hundreds of \nthousands of migrant farmworkers, ready, willing and able to work. If \nthere is no such shortage, then clearly there is no need for growers to \nuse the H-2A Program.\n  However, growers in Oregon and across the country are afraid that if \nthis legislation is effective in cracking down on false documents and \ncracking down on people who come across the border, then they will see \ntheir work force decline sharply.\n  Now as far as I can tell, no one can say for certain how many illegal \nimmigrants there are in this country and how many are part of the \nmigrant labor work force. But I know from visiting with folks in \nOregon, that there is nothing that makes a farmer lose more sleep at \nnight than worrying about his or her fruit, or berries, or vegetables, \nrotting in the field because there is no one there to pick it.\n  I know that many say that a farmer could get as much labor as he \nwanted if the wage was high enough. I want to make clear that I \nstrongly support making sure that seasonal, agricultural workers get a \ngood, living wage. I strongly support ensuring that they have good \nhousing, and workers compensation, and safe working conditions.\n  But I do think we have to be realistic that if we want to keep a \ncompetitive agricultural industry, these temporary, seasonal jobs are \nnever going to make a person a millionaire; these jobs are always going \nto involve tough, physical labor, and they most likely aren't going to \nbe filled by out-of-work engineers.\n  So it seems to make sense to me that because we want our agricultural \nindustry to be the most competitive in the world, that if and when \nthere is a labor shortage of people who are willing and able to do \ntemporary, seasonal work, there should be an effective way for the \nfarmer to get help to harvest the crop.\n  I don't want to have to scramble while the food rots in the field to \nfix the H-2A Program. Let's straighten it out now. Hopefully, we'll \nnever have to use it--but if we do, let's have something that is \nusable.\n  Third, if and when a farmer uses the H-2A Program, the program should \nnot directly or indirectly be misused to displace U.S. agricultural \nworkers, or to make U.S. workers worse off.\n  There are a lot of stories about misuse of the H-2A Program --I find \nthese appalling. I do not think that the H-2A Program should be used as \na conduit for cheap foreign labor, as a substitute for already \navailable American workers.\n  It seems to me that everyone admits that there are some abusive \nemployers. There are employers who have manipulated the piece rates to \npay people lower wages. There are employers who, once they get into the \nH-2A Program, never again look for American labor. I think that this \nprogram needs careful scrutiny to ensure that workers are treated \nfairly--that they get a fair wage for a fair day's work, that they have \nplaces to live and reasonable benefits, and that we don't bring in \nforeign workers to the detriment of American workers here.\n  Many of the problems I hear about with the H-2A Program from \nfarmworker advocates seem to stem from a lack of enforcement in the \nprogram. Perhaps this is something that we also need to look at--what \nmechanism can make sure that this program is enforceable.\n  Fourth, finally, I believe that it is important that we do not \nundermine the intent of this bill to ensure that we stop the flood of \nillegal immigrants coming across the border. We would ask GAO to look \nat the extent to which this program might cause an increase in illegal \nimmigrants in this country.\n  I know that a number of concerns have been expressed about overstays \namong temporary workers. Obviously, our primary concern with this \nentire legislation is that we get some control over the illegal \nimmigrants coming into this country, and it is important that we don't \nclose the door in one place, only to open a backdoor elsewhere.\n  I know that the tensions over the guest worker issue run deep. I hope \nthat with this GAO report we can start to take an objective, balanced \nlook at what this guest worker program will mean both for farm workers \nand for employers, and how it can operate so it is fair to both.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Ron Wyden for offering an \namendment to require the General Accounting Office [GAO] to review and \nreport on the effectiveness of the H-2A Nonimmigrant Worker Program \nafter passage of immigration reform legislation.\n  I have heard from many agriculture and labor groups about the \nimportance of H-2A Nonimmigrant Worker Program. In my home State of \nVermont, for example, apple growers depend on this program for some of \ntheir labor needs during the peak harvest season. Many of these farmers \nhave concerns with the current operation and responsiveness of the H-2A \nprogram. Both farmers and laborers are concerned that passage of \nlegislation to reform the Nation's immigration laws may further hamper \nthe effectiveness of the H-2A Nonimmigrant Worker Program. I believe \nthis amendment goes a long way in addressing their concerns.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this amendment because I believe it will \nresult in the collection of public, nonpartisan information on the \neffectiveness of this essential program. It directs the GAO to review \nthe existing H-2A Nonimmigrant Worker Program to ensure that the \nprogram provides a workable safety valve in the event of future \nshortages of domestic workers. And it requires the GAO to issue a \ntimely report to the public on its findings. I am hopeful that the GAO \nstudy will provide a foundation for improving the program for the sake \nof agricultural employers and workers.\n  I also believe that this amendment crafts a careful balance between \nthe needs of agricultural growers and the protection of domestic and \nforeign farm workers. The amendment calls on the GAO to review the H-2A \nProgram to determine if it provides an adequate supply of qualified \nU.S. workers, timely approval for the applications for temporary \nforeign workers, protection against the displacement or diminishing of \nthe terms and conditions of the employment of U.S. agricultural \nworkers.\n  I am hopeful that this GAO report will help the H-2A admissions \nprocess meet the needs of agricultural employers while protecting the \njobs, wages, and working conditions of domestic workers and the rights \nand dignity of those admitted to work on a temporary and seasonal \nbasis.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Wyden amendment.\n\n\n                             ins amendment\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, much of the debate on this floor is \nfocused on how to strengthen our immigration laws. But whatever we pass \nwill not mean much if we do not make sure that our States have the \ntools and support they need to enforce those laws in the first place.\n  My amendment, which is cosponsored by Senator Byrd and Senator \nDaschle that would require the Attorney General to provide at least 10 \nfull-time active duty agents of the Immigration and Naturalization \nService in each\n\n[[Page S4305]]\n\nState. These can be either new agents or existing agents shifted from \nother States.\n  In America today, immigration is not simply a California issue or a \nNew York issue or a Texas or Florida issue. I can tell you that it is a \nreal issue--and a real challenge--in my own State.\n  But today there are three States--including Iowa--that have no \npermanent INS presence to combat illegal immigration or to assist legal \nimmigrants. In fact, in Iowa every other Federal law enforcement agency \nis represented except the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n  This is a commonsense amendment. Ten agents is a modest level \ncompared to agents in other States. According to INS current staffing \nlevels, Missouri has 92 agents, Minnesota has 281 agents and the State \nof Washington has 440. And Iowa, West Virginia, and South Dakota have \nzero. This just does not make any sense.\n  Clearly every State needs a minimum INS presence to meet basic needs. \nMy amendment would ensure that need is met. It would affect 10 States \nand only require 61 agents which is less than 0.3 percent of the \ncurrent 19,780 INS agents nationwide.\n  Let me speak briefly about the situation in my own State. Currently, \nIowa shares an INS office located in Omaha, NE. In its February report, \nthe Omaha INS office reported that they apprehend a total of 704 \nillegal aliens last year for the two State area. This number is up by \n52 percent from 1994.\n  The irony here is that in 1995, the INS office in Omaha was operating \nat a 33 percent reduction in manpower from 1994 staff levels. Yet the \nnumber of illegal aliens apprehended increased by 52 percent that year.\n  This same report states that there are about 550 criminal aliens \nbeing detained or serving sentences in Iowa and Nebraska city-county \njails. Many of these aliens were arrested for controlled substance \nviolations and drug trafficking crimes.\n  A little law enforcement relief is on its way to Iowa. The Justice \nDepartment announced that it will establish an INS office in Cedar \nRapids with four law enforcement agents. That is a good step. And it is \nfour more agents then we had before. But we need additional INS \nenforcement to assist Iowa's law enforcement in the central and western \nparts of our State.\n  In fact, the Omaha district office assesed in their initial report to \nthe Justice Department that at least 8 INS enforcement agents are \nneeded simply to handle the issue of illegal immigration in Iowa.\n  Mr. President, in the immigration reform legislation before the \nSenate this week, the Attorney General will be mandated to increase the \nnumber of Border Patrol agents by 1,000 every year for the next 4 \nyears. Yet for Iowa, the Justice Department can only spare 4 law \nenforcement agents and no agents to perform examinations or inspections \nfunctions.\n  By providing each State with its own INS office, the Justice \nDepartment will save taxpayer dollars by reducing not only travel time \nbut also jail time per alien, since a permanent INS presence would \nsubstantially speedup deportation proceedings.\n  There is also a growing need to assist legal immigrants and to speed \nup document processing. The Omaha INS office reported that based on its \nfirst quarter totals for this year the examinations process for legal \nimmigrants applying for citizenship or adjusting their status went up \n45 percent from last year. Even though, once again, the manpower for \nthe Omaha INS office is down by one-third.\n  I have recommended that permanent INS office in Des Moines be located \nin free office space that would be provided by the Des Moines \nInternational Airport. Placing the office in the Des Moines \nInternational Airport would benefit Iowa in three ways. First, it would \ncut costs and save taxpayers money. Second, it would generate economic \nbenefits for Iowa because the airport could then process international \narrivals and advance Iowa's goal of becoming increasingly more \ncompetitive in the global market. Third, the office would be able to \nprocess legal immigrants living in Iowa.\n  I urge my collegues to join in support of my amendment. It is common \nsense, it is modest, and it sends a clear message to our States that we \nare committee to enforcing our immigration laws and giving them the \ntools they need to do it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I fully support Senator Harkin's \namendment to require the INS to have full-time staff in every State. \nCurrently, South Dakota is one of only 3 States that do not have a \npermanent INS presence. Although South Dakota does not have the \nproblems with immigration faced by States like California, there has \nbeen a dramatic growth in immigration, both legal and illegal, into the \nState and particularly into Sioux Falls. As immigration increases, it \nhas become necessary to step up enforcement of the immigration laws \nnationwide, including in South Dakota.\n  In addition, citizens and legal residents who need help from the INS \nneed to have an office in South Dakota to serve them. Now, they must \njourney to either Minnesota or Colorado. That is a huge burden on the \nresidents of South Dakota.\n  Senator Harkin is to be commended for addressing these problems and \nensuring that South Dakota will have help from the INS to prevent \nillegal immigration and to facilitate the needs of legal residents and \ncitizens.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, my amendment is the same amendment that \nwas added last week by unanimous consent to S. 1028, the health \ninsurance reform bill. Although I am hopeful the House of \nRepresentatives will agree to retain the amendment during its \nconference with the Senate, that is not a certainty. The program this \namendment extends is very important to my State and several others with \nlarge rural populations. But time is running out and this extension \nmust be signed into law into the next few months. So I am offering the \namendment today to S. 1664.\n  This amendment would extend what has become known by some as the \nConrad State 20 Program. In 1994, I added a provision to the visa \nextension bill that allows state health departments or their \nequivalents to participate in the process of obtaining J-1 visa \nwaivers. This process allows a foreign medical graduate [FMG  who has \nsecured employment in the United States to waive the J-1 visa program's \n2-year residency requirement.\n  As a condition of the J-1 visa, FMGs must return to their home \ncountries for at least 2 years after their visas expire before being \neligible to return. However, if the home countries do not object, FMGs \ncan follow a waiver process that allows them to remain and work here in \na designated health professional shortage area or medically underserved \narea. Before my legislation became law, that process exclusively \ninvolved finding an ``interested Federal agency'' to recommend to the \nUnited States Information Agency [USIA] that waiving the 2-year \nrequirement was in the public interest. The law now allows each State \nhealth department or its equivalent to make this recommendation to the \nUSIA for up to 20 waivers per year.\n  This law was necessary for several reasons. Despite an abundance of \nphysicians in some areas of the country, other areas, especially rural \nand inner city areas, have had an exceedingly hard time recruiting \nAmerican doctors. Many health facilities have had no other choice but \nturn to FMGs to fill their primary care needs. Unfortunately, obtaining \nJ-1 visa waiver for qualified FMGs through the Federal program is a \nlong and bureaucratic process that not only requires the participation \nof the interested Federal agency but also requires approval from both \nthe USIA and the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n  Finding a Federal agency to cooperate is difficult enough, \nconsidering that the Department of Health and Human Services does not \nparticipate. States who are not members of the Appalachian Regional \nCommission, which is eligible to approve its own waivers, have had to \nenlist any agency that is willing to take on these additional duties. \nThese agencies, such as the Department of Agriculture or the Department \nof Housing and Urban Development, often have little or no expertise in \nhealth care issues. Once an agency does agree to participate, the word \nspreads quickly and soon that agency can be flooded with thousands of \nwaiver applications from across the country.\n  Because States can clearly determine their own health needs far \nbetter than\n\n[[Page S4306]]\n\nan agency in Washington, DC, my legislation now allows States to go \ndirectly to the USIA to request a waiver. It also is relieving some of \nthe burden that participating Federal agencies have incurred in \nprocessing waiver applications.\n\n  The Conrad State 20 Program is still very new, and not every State \nhas yet elected to use it. But the program is beginning to work exactly \nas I had hoped. At least 21 States have reported using it to obtain \nwaivers. More States are expected to participate in the coming months. \nUnfortunately, the Conrad State 20 Program is scheduled to sunset on \nJune 1, 1996, unless Congress approves an extension. The amendment I am \noffering would extend the program for 6 more years. This is not a \npermanent extension. The amendment would sunset the program on June 1, \n2002.\n  My amendment also puts new restrictions and conditions on FMGs who \nuse the Federal program. As a condition of using the Conrad State 20 \nProgram to acquire a waiver. FMGs must contract to work for their \noriginal employer for at least 3 years. Otherwise, their waiver will be \nrevoked and they will be subject to deportation. My amendment would \napply the same 3-year contractual obligation for those who obtain a \nwaiver through the Federal program.\n  We all know that State empowerment has been a major issue of the \n104th Congress. The Conrad State 20 Program is one way of giving States \nmore control over their health care needs. States that are using the \nprogram want to keep it operating for a few more years. They understand \nthat this program does not take away jobs from American doctors, but \ninstead is one more valuable tool to help serve the health care needs \nof rural and inner city citizens. The Senate passed my original \nlegislation with strong bipartisan support. I am hopeful the Senate \nwill agree that creating the Conrad State 20 Program was very \nworthwhile, and will agree to accept this modest, 6-year extension.\n  Mr. HATCH. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 3866) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of the \nbill, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming [Senator Simpson] and the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts [Senator Kennedy] for \naccepting a bloc of three amendments that I offered to the immigration \nreform bill and including them in the manager's amendment that was just \naccepted by voice vote.\n  I have been deeply concerned about provisions in the bill that could \nhave the effect, perhaps unwittingly, of perpetuating violence against \nimmigrant women and children. Two years ago, Congress made a commitment \nto fight the epidemic of violence against women--all women--when we \npassed the historic Violence Against Women Act. That commitment should \nnot be forgotten as we debate immigration reform. There are provisions \nin this immigration bill before the Senate today that could trap many \nwomen in abusive relationships.\n  Mr. President, it would be unconscionable for our immigration laws to \nfacilitate an abuser's control over his victim. It would be \nunconscionable for our immigration laws to abet criminal perpetrators \nof domestic violence. It would be unconscionable for our immigration \nlaws to perpetuate violence against women and children.\n  Domestic abuse is one of the most serious issues our country faces--\nnot only for the people who are in danger in their own homes, but for \nall of us--when that danger, that abusive behavior learned at home, \nspills out into our streets and schools. Domestic abuse knows no \nborders. Neither race, gender, geography, nor economic status shields \nsomeone from domestic violence.\n  Every 15 seconds a woman is beaten by a husband or boyfriend.\n  Over 4,000 women are killed every year by their abuser.\n  Every 6 minutes, a woman is forcibly raped.\n  Some 70 percent of men who batter women also batter their children.\n  A survey conducted in 1992 found that more than half of the battered \nwomen surveyed stayed with their batterer because they did not feel \nthey could support themselves and their families.\n  The Violence Against Women Act was enacted to ensure that women in \nthe United States, living under all different kinds of circumstances, \nhave every chance to create safe lives for themselves and their \nchildren.\n  For a battered immigrant woman to be eligible for the protections of \nthe Violence Against Women Act, she must show that she: First, is the \nspouse of a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States; \nsecond, is eligible for immigrant classification based on that \nrelationship; third, is residing in the United States; fourth, has \nresided in the United States with the citizen or lawful permanent \nresident spouse; fifth, has been battered by, or subjected to extreme \ncruelty by that spouse; sixth, is a person of good moral character; \nseventh, entered into the marriage in good faith; and eighth, that her \ndeportation would cause extreme hardship to her or her child.\n  Many undocumented women are undocumented because they have been \nvictims of abuse, and in many cases their abusers have interfered with \nor deceived them about the immigration process.\n  These women, victims of domestic violence who are eligible for lawful \npermanent residency, but who have not yet attained residency due to the \nactions or inactions of their abusers, should not be penalized as \nundocumented immigrants. Their undocumented status is most often not \nwillful, but results from the abusive relationship.\n  I want to explain this carefully. Many of these women come into the \ncountry legally, with the sponsorship of their spouse. Once they are \nhere, the abusive partner will use her immigration status as a means of \ncoercing her into submission--for example, ``If you don't do whatever I \nsay, I will call the INS on you and withdraw my petition.'' Often these \nwomen will leave the country with their spouse and then the spouse will \nforce them to re-enter illegally. The spouse will sometimes not file \nthe proper paperwork to petition for status, all the while telling his \nbattered wife that he is taking care of the situation, and that her \nfate in the United States rests in his hands.\n  For example, Dania's case, originating in New Jersey, was recently \nbrought to my attention. Dania is 27 years old. She came to the United \nStates from India. Her husband Mihi, a U.S. citizen, told her that he \nwould file for her to get permanent residence in the United States. \nSoon after they were married, he did file a petition. The couple \nresided with Mihi's family, who were verbally abusive to Dania and Mihi \nhimself battered her with his fists, leaving visible marks on her face \nand body. The police responded to complaints from neighbors about the \nviolence on several occasions. Mihi told Dania that if she did not do \nwhatever he said, he would withdraw the petition he filed and have her \ndeported.\n  Dania left her husband once and fled to a shelter. Soon after, he \nconvinced her to take a ``reconciliation trip'' with him to India. When \nthey got to India, he destroyed all of her documents including her \npassport. She obtained a passport and returned to the United States to \nfind that Mihi had withdrawn his petition sponsoring her for legal \nstatus.\n  Mr. President, to treat Dania and these other VAWA eligible women as \nundocumented is to punish them for being victims of a crime. Remember, \ndomestic violence is a crime, whether or not the victim has a green \ncard.\n  Under this bill, these undocumented immigrant women would be \nineligible for any means tested government assistance programs.\n  The first amendment in this bloc, accepted by the managers of the \nbill, would allow women who are eligible to file independently for \nlegal residence under the Violence Against Women Act, but have yet to \ndo so, and thus are ineligible for assistance, to receive certain \nbenefits including AFDC and Medicaid, provided that they file for \nlegal, permanent residence within 45 days.\n\n  Let's say a battered immigrant woman flees her abusive household in \nthe middle of the night and goes to a domestic violence shelter. Prior \nto\n\n[[Page S4307]]\n\ngoing to the shelter, she may not have even known that the Violence \nAgainst Women Act existed, and therefore, she has never self-petitioned \nfor residency. The next morning, the first thing she needs to deal with \nis not her immigration status, but with the more pressing needs of \nfinding a temporary source of food, diapers and medical care for her \nchild.\n  This amendment makes her immediately available for some of the public \nbenefits that lawful permanent residents are eligible for, and then she \nhas 45 days to file her claim for lawful permanent residency. If she \nfails to file the claim or the claim is denied, the benefits would be \nterminated.\n  Women fleeing abusive relationships need the transitional assistance \nthat is provided by government public benefits programs. This amendment \nwould allow these women to be eligible for a narrow set of means-tested \ngovernment assistance programs. This discrete group of programs has \nbeen selected because they would provide bare bones support: \nsupplemental security income; aid to families with dependent children; \nsocial services block grants; Medicaid; food stamps; and housing \nassistance.\n  If women who have been battered do not have access to this \nassistance, they are thrust into the untenable position of acquiescing \nto abuse or facing deportation when they ask for help.\n  Mr. President, I want to tell another story, because I think the best \nway to understand about some of these problems--which seem unimaginable \nto so many of us--is to hear about real people who these amendments \nwould help. Guadalupe is an undocumented woman living in Oregon, who \nwas not a legal resident due to the inaction of her husband and \nsponsor, a battered woman who could have successfully fled her \nhideously abusive marriage if she had been able to get some kind of \ntransitional assistance for herself and her children.\n  Guadalupe is from Mexico and is married to Jose. They have had two \nchildren together. Jose applied for, and received, his legal residency. \nThroughout the 11 years of their marriage, he promised on many \noccasions to file for legal residency on behalf of Guadalupe. He never \ndid.\n  Guadalupe was made to stay in the house and have no contact with \nanyone. The only time she left the house was on weekly shopping trips \nto the grocery store. Soon, even the trips to the store were a thing of \nthe past and Guadalupe and her children would go for days with nothing \nto eat.\n  Jose would belittle, humiliate, rape, and sodomize Guadalupe in front \nof the children, and he explained to his 3-year-old son that he would \nbe expected to do this as well when he got older in order to ``keep his \nmother and sister in line.'' When Guadalupe would attempt to defend \nherself and her children, Jose would pull out his pistol and threaten \nto kill her.\n  During one particularly bad incident of abuse, a neighbor became \naware of what was going on and gave Guadalupe a shelter number. She \nmoved to the shelter. Since neither Guadalupe nor her children have INS \ndocumentation, they were ineligible for public assistance and Guadalupe \ncould not work because she doesn't have a green card. They were totally \neconomically dependent on Jose.\n\n  She moved back in with him out of economic necessity and the abuse \ncontinued to escalate. Jose earned $2,000 a month, and yet his children \nsuffer from malnutrition since he doesn't give Guadalupe any money to \nbuy food. Jose repeatedly threatens to have Guadalupe and the children \ndeported.\n  If Guadalupe had been eligible to receive some assistance right away, \nit might have been possible for her to start a new, safe, and secure \nlife for herself and her children. This amendment would give Guadalupe \nand other women in similar, desperate circumstances, a chance at \nbreaking free from abusive relationships and starting a safer life.\n  The second amendment accepted by the managers would protect battered \nwomen, also in the circumstance of needing some assistance, from being \ndeported for being a ``public charge,'' that is to say, for temporarily \nrelying on public assistance to escape the violence.\n  In order to be granted suspension of deportation under the Violence \nAgainst Women Act, battered women must overcome two tests: First, she \nmust prove that she is eligible for suspension of deportation under the \nViolence Against Women Act.\n  To do so she must prove:\n  That she has been battered or the subject of extreme cruelty in the \nUnited States by a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident spouse;\n  That she has a valid marriage;\n  That she is of good moral character; and\n  That her deportation would cause extreme hardship.\n  Second, once she has proven this, the judge could still exercise \njudicial discretion and deport her regardless of her VAWA eligibility \nbecause she relied on public benefits in an effort to escape her abuse.\n  Under this bill, any legal immigrant who receives any means-tested \nFederal or State assistance for an aggregate of 12 months during her \nfirst 5 years in the United States is deportable as a public charge. \nFor these purposes, means-tested Federal or State assistance programs \ninclude things like, if she got a Pell grant, in order to further her \neducation and make it possible to get a better job to provide for \nherself and her children. A battered woman could also be deported for \nbeing a ``public charge'' if she enrolled a child in Head Start or any \nsimilar means-tested program. This standard has the effect of punishing \npeople who are availing themselves of programs that are there to help \nmake them self-sufficient.\n  Realistically, battered women often need to rely on public assistance \nto escape their violent surroundings. My second amendment, like the \nHouse bill, would allow battered women to be eligible for the same \ndiscreet set of government assistance programs that require \nmeans testing, those that I listed in conjunction with my last \namendment, for 4 years without being considered a public charge. A 4-\nyear time period was selected because research has shown that half of \nwomen on public assistance are off of assistance within 4 years. This \namendment would provide an exception to the provision in the Senate \nbill that would make such a woman deportable.\n\n  Keep in mind that the decision to leave an abusive relationship is \nnot an easy one. When a woman leaves she knows that two things will \nhappen immediately--she, and if she is a mother, her children, will \nbecome homeless and they will likey lose all of their economic \nresource. She will immediately enter poverty. For a mother, this would \nbe an enormous step to take.\n  My amendment is necessary under many different circumstances. For \nexample, some shelters, as a safety precaution, condition residence \nupon a battered woman not returning to her place of employment. Many \nbattered women do no work outside the home because the abuser does not \nallow it. In other cases the abuser has forbidden the abused woman from \ngetting educational or employment skills that would make her self-\nsufficient. These are some of the many reasons battered women may rely \non transitional public assistance as they flee.\n  Giving battered women a longer time on assistance before they are \nconsidered a public charge, and therefore deportable, is another way of \ngiving abused women and their children a better chance at improving \ntheir circumstances.\n  The third amendment accepted by the Managers relates to a practice \nknown as deeming, whereby the income of an immigrant's sponsor is \nattributed to the immigrant for the purposes of determining the \nimmigrant's eligibility for public assistance. For example, an \nimmigrant woman is sponsored by her U.S. citizen husband who signs an \naffidavit that he will support her. He earns $30,000 a year. That woman \nis deemed to have access to $30,000 a year, even if he is not \nsupporting her in reality.\n  Deeming amounts to essentially pretending that an abusive sponsor is \nsupporting a victim of domestic abuse and it renders her ineligible for \nthe transitional public assistance that she would need to become \nindependent, and would imprison her and her children in a violent \nsituation. She would be without a means of economic survival and hence \nforced to return to her abuser. Many times, we see affidavits of \nsupport used as a tool by the abuser to prevent the victim from \nleaving.\n  My third amendment, similar to the House bill language, would \neliminate\n\n[[Page S4308]]\n\nthe practice of ``deeming'' for victims of domestic abuse for the first \n4 years, and beyond 4 years if there is an ongoing need for the \nbenefits and that need has been caused by the domestic abuse.\n  These 4 years give the battered woman an opportunity to become self-\nsufficient. Often when a woman leaves an abusive relationship she is \ndesperate and scared. She fears for her life because leaving can be the \nmost dangerous time for her. She has probably lost all of her self-\nesteem and self-confidence because of the battering. The process of \nputting her life and the lives of her children back together can be \nslow.\n\n  As a community, we need to encourage women and children recovering \nfrom an abusive situation to become a strong, healthy, independent \nfamily. To set ``one size fits all'' provisions and arbitrary time \nlimits for immigrant women is unfair, unreasonable and unconscionable. \nIt shows no understanding of the trauma that a women go through.\n  Just think of Monica Seles, the tennis star who was stabbed while on \nthe tennis court. It took her 2 years to return to tennis due to the \npost traumatic stress disorder caused by a single attack. Although this \nwas indeed a terrible, terrible trauma, consider the effect of years of \nbattering and abuse some women suffer in their own homes, and think \nwhat it must take to recover from that kind of abuse.\n  As we strive to reform our immigration policies in a thoughtful, and \nnot punitive manner, we must be careful that proposed reforms don't \neliminate protections that help women and children, particularly \nvulnerable women and children, escape dangerous, violent homes.\n  Mr. President, all of the amendments I have offered today relating to \ndomestic violence have been offered for the purposes of keeping the \nlandmark legislation, the Violence Against Women Act, the strong \nprotection for abused women and their children that it was intended to \nbe.\n  We have made a lot of progress in the past few years, but there is \nstill a large gap in the public awareness and understanding of domestic \nviolence. It takes community support and assistance for women and \nchildren to take the first step to become safe. My fellow Senators and \nI have a perfect opportunity to set an example to the community today.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON.

Mr. President, the floor manager and I have visited \nabout what we might expect through the evening and into tomorrow. It is \nour best judgment that we will have an amendment dealing with the \nCuban-Asian adjustment that Senator Graham will speak to this evening, \nand then we will have the final debate as the first order of business \ntomorrow. Then Senator Graham has indicated that he would follow up \nwith a presentation on one of his amendments dealing with the welfare \nprovisions on the underlying legislation with the opportunity to have, \nagain, briefer debate on that measure tomorrow.\n  Then it is our hope that we will be able to, as I understand it, go \nfrom side to side in terms of the amendments themselves. We will \nobviously do the best we can to accommodate different Members and their \ntime schedule. That has been certainly the agreement.\n  We want to express our appreciation to Senator Simpson for that \nmeasure. We will move through the course of the day. I have spoken to a \nnumber of our colleagues to urge the early consideration of their \namendments in a timely way in the midmorning and later morning so we \ncan make some real progress on this bill.\n\n[[Page S4309]]\n\n  We can see that there is no desire on our part to delay this \nlegislation. It was a unanimous vote, virtually, on the cloture. As I \nmentioned earlier, what is underlying this whole effort is really the \nquestion about whether we will get a debate or discussion on the issue \nof minimum wage. I made that presentation earlier.\n  We can see from all of our sides we are prepared to move ahead. We \nare going to work with the manager of the bill and try and give as much \nnotice to our colleagues as is possible in terms of the amendments that \nare coming up. We urge all of them to give the focus and attention to \nthis subject now because there is a series of very important amendments \nthat will be coming up through the day and tomorrow, and then it will \nbe up to the leaders about how late we meet tomorrow evening and into \nWednesday.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, as always, over the years, in dealing \nwith this issue of illegal immigration and legal immigration, I \nappreciated the courtesies and attention of the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  That is evident again. He has a very serious issue he wants to bring \nbefore the U.S. Senate. We understand that. I understand that. I would \nbe doing the same were I in his role. I do regret that the procedural \naspects of the last few days made it appear that we were doing the \nbusiness all over here, and that was unfortunate.\n  We moved some amendments without, perhaps, doing the usual procedure \nof back and forth and back and forth. So we will now go to Senator \nGraham, and that is the Cuban Adjustment Act rather than the Cuban-\nHaitian. It is not a Cuban-Haitian issue. It is a Cuban Adjustment Act \nissue.\n  I will define it as an anachronism, and in other terms, a little \nlater. And then he may, if he desires, go forward with a second \namendment to reduce my level of guilt.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to assure my good friend from \nWyoming that reducing his level of guilt, or, frankly, any other \nemotion that he might feel, is not the purpose of this, but it is \nrather to discuss the current relevance, the relevance in the spring of \n1996, of legislation that this Congress passed 30 years ago.\n  It was on November 2, 1966, that Public Law 89-732, the Cuban \nAdjustment Act, became the law of the land.\n  Mr. President, I want to read, briefly, from that law that was passed \nalmost 30 years ago, because an understanding of what this law does--\nand, frankly, what it does not do--is crucial to understanding the \nproposal which I will submit to the Senate.\n  I will read portions of the Cuban Adjustment Act. It states:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of the Immigration and \n     Nationality law, the status of any alien who is a native or \n     citizen of Cuba, and who has been inspected and admitted, or \n     paroled into the United States subsequent to January 1, 1959, \n     and has been physically present in the United States for at \n     least 1 year, may be adjusted by the Attorney General in \n     his--\n\n  Now her--\n\n     discretion, and under such regulations as he or she may \n     prescribe to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent \n     residence.\n\n  Mr. President, that is the essence of the Cuban Adjustment Act. It \nonly relates to people who are lawfully in the United States. It does \nnot apply to people who are here illegally. You first had to have been \nadmitted into the United States, or paroled into the United States, in \norder to commence the process of 1 year of presence in the United \nStates prior to being eligible to request this discretionary act of the \nAttorney General.\n  Mr. President, last week, I made some preliminary remarks on this \nlegislation, and I stated that one of my concerns is that, although \nthis bill has as its title that this is the ``illegal\" aliens bill, as \ndistinct from a separate ``legal'' alien bill, that in fact the illegal \naliens bill has spotted throughout it provisions that relate \nprimarily--or as in this case, exclusively--to legal aliens.\n  So I ask my colleagues to now part the veil of legal and illegal, \nbecause we are now talking about people who are in this country \nlegally, and whose status is about to be affected by a change in a bill \nwhose title would lead one to believe that it only relates to those \npersons who are in the country illegally.\n  What would the provision in the illegal immigration bill, S. 1664, do \nto those persons who are in the country legally and under current law \nwould have the prerogative of asking the Attorney General to exercise \nher discretion to adjust their status? This provision, which begins on \npage 177, would first repeal Public Law 89-732, the Cuban Adjustment \nAct.\n  Second, it states a savings provision, which states that ``The \nprovisions of such act shall continue to apply on a case-by-case basis \nwith respect to individuals paroled into the United States pursuant to \nthe Cuban migration agreement of 1995.''\n  Let me make some comments on that provision. The savings provision \nstates that it applies on a case-by-case basis. As I indicated, in \ncurrent law it is also on a case-by-case basis.\n\n  Applications must be made on an individual basis for a person who is \na native or a citizen of Cuba, who has been inspected, or admitted, or \nparoled into the United States subsequent to January 1, 1959, and has \nbeen physically present for 1 year.\n  If you meet all those requirements, then you may apply to the \ndiscretionary act of the Attorney General to adjust your status. This \nsavings provision, however, would only apply with respect to \nindividuals paroled into the United States. The current Cuban \nAdjustment Act refers to persons who are inspected and admitted, or \nparoled. So it would narrow the categories of persons who could come \ninto the United States to those who are paroled.\n  What is the significance of that? As you know, there are a number of \nmeans by which a person can come into the United States. For those \npersons who have come from Cuba, they have primarily come in one of \nthree categories: as parolees, as refugees, or as visa immigrants. This \namendment, as written in current law, would restrict it to only one of \nthose three categories--those who are parolees.\n  As an example, in 1995, under the United States-Cuban migration \namendment--I might say, Mr. President, that was the agreement entered \ninto in the spring of 1995 as a culmination of the series of events \nwhich began almost 9 months earlier with a mass migration of small \nboats from Cuba to the United States, which, in turn, led to the large \nnumber of persons who were detained at the United States Naval Station \nat Guantanamo Bay. Of those who came into the United States in 1995, \n7,500 came in with the status of refugees. Of those, 7,500 would be \nexcluded from the applicability of the Cuban Adjustment Act, under this \nprovision, because it would only apply to parolees. Six-thousand came \nas visa immigrants. Those would be excluded from the application of the \nCuban Adjustment Act. There were 14,000 who came as parolees through \nthe migration agreement having applied to the United States-Cuban \ninterest section in Havana. Another 10,000 came as parolees, as one of \nthose persons who were being detained at Guantanamo. So, last year, \nthere would have been 13,500 of those persons who came that would not \nhave been eligible because they came in a status other than as a \nparolee, and 24,000 would have been eligible because they came as \nparolees.\n  The next major restriction is that you have to come in pursuant to \nthe Cuban migration agreement of 1995. There are literally tens of \nthousands of persons who are otherwise eligible for adjustment of \nstatus under the Cuban Adjustment Act, who have come in by means other \nthan the Cuban Migration Agreement of 1995. In fact, from 1990 to 1994, \nan average of almost 20,000 persons a year adjusted their status under \nthe Cuban Adjustment Act. None of them came in under the Cuban \nMigration Act because the Migration Act did not go into effect until \nthe spring of 1995.\n  Assumingly, although there are no precise records, there are still \nmany thousands of persons who came prior to the spring of 1995, prior \nto the Cuban Migration Act, who are still eligible because they meet \nthe other standards of having come here legally, having resided here \nfor 1 year, and are now legally eligible to make a request to the \nAttorney General for a discretionary act of adjusting their status.\n  So one of the consequences of adopting the language which is in 1664 \ntoday is to exclude a substantial number of people from the benefits of \nthis legislation, people who are just like persons\n\n[[Page S4310]]\n\nwho for 30 years have utilized this legislation in order to adjust \ntheir status.\n  Second, this sends a signal that we believe, as the Senator from \nWyoming alluded, that we think the situation in Cuba has changed so \ndramatically that now legislation passed 30 years ago is a dinosaur, is \nan anachronism, and no longer serves a legitimate purpose.\n  In fact, Mr. President, you can read as recently as this morning's \nWashington Post an article that states:\n\n       Cuba Slows Changes, Reemphasizes Ideology, Tighter U.S. \n     Embargo Draws Vow From Castro ``to Resist Another 35 Years.''\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article from the \nWashington Post of April 29 be printed in the Record immediately after \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I cite this as the most recent evidence of \nthe fact that we are not dealing with an anachronism. Fidel Castro is \nan anachronism. But the Cuban Adjustment Act, which was designed to \nrespond to the human rights abuses, to the circumstances that forced \nthousands of native citizens of Cuba to flee that country, \nunfortunately, the Cuban Adjustment Act still serves its humanitarian \npurpose in 1996 as it did when it was adopted by the Congress in 1966.\n  Third, the adoption of the language in 1664 would have the practical \neffect of turning a substantial amount of the U.S. immigration policy, \nsubstantial amount of our responsibilities to make decisions as to what \nis in the best interests of the United States of America, over to Fidel \nCastro.\n  Why is that? All Fidel Castro would have to do, if this language in \nSenate bill 1664 were to be adopted, would be to abrogate the Cuban \nAdjustment Act, the Cuban Migration Agreement of 1995, and no person \nwould henceforth be eligible to utilize the Cuban Adjustment Act as a \nmeans of changing their status and securing the benefits of permanent \nresidence in the United States.\n  We would be telling Fidel Castro, ``If you wish to amend United \nStates immigration law, all you have to do is abrogate the only window \nwhich is now available by which a Cuban citizen who has flown the \ntyranny of your government to secure the benefits that have been \navailable for 30 years to tens of thousands people to adjust their \nstatus.'' I do not think this Congress wants to accede to Fidel Castro \nthe ability to influence our policy.\n  Mr. President, I do not think the Cuban Adjustment Act needs to be a \npermanent part of American law. Frankly, I wish it had never been \nnecessary. I wish once it was determined necessary and enacted, it \nwould have been in a position to have been repealed as quickly as \npossible because its existence is testimony to Fidel Castro's continued \nexistence and tyrannical rule over the citizens of the island of Cuba.\n  So, Mr. President, what I propose, joined by a number of our \ncolleagues, including Senators Dole, Mack, Abraham, Bradley, and Helms, \nis an alternative approach. Our amendment would say that the Cuban \nAdjustment Act shall be repealed, but it shall be repealed only upon a \ndetermination by the President under the Cuban Liberty and Democratic \nSolidarity Act of 1996--what is frequently referred to as the Helms-\nBurton legislation--only when a determination has been made by the \nPresident pursuant to the standards in that legislation that in fact a \ndemocratically elected government is now in power in Cuba. Once there \nis a democratic government in Cuba, then the need for the Cuban \nAdjustment Act will have been fulfilled, and there would be a \ncelebration of repeal of the Cuban Adjustment Act.\n  So, Mr. President, I believe this amendment has been filed as No. \n3760 with the provision that I have just stated.\n  Mr. President, I urge this Senate not to precipitously adopt the \nlanguage that is in 1664, not to close the opportunity for thousands of \nCubans, Cubans who arrived prior to the Cuban Migration Agreement of \n1995, and those Cubans who arrived under it in a status other than \nparolees.\n  Let us not inadvertently send a signal to Fidel Castro that, in spite \nof the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, we have found some reason \nto believe there has been a transformation, a reformation, from the \ntyranny of 35 years into a government in which we are prepared to give \nsome respect and dignity. The fact is no such transformation has \noccurred, and we do not wish to give such evidence that there has been. \nWe certainly do not wish to turn over to Fidel Castro the ability to \naffect our immigration laws.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment which is at the \ndesk, and look forward to its consideration at the earliest opportunity \ntomorrow.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 29, 1996]\n\n Cuba Slows Changes, Reemphasizes Ideology--Tighter U.S. Embargo Draws \n             Vow From Castro ``To Resist Another 35 Years''\n\n                           (By Douglas Farah)\n\n       Havana.--Facing a freeze in Cuban-U.S. relations and \n     slipping state control of the economy, Cuba's ruling \n     Communist Party has slowed moves toward free-market \n     economics, raised pressure on dissidents and reemphasized its \n     orthodox Marxist rhetoric.\n       Around the country, old propaganda signs are being \n     refreshed, new billboards denouncing the U.S. economic \n     embargo are going up, and buildings housing the Committees \n     for the Defense of the Revolution are being repaired. \n     Reaffirming the Marxist, socialist nature of the Cuban \n     revolution is again the focal point of speeches.\n       While changes permitting some private enterprise and \n     foreign investment will not be rolled back, according to \n     senior government officials and diplomats, the pace of future \n     moves toward a market economy--especially those related to \n     increasing self-employment--are likely to slow down or be put \n     on hold.\n       President Fidel Castro, in a ceremony on April 16 marking \n     35th anniversary of his declaration of the revolution as \n     socialist, said that Cuba has resisted pressure to change and \n     that ``we're prepared to resist another 35 years, and 35 \n     times 35 years.''\n       In part, the call to return to ideological purity reflects \n     increased concern that a growing sector of the economy in \n     moving out from under state control, according to diplomats \n     and Cubans analysts. Another factor often cited is increased \n     government optimism that this year's crucial sugar harvest is \n     on target to reach 4.5 million tons, up from last year's \n     disastrous 3.3 million tons, the lowest in 40 years.\n       If the harvest reaches that goal, the government will be \n     able to pay off the $300 million in commercial loans it took \n     out last year, at 18 percent interest, to rebuild the \n     industry, which is vital to returning the economy to \n     sustained growth. Official figures show the economy shrank \n     by 36 percent from 1989 to 1992, following the collapse of \n     the Soviet Bloc, which heavily subsidized Cuba.\n       Since 1993, Cuba has legalized use of dollars, authorized \n     limited self-employment, allowed farmers to sell surplus \n     produce on the open market and offered cash incentives to \n     workers in key sectors of the economy to produce more. The \n     result has been not only an upturn in the economy, but also \n     the creation of a class with access to goods and services not \n     available to those who work for the state at fixed wages in \n     Cuban pesos, usually about $16 a month.\n       ``We need time to assimilate and consolidate the steps we \n     have already taken, especially in self-employment,'' Alfredo \n     Gonzalez, senior adviser in the Ministry of Economics and \n     Planning, said in an interview. ``The moves have had \n     contradictory effects. When some people start to get rich, it \n     has a social impact. University professors and social \n     workers, who earn only in pesos, are starting to ask, `When \n     will it be my turn?' ''\n       Some of the party faithful are not waiting. A professor of \n     Marxism at the University of Havana can be found most nights \n     harmonizing with a musical trio that strolls through a plush \n     dollar restaurant, singing romantic ballads for tips. He said \n     he made more in two nights there than at his academic job in \n     a month.\n       University students, long praised as the vanguard of the \n     revolution, are trying desperately to get into business \n     administration and computer classes. According to academic \n     sources, only seven students signed up last semester to study \n     Marxism, once one of the most popular courses.\n       The opening salvo in the ideological rollback was fired by \n     Raul Castro, brother of the president and head of the armed \n     forces, in a March 23 speech to a meeting of the party's 212-\n     member Central Committee. It was only the fifth full meeting \n     of the committee since Fidel Castro took over in 1959, and \n     the first since 1992.\n       Raul Castro called for renewed ideological vigor, \n     especially in the watch committees. He sharply criticized \n     some parts of the economic changes already implemented, \n     including foreign influences spread through the growing \n     tourism industry, and the relative wealth of some people who \n     are now legally allowed to form their own small businesses.\n       ``Fundamentally, it is understood that ideology is at the \n     root of everything.'' Raul Castro said.\n       The meeting was held a month after Cuban-U.S. relations \n     took their sharpest plunge in three decades, when Cuban air \n     force shot down two small airplanes belonging to the Miami-\n     based exile group Brothers to the Rescue. In response, \n     President Clinton signed into law the Helms-Burton Act, which \n     seeks to strengthen the 34-year-old U.S. economic embargo \n     against Cuba.\n\n[[Page S4311]]\n\n       Using the threat of covert U.S. operations, the Cuban \n     government stepped up attacks on dissident groups, \n     independent journalist and even reformist academic groups \n     that were largely financed by the Communist-Party. Academic \n     sources said that committees are reviewing the work of \n     academic centers, their finances and their foreign contacts.\n       The tone was set by Raul Castro, who accused the United \n     States of financing ``the proliferation and growth of small \n     groups of traitors within the country.''\n       Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly, \n     defended the crackdown on Communist Party-financed think \n     tanks, which won international attention by pushing for \n     faster, deeper economic change. ``The party has the right to \n     question and analyze whether a center that depends on it for \n     material and human resources is doing what it is supposed to \n     do, and if not, to correct things,'' he said.\n       Rep. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), representing the United \n     States at the U.N. Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva, \n     accused Havana last week of carrying out ``the most \n     repressive wave we have seen in the recent history of Cuba.'' \n     On Tuesday, the commission passed a resolution condemning \n     Cuba for not allowing freedom of assembly and expression.\n       Caught in the middle are the dissidents themselves.\n       Vladimiro Roca, a dissident whose father, Blas Roca, was a \n     founder of the Cuban Communist Party, said he is awaiting a \n     crackdown. ``Our meetings are being blocked, we can no longer \n     get foreign newspapers, it is getting ever more hard,'' Roca \n     said in an interview at his home. ``The shoot-down and the \n     Helms-Burton act have made life more difficult.''\n       But just how tough mobilizing people has become was tacitly \n     acknowledged by Raul Castro when he said people's ``number \n     one daily concern is food.'' Still, he called for \n     revitalizing the watch committees, powerful political \n     structures set up in each block of every city and town to \n     monitor ideology and instill revolutionary fervor.\n       Instead of going to meetings, people spend much of their \n     time trying to put food on the table or seeking scarce \n     transportation to work or markets. The committees gradually \n     have lost influence, especially around Havana, and in some \n     areas hold almost no meetings.\n       Officials and businesses people who travel here regularly \n     said two reform programs already approved are still on track. \n     One is to revive a commercial banking system abandoned in the \n     1960s, and the other is to break down large state companies \n     into smaller, more efficient units.\n       Gonzalez and Alarcon said one of the pending changes most \n     cherished by reformers and long rumored to be imminent--\n     allowing the creation of small and mid-size companies under \n     private overship--is being studied, but there are no plans to \n     go ahead with it soon.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, under the rules under which we are \ncurrently operating, the amendment 3760 has been filed.\n  Would the appropriate motion be to call up the amendment at this \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                amendment no. 3760 to amendment no. 3743\n\n  (Purpose: To condition the repeal of the Cuban Adjustment Act on a \n       democratically elected government in Cuba being in power)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham], for himself, Mr. \n     Dole, Mr. Mack, and Mr. Abraham, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3760 to amendment No. 3743.\n       Beginning on page 177, strike line 13 and all that follows \n     through line 4 on page 178, inserting the following:\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the \n     repeal of Public Law 89-732 made by this Act shall become \n     effective only upon a determination by the President under \n     section 203(c)(3) of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic \n     Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996 that a democratically \n     elected government in Cuba is in power.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President I thank the Senator from Florida.\n  This is an issue that continues, and I hope my colleagues can hear it \nand understand what it is that we have done here over the years.\n  This is the Cuban Adjustment Act. It has not anything to do with the \nCuban-Haitian Adjustment Act. This is a measure that went on the books \nin the early 1960's when the freedom flotillas were bringing in \nhundreds of thousands of Cubans who were being given parole. People \nsay, ``What is parole?'' It is a very distinctive remedy. It is just \nbringing them here, really outside the scope of immigration laws, in a \nsense. It is a temporary status, and the only way to change to \npermanent status is through adjustment. Hence, the Cuban Adjustment \nAct.\n  The Cuban Adjustment Act is a relic of the freedom flights of the \n1960's and freedom flotillas in the late 1970's. The Senate repealed it \nfirst in 1982, if I recall, and then it went to the House, and it was \nleft out of conference. The Senate has repealed it again--I do not \nrecall that date--and it was replaced in conference.\n  At the time of the original Cuban Adjustment Act--it was a time of \ncrisis, obviously a time of crisis has been continuing in that part of \nthe world--Cubans were brought to the United States by the tens of \nthousands, even the hundreds of thousands. Most were given this parole \nstatus, which is this indefinite status which you cannot remain in, and \nit requires an ``adjustment'' in order to receive a permanent immigrant \nstatus in the United States.\n  So since we welcomed these Cubans, and we should have, and we \nintended that they remain here, the Cuban Adjustment Act provided--and \nhere is the issue--that after 1 year in the United States of America \nall Cubans could claim a green card and become permanent residents \nhere.\n  Since 1980, we have discouraged, thoroughly discouraged the illegal \nentry of Cubans, and there is no longer any need for the Cuban \nAdjustment Act. The provision in the bill which repeals the Cuban \nAdjustment Act exempts--and I hope all hear this--those Cubans who come \nunder the current agreement between the Castro Government and the \nClinton administration. Those 20,000 Cubans per year who are chosen by \nlottery and otherwise to come here, under that agreement they will be \nable to have their status adjusted under the committee bill provisions. \nThere is no change in the status of those people. However, other than \nthat one exception, there is simply no need for the Cuban Adjustment \nAct, and it should be repealed.\n  It is very clear. No other group or nationality in the world, \nregardless of what is going on in their country, no other group or \nnationality in the world, in the entire world is able to get a green \ncard merely by coming to the United States legally or illegally and \nremaining here for a year.\n  That is what you have here. It is an extraordinary thing. Millions of \npersons who have a legal right to immigrate, to join family here, are \nwaiting in the backlog sometimes for 15 or 20 years. It makes no sense \nto allow a Cuban to come here illegally on a raft or an inner tube or \nto fly in with a visitor's visa to see friends in Miami and then simply \nstay on a year, violating our laws in doing so, and then be rewarded \nwith the most precious thing we can give, and that is the green card. \nIt strains all reason.\n  You have a situation where a person comes on a tourist visa, goes \nimmediately to the home of a relative in Florida, stays there, to be \nsure to pick up a receipt or show something they did with a date on it, \na rent receipt or something, and in a year you go into the INS and you \nshow anything you have to show that you have been here a year and you \nget a green card.\n  We do not do that with people fleeing the most oppressive realms on \nthe Earth. We do not do it with anybody. It is a total anachronism. It \ndoes not fit. I know that we are all trying to whack Cuba and whack \nCastro. I am ready to do that day and night. I admire what Senator \nHelms has been up to on that. There are others--Senator Graham, Senator \nConnie Mack--I understand that, and I have joined that. But if we are \ngoing to have a law on the books which does not have anything to do \nwith oppression, it has to do with the most remarkable lapse that we \ncan ever imagine in our immigration law, the Cuban Adjustment Act I \nthink should be repealed.\n  Even though this is a different and quite unique amendment than \npreviously, it still is a situation where it is the only country on the \nface of the Earth where you come, stick around a year under any \ncircumstances--even if you violated the law--and walk in and get a \ngreen card, whereas if anybody else did that, if they had their \nadjustment lapse, they would be pitched.\n  So that is where we are. It is an interesting vote again. We will \nmake the decision and move on. It has been thoroughly debated in years \npast, and I admire my friend from Florida. You cannot represent Florida \nand not do this. Senator Connie Mack is the same. And I understand \nthat. For anyone who would miss the significance, this is\n\n[[Page S4312]]\n\nvery critically important for them to be doing, and they do it with \ngreat directness and authenticity, and I commend them.\n  Mr. President, since there seems to be a lack of spirited debate on \nthis issue, I wonder if the Senator from Florida would wish to go \nforward with the second amendment and perhaps debate that and then when \nSenator Kennedy returns, I believe he is supporting the Senator's \nposition, is that not correct? Is Senator Kennedy supporting the \nSenator's position on this?\n  I am trying to determine if we have proponents and opponents, but we \nneed not do that. If the Senator is ready to go forward with the second \namendment, I would ask that we simply set aside this amendment for the \nmoment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate the cordiality of our \ncolleague from Wyoming. I would move on to the second amendment, which \nis really one of what I anticipate will be a cluster of amendments. \nAgain, it goes to an issue raised in the previous amendment, which is \nthat while we are dealing with the bill S. 1664 that has as its title: \n``To Increase Control Over Immigration in the United States by \nIncreasing Border Patrol and Investigative Personnel,'' et cetera, a \nbill designed to restrain illegal immigration, in fact there are \nprovisions which apply substantially or totally to persons who are in \nthe country legally.\n  Many of those provisions also go to a second major concern for the \nstructure of this legislation, and that is the degree to which it \nrepresents a significant unfunded mandate, a transfer of financial \nobligations from the Federal Government to State and local communities.\n  Mr. President, for many years, as you well know, I have been \nseriously concerned with the fact that while the Federal Government has \nthe total responsibility for determining what our immigration policy \nwill be and has the total responsibility for enforcing that immigration \npolicy, where the policy is either misguided or where the policy is \nbreached, it is the local communities and the States in which the \naliens reside that most of the impact is felt. That impact is \nparticularly felt in the area of the delivery of critical public \nservices, from health care to education to financial assistance in time \nof need. It has been my feeling that fundamentally the Federal \nGovernment ought to be responsible for all dimensions of the \nimmigration issue. It sets the rules. It enforces the rules. It should \nbe responsible when the rules are not adequately enforced and there are \nimpacts, especially financial impacts on individual communities.\n\n  Thus, I am concerned with this legislation, which instead of moving \nin the direction I think represents fair and balanced policy, goes in \nthe opposite direction and is now going to have the Federal Government \nwithdrawing from its level of financial responsibility for legal as \nwell as illegal aliens, and will be, by its default, imposing that \nresponsibility on the communities and States in which the aliens live.\n  Compounding that is the uncertainty of just which of these programs \nthat are intended to provide some assistance to the alien will be \naffected by this shift of responsibility. As currently written, S. 1664 \nwould require that the income of the sponsor, that is the person who is \nsponsoring the legal alien to come into the United States, would \nrequire that the sponsor's income be deemed to be the income of the \nalien for ``any program of assistance provided or funded in whole or in \npart by the Federal Government, by any State or local government entity \nfor which eligibility for benefits is based on need.'' That is the \nstandard by which there will be this transfer of responsibility, \nassumedly, from the Federal Government to the sponsor of the legal \nalien. But in reality, if that sponsor is not able to meet his \nobligations, it is going to be a transfer to the local community, \nprivate philanthropy, or government services, when the legal alien \nbecomes old, unemployed, injured, or otherwise in need of services that \nhe or she is unable to pay for.\n  The amendment which I am offering, which has been filed as No. 3803, \nand in which I am joined by Senator Specter, says if we are going to do \nthis, if we are going to require this deeming, that at least we ought \nto know precisely what it is we are talking about because no one can \nsay, reading the language that I just quoted from the legislation, what \nprograms, Federal, State or local, would be impacted by these very \nbroad and sweeping words.\n  What are some of the programs? I would like to ask the sponsors and \nsupporters of the bill whether or not the following programs are \nintended to be impacted by S. 1664.\n  Minnesota has a program called ``MinnesotaCare,'' would that be \naffected? Rhode Island's ``Rite Care,'' would that be affected? Hawaii \nhas a program called ``Healthy Start,'' would that be affected? My own \nState of Florida has a program called ``Healthy Kids,'' would that be \naffected? Texas's ``Crippled Children's'' program, Chapter I programs \nin the public schools, Maryland's ``Minds Across Maryland,'' Florida's \n``Children's Emergency Services,'' Texas's ``Indigent Health Care,'' \nlocal government public defenders, immunization programs in public \nhealth clinics, services in our Nation's public hospitals, State and \nlocal public health services, programs to take children out of abusive \nenvironments, gang prevention programs, children's lunches and \nnutrition programs, special education programs--which of these are \nintended to be covered?\n  Whatever you think about the underlying policy, there can certainly \nbe no virtue in ambiguity. At least the people at the State and \ncommunity level, citizens and those charged with the responsibility for \nproviding services alike, we owe to them the obligation of clarity of \nwhat it is we intend, in terms of those programs that will be affected \nby the sweeping language, ``any program of assistance provided or \nfunded in whole or in part, for which eligibility for benefits is based \non need'', shall require deeming.\n  For example, Virginia uses Community Development Block Grant money to \nfund community centers and extension services that provide lunch \nprograms, after-school tutoring, English classes, and recreational \nsports programs to residents of the community. Will Virginia have to \ndeem participants in everything from children's soccer leagues to \nmobile meals to English classes? Do we intend that? If we do, let us \nsay so.\n\n  Program providers, State and local governments and others, including \nthe public, need to know the answers to these questions and more. They \ndeserve nothing less. Moreover, Members of Congress should know the \nimpact of the legislation before we are asked to decide as to whether \nit is appropriate public policy, policy to be enacted into laws of the \nUnited States of America. The majority leader said on the Senate floor \nduring the debate of the unfunded mandates legislation on January 4 of \n1995:\n\n       Mr. President, the time has come for a little legislative \n     truth in advertising. Before Members of Congress vote for a \n     piece of legislation they need to know how it would impact \n     the States and localities they represent. If Members of \n     Congress want to pass a new law, they should be willing to \n     make the tough choices needed to pay for it.\n\n  The underlying bill, S. 1664, fails to meet these tests as \nestablished by the majority leader. Members of Congress have no idea \nwhat programs will be impacted by this legislation. Are 60 programs \nimpacted? Are 88 programs? Are 417 programs? Are 3,812 programs? We \nhave no idea and we will not, until regulations are implemented or the \ncourts have decided what the meaning is of the phrase, programs by \nwhich ``eligibility for benefits is based on need.'' Why should we turn \nover such a decision to regulators and the courts? We should decide. We \nshould partake in a little ``legislative truth-in-advertisin'' \nourselves.\n  Moreover, Members of Congress have not made the tough choices needed \nto pay for it. In fact, the National Conference of State Legislators \nhas prepared a study to determine the imposed impact these deeming \nrequirements will have, that is the requirement that the sponsor be \nfinancially responsible for the sponsored alien who is applying for a \nneeds-based program. The National Conference of State Legislators has \nprepared a study on just 10 of those programs which they believe will \nprobably be impacted. The programs that the NCSL studied were school \nlunch, school breakfast, child and adult care food programs, vocational \nrehabilitation, title 20 social service block\n\n[[Page S4313]]\n\ngrants, foster care, title IV-A child care, title IV-D child support, \nand Medicaid qualified Medicare beneficiaries.\n  The administrative costs alone of deeming these programs, of \ndetermining who is and who is not eligible, would exceed $700 million, \naccording to the National Conference of State Legislators study. As a \nresult, the National Conference of State Legislators, the National \nAssociation of Counties, and the National League of Cities have \nendorsed the amendment which is before the Senate this evening, to \nsubstitute a clear and concrete list of programs to be deemed. As they \nwrite, ``This amendment assures that Congress and not the courts will \ndecide which programs are deemed.''\n  Let me repeat. This amendment assures that Congress, and not the \ncourts, will decide which programs are deemed.\n  If the Senate chooses to impose new administrative requirements on \nState and local governments, we should do so, as the majority leader \nsaid, and ``be willing to make the tough choices needed to pay for \nit.''\n  For these reasons, we take a different approach by eliminating the \nvague language which is in S. 1664 and replacing that vague language \nwith a list of 16 specific programs that would be required to be \nimplemented under the new deeming provisions.\n  These programs are: Aid to Families with Dependent Children, \nSupplemental Security Income, food stamps, section 8 low-income housing \nassistance, low rent public housing, section 236 interest reduction \npayments, homeowner assisted payments under the National Housing Act, \nHUD low-income rent supplements, rural housing loans, rural rental \nhousing loans, rural rental assistance, rural housing repair loans and \ngrants, farm labor housing loans and grants, rural housing preservation \ngrants, rural self-help technical assistance grants, and site loans.\n  Those would be the 16 programs that would be subjected to deeming.\n  Mr. President, I do not submit that these 16 programs came from a \nmountain and were inscribed on tablets. These are 16 programs which we \nand responsible organizations have identified as what they think would \nbe appropriate to apply the deeming standard. If someone wishes to \nsubtract or add to or modify this list, that would be the subject of a \nreasonable debate. But we would be in a position to be telling States \nand local communities and their citizens exactly what we mean. We would \nbe deciding to which programs we would apply this requirement that the \nincome of the sponsor be added to the income of the alien in \ndetermining eligibility. We would not be leaving that judgment up to \nbureaucrats through regulation or to the courts through laborious \nlitigation.\n  I will be happy to work with the sponsors of this bill to work out an \nagreement with the State and local units impacted by deeming so what \nprograms should be included will be understood and, hopefully, will be \nthe result of a consensus judgment. However, I firmly agree with the \nmajority leader that we should at least have a little ``legislative \ntruth-in-advertising.''\n  In addition to the strong support of the National Conference of State \nLegislators, the National Association of Counties, and the National \nLeague of Cities, this amendment is also supported by the National \nAssociation of Public Hospitals, the American Association of Community \nColleges, Catholic Charities, United States Catholic Conference, and \nthe Council of Jewish Federation among others.\n  Mr. President, this is the first of what I anticipate will be a \nseries of amendments that relate to the issue of the eligibility of \nlegal aliens to receive a variety of benefits and the circumstances \nunder which the Federal Government should restrict its, as well as \nother governments's ability to provide those need-based services for \nlegal immigrants.\n  This is not a matter which should pass quietly and without considered \njudgment, particularly in a bill which advertises itself as dealing \nwith illegal aliens. We are here talking, Mr. President, about the \nfinancial rights of access to public programs of people who are in the \ncountry legally, who have played by the rules that we have established, \nwho are paying taxes, who are subject to virtually all the requirements \nthat apply to citizens, except the right to vote and the right to serve \non juries. Yet, we are about to say in a retroactive way, including to \nthose persons already in the country today under the standards that \nwere applicable when they entered, that they are going to have their \nrights severely restricted and without clarity as to what those \nrestricted rights will be.\n  I think that is bad policy. I think it violates the principles of the \nunfunded mandate legislation, the first legislation to be passed by \nthis Congress. I think it undercuts the essential thrust of the \nlegislation that is intended to be dealing with the impact of illegal \nimmigrants.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3803 to Amendment No. 3743\n\n(Purpose: To clarify and enumerate specific public assistance programs \n          with respect to which the deeming provisions apply)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So, Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3803.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham], for himself and Mr. \n     Specter, proposes an amendment numbered 3803 to amendment No. \n     3743.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 198, beginning on line 11, strike all through page \n     201, line 4, and insert the following: for benefits, the \n     income and resources described in subsection (b) shall, \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law, be deemed to be \n     the income and resources of such alien for purposes of the \n     following programs:\n       (1) Supplementary security income under title XVI of the \n     Social Security Act;\n       (2) Aid to Families with Dependent Children under title IV \n     of the Social Security Act;\n       (3) Food stamps under the Food Stamp Act of 1977;\n       (4) Section 8 low-income housing assistance under the \n     United States Housing Act of 1937;\n       (5) Low-rent public housing under the United States Housing \n     Act of 1937;\n       (6) Section 236 interest reduction payments under the \n     National Housing Act;\n       (7) Home-owner assistance payments under the National \n     Housing Act;\n       (8) Low income rent supplements under the Housing and Urban \n     Development Act of 1965;\n       (9) Rural housing loans under the Housing Act of 1949;\n       (10) Rural rental housing loans under the Housing Act of \n     1949;\n       (11) Rural rental assistance under the Housing Act of 1949;\n       (12) Rural housing repair loans and grants under the \n     Housing Act of 1949;\n       (13) Farm labor housing loans and grants under the Housing \n     act of 1949;\n       (14) Rural housing preservation grants under the Housing \n     Act of 1949;\n       (15) Rural self-help technical assistance grants under the \n     Housing Act of 1949;\n       (16) Site loans under the Housing Act of 1949; and\n       (b) Deemed Income and Resources.--The income and resources \n     described in this subsection include the income and resources \n     of--\n       (1) any person who, as a sponsor of an alien's entry into \n     the United States, or in order to enable an alien lawfully to \n     remain in the United States, executed an affidavit of support \n     or similar agreement with respect to such alien, and\n       (2) the sponsor's spouse.\n       (c) Length of Deeming Perior.--The requirement of \n     subsection (a) shall apply for the period for which the \n     sponsor has agreed, in such affidavit or agreement, to \n     provide support for such alien, or for a period of 5 years \n     beginning on the day such alien was first lawfully in the \n     United States after the execution of such affidavit or \n     agreement, whichever period is longer.\n       (d) Exception for indigence.--\n       (1) In general.--If a determination described in paragraph \n     (2) is made, the amount of income and resources of the \n     sponsor or the sponsor's spouse which shall be attributed to \n     the sponsored alien shall not exceed the amount actually \n     provided for a period--\n       (A) beginning on the date of such determination and ending \n     12 months after such date, or\n       (B) if the address of the sponsor is unknown to the \n     sponsored alien, beginning on the date of such determination \n     and ending on the date that is 12 months after the address of \n     the sponsor becomes known to the sponsored alien or to the \n     agency (which shall inform such alien of the address within 7 \n     days).\n       (2) Determination described.--A determination described in \n     this paragraph is a determination by an agency that a \n     sponsored alien would, in the absence of the assistance \n     provided by the agency, be unable to obtain food or shelter, \n     taking into account the alien's own income, plus any cash, \n     food, housing, or other assistance provided by other \n     individuals, including the sponsor.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S4314]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I know there is an obligation for many of \nus at 6:45. I am going to be very brief, and I will cover this issue in \nmore complete detail tomorrow so that we might meet those obligations.\n  This is a very fascinating amendment. It is, I gather, a list of only \nthe issues or the programs that would be deemed to be income. I hope \npeople can hear what we are trying to do here. There are two choices: \nEither the sponsor pays for a legal immigrant or the taxpayers do. That \nis about the simplest kind of discussion I can come to.\n  This issue of deeming is very simple. Deeming is this, and I hope we \ncan try to keep toward this in the debate: The purpose of deeming is to \nmake the sponsor of the immigrant responsible for the needs of the \nimmigrant relative, that immigrant relative that the sponsor brought to \nthis country.\n  Everything we have done here with regard to this immigration issue, \nincluding the new affidavit support requirements, says if you bring \nyour relative to the United States, you are going to be sure that they \ndo not become a public charge. That has been the law since 1884 in the \nUnited States of America.\n\n  The question is very simple. Either you deem the income of the \nsponsor, and every other thing that this person is going to get, or the \ntaxpayer will pave to pick up the slack. That is where it is. Any other \nassistance will be required to be picked up by the citizens of the \nUnited States.\n  If you are going to be specific, as in this amendment--and remember \nthat we are told that this is for clarity--these are the issues, these \nare the programs that are deemed to be judged as support. We have not \neven talked about Medicaid, Pell grants, State general assistance, \nlegal services, low-income heating, as if they were not there.\n  This is one that needs the clear light of morning, the brilliant sun \ncoming over the eastern hills so we can pierce this veil, because this \nis a concept that will assure that someone who sponsors a legal \nimmigrant will be off the hook and that an agency will provide services \nand not be able to go back against the sponsor.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, the whole purpose of this exercise is to say, \n``If you bring in a legal immigrant, you give an affidavit of support, \nyou pledge that your assets are considered to be the assets of that \nperson. And that will be so for 5 years or until naturalization. And if \nyou do not choose to do that, then know that the sponsor is off the \nhook and the taxpayers are on the hook.'' I do not think that is what \nthe public charge provision of the law ever would have provided.\n  With that, Mr. President, unless the Senator from Florida has \nsomething further, I will go to wrap up, if I may. I thank the Senator \nfrom Florida for his courtesy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/29/senate-section/article/S4308-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to pay \ntribute to a woman who has dedicated her life to battling homelessness \nin Vermont. Sister Lucille Bonvouloir is the unofficial Patron Saint \nfor the homeless in Burlington, the State's largest city and only \nEnterprise Community. The Committee on Temporary Shelter [COTS], an \norganization that she has directed since 1988, provides a range of \nsocial services as well as basic shelter to help people who have hit \nbottom get back on their feet again. As the problem of homelessness in \nBurlington has grown, so has COTS under Sister Lucille's innovative and \ncapable direction.\n  In July, Sister Lucille will be taking on new responsibilities as the \nvice president of the Vermont Regional Sisters of Mercy. While she will \nbe sorely missed and the shoes she leaves behind at COTS are large \nindeed, the homeless and the needy of Burlington have nothing to fear \nfrom the transition. They know as I do that their guardian angel will \ncontinue to watch over them and stand up for their needs as she has for \nso many years. I join them in wishing her the best in her new career.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the February 7, 1996 \nBurlington Free Press on Sister Lucille Bonvouloir's life of service to \nBurlington be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Sister Bonvouloir To Work With Sisters of Mercy\n\n                           (By Mike Donoghue)\n\n       A Burlington nun known as a fighter for providing shelter \n     and vocational training for homeless people said Tuesday that \n     she would step down in June as head of the largest program \n     for the Vermont homeless.\n       Sister Lucille Bonvouloir will leave her post as executive \n     director of the Committee on Temporary Shelter to become vice \n     president of the Vermont Regional Sisters of Mercy on July 1.\n       Sister Bonvouloir and the agency, better known as COTS, \n     provided services to 1,100 individuals through seven programs \n     operated in Burlington last year.\n       The Orwell native said she expects to face new battles when \n     she becomes part of the team managing the affairs of the 93 \n     Sisters of Mercy serving Vermont. Among the expected scuffles \n     will be a proposed 93-unit affordable housing development the \n     sisters hope to build on the north side of Mount St. Mary's \n     Convent on Mansfield Avenue.\n       The project will be ideal for single mothers who are \n     returning to school at nearby Trinity College, she said. It \n     is opposed by residents who say it is too large for the \n     neighborhood.\n       Sister Bonvouloir, 53, has worked for the committee since \n     1986 and has been its director since June 1988. She helped \n     expand the programs to meet the needs in the community for \n     family shelters and vocational training.\n       When the number of homeless families increased, the COTS \n     Family Shelter opened on North Champlain Street in 1988. When \n     there was chronic shortage of affordable housing, COTS \n     developed St. John's Hall on Elmwood Avenue.\n       During 1993-94, Sister Lucille improved access to \n     vocational programs and created a voice mail system in \n     Burlington to increase employment prospects for those without \n     phones. Last year, 70 percent of the participants in the \n     vocational program were placed in full-time jobs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/29/senate-section/article/S4314-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4314-S4315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNITED STATES-JAPAN AVIATION RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the most recent \nin what seems to be a never ending list of crises we have had in the \npast year with the Government of Japan regarding international aviation \nrelations.\n  The root of the current problem, and a number of those which have \npreceded it, is the Government of Japan's continued refusal to fully \ncomply with the United States-Japan bilateral aviation agreement. The \nGovernment of Japan incorrectly believes selective compliance with our \nbilateral aviation agreement is acceptable. The Japanese are badly \nmistaken. Nothing short of full compliance with the United States-Japan \nbilateral aviation agreement is acceptable.\n  Let me explain. The United States-Japan bilateral aviation agreement \nguarantees three United States-carriers--United Airlines, Northwest \nAirlines, and Federal Express--``beyond rights'' which authorize them \nto fly to Japan, take on additional passengers and cargo, and then fly \nto another country. That agreement requires the Government of Japan to \nauthorize new beyond routes no more than 45 days after one of these \nthree carriers files notice of an intention to initiate new beyond \nservice. If this sounds like a relatively straightforward procedure, it \nis.\n  Regrettably, the Government of Japan has made the procedure of \ninitiating new beyond service anything but straightforward and \npredictable. Instead, contrary to the United States-Japan bilateral \naviation agreement, they have turned a ``notice and fly'' provision \ninto an approval process where the litmus test seems to be whether \ncompetition from a new route operated by a United States carrier \nthreatens less competitive incumbent Japanese carriers. In fact, the \noverriding goal seems to be nothing less than imposing a de facto \nfreeze on new air service by United States carriers beyond Japan. This \nviolates the letter as well as the spirit of the United States-Japan \nbilateral aviation agreement and is intolerable.\n\n[[Page S4315]]\n\n  Mr. President, I have spoken about the problem at hand numerous times \nin this body. Unfortunately, it remains unresolved. More than a year \nago, United Airlines notified the Government of Japan of its intention \nto start new beyond service between Osaka and Seoul, Korea. Although \nUnited Airlines is clearly authorized to operate this new service, the \nJapanese continue to refuse to permit it to do so. Unquestionably, \nUnited Airlines and its employee-owners have, and are continuing to, \npay a very steep financial price for Japan's decision to wrongly deny \nit this valuable economic opportunity.\n  The Japanese, unfortunately, have repeatedly rebuffed attempts by the \nadministration to redress this violation. In fact, the most recent \nattempt was met by a threat from the Japanese that they may impose \nlimits on new service by United States carriers between Los Angeles and \nTokyo, even though the service in question is guaranteed by the United \nStates-Japan bilateral aviation agreement without the threatened \nlimitations. Make no mistake about it, whenever United States carriers \nare denied opportunities, the U.S. economy loses and tourism-related \njobs in the United States are lost.\n  Consistent with an amendment I offered last year on United States-\nJapan aviation relations that is now part of Public Law 104-50, the \nadministration has finally drawn a line in the sand to hopefully \nresolve this violation. Namely, the administration has put on hold \nJapan Airlines' request for service between Tokyo and Kona, Hawaii \nuntil the Japanese respect United Airlines' right to provide new \nservice beyond Japan. Even though I regret temporarily depriving Hawaii \nof a new tourism opportunity, we simply should not agree to expand \ncommercial opportunities for a Japanese carrier in the United States at \nthe same time the Government of Japan is wrongly denying a United \nStates carrier opportunities in the Asia-Pacific market.\n  Although the words of the Government of Japan suggest it wants to \nmove forward in United States-Japan aviation relations, Japan's actions \nare preventing us from doing so. Moreover, the Government of Japan's \ncontinued failure to fully comply with the existing agreement is \neroding the trust needed to secure a broader agreement that will create \nnew air service opportunities for all United States and Japanese \ncarriers between and beyond our two countries.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying I hope the Government of \nJapan resolves the Tokyo-Kona problem it created by immediately \ncomplying with the United States-Japan bilateral aviation agreement. \nAlso, I hope the Japanese will not compound the current problem by \nfollowing through on its threat to impose countermeasures against \nUnited Airlines and Northwest Airlines if the Tokyo-Kona problem is not \nresolved to its satisfaction. Clearly, that would further undermine \nJapan's stated goal of moving forward in our aviation relationship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/29/senate-section/article/S4314-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/29/senate-section/article/S4315-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT OF A SUSPENSION UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED \n  AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996--MESSAGE FROM THE \n    PRESIDENT RECEIVED DURING THE ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE--PM 141\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 1995, \nthe Secretary of the Senate on April 26, 1996, received a message from \nthe President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Appropriations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I hereby report that I have exercised the authority provided to me \nunder subsection 325(c) of the Department of the Interior and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Act, 1996, to suspend subsection 325(a) and \n325(b) of such Act.

This Strategy carries forward the policies and \nprinciples of the 1994 and 1995 Strategies. It describes new directions \nand initiatives to confront the ever-changing challenges of drug abuse \nand trafficking.\n  This past March I convened the White House Leadership Conference on \nYouth, Drug Use, and Violence in order to focus the Nation's attention \non two major health problems faced by young people today--drug use and \nviolence. The conference brought together over 300 young people, \nparents, clergy, community and business leaders, judges, prosecutors, \npolice, entertainers, media executives, researchers, and treatment and \nprevention specialists from across America to examine solutions and \nkeep us moving forward with proven strategies. The Vice President, \nGeneral Barry McCaffrey, and I met with the participants in a series of \nroundtable discussions, discussing how to strengthen the efforts of \nfamilies, the media, communities, schools, businesses, and government \nto reduce drug use and violence. Participants left with new energy and \nnew ideas, determined to return home and begin implementing the \nsolutions and strategies discussed that day.\n  This conference took place at an important juncture in America's \nongoing fight against drug abuse. In the last few years our nation has \nmade significant progress against drug use and related crime. The \nnumber of Americans who use cocaine has been reduced by 30 percent \nsince 1992. The amount of money Americans spend on illicit drugs has \ndeclined from an estimated $64 billion five years ago to about $49 \nbillion in 1993--a 23 percent drop. We are finally gaining ground \nagainst overall crime: drug-related murders are down 12 percent since \n1989; robberies are down 10 percent since 1991.\n  At the same time, we have dealt serious blows to the international \ncriminal networks that import drugs into America. Many powerful drug \nlords, including leaders of Colombia's notorious Cali cartel, have been \narrested. A multinational air interdiction program has disrupted the \nprincipal air route for smugglers between Peru and Colombia. The close \ncooperation between the United States, Peru, and other governments in \nthe region has disrupted the cocaine economy in several areas. Our \nefforts have decreased overall cocaine production and have made coca \nplanting less attractive to the farmers who initiate the cocaine \nproduction process. And I have taken the serious step of cutting off \nall non-humanitarian aid to certain drug producing and trafficking \nnations that have not cooperated with the United States in narcotics \ncontrol. Further, I have ordered that we vote against their requests \nfor loans from the World Bank and other multi-lateral development \nbanks. This clearly underscores the unwavering commitment of the United \nStates to stand against drug production and trafficking.\n  Here at home, we have achieved major successes in arresting, \nprosecuting, and dismantling criminal drug networks. In Miami, the High \nIntensity Drug Trafficking Program, through its operational task \nforces, successfully concluded a major operation that resulted in the \nindictments of 252 individuals for drug trafficking and other drug-\nrelated crimes. Operations conducted by the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration's Mobile Enforcement Teams program (MET), a highly \nsuccessful federal tool for assisting local\n\n[[Page S4316]]\n\nlaw enforcement, have resulted in more than 1,500 arrests of violent \nand predatory drug criminals in more than 50 communities across the \nnation.\n  But as the White House Leadership Conference on Youth, Drug Use, and \nViolence showed, now is the time to press forward. We must not let up \nfor a moment in our efforts against drug abuse, and drug abuse by young \npeople, particularly.\n  There are many reasons why young people do continue to use drugs. \nChief among these are ignorance of the facts about addicition and the \npotency of drugs, and complacency about the danger of drugs. \nUnfortunately, all too often we see signs of complacency about the \ndangers of drug use: diminished attention to the drug problem by the \nnational media; the glamorization and legitimization of drug use in the \nentertainment industry; the coddling of professional athletes who are \nhabitual drug-users; avoidance of the issue by parents and other \nadults; calls for drug-legalization; and the marketing of products to \nyoung people that legitimize and elevate the use of alcohol, tobacco, \nand illicit drugs.\n\n  All Americans must accept responsibility to teach young people that \ndrugs are illegal and they are deadly. They may land you in jail; they \nmay cost you your life. We must renew our commitment to the drug \nprevention strategies that deter first-time drug use and stop the \nprogression from alcohol and tobacco use to marijuana and harder drugs.\n  The National Drug Control Strategy is designed to prevent a new drug \nuse epidemic through an aggressive and comprehensive full-court press \nthat harnesses the energies of committed individuals from every sector \nof our society. As I said the State of the Union, we must step up our \nattack against criminal youth gangs that deal in illicit drugs. We will \nimprove the effectiveness of our cooperative efforts among U.S. defense \nand law enforcement agencies, as well as with other nations, to disrupt \nthe flow of drugs coming into the country. We will seek to expand the \navailability and improve the quality of drug treatment. And we will \ncontinue to oppose resolutely calls for the legalization of illicit \ndrugs. We will increase efforts to prevent drug use by all Americans, \nparticularly young people.\n  The tragedy of drug abuse and drug-related crime affects us all. The \nNational Drug Control Strategy requires commitment and resources from \nmany individuals and organizations, and from all levels of government. \nFor the Strategy to succeed, each of us must do our part.\n  We ask the Congress to be a bipartisan partner and provide the \nresources we need at the federal level to get the job done.

A bill to establish a commission to evaluate the programs of \nthe Federal Government that assist members of the Armed Forces and \nveterans in readjusting to civilian life, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                TRANSITION TO CIVILIAN LIFE LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce legislation \nestablishing a commission to review the various programs administered \nby the Federal Government to assist service members transitioning from \nmilitary to civilian life.\n\n\n                   Current System Lacks Coordination\n\n  Currently, several Federal departments and agencies offer programs to \nassist military men and women, veterans and reserve component members \nin their transition back to civilian life. Offices in the Departments \nof Defense, Veterans Affairs, Labor, and others, sponsor programs \noffering such services as education assistance, job-training, job \nplacement, and home loans. These are all useful and valuable services. \nHowever, changes in the labor market are challenging today's veteran \nreadjustment programs. Unemployment rates for recently separated \nveterans may be as high as 17 percent, compared with a national average \nof about 5.7 percent. This is extremely troubling when one stops to \nthink about the experience, discipline, and work ethic veterans bring \nto the workplace.\n  By better focusing these resources, we can make the existing programs \nmore accessible to a greater number of veterans; we can streamline \nprograms and make them more user-friendly; we can minimize overlap and \nimprove cost-effectiveness. That would be a big improvement over the \ncurrent situation, and would ultimately better serve our service men \nand women.\n  Let me emphasize, the purpose of this commission is not to create new \nprograms and make a large bureaucracy. Rather it is to review the range \nof existing programs and determine how we can better coordinate our \nefforts on behalf of veterans. Both the House and Senate Veterans' \nAffairs Committees, as well as several veterans service organizations \nsupport this concept and agree that such a review is both appropriate \nand timely. There is real opportunity here to repeat the success of \nGeneral Bradley's 1955 commission, which make significant improvements \nin transition programs with fresh concepts and approaches.\n\n\n                      Improved Service to Veterans\n\n  In my view, establishing this commission is the first step toward \nproviding more accessible and more practical assistance to service \nmembers who are facing fundamental changes in their personal and \nprofessional lives. These are brave men and women who committed \nprecious years of their lives to defending their Nation. Now they are \nready and willing to become productive members of their civilian \ncommunities. It is my hope that this legislation will help these very \ndeserving individuals make better use of the opportunities and \nresources available to them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1711\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide incentives to encourage stronger truth in \nsentencing of violent offenders, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               The Stop Allowing Felons Early Release Act\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am here today to join with the Senator \nfrom Idaho, Senator Craig, in introducing a piece of legislation that \nwe call the SAFER Act, the Stop Allowing Felons Early Release Act. I am \nvery pleased to work with Senator Craig from Idaho on this piece of \nlegislation. I would like to describe briefly for my colleagues what we \nintend to do.\n  Mr. President, many Americans will remember the story that they have \nread and reread in recent weeks about a child molester in Texas who was \nconvicted after confessing he had sexually abused a 6-year-old boy. \nThis man, who describes himself as a demon, claims he has molested 240 \nother children and he says to prison authorities that he will continue \nto do so when he is on the street.\n  Despite his repeated statements that he will continue to assault \nchildren, this prisoner was released recently\n\n[[Page S4319]]\n\nafter serving 6 years of an 8-year sentence under a mandatory good-time \nrelease program. Under Texas law, authorities had no discretion to \nrefuse to grant good-time credits to reduce this particular person's \nprison sentence. In fact, he is 1 of 1,000 child molesters who will be \nreleased from prison early this year.\n  Some of my colleagues will remember the story of Jonathan Hall, a \nyoung boy who was murdered this winter. Jonathan was a 13-year-old boy \nfrom Fairfax County, VA, who was stabbed 58 times and thrown into a \npond and, apparently, left for dead. When the police discovered him, \nthey found dirt and grass between his fingers. He did not die \nimmediately after having been stabbed 58 times, and he tried to crawl \nout of this pond. He did not make it, and he died.\n  The person who allegedly killed Jonathan Hall has a long criminal \nrecord. In 1970, he murdered a cab driver. He was put in prison and \nthen released on a work-release program. He kidnaped a woman while on \nwork release and received an additional sentence. He then was convicted \nof murdering another prisoner. Two murders and a kidnaping, and he was \nset free on early release to live on the street where a 13-year-old boy \nnamed Jonathan Hall was living. Jonathan is dead because a man twice \nconvicted of murder and kidnaping was let out of prison early.\n  Bettina Pruckmayr, whom I have spoken about before, was a 26-year-old \nattorney who was beginning her career in Washington, DC. She was \nabducted in a carjacking, driven to an ATM machine, and fatally stabbed \nover 30 times by a man who had been convicted previously of rape, armed \nrobbery, and murder. He was on the streets of the District of Columbia \nlegally because he was let out of prison early.\n  It does not take Sherlock Holmes to know who is going to commit the \nnext violent crime. It is all-too-often someone who has committed a \nprevious violent crime and who has been put in prison and let out \nearly. My colleague from Idaho and I believe that those who commit \nviolent crimes in our country ought to understand one thing: If you \ncommit a violent crime, you are going to finish your entire sentence in \na place of incarceration. No more good time, no more early release, no \nmore parole. If you commit a violent crime, this country is determined \nnot to turn murderers, child molesters, rapists and armed robbers back \non the streets of our country.\n  Despite all of the talk about getting tough on crime, we still have \nan epidemic of violent crime in our country. I would like to use a \ncouple of charts to demonstrate this fact.\n  There is one violent crime every 17 seconds in our country; one \nmurder every 23 minutes; one forcible rape every 5 minutes; one robbery \nevery 51 seconds; one aggravated assault every 28 seconds. That is what \nthe time clock shows for 1994.\n  One in three offenders is rearrested for a violent crime within 3 \nyears of being let out of prison. The Justice Department estimates that \nalmost all violent criminals in State prisons are now released early \nbefore their term is up, before their sentences are completed.\n  I have a list of what the States do. Some States say that, if you \nserve a day, you get a day and a half off. That is why we have a \ncircumstance in our country today where the average time served for \nmurder is just slightly less than 6 years. I am not talking about the \nsentence; the sentence is longer than that. But we say we cannot afford \nto keep people locked up, so we put them back on the streets, where \nthey commit more murder, when, in fact, they should not have been in a \nposition to commit another murder. They should still have been in \nprison.\n  In 1991, the Bureau of Justice Statistics did a study of State \nprisons, and they found that 156,000 people were in jail for offenses \nthey had committed while they were on early release from prison for a \nprior conviction.\n  Let me say that again because it is important: 156,000 people were in \nprison for offenses they had committed while they were on parole from a \nprevious conviction.\n  They should never have been in a position to commit these new \noffenses, and a good number of which were murders. But we decided as a \ncountry to let them out early because we somehow cannot afford to keep \nthem locked up. That does not add up. We have half the people in prison \nwho are nonviolent. We can incarcerate them much less expensively than \nwe now do.\n  The Senator from Ohio, Senator Glenn, talks about Quonset huts. He \nsaid he lived in one for 6 to 8 years while in the Marine Corps. We can \nuse abandoned military facilities to incarcerate, much less \nexpensively, nonviolent offenders and open up tens of thousands of \nprison cells for violent prisoners. We can put violent prisoners in \nthose cells and say to them, ``You are going to stay in those cells \nuntil the end of your term. You are not going to be out raping and \nmurdering other Americans.''\n  This piece of legislation affects those States that are going to \naccess money from the Federal Government to build new prisons. We say \nto those States that affirmatively decide as a matter of policy, \n``We're going to keep violent criminals locked up for their entire \nterm,'' we want you to be advantaged when it comes to grants. All \nStates will be eligible for this program, but we are saying that we \nwant more money to be available to those States that say, ``It is our \npolicy that violent criminals will spend their entire time in prison.''\n  The real cost of early release of violent offenders is this: There \nare 4,820 people in prison who committed murders while they were out on \nearly release.\n  In other words, we knew who they were. We knew what they did. But we \nlet them out early. When we say ``we,'' I am talking about the State \nand local justice systems that let them out early because they said, \n``We can't afford to keep you in.'' As a result, 4,820 people were \nmurdered, and they should not have lost their lies. Bettina Pruckmayr \nis one, 13-year-old Jonathan Hall is one. We can read all their names. \nEvery one of these cases is a tragedy because we knew who the \nperpetrators were. We let them out of prison early. There were 3,899 \nrapes, 6,238 assaults. That is the real cost of early release.\n  What is happening to murderers in this country? The average person \nsentenced for murder in the criminal justice system in this country \nnow, in the State and local court systems, is 34 percent of the \nsentence and then early release--34 percent of a sentence for murder, \nand then early release. For kidnaping, offenders have served 40 percent \nof their time. For robbery, they have served 39 percent of their time. \nFor assault, 37 percent of their time.\n  My point is, we can do better than that. We can say to people, \nclearly and deliberately, that if you commit a violent crime, \nunderstand this: Society is not going to put you back on the street to \nmurder Jonathan Hall, to murder Bettina Pruckmayr or another person, \nanother innocent person who relies on Governments to prosecute those \nwho commit violent crimes, put them in jail, and keep them in jail.\n  The Federal system is somewhat different, I am pleased to say. I have \nbeen involved in some of that with respect to the crime bill. The \nFederal Government abolished parole for Federal prisoners in 1984. The \n1994 crime bill included a provision that I authored that eliminated \nautomatic good time credits for violent offenders.\n  But, as you know, 95 percent of the crimes are committed under the \nState and local jurisdictions. The State and local jurisdictions are \ninvolved in almost all of what I have been talking about. In order to \ndo what the American people would expect us to do, we must encourage \nState and local governments to decide that when they find violent \noffenders who are committing murders and rapes, and violent assaults, \nand they sentence them to prison, they must be kept in prison.\n  We were told that the reason that you have to have good time --and \nsome States give a day, some States nearly 2 days of good time for \nevery day a prisoner serves; so you serve a year and get 2 years off of \nyour sentence--the reason they say you must have good time off for good \nbehavior is to be able to manage violent prisoners.\n  A Justice Department official told us at a meeting some while ago, he \nsaid, ``Well, these young gang-related offenders in prison are so \nviolent that they can't be controlled without incentives.'' The \nincentive is, ``Look, either you behave and we will give you good time, \nor you misbehave and we'll take\n\n[[Page S4320]]\n\ngood time away, and, therefore, you must stay here longer.'' They say \nthese people are so violent they cannot be controlled without the \nincentive of giving them a reduced sentence.\n  I guess the question is this: If prisoners are so violent that prison \nguards and strict prison rules cannot control them--and that is what \nthe Justice Department says--if that is the case, why on Earth would \nyou construct a system that says to those people, ``Behave here, and \nwe'll turn you back to the streets somewhere?'' Why on Earth would we \nthink that advances the criminal justice system in this country?\n  Senator Craig and I are not saying that we ought to run the criminal \njustice system. It is not what this legislation is about. We are \nsaying, as a Federal Government, we have made some money available for \nnew prison construction and, as a matter of policy, we should use this \nmoney as an incentive so those States who will get the most will be \nthose States who decide to construct a policy in which those who commit \nviolent crimes will stay in prison for their entire sentence.\n  That is our hope. Our hope is that we will advance that kind of \npublic policy. Our hope is that we will save lives. So we will \nintroduce this piece of legislation today in the memory of so many \npeople who have been the victims of violent crimes that should never \never have occurred.\n\n  We will introduce this bill in the memory of Bettina Pruckmayr, this \nyoung woman who should not have been murdered, because the person who \nallegedly murdered her was a person we knew was violent, and in the \nmemory of Jonathan Hall, a 13-year-old who happened to live on the \nstreet of person who had committed two previous murders and a kidnaping \nand who was released early from prison.\n  I hope, Mr. President, that one day soon we will be able to decide \nthat the sentence for murder is the time served for murder. I hope we \nwill no longer tell criminals, ``You get good time off for good \nbehavior. You get early parole if you behave. By the way, we will let \nyou out early.'' I hope that is not the message we will continue to \nsend to those who commit violent crimes in our country.\n  Again, I am delighted to join my colleague from Idaho, Senator Craig, \nin advancing what I think is a very important policy initiative in \nasking State and local governments to consider this as a method of \nachieving the access to Federal funds, and with the maximum capability \nthey can, to build additional prisons and keep violent criminals in \njail.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me say how blessed I am to be a \ncosponsor of the Stop Allowing Felons Early Release Act, known as the \nSAFER Act. Let me, in a very sincere way, congratulate my colleague \nfrom North Dakota for what is a very sensible approach to crimefighting \nand for his outspoken leadership on this issue.\n  This bill that he has just outlined for us all this morning would \nhelp stop one of the most significant causes of crime in America. It is \namazing to me, but it is true by fact and statistic, that the way our \ncriminal justice system is operated today, Mr. President, results in \nincreased crime. We know that a relatively small percentage of our \npopulation is responsible for a relatively large percentage of violent \ncrimes.\n  Study after study has shown that a vast number of violent crimes are \nState crimes committed by repeat offenders--repeat offenders.\n  Although there are many causes of violent crime and many factors \ncontributing to our crime rate, it appears that the most immediate and \nsignificant is the career criminal. Since that is the cause, we clearly \nhave an opportunity to save lives and prevent crime-related losses by \ngetting the hard-core criminals off the streets and out of our \ncommunities.\n  Even though crime-fighting is primarily a State and local \nresponsibility, as my colleague has referenced, Congress has had \nendless debates over the best way to protect our citizenry from these \ndangerous predators. We have explored how crime can be prevented or \ndeterred and how it should be punished. We have looked at better tools \nto help law enforcement stop criminals. We have provided significant \nresources for State and local governments to attack crime at its roots.\n  Many of those efforts have produced success at some level, but what \nwe are finding, however, is all this good work can be undermined by \nprograms of early release and parole that send violent felons back out \ninto our communities to prey again and again on our citizenry.\n  Senator Dorgan has spoken here in the Senate on the horrifying \nconsequences, citing example after example of these policies. The \nimpact reaches far beyond the victims of repeat criminals, their \nfamilies and communities. Justice itself is imperiled when punishment \nis uncertain and unpredictable. We can argue about the value of \nimprisonment in terms of rehabilitating criminals.\n  Some even argue about the value of imprisonment in terms of deterring \ncrime. But there can be no serious argument that any rehabilitation or \ndeterrent value is reduced in prison--if prisoners are subject to the \nrevolving door and, as a result of that, become the repeat offenders.\n  More important, there can be no serious argument that early release \nprograms destroy the most effective outcome of imprisonment: \nincapacitating the violent criminal by separating him or her from \nsociety and the opportunity to commit additional crimes. All too often \nearly release and parole programs are being driven by financial \nconsiderations at the State and the local level rather than solid \nevidence of rehabilitation.\n  I understand those concerns in my own State of Idaho. Our inmate \npopulation is estimated to be increasing at about 27 inmates per \nmonth. We will need to double prison space in the next 6 years in my \nState. It is not necessarily bad for Government to innovate or find \ncost-conscious alternatives in this area.\n\n  Again, my colleague from North Dakota cited some of those for the \nnonviolent-type criminal or the nonviolent offender. We can find \nalternative methods of incarceration for them in facilities that are \noftentimes already built, that can simply be modified for a new \npurpose. Clearly, these programs cross the line when they send hard-\ncore violent offenders back to the streets before serving their full \nsentences.\n  Congress has established programs at the Federal level that help \nState and local governments with financial and human resource needs in \nfighting crime. Among other initiatives, we have provided financial \nincentive grants to States, to enact truth-in-sentencing laws to ensure \nthat the time actually served by convicted felons reflects the \nsentences they were given. It just does not make sense to me, and I \nknow it does not make any sense to the taxpayer if we support policies \nand provide taxpayers dollars that actually increase crime.\n  The SAFER bill provides an important incentive for States to get rid \nof the early release program for violent offenders we know will only \npush the crime rate higher, and the statistics prove it. As long as \nthose programs are on the books, States will only have access to 75 \npercent of the funds available to them under the truth-in-sentencing \nprograms.\n  Again, my colleague from North Dakota has outlined how this bill \nwould affect those States. It is important to let those States know \nthat these kinds of policies are no longer acceptable when the Federal \ntax dollars are involved. Access to full grant amounts would be \navailable to States that eliminate those programs, only dealing with it \nin the way that we have outlined. If approved by a Governor after a \npublic hearing in which the victims and other members of the public \nhave an opportunity to be heard, then you might look at some \nconsequences for an early release program. There are ways to deal with \nit in the legislation as set forth. These States would also have access \nto a portion of the remaining undistributed grant funds.\n  The SAFER bill is a measured response, strategy, to reducing one of \nthe most significant causes of crime in our society today. I hope my \ncolleagues would join with me and the Senator from North Dakota in what \nwe believe is a very important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, it is not complicated. It is straightforward. It is \njust a heck of a lot of common sense when you look at the facts and you \nlook at the statistics--hardened criminals are oftentimes repeat \noffenders. They ought\n\n[[Page S4321]]\n\nto stay and do the time. That is what our legislation would require.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Idaho has made a \ncompelling statement on this issue. I wanted to make a couple of other \nobservations.\n  Some have said to me, what about rehabilitation? Should not someone \nbe able to be rehabilitated while in prison? I say that is fine. I am \nfor rehabilitation. But I do not want a circumstance to continue to \nexist where we know that about 6 percent to 8 percent of the criminals \nin America commit two-thirds of all the violent criminal acts, and they \ngo through that revolving door to commit new crimes.\n  We should rehabilitate them, but we should not be in a circumstance \nin this country where the amount of time served for murder is 5.9 \nyears. What on Earth are we thinking of? We should decide that those \npeople who are career criminals and who kill the people I have \ndescribed today will go to prison and spend their time in prison until \ntheir sentence is complete. That is what this bill is about.\n  I know people say, ``You are talking tough.'' The fact is, if we do \nnot get tough with that 8 percent of the criminal element who commit \nmost of the violent crimes in this country, the American people are not \nsafe. We make victims of the American people by turning murderers out \nof prison years and years before their sentences are complete. It is \ntime for us to decide that does not make sense.\n\n  We are simply shifting the costs. We shift the costs from those who \nwould be required to pay for a prison cell to those victims and their \nfamilies who now suffer the consequences of murder, rape, assault, and \nmore.\n  This is not a regional issue. This is an issue that is national. A \nwoman named Donna Martz, bless her soul, used to bring a tour bus every \nyear to the State capitol. They came to the front steps and we would \ntake a picture. On a quiet Sunday morning, coming out of a hotel in \nBismarck, ND, a man and a woman from Pennsylvania on the run from the \nlaw, having left jail in Pennsylvania, abducted poor Donna Martz and \nput her in a trunk. They eventually killed her some days later out in \nthe desert of Nevada.\n  Violent crime does not respect State boundaries. Victims of violent \ncrime--the violence that is committed by people who have been in prison \nwho we know are violent and who are let out early--are strewn across \nthis country. That is why I am delighted the Senator from Idaho has \njoined in this legislation. I hope we can make some progress in \nadvancing this in this Congress. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. My colleague from North Dakota is right. We are not \ntalking tough. We are not even beginning to talk tough on behalf of the \nvictims. The families that have been destroyed, torn apart by acts of \nviolence of the type that this legislation will be directed toward.\n  I think the American public expect us to talk tough. If Federal tax \ndollars are going to be used under the assumption that the communities \nof our Nation will be safer when those dollars are appropriately spent, \nthen it is our responsibility as Senators that those dollars get well \nspent.\n  What we are saying to the States in this instance, if you have a \nrevolving door in your criminal justice system where known hardened \ncriminal repeat offenders are back on the streets, then you are not \ngoing to get as much of the Federal dollar as is now available. You \nhave to examine the way you handle these criminals and keep them in and \nlet them do their time. Only under special circumstances where it is \nclearly evident that rehabilitation has worked and this person can \nreturn to society and live a safe and law-abiding life, can they or \nshould they be returned.\n  I hope that all Senators would take a look at this legislation as we \nintroduce it today. We would certainly hope that all would become \ncosponsors of it. We think it is responsible and tough when it comes to \ndealing with the criminal element of our society.\n  It just does not make sense to use U.S. taxpayer dollars to support \npolicies that might actually increase crime. The SAFER bill provides an \nimportant incentive for States to get rid of the early release programs \nfor violent offenders we know will only push the crime rate higher. As \nlong as those programs are on the books, States would only have access \nto 75 percent of the funds available to them under the Truth in \nSentencing Grant Program. Access to full grant amounts would be \navailable to States that eliminate those programs and only allow early \nrelease if approved by the Governor after a public hearing in which the \nvictims and other members of the public have an opportunity to be \nheard. These States would also have access to a portion of the \nremaining undistributed grant funds.\n  The SAFER bill is a measured, responsible strategy for reducing one \nof the most significant causes of crime in our society today. I hope \nall of our colleagues will join in supporting this bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Dewine, \n        Mr. Warner, Mr. Simon, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 1713. A bill to establish a congressional commemorative medal for \norgan donors and their families; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n\n\n            the gift of life congressional medal act of 1996\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I take great pleasure today in introducing \nthe Gift of Life Congressional Medal Act of 1995. I am joined by my \ncolleague Mr. Levin in introducing the Senate companion version to \nRepresentative Stark's bill. With this legislation, which doesn't cost \ntaxpayers a penny, Congress has the opportunity to recognize and \nencourage potential donors, and give hope to the 45,120 Americans who \nhave end stage organ disease. As a heart and lung transplant surgeon, I \nsaw one in four of my patients die because of the lack of available \ndonors. Public awareness simply has not kept up with the relatively new \nscience of transplantation. As public servants, we need to do all we \ncan to raise awareness about the gift of life.\n  Under this bill, each donor or donor family will be eligible to \nreceive a commemorative congressional medal. It is not expected that \nall families, many of whom wish to remain anonymous, will take \nadvantage of this opportunity. The program will be coordinated by the \nregional organ procurement organizations [OPOs] and managed by the \nentity administering the organ procurement and transplantation network. \nUpon request of the family or individual, a public official will \npresent the medal to the donor or the family. This creates a wonderful \nopportunity to honor those sharing life through donation and increase \npublic awareness. Some researchers have estimated that it may be \npossible to increase the number of organ donations by 80 percent \nthrough incentive programs and public education.\n  As several recent experiences have proved, any one of us, or any \nmember of our families, could need a life saving transplant tomorrow. \nWe would then be placed on a waiting list to anxiously await our turn, \nor our death. The number of people on the list has doubled since 1990 \nand a new name is added to the list every 18 minutes. However, this \nofficial waiting list reflects only those who have been lucky enough to \nmake it into the medical care system and to pass the financial hurdles. \nIf you include all those reaching end stage disease, the number of \npeople potentially needing organs or bone marrow, very likely over \n100,000, becomes staggering. Only a small fraction of that number would \never receive transplants, even if they had adequate insurance. There \nsimply are not enough organ and tissue donors, even to meet present \ndemand.\n  Federal policies surrounding the issue of organ transplantation are \ndifficult. Whenever you deal with whether someone lives or dies, there \nare no easy answers. There are close to 15,000 and 20,000 potential \ndonors each year, yet inexcusably, there are only some 5,100 actual \ndonors. That is why we need you to help us educate others about the \nfacts surrounding tissue and organ donation.\n  This year, Mr. President, there has been unprecedented cooperation, \non both sides of the aisle, and a growing commitment to awaken public \ncompassion on behalf of those who need organ transplants. It is my very \ngreat pleasure to introduce this bill on behalf of a\n\n[[Page S4322]]\n\ngroup of Senators who have already contributed in extremely significant \nways to the cause of organ transplantation. And we are proud to ask you \nto join us, in encouraging people to give life to others.\n                                 ______\n\n      Mr. DOLE (for Mr. Burns):\n  S. 1714. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to ensure the \nability of utility providers to establish, improve, operate and \nmaintain utility structures, facilities, and equipment for the benefit, \nsafety, and well-being of consumers, by removing limitations on maximum \ndriving and on-duty time pertaining to utility vehicle operators and \ndrivers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n\n\n  the utility consumer service improvement and protection act of 1996\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Utility \nConsumer Service Improvement and Protection Act of 1996. This \nlegislation would modify a Federal regulation which is unnecessary, \nburdensome, and which costs millions of dollars each year in return for \nnegligible benefits.\n  This regulation costs the Government itself hundreds of thousands of \ndollars annually for the personnel and overhead needed to implement, \ntrack, and enforce it. More importantly, it imposes unnecessary costs \nupon almost every family and business in the United States, due to \nhigher rates imposed on consumers' utilities--electric, telephone, \nnatural gas, water, sewer, garbage disposal, and even cable television. \nThe regulation in question is the Department of Transportation's hours-\nof-service truck-driving rules as they are applied to the utility \nindustry.\n  When we examine the hours-of-service truck-driving regulations as \napplied to public utility service vehicles, there is no evidence that \nthese costly regulations improve public safety or provide any other \ntangible benefits whatsoever to the American public.\n  To the contrary, there is significant evidence that these regulations \nneedlessly increase costs and threaten the reliability of basic utility \nservices for average American consumers. By imposing higher costs and \nreducing the reliability of basic utility services, the DOT regulations \nthemselves pose an increased risk to the health and safety of the \npublic.\n  In regard to utility vehicles, this hours-of-service regulation is a \nclassic example of a well-intended regulation which simply does far \nmore harm than good--the costs greatly outweigh any potential benefits, \nand it should be immediately modified to the extent that it applies to \nthe utility service vehicles which are vital to the installation and \nthe maintenance of utility facilities across our country.\n  DOT over-reacted in issuing its regulations, which limit the number \nof hours drivers can be on duty at his or her job, and still operate a \nheavy vehicle. The DOT regulation makes no distinction in the manner in \nwhich a vehicle is operated, neither does it recognize and accommodate \nthe purposes for which different kinds of vehicles are operated.\n  The hours-of-service regulations apply to virtually all drivers of \nall vehicles which exceed a certain weight, regardless of how the \nvehicle is actually used. Almost of utility service vehicle owners and \ndrivers are subjected to the regulation, even though they are only \ndriven an average of 50 miles per day.\n  Many thousands of trucks and motorized heavy equipment units owned by \npublic utility providers exceed the DOT regulatory weight threshold, \nand are thus subject to the regulations. This directly increases the \ncost to consumers for basic utility services, and interferes with \nutility providers in their job of maintaining reliable service.\n  When the electricity goes out, persons who are dependent upon various \nkinds of mechanical equipment are suddenly faced with a life-\nthreatening situation. When the phone lines are down, people with \nemergency situations cannot call for the ambulance, or the fire \ndepartment, or the sheriff's office for help. A regulation which makes \nit more difficult and expensive to rapidly restore or maintain vital \nutility service becomes in and of itself a much greater threat to \npublic health and safety than the very limited highway operation.\n  This same bill, H.R. 2144, was introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives last year. It would simply have exempted utility \nservice vehicles and their owners and drivers from the DOT hour of \nservice regulations.\n  While some portions of H.R. 2144 were incorporated into Public Law \n104-59, the National Highway System Act, much of the costly and \nrestrictive DOT hours of service truck driving regulation still applies \nto utility service vehicles, costing consumers unwarranted regulatory \nexpense and still interfering with utilities' ability to ensure \nreliable service and repairs.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will complete the job started \nlast year. My bill will exempt utility service vehicles and their \ndrivers from the DOT hours of service regulations effective only for \nthose vehicles and drivers while they are actively engaged in \nlegitimate and necessary utility activities.\n  I want to point out that this exemption does not relieve owners from \nany established equipment mechanical safety standards or inspections, \nnor does it weaken in any way the licensing standards and testing \nrequired of drivers. It does not interfere with or pre-empt any state-\nimposed regulations which may affect driving-time hours.\n   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort by \ncosponsoring this legislation and working for its passage. I also ask \nunanimous consent that a letter written by the Montana Electric \nCooperatives' Association be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  Montana Electric\n\n\n                                    Cooperatives' Association,\n\n                                   Great Falls, MT, March 6, 1996.\n     Hon. Conrad Burns,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Burns: Montana's rural electric cooperatives \n     are writing to ask for your help in obtaining a much needed \n     reform of specific federal regulations which are unnecessary, \n     unwieldy, and which cost far more to comply with than any \n     possible benefits that might theoretically be derived. The \n     current Department of Transportation ``Hours of Service'' \n     (HOS) truck driving regulations, as they apply to public \n     utility providers, impose an entirely unreasonable cost on \n     consumers, and compound other difficulties faced by providers \n     in reliably maintaining vital utility services.\n       The HOS regulations were originally intended to address \n     public safety concerns arising from practices in the long-\n     haul, transcontinental trucking industry where vehicles are \n     utilized in an entirely different manner than those in the \n     utility business.\n       Citizens and legislators alike became alarmed at the \n     frequency and severity of highway accidents caused when long-\n     haul truckers would operate their vehicles for days at a time \n     without getting proper rest. Operators suffering from driving \n     fatigue and ``white line fever'' often exceeded their \n     physical and mental limits, resulting in some truly horrible \n     accidents and the tragic deaths of many innocent motorists.\n       However, it is important to note that utility service \n     vehicles simply are not operated in the same fashion as the \n     long-haul equipment, and there is no evidence that our \n     industry's vehicles were ever a part of the problem the \n     regulations were designed to resolve. This is especially true \n     for utilities serving rural Montana. Clearly, the HOS rules \n     are but one more example of a ``one-size-fits-all'' federal \n     mandate that is costly, unrealistic and unnecessary.\n       Disregarding these distinctions, DOT crafted regulations \n     which apply as equally to utility vehicles as to long-haul \n     vehicles. This has resulted in a situation whereby \n     enforcement of existing rules will require consumers to pay \n     significantly higher utility rates to help fix a problem that \n     didn't exist in the first place.\n       We also believe public safety is actually placed in far \n     greater imminent danger by imposition of the DOT's arbitrary \n     and restrictive Hours of Service rules.\n       That is because these rules hamper the ability of our \n     cooperatives to rapidly maintain and restore electric and \n     telephone service to the approximately 300,000 Montanans we \n     serve. The result is that customers' lives may be in far \n     greater danger from lack of electric or telephone service \n     than by the possibility of a utility service vehicle \n     accident.\n       Cooperative managers have called us to emphasize that the \n     HOS rules ignore reality: When the power is out, those on \n     life support equipment, for example, are at great risk. When \n     phone lines are shut down, people can't call for medical, \n     fire, or law enforcement emergency assistance.\n       As one western Montana cooperative manager put it, ``It is \n     our overall responsibility to ascertain the circumstances of \n     each individual work period and draw the line between safe \n     working/driving practices, balanced against the urgency of \n     electric service restoration. Service restoration work can be\n\n[[Page S4323]]\n\n     critical and/or lifesaving by nature--much more so than the \n     negligible risk of driving--after even 15 hours or more of \n     work. We have prescribed rest periods in relation to hours \n     worked which also require common sense supervisor \n     interpretation.''\n       An eastern Montana cooperative director described the \n     situation this way: ``Because of the great distances involved \n     in our service area, exceeding the restriction on service \n     hours could be a high probability. Because of the dependency \n     on the power we supply for heat, water heaters, and \n     communication within our service area, it is imperative to \n     the welfare of our consumers that the restoration of power \n     occur as quickly as possible.''\n       As applied to utility service vehicles and drivers, the DOT \n     regulations are totally unwarranted, extremely expensive (in \n     the aggregate) to consumers, and pose a potentially dangerous \n     obstacle to our ability to maintain electric and telephone \n     lifelines.\n       MECA applauds your consideration of legislation which would \n     exempt utility service vehicles from the HOS regulations. We \n     also appreciate your well-crafted draft language because it \n     is written in a manner which would exempt our vehicles only \n     when they are being used for legitimate utility purposes \n     (including emergencies arising from storms and other acts of \n     nature).\n       We sincerely urge your speedy introduction of such \n     legislation and we will work to help build the support needed \n     for congressional passage of the measure.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jay T. Downen,\n\n                                 Executive Vice President.\n\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n        Lugar, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Campbell, Mr. \n        Cochran, Mr. Hatfield, Mr. Stevens, and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 1715.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act reauthorize \nthe adolescent family life program, provide for abstinence education, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n    the adolescent family life and abstinence education act of 1996\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce, \non behalf of 14 Senators, the Adolescent Family Life and Abstinence \nEducation Act of 1996 and, on behalf of 12 Senators, the Adoption \nPromotion Act of 1996. I am pleased to be introducing these bills with \nmany colleagues from both parties, which I shall describe shortly.\n\n\n                       Toward a ``Good'' Society\n\n  Mr. President, I am introducing two bills designed to bring Americans \ntogether on one of the most controversial, if not the most \ncontroversial matter facing the United States domestically today, and \nthat is the question of abortion, pro-choice, pro-life. While we cannot \nachieve agreement on all aspects of that underlying controversy, I \nbelieve it is possible to make enormous steps forward on the issue of \nabstinence; that is, to try to curtail premarital sex, especially among \nteenagers, which results in unintended pregnancies, and to promote \nadoption through tax credits, to try to encourage those who are in the \nsituation of unintended pregnancy to carry through to term.\n  At the outset, let me provide my colleagues with a brief summary of \nthe legislation. This legislation would support an authorization for \n$75 million annually to have abstinence education. While there is great \nconcern about education dealing with matters of sex generally, there \nappears to be an exception when you talk about abstinence. Within the \npast several weeks, I have had the opportunity to visit the Carrick \nHigh School in Pittsburgh, where I met with students who are involved \nin an abstinence program and with officials of Mercy Hospital which has \nbeen the recipient of a $250,000 federal grant for abstinence \neducation. The results there have been very profound. Later, I visited \na program in Lancaster, PA, where young people are taking the \nabstinence pledge and are being counseled in how to respond to peer \npressure with counter peer pressure. As I say, while we cannot agree on \nall aspects of the issue of abortion, pro-choice, pro-life, I believe \nwhen we talk about abstinence, that is an area of agreement.\n  Similarly, on adoption, there have been many efforts to give tax \nbreaks. This legislation is another effort, with up to a $5,000 tax \ncredit for adoption, and up to $7,500 for adopting children with \nspecial needs. These two bills will supplement legislation which I have \nalready pushed on prenatal care for pregnancies, again involving many \nyoungsters in their teens. I saw my first one-pound baby more than a \ndecade ago. It is really a startling sight, a child no bigger than my \nhand, carrying medical problems for a lifetime and costing up to \n$200,000 in medical care per child for just the first year. I believe \nthis abstinence legislation, in conjunction with adequate prenatal care \nand the Healthy Start program, will go a long way toward avoiding \nteenage pregnancies and the complications that can arise, such as low-\nbirth-weight babies.\n  Mr. President, on March 28, 1996, I spoke on the Senate floor in \nsupport of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's Teen Pregnancy Prevention \nWeek. During that week, communities throughout the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania conducted special activities to promote pre-marital \nabstinence as the best, healthiest way to prevent teen pregnancy and \nthe many other physical, emotional, and relational consequences of \nearly sexual activity. On Friday, March 15, 1996, I had the opportunity \nto kick-off this important week at Central High School in Philadelphia, \nand during my remarks, I stated that I would be introducing two \nlegislative proposals that deal with the important issue of teen \npregnancy, one on abstinence education and one on promoting adoption.\n  By way of background, nearly 200 years ago, the French writer Alexis \nde Tocqueville is said to have observed that ``America is great because \nshe is good, and if America ever ceases to be good, America will cease \nto be great.'' Although de Tocqueville is long gone, his analysis is \ntimeless. It is impossible to be a public official today, to travel \nthroughout States such as Pennsylvania and elsewhere in the United \nStates, without recognizing that America's problems are more moral than \nmaterial. The news media offer us a monthly snapshot of leading \neconomic indicators, but it may be that our leading moral indicators \nare more telling, such as the staggering number of teenage pregnancies, \nthe national divorce rate, and the rapid rise in juvenile crime.\n\n  As we have tried to steer towards a growing economy and a balanced \nbudget, there has been a growing consensus that all our goals--\npersonal, economic, and national security--must rest on a restored \nethic of personal responsibility. There has been an increased \nrecognition that a crisis of values underlies the many public policy \nproblems the Senate addresses on a daily basis. This has impressed upon \nme the need for people of strong moral commitments to enter public \nservice and public debate, so that we may confront the underlying \nproblems.\n  On the critical question of the health of America's families, the \ngrim statistics are well known, but worth repeating. These leading \nmoral indicators suggest that the erosion of the American family \ncontinues unabated. For example, more than 50 percent of American \nmarriages now end in divorce, meaning that millions of American \nchildren face at least some instability in their home environment. \nThen, there is the alarming number of teenagers getting pregnant in the \nUnited States. According to statistics released by the Centers for \nDisease Control in 1995, there were an estimated 835,000 teenage \npregnancies in 1990. Further, the National Center for Health Statistics \nreports that in 1993, 12,000 girls under 15 years of age gave birth to \na child. To me, this necessitates a strong response from public \nofficials, the clergy, and concerned citizens.\n  A leading moral indicator is the rapid increase in the number of \nunwed mothers. The percentage of teen births that occurred outside of \nmarriage has risen from 48 percent in 1980 to 72 percent of all teenage \nbirths in 1993. According to my distinguished colleague,\n\n[[Page S4324]]\n\nSenator Moynihan, within 10 years, unless we reverse current trends, \nmore than half our children will be born to unmarried women. By \ncomparison, the United States teenage birth rate--60 births per 1,000 \nfemales aged 15 to 19--is double the rate in other industrialized \nsocieties such as Australia and the United Kingdom. France and Japan \nreport some of the lowest teenage birth rates, at nine and four births \nper 1,000 females, respectively.\n  It is worth pausing to reflect on the enormous significance of these \nstatistics regarding out-of-wedlock births. Marriage is obviously \nimportant as it relates to the benefits for children to have a strong \nfamily structure based on a commitment of mutual support and respect.\n  On the subject of family values, I speak with considerable pride \nabout the institution of marriage with my parents and my siblings. In \naddition to my parents' marriage of 45 years, my brother, Morton, and \nhis wife, Joyce, were married for 51 years until his death in 1993. My \nsister, Hilda, and her husband, Arthur Morgenstern, celebrated their \n53rd wedding anniversary in April. My sister, Shirley, was married to \nEdward Kety for 46 years until his death last summer. My son, Shanin, \nand his wife, Tracey, will celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary on \nJune 29, 1996. So our family totals 248 years of marriage.\n  In considering the troubling statistics on out-of-wedlock births, I \nbelieve there is much we can do to reduce the likelihood that an \nunmarried teenager will become pregnant in the first place.\n  While I am personally opposed to abortion, I do not believe it can be \ncontrolled by the Government. I believe it is a matter for the woman \nand family, with appropriate guidance by ministers, priests, and \nrabbis. I do believe the government has a significant role in promoting \nalternatives to abortion. In my view, there is no reason why people on \nboth sides of the abortion debate cannot work together to promote those \nalternatives. We can reduce teenage pregnancies by encouraging \nabstinence and personal responsibility. If a teen pregnancy does occur, \nwe should promote adoption as a socially beneficial alternative.\n\n  We can, and we must, confront our leading moral indicators head-on. \nWe must press harder in the fight to reduce the alarming number of \nteenage pregnancies. And, when a child comes into the world as the \nresult of an unintended pregnancy, we must do all that we can to ensure \nthat it is raised in a loving, stable family environment.\n  It is the American family, of course, to which these responsibilities \nchiefly belong. Nonetheless, I believe that the Government can play a \nrole and that we in the Congress must seek out appropriate legislative \nmeans to advance this cause. Accordingly, I am today introducing these \ntwo bills which will strengthen the social fabric and family stability \nof our Nation.\n  Before I go into greater detail on these two bills, I want to point \nout that I have benefited from thoughtful review and comments by a \nnumber of individuals with expertise on the issues of teen pregnancy, \nabstinence, and adoption, including Bill Pierce of the National Council \non Adoption; H. Woodruff Turner and Katrina Schulhof of the Pittsburgh \nAdoptive Family Rights Council; David Keene of the American \nConservative Union; Ms. Molly Kelly of Philadelphia; Larry Breitenstein \nof the Westmoreland County Childrens Bureau; Dr. Carol Jean Vale, \nPresident of Chestnut Hill College; Sister Roseanne Bonfini of \nImmaculata College; James Stark of the Fayette County Community Action \nAgency; Danelle Stone and Melissa Mizner of Catholic Charities \nCounseling and Adoption Services--Erie Diocese; Washington County \nCommissioner Diana Irey; Reverend Horace Strand, Sr. of the Faith \nTemple Holy Church and Christian School; Rev. Msgr. Philip Cribben of \nthe Archdiocese of Philadelphia; and Ted Meehan of the Mainstream \nRepublicans.\n\n\n      Adolescent Family Life and Abstinence Education Act of 1996\n\n  My first legislative proposal provides for the continued funding of \nprograms that are designed to reduce teenage pregnancy and to increase \nabstinence education. The existing Adolescent Family Life Program, \nknown as the title XX program, is a worthwhile program which focuses \ndirectly on the issues of abstinence, adolescent sexuality, adoption \nalternatives, pregnancy and parenting. If you want to reduce the number \nof abortions performed in the United States, teaching children to say \nno to negative peer pressure is a starting place.\n  In 1981, Congress established the Adolescent Family Life Program as \nthe only Federal program of its kind. Through demonstration grants and \ncontracts, Adolescent Family Life focuses on a comprehensive range of \nhealth, educational, and social services needed to improve the health \nof adolescents, including the complex issues of early adolescent \nsexuality, pregnancy, and parenting.\n  This legislation had bipartisan support when originally enacted in \n1981 and when it was reauthorized in 1984. Authority for title XX \nexpired in 1985 and since then, the program has been operating under \nfunding provided in the annual Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations \nbill. For fiscal year 1996, the Labor, HHS, and Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee, which I chair, provided $7.7 million for \nthe Adolescent Family Life program.\n  Now, more than 10 years after the authority for this valuable program \nexpired, it is important that Congress reauthorize it to demonstrate \nour commitment to this important Adolescent Family Life Program. As I \nstated at the outset, my legislation, the Adolescent Family Life and \nAbstinence Education Act of 1996, would provide authority for $75 \nmillion annually between now and fiscal year 2000, substantially higher \nthan the $30 million authorized in 1985. My legislation would also \namend title XX to state expressly that the education services provided \nby the recipients of federal funds should include information about \nabstinence. I have also proposed amending the law to require the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to ensure, to the maximum extent \npracticable, that approved grants have a geographic diversity that \nshows adequate representation of both urban and rural areas. Further, \nto address concerns raised by Pennsylvania constituents, my legislation \nwould establish a simplified, expedited application process for groups \nseeking Title XX demonstration project funding of less than $15,000.\n\n  As I noted at the beginning of my remarks, teenage pregnancies exact \na substantial emotional and financial toll on our society and deserve \npriority consideration by Congress. Adolescent pregnancy threatens the \nhealth of both the young mother and child. Teenage mothers are more \nlikely to lack adequate prenatal care and to give birth to a low \nbirthweight baby. When I refer to the problem of low birthweight \nbabies, I am talking about babies weighing as little as 12 ounces who \nwhen born are no larger than my hand. It is tragic that these babies \nare not born more healthy, for low birthweight babies will carry scars \nfor a lifetime and often do not live very long.\n  The Adolescent Family Life Program, in addressing early sexual \nrelations among teenagers, can also protect their health with respect \nto sexually transmitted diseases. Early sexual activity, particularly \nwith multiple partners, increases the chance that a teenager will \ncontract such a disease. The Title XX program is designed to get \nteenagers to focus on the potential consequences of early sexual \nactivity, and these health concerns certainly provide additional \njustification for Federal support of abstinence education.\n  In making the case for funding programs to address the teen pregnancy \nproblem it is important to focus primarily on the physical, emotional, \nand spiritual costs associated with a young girl becoming pregnant. At \na time when Federal, State, and local governments face difficult \nbudgetary constraints, I should also note that in 1990, an estimated 51 \npercent of Aid to Families with Dependent Children payments went to \nrecipients who were 19 or younger when they first became mothers. \nBillions of dollars could be saved by preventing unwanted teenage \nbirths to unwed mothers.\n  Reauthorizing the Adolescent Family Life Program at $75 million will \ndemonstrate that Congress recognizes the serious emotional and \nfinancial impact of teenage pregnancy. Updating federal law to advocate \nabstinence education\n\n[[Page S4325]]\n\nexpressly is also necessary to provide guidance to the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. I urge my colleagues and others to making \nAmerica a ``good'' society to support this legislation and join me in \nthe effort to reduce teenage pregnancies.\n\n\n                   The Adoption Promotion Act of 1996\n\n  My second legislative proposal, the ``Adoption Promotion Act of \n1996,'' is intended to provide appropriate tax incentives to encourage \nadoption, a policy which serves as a compassionate response to children \nwhose own parents are unable or unwilling to care for them. This is \nparticularly important in an era when so many teenagers are having \nbabies and are unable to care for them.\n  Based upon my own strong sense of family, I firmly believe that the \nfamily is the primary building block of our society. To reinforce the \nimportant role families play in our society, the Senate and the House \nof Representatives recently passed balanced budget legislation which \ncontained provisions to benefit families. For instance, the agreement \nprovided a $500 per child tax credit to help cover the rising costs of \nraising children. That legislation also provided a $5,000 nonrefundable \ntax credit for families who follow the long and arduous, but rewarding, \nprocess of adopting a child. Although this legislation was vetoed by \nthe President, I believe it made a very strong statement in support of \nthe American family.\n  I have spent the past year advocating scrapping our current Tax Code \nand replacing it with a flat tax that would encourage saving, stimulate \ngrowth, and promote fundamental simplicity. In March 1995 I introduced \nS. 488, the Flat Tax Act of 1995, which would increase economic growth \nby $2 trillion and reduce interest rates by 2 full percentage points. \nFurther, S. 488 would provide much more generous personal exemptions \nand deductions for children. However, as the Congress debates the \nmerits and necessity of fundamental tax reform, and until such \nlegislation is enacted, I believe we need to move forward with \nspecialized tax legislation that promotes adoption.\n\n  As I stated earlier, today I am introducing the Adoption Promotion \nAct of 1996, which would encourage the adoption of children into \nhealthy and stable existing families. Far too many children are left to \ngrow up in foster care without ever experiencing the rewards of being a \npermanent family member. Many other couples, unable to conceive their \nown child, turn to infant adoption to start a family. Recognizing the \ncost hurdles that may discourage many American families from adopting a \nchild, my legislation would provide a nonrefundable adoption tax credit \nfor up to $5,000 in qualified adoption expenses for families earning up \nto $65,000 in annual adjusted gross income. The credit is available at \na gradually reduced percentage to families with adjusted gross income \nbetween $65,000 and $95,000. The credit is available during the year of \nthe legal, finalized adoption, but may cover expenses incurred in \nprevious years toward the adoption.\n  As I will explain in greater detail later, my legislation also would \nallow all families to make penalty free withdrawals of up to $2,000 \nfrom Individual Retirement Accounts to pay adoption expenses. In \naddition, the bill allows employers to offer their employees tax-free \nbenefits for adoption. To address the particular problem of placing \nchildren with special needs in adoptive families, my legislation would \nprovide a $7,500 nonrefundable tax credit for such adoptions.\n  Mr. President, when couples realize that they are not able to \nconceive their own children or that it is not medically advisable, many \nconsider adoption. Many other couples blessed with their own children \nconsider adopting a child out of a sense of love and community, \nparticularly where a child has been in foster care. These couples \nquickly learn that the costs associated with adoption can be \nprohibitive. It is not uncommon for the adopting family to pay \nthousands of dollars in legal expenses, prenatal care for the birth \nmother, and the cost of the adopted child's hospital delivery. In fact, \naccording to information from congressional testimony by the National \nCouncil on Adoption, adoption costs range between zero and $30,000, \naveraging $15,000 for infants born in the United States.\n  My bill includes a provision to encourage in particular the placement \nof special needs children because there is good reason to provide a \nparticular incentive for their adoption. This legislation adopts the \ndefinition contained in the balanced budget legislation and states that \na child with a special need is one who has a mental, physical or \nemotional handicap or who may fall into a specific age, gender or \nminority group. However, this clinical explanation belies the \nfrustrating condition of these children. According to the Ways and \nMeans Committee, in fiscal year 1990, 71 percent of children with one \nor more special needs were waiting for adoptive placement. In cases \nwhere children have medical conditions, most through no fault of their \nown, costs of care can be prohibitive. It then becomes even more \ndifficult to place such children in adoptive families because of these \ntragic circumstances. I am hopeful that the $7,500 tax credit will ease \nthe financial burden on families considering adopting a special needs \nchild. I would note that the credit is not tied solely to the actual \ncosts of the adoption, because such adoptions are often less expensive \nthan a typical infant adoption. Therefore, this credit is available to \ndefray additional expenses of having a special needs child join one's \nfamily.\n  Under current law, if an employer helps to pay an employee's \npregnancy expenses by funding an insurance policy or paying the fees \nfor an employee to join an health maintenance organization, these \nexpenses are treated as tax-free fringe benefits. But if an employer \nhelps his or her employees with adoption expenses, it has to pay these \nexpenses in after-tax dollars. That is why my legislation provides that \nemployer-provided adoption assistance is tax free for up to $5,000 in \nbenefits for each child (up to $7,500 for special needs children). This \ntax provision is also phased out based on income, but at a higher level \nthan the tax credit, in order to allow more families to take full \nadvantage of employee fringe benefits. I am proud to mention that \nseveral companies in Pennsylvania, including First Pennsylvania Bank, \nRohm and Haas, and Wyeth-Ayerst already provide adoption assistance to \ntheir employees. Other companies offering such benefits include General \nMotors, DuPont and PepsiCo.\n\n  Finally, I have included provisions in my legislation to allow the \npenalty-free withdrawal from Individual Retirement Accounts [IRA] to \nhelp cover the costs of adoption expenses. I understand the fact that a \ntax credit is simply not enough to cover all the expenses associated \nwith adoption. I believe the federal tax code must encourage savings \nand reward taxpayers not penalize them for the wise uses of their hard-\nearned money. I have supported other efforts in the past that would \nallow the use of IRA funds for personal capital expenses such as \npurchase of a family home, investment in college education, or payment \nof medical expenses. In my judgment, using IRA funds for adoption \nexpenses is equally meritorious.\n  Given prior support in both the Senate and House for some type of tax \nincentives to promote adoption, I am hopeful that my colleagues will \nfavorably consider the mix of incentives contained in the Adoption \nPromotion Act of 1996 and enact this legislation in the near future. By \nreducing the financial hurdles to adoption, I hope we will be able to \ngive new hope to the thousands of children who live in foster care \nawaiting the chance to be brought into a loving family environment \npermanently. In conclusion, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Congressional Record a ``Dear Colleague'' letter, \ndated March 25, together with a summary of the legislative provisions, \ntogether with the bills themselves, which identify the 14 sponsors of \nthe abstinence bill and the 12 sponsors of the adoption bill, together \nwith seven letters: one from David Keene of the American Conservative \nUnion; the second from Danelle Stone and Melissa Mizner of the Catholic \nCharities (Erie Diocese); the third from Pastor Horace W. Strand of the \nFaith Temple Holy Church and Christian School; the fourth from \nCommissioner Colin A. Hanna of Chester County; the fifth from \nCommissioner Joseph A. Ford of Washington County; the sixth from \nCommissioner Jim Beckwith of Mifflin County; and the seventh from \nPresident Carol Jean Vale of Chestnut Hill College.\n\n[[Page S4326]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             United States Senate,\n\n\n                             Select Committee on Intelligence,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 25, 1996.\n       Dear Colleague: I am writing to urge you to cosponsor two \n     bills I intend to introduce shortly: the Adolescent Family \n     Life and Abstinence Education Act of 1966 and the Adoption \n     Promotion Act of 1996.\n       While there are obviously great differences of opinion on \n     the pro-life-pro-choice issue, there is a consensus that all \n     efforts should be made to prevent unwanted teen pregnancies \n     through abstinence. The first bill does just that.\n       Where tax breaks for adoption would encourage carrying to \n     term, we should act on that as well. The second bill does \n     just that.\n       The following describes the essence of the two bills:\n       Adolescent Family Life and Abstinence Education Act of \n     1966--Reauthorizes the Adolescent Family Life (Title XX) \n     program, which funds demonstration projects focusing on \n     abstinence, adolescent sexuality, adoption alternatives, \n     pregnancy and parenting. This program had bipartisan support \n     when originally enacted in 1981 and when it was reauthorized \n     in 1984. Authority for Title XX expired in 1985 and since \n     then, the program has been operating under funding provided \n     in the annual Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations bill. \n     For FY 1996, the Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations \n     Subcommittee, which I chair, has provided $7.7 million for \n     the Adolescent Family Life program. Congress should \n     reauthorize Title XX to demonstrate our commitment to \n     abstinence education and the physical and emotional health of \n     adolescents.\n       The Adoption Promotion Act of 1996--Provides tax incentives \n     to encourage adoption, a policy which serves as a \n     compassionate response to children whose own parents are \n     unable or unwilling to care for them. This is particularly \n     important in an era when so many teenagers are having babies \n     and are unable to care for them. This proposal is based \n     substantially on the provisions contained in the balanced \n     budget legislation which Congress passed in 1995 but was \n     vetoed by the President.\n       I hope you will cosponsor one or both of these bills. If \n     you are interested, please contact me or have your staff \n     contact Dan Renberg at 224-4254.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n       P.S. A more detailed statement of the bills is enclosed. My \n     office and I would be glad to provide additional information \n     upon request.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n            Specter Proposals To Deal With Teenage Pregnancy\n\n\n      adolescent family life and abstinence education act of 1996\n\n       Reauthorizes Adolescent Family Life program (Title XX) for \n     the first time since 1984, and at a higher ($75,000,000) \n     level than before. It has been funded annually in Labor, HHS \n     appropriations, but without authorization or reform.\n       This HHS program provides demonstration grants and \n     contracts for initiatives focusing directly on issues of \n     abstinence, adolescent sexuality, adoption alternatives, \n     pregnancy and parenting.\n       The bill adds ``abstinence'' expressly into the statutory \n     definition of educational services that can be provided under \n     the program. (Such education is already available, but the \n     statute wasn't explicit in this regard.)\n       The bill requires the Secretary of HHS to establish an \n     expedited, simplified process for consideration of grant \n     applications for less than $15,000. (Some organizations that \n     wish to implement small teen pregnancy programs are unable to \n     cope with the current process.)\n       Requires the Secretary to ensure, to the maximum extent \n     practicable, that approved grant applications adequately \n     represent both urban and rural areas.\n\n\n                     adoption promotion act of 1996\n\n       Builds on adoption tax incentives contained in Section \n     11003 of Balanced Budget Act of 1995 (budget reconciliation) \n     conference report.\n       For qualified adoption expenses, provides up to a $5,000 \n     adoption tax credit ($7,500 for children with special needs--\n     age, ethnic group, physical/mental/emotional handicap). \n     Credit is phased out beginning at $65,000 adjusted gross \n     income and is eliminated at $95,000.\n       Provides for penalty-free IRA withdrawals of up to $2,000 \n     for qualified adoption expenses.\n       Tax-free treatment of employer-provided adoption \n     assistance, to level the playing field with tax-free \n     treatment of employer-provided pregnancy expenses. Exclusion \n     from gross income of up to $5,000 in benefits ($7,500 for \n     special needs children), phasing out from $75,000 to \n     $115,000.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                              The American Conservative Union,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, March 27, 1996.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: Your recent introduction of \n     legislation to provide tax incentives designed to promote \n     adoption is to be commended.\n       On behalf of the more than one million members and \n     supporters of the American Conservative Union, I can say \n     without reservation that your approach to helping parents \n     seeking adoptive children and those children who in our \n     society are too often shunted aside deserves wide public \n     support.\n       It is my hope that it will also enjoy widespread \n     Congressional support.\n           Sincerely Yours,\n                                                   David A. Keene,\n     Chairman, ACU.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               Catholic Charities,\n\n\n                             Counseling And Adoption Services,\n\n                                         Erie, PA, March 11, 1996.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter, Thank you for sending a copy of the \n     draft of the bills and a draft of the floor statement \n     concerning the Adolescent Family Life and Abstinence \n     Education Act and the Adoption Promotion Act.\n       A tax credit for adoption would be highly favored by \n     prospective adoptive couples and would certainly benefit \n     those children waiting for permanent families.\n       For the past four years, Melissa Mizner, therapist, and \n     myself have presented a program to school students promoting \n     sexual abstinence. We have conducted 95 presentations in over \n     25 schools both public and private for approximately 4,400 \n     students in grades six to twelve. Catholic Charities \n     Counseling and Adoption Services has assumed the financial \n     burden of presenting this program despite our numerous \n     attempts to secure outside funding. The agency recognizes the \n     importance of this message and feels prevention services is \n     money well spent.\n       We have not applied for money from Title XX because the \n     process for application is so difficult for the small amount \n     of $3,000 to $5,000 we would require each year to provide \n     this program. I wish this process could be simplified for \n     agencies requesting smaller grants from the Adolescent Family \n     Life program. If it were, other agencies in Pennsylvania \n     might consider providing a similar program such as ours.\n       We are in full favor of your two proposed bills. If we can \n     be of any assistance in providing support for these \n     proposals, please do not hesitate to contact the agency.\n       Thank you for taking the time to keep us informed and \n     aware.\n           Sincerely,\n     Danelle Stone, BSSW,\n       Adoption Coordinator.\n     Melissa Mizner, MS, NCC,\n       Marriage and Family Therapist.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                         Faith Temple Holy Church,\n\n\n                                         and Christian School,\n\n                                                    March 8, 1996.\n     Senator Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Specter, Thank you for giving; me the opportunity \n     to review your statement to the Senate on the need to amend \n     Title XX to include the teaching of Abstinence, and the \n     promotion of the 1996 Adoption Act. First I want to say how \n     much I appreciated hearing of the value your parents placed \n     on the Institution of Marriage. The personal example of you \n     and your siblings demonstrate that their value was not lost \n     with them. I was also pleased to hear of your personal \n     position on Abortion, and I can appreciate your position on \n     Choice; even though I strongly believe in the protection of \n     Life from the moment of conception. I think that more of your \n     constituents should know you are not an advocate of Abortion; \n     but a advocate of personal rights.\n       This amendment to Title XX can be the instrument to bring \n     both sides together, and stop the need for most abortions by \n     decreasing the growing rate of un-intended pregnancies. The \n     additional funding, and the promotion of the Adoption Act of \n     1996 will help tremendously. Please be advised that as a \n     Pastor, and school Administrator, I can see the need for \n     resources being allocated for this purpose. If I can be of \n     any help to you in promoting this worthy endeavor; please \n     feel free to call on me.\n           Yours in His Service,\n                                             Dr. Horace W. Strand,\n     Pastor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            The County of Chester,\n\n\n                                  Office of the Commissioners,\n\n                                 West Chester, PA, March 14, 1996.\n     The Hon. Arlen Specter\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Arlen: It was great to see you again at the \n     Conservative Political Action Conference last month, and to \n     learn from your letter of March 7 of your support of such a \n     bedrock conservative cause as abstinence education. Please \n     let me know if there is anything I can do to help advance \n     that agenda here in Chester County.\n           With warmest regards, I am\n                                                   Colin A. Hanna,\n     Commissioner.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                             County of Washington,\n\n\n                                 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,\n\n                                   Washington, PA, March 19, 1996.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: This is in response to your letter of \n     March 7, 1996, regarding your proposed legislation under the \n     titles of the Adolescent Family Life and Abstinence Education \n     Act of 1996 and the Adoption Promotion Act of 1996.\n\n[[Page S4327]]\n\n       First of all, abstinence education is very important if \n     provided in an educational forum. Since many of our young \n     adults are members of one parent families whose family time \n     is limited by being the sole provider and, therefore, unable \n     to provide the ongoing moral and family stability. Because of \n     changes in society, our children can no longer be guaranteed \n     to receive the educational and moral values found in a stable \n     family unit. As professionals responsible for educating our \n     children, we have to go beyond the traditional reading, \n     writing and arithmetic in preparing them for adult life. With \n     this in mind, the need to continue with abstinence education \n     is vital to the development of a moral society.\n       Secondly, the idea of tax incentives for adoptive parents \n     would help ease the burden for those families who are more \n     than willing to adopt but are not financially able to do so. \n     This would also reduce the cost and the tragedy of long term \n     foster care. The long term financial benefits of such an \n     incentive plan can only benefit those children today and \n     society tomorrow.\n       In conclusion, I would like to offer Washington County's \n     support on your proposed legislation.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                Joseph A. Ford, Sr., Chairman.\n\n     Washington County Board of Commissioners,\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            Chestnut Hill College,\n\n\n                                      Office of the President,\n\n                                                   March 12, 1996.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: I am writing to ask you to consider \n     introducing a bi-partisan amendment to restore targeted \n     programs to the Omnibus Appropriations Bill (H.R. 3019). \n     Central to such an amendment is the restoration of the \n     Perkins Loan and SSIG. As you know, thousands of Pennsylvania \n     college students will be affected by decisions governing the \n     future of such financial assistance.\n       As in the past, I know I can count on your support of \n     private higher education in the Commonwealth and throughout \n     the nation.\n       I applaud your plan to introduce legislation titled \n     Adolescent Family Life and Abstinence Education Act of 1996 \n     and the Adoption Promotion Act of 1996. I agree \n     wholeheartedly that people on both sides of the abortion \n     issue can work together to promote mutually agreeable \n     alternatives to abortion. Moreover, your observation that the \n     country needs to assess and respond to ``leading moral \n     indicators'' is cogent, insightful, and timely.\n       As always, Senator, I respect your ability to cut to the \n     core of issues, to name the problems, and to offer solutions. \n     In addition, I appreciate your balanced approach to public \n     policy.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE DISCRIMINATORY APPLICATION \n                   OF THE NEW BRUNSWICK PROVINCIAL SALES TAX.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) in July 1993, Canadian Customs officers began \n     collecting an 11% New Brunswick Provincial Sales Tax (PST) \n     tax on goods purchased in the United States by New Brunswick \n     residents, an action that has caused severe economic harm to \n     U.S. businesses located in proximity to the border with New \n     Brunswick;\n       (2) this impediment to cross-border trade compounds the \n     damage already done from the Canadian government's imposition \n     of a 7% tax on all goods bought by Canadians in the United \n     States;\n       (3) collection of the New Brunswick Provincial Sales Tax on \n     goods purchased outside of New Brunswick is collected only \n     along the U.S.-Canadian border--not along New Brunswick's \n     borders with other Canadian provinces--thus being \n     administered by Canadian authorities in a manner uniquely \n     discriminatory to Canadians shopping in the United States;\n       (4) in February 1994, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) \n     publicly stated an intention to seek redress from the \n     discriminatory application of the PST under the dispute \n     resolution process in Chapter 20 of the North American Free \n     Trade Agreement (NAFTA), but the United States Government has \n     still not made such a claim under NAFTA procedures; and\n       (5) initially, the USTR argued that filing a PST claim was \n     delayed only because the dispute mechanism under NAFTA had \n     not yet been finalized, but more than a year after such \n     mechanism has been put in place, the PST claim has still not \n     been put forward by the USTR.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Provincial Sales Tax levied by the Canadian \n     Province of New Brunswick on Canadian citizens of that \n     province who purchase goods in the United States violates the \n     North American Free Trade Agreement in its discriminatory \n     application to cross-border trade with the United States and \n     damages good relations between the United States and Canada; \n     and\n       (2) the United States Trade Representative should move \n     forward without further delay in seeking redress under the \n     dispute resolution process in Chapter 20 of the North \n     American Free Trade Agreement for the discriminatory \n     application of the New Brunswick Provincial Sales Tax on \n     U.S.-Canada cross-border trade.\n                                 ______\n\n\n             ABRAHAM (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENTS NOS. 3749-3750\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. DeWine) submitted two \namendments intended to be proposed by them to amendment No. 3743 \nproposed by Mr. Simpson to the bill S. 1644, supra;

However, \n     there are no official statistics available on the number of \n     mail-order brides entering the United States each year.\n       (2) The companies engaged in the mail-order bride business \n     earn substantial profits from their businesses.\n       (3) Although many of these mail-order marriages work out, \n     in many other cases, anecdotal evidence suggests that mail-\n     order brides often find themselves in abusive relationships. \n     There is also evidence to suggest that a substantial number \n     of mail-order marriages constitute marriage fraud under \n     United States law.\n       (4) Many mail-order brides comes to the United States \n     unaware or ignorant of United States immigration law. Mail-\n     order brides who are battered spouses often think that if \n     they flee an abusive marriage, they will be deported. Often \n     the citizen spouse threatens to have them deported if they \n     report the abuse.\n       (5) The Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates \n     the rate of marriage fraud between foreign nationals and \n     United States citizens or legal permanent residents as up to \n     five percent. It is unclear what percent of those marriage \n     fraud cases originated as mail-order marriages.\n       (b) Information Dissemination.--Each international \n     matchmaking organization doing business in the United States \n     shall disseminate to recruits, upon recruitment, such \n     immigration and naturalization information as the Immigration \n     and Naturalization Service deems appropriate, in the \n     recruit's native language, including information regarding \n     conditional permanent residence status, permanent resident \n     status, the battered spouse waiver of conditional permanent \n     resident status requirement, marriage fraud penalties, \n     immigrants' rights, the unregulated nature of the business, \n     and the study mandated in subsection (c).\n       (c) Study.--The Attorney General, in consultation with the \n     Commission of Immigration and Naturalization and the Violence \n     Against Women Office of the Department of Justice, shall \n     conduct a study to determine, among other things--\n       (1) the number of mail-order marriages;\n       (2) the extent of marriage fraud arising as a result of the \n     services provided by international matchmaking organizations;\n       (3) the extent to which mail-order spouses utilize section \n     244(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act providing \n     for waiver of deportation in the event of abuse, or section \n     204(a)(1)(A)(iii) of such Act providing for self-petitioning \n     for permanent resident status;\n       (4) the extent of domestic abuse in mail-order marriages; \n     and\n       (5) the need for continued or expanded regulation and \n     education to implement the objectives of the Violence Against \n     Women Act of 1994 in this area.\n       (d) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall submit a \n     report to the Congress setting forth the results of the study \n     conducted under subsection (c).\n       (e) Civil Penalty.--(1) The Attorney General shall impose a \n     civil penalty of not to exceed $20,000 for each violation of \n     subsection (b).\n       (2) Any penalty under paragraph (1) may be imposed only \n     after notice and opportunity for an agency hearing on the \n     record in accordance with sections 554 through 557 of title \n     5, United States Code.\n       (f) Definitions.--As used in this section:\n       (1) International matchmaking organization.--The term \n     ``international matchmaking organization'' means a \n     corporation, partnership, business, or other legal entity, \n     whether or not organized under the laws of the United States \n     or any State, that does business in the United States and for \n     profit offers to United States citizens or permanent resident \n     aliens, dating, matrimonial, or social referral services to \n     nonresident, noncitizens, by--\n       (A) an exchange of names, telephone numbers, addresses, or \n     statistics;\n       (B) selection of photographs; or\n       (C) a social environment provided by the organization in a \n     country other than the United States.\n       (2) Recruit.--The term ``recruit'' means a noncitizen, \n     nonresident person, recruited by the international \n     matchmaking organization for the purpose of providing dating, \n     matrimonial, or social referral services to United States \n     citizens or permanent resident aliens.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                 HELMS (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3849\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. HELMS (for himself, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Gramm) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by them to the bill S. 1664, supra; \nas follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the amendment, add the \n     following:\n       Sec.   .

MAIL-ORDER BRIDE BUSINESS.\n\n       (a) Congressional Findings.--The Congress makes the \n     following findings:\n       (1) There is a substantial ``mail-order bride'' business in \n     the United States. With approximately 200 companies in the \n     United States, an estimated 2,000 to 3,500 American men find \n     wives through mail-order bride catalogs each year. However, \n     there are no official statistics available on the number of \n     mail-order brides entering the United States each year.\n       (2) The companies engaged in the mail-order bride business \n     earn substantial profits from their businesses.\n       (3) Although many of these mail-order marriages work out, \n     in many other cases, anecdotal evidence suggests that mail-\n     order brides often find themselves in abusive relationships. \n     There is also evidence to suggest that a substantial number \n     of mail-order marriages constitute marriage fraud under \n     United States law.\n       (4) Many mail-order brides come to the United States \n     unaware or ignorant of United States immigration law.

Mr. President, I rise before you today to \ncongratulate four outstanding New Hampshire teachers on receiving the \n1995 Presidential Award for Excellence in Science and Mathematics \nTeaching. Kevin Murphy of Milford, an elementary school mathematics \nteacher at Milford Elementary School in Milford; Diane Lonergan of \nMerrimack, an elementary school science teacher at Memorial School in \nBedford; Diane Sawyer of Portsmouth, a secondary school mathematics \nteacher at Exeter Area Junior High School in Exeter; and Brewster \nBartlett of Loudon, a secondary school science teacher at Pinkerton \nAcademy in Derry were the four deserving recipients of this prestigious \naward.\n  The Presidential Awards for Excellence in Science and Mathematics \nTeaching Program is administered by the National Science Foundation \n[NSF]. The awards are designed to recognize and reward outstanding \nteachers from elementary and secondary schools who serve as models for \ntheir colleagues and encourage high quality teachers to enter and \nremain in the teaching field. In addition to the distinguished national \nrecognition that comes with the award, each recipient's school will \nreceive an NSF grant of $7,500 to be used under the direction of the \nteacher, and to supplement other resources for improving science or \nmathematics programs in the school system.\n  The four outstanding recipients of this teaching award will spend a \nweek in May in Washington, DC, for a series of events to commemorate \ntheir selection. They will be honored at the U.S. State Department and \nother organizations such as the National Academy of Science.\n  There is no more important resource in America today than our school \nteachers. As a former teacher, I understand the devotion and hard work \nnecessary to be a successful teacher and a positive role model for \nchildren. These four outstanding teachers have displayed not only \nextraordinary talents in their teaching, but have also shown a \nremarkable level of commitment to their students. I am proud to honor \nthese four exceptional teachers for nurturing the best and the \nbrightest students New Hampshire has to offer. I would like to \ncongratulate Kevin Murphy, Brewster Bartlett, Diane Lonergan, and Diane \nSawyer for this distinguished recognition, and thank them for their \ndevotion to students in New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/29/senate-section/article/S4358-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4358-S4359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CONFERENCE AGREEMENT ON THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION, H.R. 3019\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased I was able to support \nthe conference agreement on H.R. 3019, the 14th and final effort to \nprovide FY 96 funding for the various agencies of the Federal \nGovernment, when it passed the Senate on April 25 by a vote of 88-11.\n  After a long and wrenching struggle, Republicans and Democrats \nfinally reached agreement on the remaining fiscal year 1996 \nappropriations measures that will fund nine cabinet departments and \ndozens of agencies for the balance of this fiscal year. These \nappropriations bills were supposed to have been completed on September \n30 last year. Meanwhile more than half of the fiscal year has expired. \nHopefully, the exercise we have gone through this appropriations \ncycle--14 continuing resolutions and 2 long government shutdowns--will \nnot be repeated. It's time to get on with the business of Government \nand run it in a business-like manner.\n  Overall, appropriations levels for fiscal year 1996 have been cut by \n$23 billion. That represents a significant downpayment on reaching a \nbalanced budget over the next 7 years. The dispute concerning these \nbills was a struggle over priorities. The House bill, as originally \npassed, made cuts in programs that the President and many of us in \nCongress believe are critical to the long-term economic and social \nhealth of the Nation. While nobody received everything he or she wanted \nin this long-awaited conference agreement, I commend the conferees for \nmoving significantly closer to the President's position by providing \napproximately $5.1 billion more than the House originally sought for \neducation, job training, environmental protection, technology, and law \nenforcement. These increases, which I believe are essential investments \nin our future, have been fully offset with cuts in other accounts. The \nlack of certainty about Federal education funding levels was playing \nhavoc with school systems throughout the country. I am pleased that \nthey will now be able to accurately plan their budgets and sign teacher \ncontracts for the next school year.\n  I would also like to commend the conferees for their efforts to \neliminate\n\n[[Page S4359]]\n\nmost of the extraneous legislative riders in the bill. Under the \nconference agreement, the President was given the authority to waive \nimplementation of these riders, most of which are attempts to weaken \nour environmental laws and regulations. Knowing the strong commitment \nthat the President and Vice President have to protecting our \nenvironment, I am quite certain that the President will exercise his \nauthority to ensure that these riders are not implemented. These \nlegislative restrictions have no place on an appropriations bill to \nbegin with. More importantly, they seriously undermine our commitment \nto ensure a healthy and safe environment for our children. Every poll \nindicates that the public expects the Government to be the public \nsteward of our precious natural resources--our public lands, our air, \nand our water. That stewardship must not be abandoned.\n  This bill also addresses critical local issues. As all of my \ncolleagues know, flooding in the Devils Lake Basin continues to pose \nserious problems for residents and businesses in North Dakota. Just \nthis week, Devils Lake reached another 120-year high level and the lake \nis expected to rise by an additional two feet next June or July. When \nthe lake rose to its current level last July, it caused $50 million in \ndamages to roads and public and private property in the area. Similar \ndamages are expected this year.\n  Because of this serious situation, during the Senate's original \nconsideration of this measure, Senator Conrad and I proposed two \namendments to mitigate the flooding problems at Devils Lake. Those \namendments were adopted by the full Senate. The first amendment added \n$10 million to the Economic Development Administration budget for \nhazard mitigation assistance in the form of road raises and water \nstorage on private lands in the Devils Lake Basin. The second amendment \nprovided an additional $2.8 million to the Fish and Wildlife Service \nfor water storage and for necessary repairs on their already damaged \nlands in the Devils Lake area. The House bill had no similar \nprovisions.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \nparticularly Senators Hatfield, Byrd, Hollings, Gorton and Gregg, for \nensuring that the bulk of the money provided in our floor amendments \nwas retained in conference. While there are no earmarks in the \nconference agreement, the statement of managers report makes clear that \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service should give every consideration to the \nneeds at Devils Lake in allocating the $38.9 million in additional \ndisaster relief funding made available to that agency in the conference \nagreement.\n  The total pot of disaster funding in the bill for the Economic \nDevelopment Administration--$18 million--is made available for \ndisasters in the Pacific Northwest and for other disasters nationwide, \nso North Dakota will have to compete with other States for that money. \nSenator Conrad and I intend to work closely with the administration to \nensure that Devils Lake receives its fair share of that funding. If we \nsuccessful, we can take preventive measures to mitigate the anticipated \nflooding in the Devils Lake Basin this summer, and significantly reduce \nfuture Federal and State disaster assistance outlays.\n  While this is not a perfect agreement, it's a good compromise, and I \nam pleased that the overwhelming majority of my colleagues supported \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/29/senate-section/article/S4358-4", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    WELCOME TO DR.

Mr. President, this week the Senate Armed \nServices Committee is engaged in marking up the fiscal year 1997 \nDefense authorization bill. All of us on the committee, as well as many \nof my colleagues who are not on the defense committee, are concerned \nabout how we fund, structure, equip, maintain and train our military \nforces to meet the challenges which our country faces today and will \nface tomorrow as we defend and advance our national interests. I would \nlike to speak for a few moments today about some of the difficult \nquestions I believe we are facing as we confront the challenges which \nlie ahead for our military forces.\n  The millennium is coming and beyond it a new century--a century \nwhich, if what we see occurring around us today offers any indication, \nwill bring changes few of us can begin to imagine, no more than people \nat the end of the 19th century could have foretold what the 20th \ncentury would bring.\n  We need only to look at the incredible leaps which have occurred in \ntechnology in the past decade and the ever-increasing frequency with \nwhich new technological wonders are being introduced to know that the \n21st Century will be a time of amazing change full of great opportunity \nand great risk for all of us.\n  The past years have shown us not only that new technologies are \nbecoming more readily available--whether it is faster, smaller and \ncheaper computers and computer chips, inexpensive and reliable global \npositioning systems, or communications which permit us to bring into \nour homes hundreds of different television channels from around the \nworld, movies on demand, and global news which is real-time and all too \nreal--but that changes will have to come about in the way we organize \nour daily lives and the very structure of businesses and institutions \nin response to that technology. Those enterprises which fail to adapt \nto new technology quickly find themselves behind their competitors and, \nin the private sector, are soon out of business.\n  The same is true of national governments and military organizations--\nthose which are unable to recognize that rapid change is the one \nconstant in our lives and cannot exploit that change, risk falling \nbehind their potential competitors. History teaches that every \nsignificant new industrial or technological advance finds its way into \nwarfare. Unlike business, however, the price of failure for our \nnational security is not bankruptcy or disappointed shareholders; it \ncould well be the loss of our freedom, our foreign markets and the safe \nand prosperous future which all of us seek for our children.\n  Guaranteeing our security in the new century will require innovation. \nIt will also require courage and wisdom as we incorporate technology \nand innovation into our defense structure.\n  To help structure the very important debate which I believe we need \nto engage in across the country on national security, I would like to \noffer a few observations and pose a few questions\n  First, as we look to the future, we ought to be asking a very basic \nquestion: What is it we want our military to be able to do? Not just in \nthe sense of military capabilities--this is an important question we \nwill get to shortly--rather, the broader question that underlies the \nother. What role do we want the United States to play in the next \ncentury and what will we need our military to be able to do in order \nfor the US to play that role?\n\n[[Page S4360]]\n\n  I believe that America's values and interests in the 21st century \nwill demand that we play at least as active a role in the world as we \ndid in this century and especially during the cold war. We can already \nsee signs of this in the optempo rates of all our Armed Forces in the \nyears since the fall of the Berlin Wall. We cannot shrink from playing \nour part as world leader, nor should we. To make a long story short, \nlet me simply say that American leadership in world affairs increases \nthe personal security and economic opportunities of the American \npeople. This will be true in the next century as it is today.\n  We have now and will continue to have vital national interests in the \nsecurity and stability of Europe, Southwest Asia, the Middle East, East \nAsia and elsewhere, just as we have vital interests in maintaining our \nfreedom of access to sea- and air-lanes of transportation and commerce. \nWe must be able to defend these interests and values and to support \nthose who share them with us. We must continue to pursue them in the \ncentury ahead, as we have in the past, in concert with strategic allies \nand coalition partners. We should, if at all possible, try to go about \nthis work with our allies, particularly our NATO and Pacific partners, \nbut even with partners, it is essential that the military force we \nbegin to structure in the final years of this century will enable us to \nfulfill our role of internationalist leader in the next century.\n  Second, we must consider and evaluate the sources of the challenges \nwe are likely to face as we protect and advance our national interests \nin the international community of tomorrow. What kinds of regional \nhegemons are likely to develop in the years ahead and are any of them \nlikely to graduate into a superpower status--either because they are \nsmaller nations who obtain weapons of mass destruction or because they \nare larger nations who will have economic power coupled with weapons of \nmass destruction?\n\n  In the near term, the likelihood of a superpower--or ``peer \ncompetitor'' which could directly threaten the United States--is low. \nIt is precisely this lack of a near-term, superpower, peer competitor \nwhich provides us with breathing room, a window of opportunity, if you \nwill, in which we can reassess our military structures and be willing \nto take some risks in order to ensure our Armed Forces are properly \nstructured, sized and equipped in the longer-term. We can afford to \nstep back and take a look at where we are and where we want to go and \nto take some risk today to prevent a much greater risk in the future if \nwe fail to make this reassessment.\n  Third, we must consider the form challenges to our interests are \nlikely to take in the next century. Are conflicts likely to be of the \ncold war variety--either in the sense of needing to rely on our nuclear \ndeterrent capability or requiring massive numbers of ground forces as \nwould have been needed to fight a Soviet invasion of Western Europe--or \nwill they be on the order and scale of Haiti, Somalia, or Bosnia. I \nbelieve that, in the near- and mid-term, they are more likely to be of \nthe latter sort. As Gen. Charles Krulak, Commandant of the Marine Corps \nand someone who is thinking long and hard about ``the day after \ntomorrow,'' has said, the future is most likely not ``Son of Desert \nStorm;'' rather, it will be ``Stepchild of Somalia and Chechnya.''\n  We cannot rule out the possibility of another Saddam Hussein rising \nin a region of strategic interest to the United States nor can we \ndiscount the potential for a resurgence of Russian nationalism or \naggressiveness, or Chinese or Islamic nationalism or aggressiveness \nparticularly if coupled with the ability to deliver weapons of mass \ndestruction. We must do all we can to prepare for such a possibility \nusing every tool available to a country of our stature--economic, \ndiplomatic, and military. To use the terminology of Secretary of \nDefense Perry, we must maintain a hedging capability to counter such \nthreats if they arise. But we also must be ready for smaller \ncontingencies which I believe will be more likely and, unfortunately, \nmore frequent.\n  We also cannot ignore the unconventional challenges which we face \ntoday and which we will, without a doubt, face on a greater scale in \nthe decades ahead. Here I mean the threat of terrorist actions beyond \nand within our borders and the ever-increasing dangers posed by the \nspread of relatively inexpensive weapons of mass destruction--\nespecially chemical and biological weapons. We must have forces and \npolicies which allow us to respond to all of these challenges and to \nhead them off whenever we can.\n  Our strategic planners must think hard and innovatively about the way \nothers--both states and non-state actors--will try to influence what we \ndo in the future. In this regard, I recommend to you an article which \nappeared in the January 29th issue of the Weekly Standard by Col. \nCharles Dunlap, an Air Force lawyer and a provocative thinker and \nwriter. In this article, entitled ``How We Lost the High-Tech War of \n2007,'' a fictional Holy Leader of some unstated group recaps the \nstrategy used to defeat the United States by terror and exploiting the \npower of televised images of death and destruction. In a particularly \nunsettling passage, he says:\n\n       Though we rarely defeated the Americans on the battlefield, \n     we were able to inflict such punishment that they were soon \n     pleading for peace at any price. With their economy in ruins, \n     their borders compromised, their people demoralized, and \n     civil unrest everywhere, they could not continue. We had \n     broken their will! They had no choice but to leave us with \n     the lands we conquered and the valuable resources they \n     contain.\n\n  And finally, we are told: ``We taught the Americans that no computer \nwages war with the exquisite finality of a simple bayonet thrust.'' So, \nwhile we work to exploit the technology of the future, we cannot afford \nto become its prisoner.\n  Fourth, we must confront the question of how to shape, size and equip \nour military forces in order for them to do what we want of them and to \nbe able to confront--and defeat if need be --the wide range of \nchallenges we will face. While all of the preceding questions are \nimportant, this question is the one toward which the other questions \nlead. It is, in fact, the reason why we must ask and answer the \npreceding questions.\n  When the Clinton administration came to office in 1993, Secretary of \nDefense Aspin undertook the Bottom-Up Review ``to define the strategy, \nforce structure, modernization programs, industrial base, and \ninfrastructure needed to meet new dangers and seize new \nopportunities.'' The Bottom-Up Review was a useful transitional \ndocument, but I believe it is already inadequate to the present and \ncertainly to the future because it does not appropriately answer the \npreceding questions. The reality of the strategic environment has \nalready changed and the resources we have committed to our military \nhave been limited. It is time for a new strategic review by the \nDepartment of Defense on behalf of the President, and, I believe we \nwould benefit at this time in our history from the work of an \nindependent, bipartisan commission.\n  I hope that Congress will mandate before long both a new Bottom-Up \nReview and a National Bipartisan Commission. I am confident that \ndedicated and innovative thinkers both within the Administration and \noutside it will be able to put us on the right course for the next \ncentury. This must be done soon. I do not believe that we can afford--\neither fiscally or strategically--to continue to tinker at the margins \nof our military forces or to procure just the same sorts of Cold War \nsystems in ever diminishing quantities (and at an ever-increasing \nprice).\n\n  As we seek to answer the questions of how best to size, shape and \nequip our military forces, we must take a hard look at technology, \ndefense organization and management, industrial base capabilities, and \nresearch and development capabilities where we have a competitive \nadvantage over potential adversaries. Then, keeping in mind the \nwarnings of thoughtful people like Charles Dunlap, we must exploit \nthese advantages to structure and equip our forces appropriately. I \nwould caution against thinking of ``defense innovation'' strictly in \nterms of developing new technologies. That is overly simplistic and \npotentially dangerous. Innovation must incorporate organization, \nstrategy, and doctrine as well. If we are to succeed in the new \ncentury, we must be innovative in our thinking about what we procure \nand how we procure it, the way our forces are organized and sized, and \nthe way they will respond to challenges which may be unlike most of \nwhat we have encountered so far in our history.\n\n[[Page S4361]]\n\n  It is conventional wisdom today to say that a technology-driven \nrevolution in military affairs is here. The technological advances I \nspoke of earlier beckon us to find ways to integrate what will be \ncommonplace tomorrow into the decisions we are making today on weapons \nsystems, command and control systems, intelligence gathering \ncapabilities, and the means of conducting and defeating information \nwarfare.\n  As a subset of this question, we must consider ``how do we get from \nhere to there?'' What is our transition strategy? How do we ensure that \nwe do not reverse course in our procurement strategies so precipitously \nthat important defense industries find themselves gutted of their \nskilled work forces, critical research and development, or essential \nnear-term production? How do we ensure that we do not make \ntechnologically-driven alterations in our force structure that diminish \nthe effectiveness and morale of our troops?\n  Government and industry need to form a new partnership in which both \nsides work together to ensure that we develop and buy the right \nproducts at the right price and in the right quantities to protect our \nnational security without fiscally overburdening the Nation. We cannot \nafford the luxury of buying products which do not provide the \ncapabilities we need for tomorrow. Nor can we afford to procure weapons \nsystems which just provide more of the capabilities we already possess.\n  Throughout all of this runs the very serious question of fiscal \nresources. The traditional question ``how much is enough?'' is no \nlonger sufficient--if, in fact, it ever was. We cannot be concerned \njust with aggregate spending levels though much of the current and \nfuture debate will center on the ``right number'' for the defense \nbudget for this fiscal year or during the Future Years Defense Plan, or \nFYDP. If we are to succeed in making the best use of limited defense \ndollars, we must also ask ``are we spending defense dollars wisely?''\n  If we hope to be able to maintain the support of our people for \nspending to protect our national security, we must be able to \ndemonstrate that we have broken the chains of tradition and \nparochialism within the Congress, the Executive branch and in the \nmilitary services and are investing in a military force for the future \nnot the past.\n  The debate which many of us in the Congress have been and are engaged \nin must stay focused on the right questions. There is a danger that \nliberal Democrats, many of whom want to cut defense spending to \nincrease social spending, will join Republican budget hawks, who want \nto cut defense spending to reduce the deficit, to form an odd-couple \ndefense-cutting coalition.\n  But neither group, as far as I can see, is asking the right questions \nbefore recommending that defense spending should be cut. And neither \ngroup acknowledges that we are spending a smaller percentage of our GDP \non defense today than at any time since Pearl Harbor. Total defense \nexpenditures may be able to be reduced in future years--although I am \nskeptical--but we won't know if this is the right decision until we \nanswer the basic questions I have posed: what are the security \nchallenges of the next century and what do we need to meet them?\n  There are, in fact, a number of thoughtful studies underway today \nwhich are examining these questions. Each of them seems to start with \nthe premise that our current force structure may well be most \nappropriate for the kinds of conflict which will occur least often in \nthe future. We need to pursue this premise not as a means of hacking \naway at one service or another just for the sake of downsizing or as a \nmeans of capturing savings to procure one favored weapons system over \nanother, but because technology may have the same potential to achieve \npersonnel reductions in the military as it has in the private sector. \nMilitary success in the future will depend on how visionary and clear-\nheaded we are today and on how courageous we are prepared to be.\n  Remember the familiar line from Ralph Waldo Emerson's Self-Reliance, \n``A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds adored by \nlittle statesmen and philosophers and divines.'' We have the \nintellectual strength in this country today both in the Pentagon and \noutside to ensure we do not maintain a foolish consistency and that we \nbreak with the models and standards of the past if that is what is best \nfor our Nation's security.\n  Andy Marshall and Bill Owens have certainly laid the groundwork for \nsuch thinking within the Pentagon. Organizations such as the Center for \nStrategic and Budgetary Assessments have been active, creative and \nconstructive in contributing to the debate with their analyses. The \nAmerican Enterprise Institute, under the leadership of Dick Cheney and \nRichard Perle, and the Democratic Leadership Council, which I have the \nprivilege of chairing, have completed studies or have work underway \nwhich have or will offer innovative and thought-provoking analyses and \nproposals. Taking these efforts in conjunction with my proposals for a \nnew strategic review by the Department of Defense and an independent \nNational Bipartisan Commission, I believe we can and will get it right, \nthough the conclusions we come to may be painful for many to accept.\n  We must be engaged in this difficult debate today if we are to have \nthe best defense tomorrow and avoid maintaining the world's finest \nfighting force for wars we have already fought. We must also engage in \nit in order to rebuild the popular consensus which is essential for our \nnational security in support of sufficient defense spending. If we \ninvolve more of our citizens in these discussions, Congress and the \nAmerican people will be willing to provide the necessary resources, \nbecause they will understand that Sir John Slessor was right when he \nsaid:\n\n       It is customary in democratic countries to deplore \n     expenditure on armaments as conflicting with the requirements \n     of the social services. There is a tendency to forget that \n     the most important social service that a government can do \n     for its people is to keep them alive and free.\n\n  If we are, in fact, going to do our duty to keep the American people \n``alive and free,'' we must engage in this debate with all our energy, \nour intellect and our courage. We owe this to the people who have sent \nus to the Senate to serve them and we owe it to the future of our great \ncountry. I hope my remarks today will be seen as a contribution to this \nimportant debate and I look forward to engaging all of my colleagues in \nthese important discussions. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/29/senate-section/article/S4359-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4361-S4362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TRIBUTE TO SUSAN M. SANDERS, THE NEW HAMPSHIRE SMALL BUSINESS \n                    ACCOUNTANT ADVOCATE OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a hard \nworking New Hampshire accountant, Susan M. Sanders, on being named the \n1996 New Hampshire Small Business Accountant Advocate of the Year. The \nSmall Business Administration recently honored Susan with this award \nbased on a number of criteria such as volunteer work to assist small \nfirms, advocacy of a reduction of financial and regulatory requirements \nfor small businesses, and support for initiatives to promote \nlegislation strengthening the financial help of small businesses.\n  Susan is a certified public accountant and supervisor at Melanson, \nGreenwood & Co., a CPA firm in Nashua. She specializes in small \nbusiness accounting and management advisory services with emphasis on \nstartup businesses. She provides assistance to small business people \nseeking counseling and consulting services on financial and management \nmatters. Susan also prepares a quarterly publication of statistical \ninformation entitled Economic Conditions In NH, which is distributed \nfree through the Nashua and Manchester Chambers of Commerce to business \nand government leaders, and is included in relocation packages mailed \nto prospective employers. Susan's commitment to the success of small \nbusinesses is also reflected by her outstanding volunteer work for \nlocal organizations such as the Nashua Chamber of Commerce, the Greater \nNashua Center for Economic Development, and the Nashua Small Business \nDevelopment Center.\n  As a dedicated small business accountant, Susan believes that small \nbusiness owners are a special breed of people that should be admired \nfor their determination, innovation, and courage. Susan's own work with \nsmall businesses demonstrates many of these same qualities.\n  Small business is not only the backbone of our economy, but an \nexpression\n\n[[Page S4362]]\n\nof the freedom and opportunity America has to offer. As a former small \nbusiness owner myself, I am proud to honor Susan for donating her time \nand talents to helping small businesses succeed in the Granite State. \nAs a professional and a volunteer, she has devoted countless hours \ntoward securing the American dream of prosperity for small business \nowners. I would like to congratulate Susan for this prestigious \nrecognition, and thank her for her steadfast devotion to small business \nowners in New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/29/senate-section/article/S4361-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA GRIZZLIES\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in December of last year, my staff and I, \nas well as some Montanans who were in the DC area, traveled hundreds of \nmiles to West Virginia to see a football game. It wasn't just any \nordinary football game, it was the NCAA Division I-AA Football \nChampionship, which pitted the University of Montana against Marshall \nUniversity.\n  The game was the most exciting of my life. After a come-from-behind \ndrive that lead to a last minute field goal, the University of Montana \nGrizzlies won their first football championship in the school's \nhistory. That day I saw my team beat an opponent that ESPN said was the \nheavy favorite. I saw my team beat an opponent that had played in the \nbig game many times before. I saw my team beat an opponent that has so \ndominated Division I-AA football that they will soon be moved to \nDivision I competition. You see, my team possessed qualities that are \nhard to measure: heart, self-discipline, work ethic. A player can learn \nthese qualities from only one person, their coach.\n  Mr. President, I was saddened, but not disappointed, to learn that \nDon Read will retire from coaching the Montana Grizzlies football team. \nI was saddened to see that our coach, with 10 straight years of winning \nseasons and a national championship under his belt, had decided to move \non. But I was not disappointed because I know that Don will still play \na major role in his community.\n  Ask anyone involved with Grizzly football and they will tell you that \nDon is not only a great coach, but an even better person. UM president \nGeorge Dennison said it best:\n\n       The Read legacy has much more substance than winning at all \n     costs. For him, winning mattered. But other things counted \n     more. As his record and actions revealed, the welfare and \n     success of his players as students, athletes and human beings \n     always came first.\n\n  Coach Read rode a wave of success that went beyond winning football \ngames. He made winners of his players on and off the field.\n  Don would be the first to tell you that Montana has been good to him. \nOn behalf of all of us in our State, coach, you have also been very \ngood to Montana.\n  Mr. President, I close by asking to have printed in the Record an \neditorial published by the Missoulian that reflects my sentiments \nexactly.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                  [From the Missoulian, Apr. 16, 1996]\n\n                      Thanks for the Memories, Don\n\n       Thank you, Don Read, for 10 truly remarkable and wonderful \n     years. That national NCAA championship was something. Those \n     faces of UM's athletes, the thrill, the pride. It was classy \n     win on all fronts, earned outright by coaches and players \n     alike. We still ride high.\n       Thanks for those very impressive statistics. Ten seasons, \n     all winners. Ten wins against the Bobcats. Wow.\n       Thanks for selecting high-quality assistant coaches who \n     lead with skill and compassion.\n       Thanks for loving and respecting Missoula. We saw you \n     walking, with your wife, Lois along the river, through \n     downtown streets, on campus, in your own neighborhood, \n     meandering through the Farmers' Market. You took time to know \n     this place and all it offers. Even when you built a new house \n     in an old district, you did so with sensitivity to \n     neighborhood history and character.\n       Thank you for loving your family. We saw that, too, when \n     you talked with pride and respect of your own children and \n     grandchildren.\n       And who knows what marvelous effect you've had on other \n     children. Kids who gathered to watch the Grizzlies practice \n     met a coach who welcomed them and their daydreams--and who \n     offered them gum and wise words on the sidelines:\n       UM's players, too, seem to understand both the value of \n     individual accomplishments and the necessity and beauty of \n     teamwork, traits made strong by the quality of leaders on the \n     coaching staff.\n       Thank you for carrying yourself with pride and honor on the \n     road, during and after the season, when meeting with alumni, \n     when talking to fans, when wooing contributors, when meeting \n     everyday people. Never once did we cringe at what you said or \n     how you acted, in private or in public.\n       Did you ever whine about salaries or belittle players or \n     make snide comments about other coaches? Not that we ever \n     heard. Even after losses you offered nothing but words of \n     support and pride and encouragement along with honest \n     analysis.\n       Thanks for the seasons. For the wins. For the class.\n       The pleasure was ours.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/29/senate-section/article/S4362-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CEASE-FIRE IN LEBANON\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the \ndecision of the parties to the crisis in Lebanon to institute a cease-\nfire. Every day last week, I urged Secretary Christopher in the \nstrongest possible terms to do everything in his power to cease the \nhostilities between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. I would like to \ncongratulate Secretary Christopher for his intense efforts in \nnegotiating this cease-fire. It is my sincere hope that the parties \nwill abide by the cease-fire, and eventually work toward a \ncomprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East.\n  The cease-fire is based upon an agreement on a set of understandings, \nthe most important of which is the agreement not to fire weapons at \ncivilians or civilian populated areas. With over 150 civilians dead as \na result of the violence in Lebanon, the urgency of ceasing hostilities \naimed at civilians is of utmost priority.\n  Now that an agreement to end the hostilities has been reached Mr. \nPresident, I urge the administration to contribute more financial \nresources to assist the civilians in Lebanon. As part of the most \nrecent cease-fire agreement, the United States, France, Syria, Lebanon, \nIsrael, Russia, and the European Union have agreed to form a \nconsultative group which will assist in the reconstruction needs of \nLebanon. It is my hope that the United States will take a leadership \nrole in the consultative group by granting considerably more additional \nassistance to Lebanon than what it already has.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/29/senate-section/article/S4362-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4362-S4363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               WALTER MONTGOMERY: THE PASSING OF A LEGEND\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \npay tribute to a man who set the example for excellence and \ncompetitiveness in the textile industry. Walter Montgomery, Sr., was \nthe godfather of textiles in South Carolina. He is the reason that we \nhave an outstanding textile industry today. Anyone who came into \ncontact with Mr. Walter could tell you that he was a real legend--and \nnot only as a force in the Nation's textile industry. An outstanding \nfigure in the field of community service, he helped countless numbers \nof people in his native Spartanburg County during his 95 years.\n  Walter Montgomery was born in Spartanburg in 1900. He began working \nat Spartan Mills, founded by his grandfather, Captain John H. \nMontgomery, in 1922. In 1929, after the death of his father, Walter \nMontgomery became president. He passed on the title to his son in 1972, \nand took his place as the chairman of Spartan Mills. In this capacity, \nhe was one of the Nation's top textile executives and led the industry \ntoward modernization.\n  Mr. Walter, as he was known affectionately, was a firm believer in \nthe value of associations and institutes. He served as the president or \nchairman of just about every textile group there was, from the South \nCarolina Textile Manufacturers Association to what is now called the \nAmerican Textile Manufacturing Institute. In 1989, Montgomery was named \n``Textile Leader of the Year'' by Textile World Magazine. It selected \nhim not so much for his impressive management skills within his own \ncompany, but for his unselfish leadership of the industry as a whole.\n  Talk to anyone about Walter Montgomery and they will tell you about \nhis outstanding leadership. Through his tireless efforts in the \nindustry and the boundless energy he dedicated to the community, Mr. \nWalter earned the respect of everyone. Working with organizations such \nas the Spartanburg County Foundation, United Way, Junior Achievement, \nand Wofford College, he created a bridge between business\n\n[[Page S4363]]\n\nand humanitarianism. He was also an active member of the Episcopal \nChurch of the Advent, and once served as scoutmaster of the church's \nBoy Scout troop.\n  If it sounds unusual for one of the Nation's top textile executives \nto have this active an extracurricular schedule, it is. Walter \nMontgomery was an extraordinary man. He had a sincere love for the \ntextile industry, and he passed on his enthusiasm to all the workers \nand executives he knew. He believed in education, and contributed time \nand money to the establishment and maintenance of educational \ninstitutions. Among his beneficiaries were Wofford College, Converse \nCollege, the University of South Carolina-Spartanburg and what is now \nthe Spartanburg Methodist College, which his father had been \ninstrumental in forming.\n  I will miss his vigor, drive, and wise advice. He was an example to \nme of how one can balance work and charity. Peatsy joins me in sending \nour condolences to his family along with our gratitude for the many \nlives he touched in South Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/29/senate-section/article/S4362-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4363-S4365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE TERRORISM PREVENTION ACT\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks \nconcerning the recently-passed Terrorism Prevention Act. I was actively \ninvolved in working out the version of the bill that passed the Senate \nlast year. However, I was not a conferee in the negotiations between \nthe House and the Senate that produced the final version that was \nenacted into law last week. Recognizing how difficult it can be to \nreach agreement among a majority of one hundred Senators, I appreciate \nthe daunting task of attaining agreement between not only the two \ncongressional bodies, but also between Congress and the President, \nespecially on such an important piece of legislation as the Terrorism \nPrevention Act.\n  Nevertheless, I do want to note that in my view, while the final \nversion contains provisions that make the bill one of this Congress's \nproudest accomplishments, it also contains other provisions included at \nthe insistence of the Administration that have rightly raised serious \nconcerns among serious people from all across the political spectrum.\n  Violent acts against American citizens, whether for political reasons \nor otherwise, cannot be tolerated. But for too long, our criminal \njustice system has been excessively solicitous of the rights of violent \ncriminals whose guilt is not in doubt.\n  This must stop. The Terrorism Prevention Act's habeas corpus reforms \nwill play an important role in stopping it by preventing prisoners on \ndeath row from gaming our legal system with countless appeals. So, too, \nwill its provisions limiting the ability of non-citizens who have \ncommitted serious crimes in this country to avoid deportation by filing \ncountless meritless court challenges to deportation orders.\n  At the same time, it is also important that we do not let the \npendulum swing too far in the other direction and trample on the civil \nrights of those who have committed no crime. Other provisions in the \nTerrorism Prevention Act that were included at the insistence of \nPresident Clinton will restrict fundraising for organizations suspected \nbut not proven to be terrorist on the basis of secret evidence. These, \nI believe, present a serious risk of jeopardizing the freedoms of all \nAmericans. I would like to discuss both types of provisions.\n  I was delighted, though admittedly confused when, in the wake of the \nOklahoma City bombing, President Clinton stated that the perpetrators \nof that bombing would be brought to swift and certain justice. As the \nvictims of any type of crime in this country know, and apparently know \nbetter than the President himself, our criminal justice system in its \npresent form makes ``swift and certain'' justice for criminals all but \nimpossible.\n  Instead, convicted criminals--murderers, child molesters, and \nthieves--have been able to game the system for far too long. The \nparents of children who have been molested and murdered and the \nfamilies of other murder victims many of whom were tortured or raped \nbefore they were killed have had to wait year after year as their \nchild's murderer appeals a capital sentence time and time again--not on \ngrounds of innocence but because their trials were not perfect. And \nsometimes the attackers have been released by courts more concerned \nabout the technical rights of criminals than the need to see that the \nlaw is carried out and justice served.\n  Swift and certain justice has not been possible in this country, not \nfor common criminals and not for the perpetrators of terrorist acts, \nbecause of the endless appeals permitted by the habeas corpus \nprocedures enacted by Congress. As Senator Hatch has recently noted, \nthere were about 2,976 inmates on death row in 1995. Yet, the States \nhave executed only 263 of these convicted killers since 1973. Habeas \nappeals alone make up 40 percent of the total delay from sentence to \nexecution.\n  The notorious case of Robert Alton Harris demonstrates rather vividly \nwhere the vices in our present criminal justice system lead. Harris \nkilled his first victim in 1975. In a savage attack that included hours \nof torture, Harris beat his next-door neighbor to death. He was \nconvicted of manslaughter and sentenced to prison. Even in prison, his \nuncontrollable violence was said to make him a danger to the other \ninmates.\n  Six months after he was paroled, Harris abducted two high school \nsophomores as they sat eating hamburgers in a car. He drove them to a \nwooded area and shot them to death, chasing one of the boys through the \nwoods and gunning him down as he crouched in the bushes screaming for \nhis life. Harris then returned to the first victim and shot him again. \nOver that boy's dead body, Harris sat down and finished the boys' half-\neaten hamburgers.\n  Harris did not deny his guilt, but in fact admitted the murders in \nopen court. He explained he had murdered the boys because he needed \ntheir car to commit a bank robbery--the crime for which he had \noriginally been arrested. He was given the death penalty by a jury on \nMarch 6, 1979. Thirteen years passed before the jury's verdict was \ncarried out and Harris was finally executed.\n  During those 13 years--the years when his teenage victims could have \nbeen completing college, starting jobs, getting married, and having \nchildren--Harris filed 10 habeas corpus petitions with the State courts \nand 6 habeas corpus petitions with the Federal courts. The boys' \nparents were notified of five execution dates, four of which were \ncanceled by the courts. But for Harris' habeas petitions, he could have \nbeen executed as early as October 1981, after review by the California \nSupreme Court and further review by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Reform of our habeas corpus system has been needed, and needed badly, \nfor several decades now.\n  The Oklahoma City bombing finally provided the clarion call that made \nit possible for the Republican majority, with President Clinton's \nreluctant acquiescence, and over stiff resistance by a majority of the \nDemocrats, to enact reforms to this legal quagmire. These reforms are \nlong, long overdue.\n  At last, because of the Terrorism Prevention Act, the limitless \nopportunities for the Federal judiciary to overturn criminal \nconvictions will come to an end. And at last, State courts will be \nallowed to enforce capital sentences against convicted murderers \nwithout the Federal courts granting repetitive hearings that have \nallowed death row prisoners to languish in prison for a decade or more.\n  The habeas corpus reforms may well be the single most important \nlegislation that this Congress has passed. If the Terrorism Prevention \nAct had no other provisions to recommend it, I would have voted for the \nact for its habeas corpus reforms.\n  Also praiseworthy are the provisions that address the serious problem \nthis country has with deporting criminal aliens. Though officially \ndesignated ``criminal aliens'' rather than ``terrorists,'' as far as I \nam concerned, noncitizens who commit violent, felonious acts against \nAmerican citizens are resident terrorists, irrespective of their \nofficial designation. Indeed, according to the FBI, alien terrorists \nhave been responsible for exactly two terrorist incidents in the United \nStates in the last 11 years: the World Trade Center bombing and a \ntrespassing incident at the Iranian Mission to the United Nations.\n  Meanwhile, more than 50,000 crimes have been committed by aliens in \nthis\n\n[[Page S4364]]\n\ncountry recently enough that the perpetrators are still incarcerated in \nState and Federal prisons right now.\n  Noncitizens in this country who are convicted of committing serious \ncrimes are deportable and should be deported. These are not \n``suspected'' criminals or members of secretly designated terrorist \ngroups: These are convicted felons. And there are about half a million \nof them currently residing on U.S. soil.\n  The reason these criminal aliens are here, despite their \ndeportability under U.S. law, is that they are able to manipulate our \nimmigration laws by requesting endless review of their orders of \ndeportation. Exactly as in the habeas corpus context, these are \nconvicted criminals obstructing the operation of law by abusing unduly \ngenerous provisions of judicial and administrative review. As long, as \na petition for review is pending, they cannot be deported. Thus, at \npresent, aliens who are convicted felons are deported at a rate of \nabout 4 percent a year.\n  The case of Lyonel Dor is typical. Lyonel Dor, a citizen of Haiti, \nentered the United States illegally in 1972. This alone made him \ndeportable as an illegal alien. Six years later he participated in the \nmurder of his aunt. For this, he was convicted of first degree \nmanslaughter and served 6\\1/2\\ years in prison. This made him doubly \ndeportable, since aliens who commit crimes of violence in the United \nStates are deportable even if they were here legally in the first \nplace.\n\n  Accordingly, Dor was ordered deported in March 1985 following a full \nadministrative hearing on whether such an order should be entered. At \nthat hearing, Dor conceded deportability. He took no direct \nadministrative appeal from the March 1985 order, although he would have \nbeen entitled to do so.\n  Nevertheless, as of late 1989, Dor had not been deported.\n  Instead, he remained in this country, requesting and receiving \nunending additional collateral administrative review and judicial \nreview of his order of deportation, tying up the courts and the INS for \nmore than 5 years after completing his criminal sentence. As of today, \nApril 29, 1996, I do not know whether Lyonel Dor has ever deported, or \nwhether he is still in this country requesting more review.\n  According to court documents described in the 1989 case, since \narriving in this country illegally, Dor received the attention of a \ntotal of 14 administrative processes and 6 judicial processes, \nincluding the criminal proceedings on his participation in the murder \nof his aunt. The deportation effort alone for this illegal immigrant \nand convicted murderer entailed 13 administrative proceedings and 4 \njudicial proceedings. In two of the four judicial proceedings, Federal \ncourts directed that Dor not be deported until the order of deportation \ncould be further subject to yet more review.\n  In this Act, as well as in the illegal immigration bill, I have \nstrongly promoted legal reforms that will put an end to such \nabsurdities. The Terrorism Prevention Act contains some of these \nprovisions, including important reforms that will place some \nconstraints on the almost limitless opportunities for criminal aliens \nto delay their deportations.\n  In particular, without touching in any way any direct appeal an alien \nmay have in connection with his underlying criminal conviction, it \ndenies judicial review of orders of deportation entered against \ncriminal aliens, eliminates certain grounds for administrative review \nof the orders of deportation entered against criminal aliens, and \nrequires the Attorney General to deport criminal aliens with 30 days of \nthe final order of deportation. I should add that during the Judiciary \nCommittee markup of the pending illegal immigration bill, S. 1664, I \nproposed amendments to that legislation that will make additional \nreforms, and I am pleased to say that they were adopted and form a part \nof the bill now before Congress.\n  On the other hand, there are other provisions in this act that I \nbelieve could be construed as being insufficiently attentive to civil \nliberties. I say this as one who is aware that cries of civil liberties \nviolations can easily deteriorate into crying wolf when no wolf is \nanywhere in the neighborhood, and that it is therefore doubly important \nto be sure such concerns are legitimate so as not to dull the American \npeople's vigilance against governmental excess. Nevertheless, I believe \nin this instance there are legitimate grounds for concern.\n  The provisions that most concern me regard not convicted criminals, \nbut, at least theoretically, the wholly innocent. These are the \nprovisions of the act that will criminalize certain fundraising \nactivities.\n  The fundraising provisions have a long history to which the \nConference Report provided an unsatisfactory conclusion. The \nfundraising proposals in the bill originally sent to Congress by the \nPresident had been quite controversial. Indeed, Senators and citizens \nof all political persuasions--Democrats and Republicans, liberals and \nconservatives--were concerned that in seeking to punish the guilty \nthese provisions went too far in endangering the rights of the \ninnocent. Obviously, this will always be a difficult balance to strike.\n  But these proposals would have given a President unilateral \nauthority, on the basis of secret evidence and without judicial review, \nto make it a crime to contribute money to any organization--domestic or \nforeign, charitable or political--designated by the President as \nbelonging on a ``terrorist'' list.\n\n  It is not difficult to imagine how such a provision would invite \nabuse.\n  People with a grievance against any organization could claim that \nsome charitable or religious organization they didn't like was a \nterrorist organization. The accused organization could then be \ndesignated a ``terrorist'' organization without being provided any \ninformation about the basis on which it was being so charged or \nafforded an opportunity to contest the designation.\n  History teaches us that star chamber proceedings of this type present \ngrave risks of error and injustice.\n  At the hearings on the bill, concerns about these provisions and \ntheir constitutional implications were raised by a number of Senators, \nincluding Senator Specter and myself, as well as the American Civil \nLiberties Union and the American Jewish Committee.\n  After a great deal of discussion and negotiation, the Senate bill \nmade a number of revisions. These included additions to the fundraising \nprovisions that would make the designation of an organization subject \nto the traditional legal safeguards: review by a neutral court, and \nmaximum disclosure to the accused organization of the information \nagainst it--consistent with national security interests and the safety \nof those providing the information.\n  The provisions in the Senate bill may not have been perfect. Indeed, \nboth the New York Times and USA Today subsequently editorialized that \nmany of these provisions still posed risks to civil liberties, even as \ntoned down in the Senate bill. There was, no doubt, room for \nimprovement. But instead of providing more protections for the secretly \naccused organizations, the Conference Report seems to provide fewer.\n  For example, whereas the Senate bill provided for full judicial \nreview of the designation of an organization as ``terrorist'', the act \nthat emerged from conference provides only for limited review on the \nadministrative record. That means that the findings of fact of the \nadministrative officer will receive some degree of deference by the \nreviewing court. More seriously still, it permits an organization to be \ndesignated as ``terrorist'' in the administrative proceeding entirely \non the basis of classified information. Under the terms of the bill, \nthat material can remain secret from the designated organization or any \nof its representatives throughout both the administrative and judicial \nprocess.\n  Despite the serious consequences that flow from such a designation, \nthe Conference Report nowhere expressly provides for any disclosure of \nsummaries or partial disclosure of the secret information to the \naccused organization, even though the necessity for such a total \nblackout may often be wanting. While the courts may well find such \nCongressional silence insufficient to infer an intent to bar the \nmaximum disclosure possible, in light of our country's historical \ndistrust of secret proceedings, I believe Congress should have made \nexpress provision for such disclosure.\n  To a lesser degree I believe the procedures established by this \nlegislation for removing aliens suspected of being terrorists on the \nbasis of classified information are open to similar criticism.\n\n[[Page S4365]]\n\n Although these provisions at least require some form of summary, in my \nview they strike the balance between the alien and the Government less \ncarefully and less fairly than the Senate version of the bill.\n  The fight against terrorism and all criminal acts against Americans \nmust be conducted vigorously, relentlessly, and in a manner that \nrespects basic civil liberties. I believe the fundraising and alien \nterrorist removal provisions are one area in which the Terrorism \nPrevention Act could have been improved by not leaving civil liberties \nprotections to the Executive and Judicial branches. I would have \npreferred for the act to have to have expressly provided for disclosure \nof the secret information to the maximum extent possible.\n  It is my hope that despite the administration's insensitivity to \nthese concerns and its insistence on including these provisions in \ntheir current objectionable form, during the legislative process, the \nexecutive branch will be sensitive to the questionable \nconstitutionality of these provisions when it turns to enforcing them \nand will take great care in their use. Should it fail to do so, I would \nexpect the courts to step in. In any event, and especially should the \nexecutive branch restraint prove insufficient, and the abuses I fear \nprove not only hypothetical but real, I will seek the opportunity to \nrevisit these provisions at the first opportunity.\n  Despite these weaknesses, Mr. President, I believe the Terrorism \nPrevention Act is an extremely important measure, and I am pleased to \nhave had a chance to participate in its enactment into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/29/senate-section/article/S4363-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4365-S4366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SALUTE TO CARL GARNER\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, on Friday, May 3d, Mr. Carl Garner \nof Tumbling Shoals, AR, will retire from Federal Service after 58 years \nas an employee of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He is one of the \nlongest consecutive serving Federal employees in the history of this \nNation, and today I want to take a brief moment to reflect on his \ncareer and service to our country.\n  Carl Garner began his career with the Army Corps of Engineers on June \n16, 1938, following his graduation from Arkansas College--now Lyon \nCollege. His early career placed him at Bull Shoals Lake in northern \nArkansas. On March 15, 1959, he was assigned to the new project at \nGreers Ferry Lake as a supervisor for Construction Management \nEngineering.\n  Greers Ferry Lake would become Carl Garner's life's work, and today \nyou cannot mention one without mentioning the other. On October 14, \n1962, Carl was named Resident Engineer for Greers Ferry Lake, and has \nheld that title for 34 years. On October 3, 1963, President John F. \nKennedy dedicated the last public works project of his life and short \nPresidency on a hillside overlooking the dam at Greers Ferry Lake. Carl \nGarner stood on the podium with the President on that occasion.\n  Carl Garner had a vision. He was an environmentalist long before the \nword became common in our vernacular. Carl's vision was that Greers \nFerry Lake should be pollution free and should reflect the natural \nbeauty and landscape of the region. Greers Ferry Lake should be a model \nfor the Nation, and today, it is the pearl in our Nation's inventory of \nmultiple purpose man-made lakes.\n  The vision that Carl Garner has preached for the last 30 years \ninvolves responsibility. Today, because of the tenacity and foresight \nof this one man, we have a public law, Public Law 99-402, which \nrequires all Federal agencies that manage land and water to conduct a \nFederal lands clean-up. Carl has taught us to be responsible with our \nenvironment through the Greers Ferry Lake clean-up, which occurs on the \nfirst Saturday following Labor Day each year. Over the years, literally \nhundreds of thousands of volunteers have learned how to be \nenvironmentally responsible because of Carl's legacy, and Greers Ferry \nLake is the result.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to say that Carl Garner is my friend. His \nimpact on my world is profound. Today I salute him and wish him the \nvery best in his future endeavors as he enjoys a well earned retirement \nfrom Federal service.\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to \nshare with the Senate the accomplishments of an outstanding researcher \nfrom Oregon Health Sciences University [OHSU], Dr. David A. McCarron. \nHis research was recently validated by a team of researchers from \nMcMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. The findings of the research \nwas published in the prestigious Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation, on April 10, 1996, accompanied by an editorial from Dr. \nMcCarron.\n  The research done at McMaster University has bolstered the findings \nof Dr. McCarron and his team of researchers in dealing with the \nrelationship between calcium deficiency in pregnant women, and the \namount of maternal and fetal morbidity. What the team found was that if \nthe amount of calcium taken by pregnant women is increased, the amount \nof maternal and fetal morbidity was significantly reduced. In fact, \nhigh blood pressure was reduced by 70 percent among women who consumed \nthe equivalent of four servings of dairy products a day, or 1,500 \nmilligrams of calcium.\n  What does this mean to all Americans? The 1992 direct health care \ncosts related to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy have been \nestimated at $18 to $22 billion. But more importantly, the savings \nwould be felt by millions of children who would have a healthier head \nstart in life. This is another fine example of the cost savings results \nof biomedical research.\n  Let me again point out for my colleagues that an important portion of \nthe funding for this program came from the legislative language in an \nappropriations bill. The fiscal year 1992 Agriculture appropriations \nbill led to a grant to OHSU, and Dr. McCarron, to continue their \nresearch effort in the field of assessing calcium impacts on pregnancy, \ninfant birth weight and a wide variety of other nutritional areas. The \nmoney bridged a gap for the program until further private funds could \nbe obtained. The importance of this grant and the continuation of this \nprogram is now being felt throughout the medical community.\n  This is the type of appropriations funding provision that has been \nthe subject of heavy criticism in recent years. However, it is this \ntype of modest investment, this type of gentle nudge to the \nadministration, that leads to huge strides in medical research and \nbetter health for Americans. The simple fact is, without the funding \nthat Dr. McCarron's research received, as a result of this provision, \nthe program would likely have ended. The continued funding and granting \nof money to these programs is not only important, it is imperative. \nBillions of dollars will be saved and lives will be improved as a \nresult of this work by Dr. McCarron.\n  Dr. McCarron is a soldier in the cause of medical research. He not \nonly fought for his program, but cleared a path for all medical \nresearch programs. His tireless devotion to the betterment of the \ncommunity around him has made him an ally to all medical research. His \nresearch will help hundreds of thousands of mothers and children for \ndecades to come.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record the JAMA piece written by Dr. \nMcCarron.\n  The material follows:\n\n      Dietary Calcium and Lower Blood Pressure--We Can All Benefit\n\n       Dietary calcium intake fails to meet recommended levels in \n     virtually all categories of Americans. The health \n     implications of this trend were recently addressed by a \n     National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference, which \n     noted that several other common medical conditions besides \n     osteoporosis are associated with low dietary calcium intake. \n     The articles by Bucher et al in this issue and the April 3 \n     issue of The Journal focus on one of these conditions: \n     increased arterial pressure. These meta-analyses of \n     randomized controlled trials of blood pressure and calcium \n     levels in 2412 adults and in 2459 pregnant women provide \n     compelling evidence that both normotensive and hypertensive \n     individuals may experience reductions in blood pressure when \n     calcium intake is increased.\n       Do these reports represent this week's favorite nutrient-\n     disease relationship, only to be cast aside when a subsequent \n     study fails to confirm these authors' conclusions? Several \n     factors argue against that possibility. Viewed in the context \n     of substantial prior observational and experimental evidence, \n     the biological plausibility that calcium exerts a favorable \n     effect on arterial pressure is strong. Furthermore, these \n     summary analysis provide insights concerning why nutrient-\n     disease relationships appear at times inconsistent. A \n     threshold of calcium intake\n\n[[Page S4366]]\n\n     below which arterial pressure increases has been documented \n     in experimental models and in epidemiological reports linking \n     low calcium intake to higher arterial pressures. The \n     threshold range overlaps with the median intake of calcium \n     for adults. As observed by Bucher et al, such a threshold \n     effect predicts that trials composed of participants with \n     varying baseline calcium intake may result in a heterogeneous \n     response, with a negligible or small benefit. The benefits \n     for those individuals whose calcium intake is below the \n     threshold may be masked by the null effect in those whose \n     baseline calcium intake is sufficient.\n       To better estimate the cardiovascular impact of achieving \n     the recommended levels of dietary calcium intake, researchers \n     should focus either on subjects who are below the threshold \n     or on those whose threshold has shifted upward because of \n     biological demands. Bucher et al did both. Numerous observers \n     have confirmed our index report that persons with \n     hypertension consume less calcium and thus are more likely to \n     be below the threshold. As that evidence would predict, \n     Bucher and colleagues identified a larger benefit of \n     increasing calcium intake in hypertensive than in \n     normotensive subjects.\n       Calcium requirements vary across the life span. When \n     calcium needs are increased, the relationship between calcium \n     intake and biological responses may be amplified. By \n     analyzing separately the randomized controlled trials in \n     pregnant women, Bucher et al tested this relationship. \n     Gestation is a transient period of increased risk of elevated \n     arterial pressure. It is also a period in which the metabolic \n     demand for calcium increases dramatically. In this otherwise \n     healthy, young, normotensive population, Bucher et al \n     established an unequivocal benefit of increasing calcium \n     intake for both mean arterial pressure and the incidence of \n     pregnancy-induced hypertension, which was reduced by 70%. \n     Preeclampsia was reduced by more than 60%\n       The observation of Bucher et al that cardiovascular \n     benefits of sufficient calcium intake increased with the \n     quality of the study strongly supports the validity of these \n     findings. The fact that pregnant women 20 years of age or \n     younger benefited more than older pregnant women is another \n     example of increased biological needs for calcium amplifying \n     the relationship between calcium level and blood pressure. \n     Younger pregnant women must provide calcium for the fetus as \n     well as their own continued skeletal growth, thus multiplying \n     their daily requirement. While the current calcium intake \n     recommendation for pregnant women and adolescent females is \n     1200 to 1500 mg/d, their reported median intake is 600 to 700 \n     mg/d. As the analysis of Bucher et al revealed, the \n     cardiovascular benefits of consuming sufficient calcium are \n     greater in those whose intake is least adequate for \n     biological demands. As noted by these authors, what remains \n     to be confirmed are the trends for reduced maternal and fetal \n     morbidity. Similarly, the impact of adequate calcium \n     intake on infant and childhood blood pressure must be \n     defined, because calcium needs are increased at this time. \n     The anticipated release of data from the National \n     Institutes of Health trail of Calcium for Preeclampsia \n     Prevention (CPEP) should address these issues.\n       For pregnant women the goal is clear, calcium intake must \n     meet metabolic needs. Current intakes in women of \n     childbearing age are not sufficient to assure optimal \n     gestational blood pressure regulation. Younger women can no \n     longer assume that the consequences of inadequate calcium \n     intake will emerge only decades later as osteoporosis. They \n     may occur within 9 months as serious complications for both \n     mother and child. Optimizing calcium intake will benefit not \n     only pregnant women but also society in general. The 1992 \n     direct health care costs related to hypertensive disorders of \n     pregnancy and their sequelue have been estimated at $18 \n     billion to $22 billion. Using the most conservative estimates \n     of Bucher et al, the savings from increasing calcium intake \n     during pregnancy might reach several billion dollars within 1 \n     year.\n       In virtually all age, sex, and ethnic categories of the US \n     population, median calcium intake is equal to or less than \n     the minimum recommendation, leaving more than 50% of \n     individuals consuming inadequate amounts of calcium. For \n     those groups at higher risk of hypertension (African \n     Americans, pregnant women, the obese, and the elderly), the \n     situation is worse. Furthermore, consuming adequate calcium \n     is no longer simply a ``women, issue.'' After age 40 years, \n     American men have a median calcium intake of less than 750 \n     mg/d. For African-American men, whose risk of hypertension is \n     two to three time that of their white counterparts, the \n     median calcium intake is than than 600 mg/d. There are \n     therefore many reasons, including control of arterial \n     pressure, why every individual should be advised to consume \n     the current recommended level of calcium as a general health \n     measure.\n     David A.

Mr. President, late last week we finally \napproved a budget for the fiscal year which started 7 months ago. After \nlong and heated negotiations, Presidential vetoes, and numerous \nshutdowns of the Federal Government, that budget protected many of the \npriorities that had been identified by the President and by Democrats \nhere in Congress, including key investments in education, crime \nprevention, the environment, and other key areas. It also effectively \nremoved many of the policy-related riders that would have done so much \ndamage to our efforts to protect Americans in the workplace, and to \nprotect the environment; major victories for all Americans.\n  The bulk of the funding for key education and job training programs, \nwhich I had fought hard to restore through an amendment on the Senate \nfloor, was retained by the conferees. Key Federal investments in the \nskills, character, and intellect of our children must remain our \nhighest priority.\n  The conferees also preserved funding for the new community policing \nprogram called COPS, which has provided funding for over 430 new police \nin Minnesota, and over 34,000 nationwide. Ultimately, it is scheduled \nto put 100,000 new police on the streets of our Nation's cities and \ntowns. Chiefs of Police and sheriffs from across the country, from big \ncities, small towns, rural areas and suburbs, have supported this \nprogram because they know that more police make a real difference in \ncombatting crime. This is a victory for communities nationwide who are \nstruggling to bring down crime and combat fear in their streets by \nstrengthening their community policing programs.\n  In addition to these major victories, the measure gained overwhelming \napproval here in the Senate because many Senators, including myself, \nbelieved that we must not allow to continue to go unfunded key Federal \nagencies and departments which protect the environment, provide funding \nfor schools, protect the health and safety of Americans in their \nworkplaces, provide funding for critical Federal health benefits, or \nsupport a host of other Federal activities.\n  While on balance I believe the bill goes a long way toward protecting \nkey priorities, there are some areas where very large budget cuts will \nstill be made by this bill. For example, I am very concerned that the \nHouse conferees insisted on slashing advance funding for the Low Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program, which is critical to thousands of \nMinnesotans who rely on it for heating aid in very cold weather.\n  Despite the battles over LIHEAP funding this past winter, and my \namendment urging the Senate conferees not to accede to House demands to \nscuttle advance funding for this program, passed by a vote of 77 to 23, \nSenate conferees agreed to drop advance funding for next winter. This \nis a major and unwise policy change, and makes it doubly important that \nadequate funding for the entire heating season be provided in the \nfiscal year 1997 Labor-HHS appropriations bill that will be developed \nsoon by the Appropriations Committee; I will fight to fully restore \nthese funds during that process.\n  There are also substantial cuts in programs for the arts, for legal \nservice programs which ensure that the constitutionally guaranteed \nrights of even low-income people are secured within our legal process, \nfor Federal Indian education efforts, for job training, for homeless \nprograms, and for a host of other key public investments in our future. \nWhile I recognize the need to continue to reduce the deficit, I opposed \nthese cuts, and will be working to restore critical funding in these \nareas in the coming months.\n  Mr. President, I did not agree with all of the priorities contained \nin the omnibus appropriations bill. It is not the bill I would have \nwritten. My colleagues know I would restructure Federal spending in \nvery different ways, even while securing the same level of savings. But \nthis final agreement allowed us finally to move beyond last year's \nfunding fights, and to turn our attention to this year's appropriations \nprocess. That is why I supported it, despite its flaws. I hope we can \ndo better this year; Americans deserve a more orderly and responsible \nprocess, with very different priorities, than Congress delivered this \nyear.\n\n[[Page S4367]]\n\n\n\n CONGRATULATIONS TO UNIVERSITY OF UTAH MEN'S AND WOMEN'S SKI TEAM NCAA \n                                 CHAMPS\n\n Mr. BENNETT.

These zoos and aquariums use the most \nadvanced technology and some of the most dedicated of our Nation's \nscientists to ensure the survival of species worldwide. Research is the \nfirst step in conservation, and during April, which is Zoo and Aquarium \nMonth, I would like to recognize the many steps toward conservation \ntaken by AZA institutions.\n  Zoos and aquariums were among the first institutions to recognize the \nthreat of species extinction around the world and to make research \ngeared to alleviating this problem one of their top priorities. Their \never-increasing expertise has since served as a valuable resource to \nconservation efforts throughout the world. I am proud to commend the \nstaff of Metro Washington Park Zoo for their significant contributions \nto the conservation and breeding of Asian elephants. The research \nperformed by Metro Washington Park Zoo and its AZA counterparts help \nensures that our grandchildren will enjoy the same animals that we all \nenjoy today. The research enables us to better understand our world \nand, ultimately, ourselves.\n  Our Nation has long acknowledged the value of our local zoos and \naquariums. They educate as well as entertain, and have long served as \nplaygrounds for our children's imagination. I would like to ask my \ncolleagues to join me in recognizing April as Zoo and Aquarium Month, \nand I encourage my colleagues and all Americans to visit their local \nzoo or aquarium with their family and friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/29/senate-section/article/S4367-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        MEASURE PLACED ON CALENDAR--SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 53.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON.
