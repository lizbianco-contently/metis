Under the previous order, the Senate will \nnow resume consideration of Senate Concurrent Resolution 13, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 13) setting forth the \n     congressional budget for the United States Government for the \n     fiscal years 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the concurrent resolution.\n\n       Pending:\n       Hutchison (for Domenici) amendment No. 1111, in the nature \n     of a substitute.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I watched, as I am sure many people in \nAmerica did, last night and all day yesterday, I guess starting at \nnoon, the two sides debating probably the most important vote we will \ntake maybe in our lifetime.\n  The balanced budget amendment, I felt, was the most important vote \nbecause that would set a framework for us, for the future generations \nto make sure that in our framework of Government we would not allow one \ngeneration to put in debt future generations. So while I reserve that \nvote as the most important vote, nevertheless, what we are doing today \nis implementing the balanced budget amendment that did not pass.\n  We are taking up for consideration a budget resolution that will \nbalance by the year 2002.\n  I was watching C-SPAN this morning and I saw a recap, I guess, of the \ndebate on the House floor yesterday. They were talking about Democrats \nholding up pictures of the elderly and Republicans holding up pictures \nof children saying, basically, that is where the arguments are--that \nthe Democrats are going for the senior citizens and the Republicans are \ntalking about protecting children.\n  I think that they are saying to the senior citizens, ``We do not \nthink you will be responsible.'' I think that is what the Democrats \nwere saying on the House side. ``We do not think you will \n[[Page S6950]] be responsible with our money. We want you to vote for \nmaking sure that we continue all of these programs, business as \nusual,'' and I do not think the seniors of America are saying that at \nall.\n  In fact, one of the callers on the show called in from Florida, and \nthe woman said, ``I am a senior and I want my grandchildren to have a \nbalanced budget. I want them to have the same kind of America that I \nhave had. I do not want to be a senior that plunges our country into \ndebt and will not take the responsible position.''\n  I think if there is an effort to pander to seniors, the people of \nthis country are smarter than that, and especially the seniors are \nsmarter than that. They are looking for the future of this country. \nThey want to cut this growth in spending so that we will have a future \nfor their children.\n  We have been talking about cuts, cuts, cuts. I must remind everyone \nin this debate we are not talking about cutting. We are talking about \nless increases, fewer increases. We are talking about a 7-percent \nincrease in Medicare, which we believe is a responsible rate of growth \nfor Medicare.\n  In fact, it will save the system for future generations. That is in \nquestion if we do not take the steps now to give innovative \nalternatives to the Medicare system we have now so that we will be able \nto say by the year 2002 the Medicare trustees were wrong. It is not \ngoing broke. They were wrong because we did what we needed to do with \ntheir warning and we saved the system.\n  I hope in the year 2002 that I will be here along with many Members \nwho will take the responsible position for our country to celebrate \nthat our Medicare and Social Security systems are intact for our \nseniors because we have done the responsible thing. More importantly \neven than that, that we have a balanced budget to give to our children \nand grandchildren, which is what I think the seniors are expecting \nMembers to do.\n  Mr. President, we are going to see debate all day today in the \nSenate. We are going to see it on Monday and Tuesday. We will have this \nmonumental vote probably sometime Wednesday. I want to commend the \nHouse of Representatives for taking this step first. I want to say that \nI hope that my colleagues will follow so we can make history for this \ncountry and move toward this very important balanced budget.\n  I yield the floor at this time to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The distinguished Senator, the \nPresident pro tempore, the Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I want to commend the able Senator from \nTexas for the excellent remarks she just made.\n  We have the greatest nation in the world. It provides Americans more \nfreedom, more justice, more opportunity, and more hope than any nation \nhas provided any people in the history of the world.\n  This great country of ours can be in jeopardy unless we do at least \ntwo things. We must provide an adequate defense to protect this \ncountry. That is essential. We must protect ourselves against the \nenemies who will destroy democracy and freedom in this world.\n  The next is, we must have a sound financial system. We have not \nbalanced this budget but one time in 32 years. Eight times in 64 years. \nThat can bring destruction. We are not being fair to our children, our \ngrandchildren, and future generations. We must take steps to balance \nthis budget.\n  I hope that we pass a budget this year, pass it now, that will take \nsteps to bring sanity to this country's finances.\n  I love this country. I want to do everything I can to preserve it. We \ncan preserve it if we stop this big spending. We have been spending \nmore than we have been taking in for all these years. We have to stop \nit and stop it now.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to say I yield to no one in my \nadmiration for the senior Senator from South Carolina.\n  I just want to say he is an example of just what I was talking about. \nIf he would not mind my calling him a senior Senator or senior citizen, \nhe is the kind of senior citizen, as a Senator, who is leading the \neffort toward doing the responsible thing.\n  This is a distinguished veteran of World War II who understands the \nimportance of a strong national defense. I am going to join with him \nlater today or next week to try to strengthen the defense part of this \nbudget resolution.\n  All Members are going to make our arguments. We are going to say what \nour priorities are. I know that the Senator from South Carolina who \nchairs the Armed Services Committee, and I believe we should have a \nstronger national defense element in this budget. In the end, we are \ngoing to vote for a budget resolution that balances the budget of this \ncountry.\n  After everyone has spoken and everyone's priorities have been looked \nat and considered, we are going to go with the majority of this Senate. \nI appreciate the leadership of the Senator from South Carolina, and I \nappreciate his words today, leading the charge for the responsible \neffort that so many of the senior citizens of this country are \nexpecting.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I wish to thank the able Senator from Texas for her \nkind remarks.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Now I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Texas for \nyielding, and appreciate the fine job she is doing as to present an \nargument as to why this balanced budget resolution is so important to \nthe future in this country.\n  We will hear a lot of demagoguery about how terrible everything is, \nand what the Senator from Texas is doing is focusing on positive \neffects of getting to a balanced budget.\n  Today we have the opportunity to debate this. This is the President's \nbudget that he sent up here earlier this year. It is for fiscal year \n1996, and it calls for in his budget, as we see by this chart, the red \nline calls for budget deficits of around $200 billion a year. That is \nwhat his budget numbers call for, using the Office of Management and \nBudget.\n  As we know from the President's State of the Union speech, it might \nhave been even his first State of the Union speech, he says we should \nnot use Office of Management and Budget numbers. Those are not the \nright numbers to use. We should use the Congressional Budget Office, \nthey are the better estimator, they have been shown to be more correct \nover time. They would be the ones that we should use in all budget \ndebates.\n  Given that fact, the purple line is the actual CBO estimate of what \nthe Clinton budget, this budget right here, this budget will project \nout. Budget deficits starting around $170 billion this year, going up \nto almost $275 billion by the year 2000.\n And then up even further, up to over about $300 billion by the year \n2002.\n\n  He is going to add, with this budget--if we approve this budget \ntoday, we will add $1.2 trillion to the debt, to the national debt. \nThat is the solution offered by the White House. Further deficits, \nincreasing deficits, further mortgaging of our country's future, \nfurther mortgaging of our children's future. That is the leadership.\n  The President of the United States is seen by the world as having the \nmoral authority to lead the world. We are, in fact, the greatest \ncountry in the world. We are a country that is a leader among nations, \nand our President stands as the head of that country as the supreme \nleader in the world today--leader--leadership. Is this leadership? I \nsuggest it is not.\n  So, as I said yesterday when I came to the floor, I am going to come \nto the floor every day, and I am going to ask the President why he is \nrefusing to lead, why he is refusing to take part in possibly the most \nhistoric debate that we have seen in the last couple of decades here on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate, why he is abdicating his responsibility \nas the leader of the free world, putting the country that is most \nimportant to freedom for the world at risk by profligate spending, \ncontinued profligate spending. I think it is an act that is beneath the \noffice, to stand on the sideline and throw barbs at those of us who are \ntrying to accomplish the goal that, if I recall, when he ran for \nPresident he was going to do his best to accomplish, to balance this \nbudget.\n  He said it in 1993 when he was putting forward his plan to raise \ntaxes to help solve the deficit. ``No hot air; show me \n[[Page S6951]] where,'' is what he said when it came to the \nRepublicans' plan for balancing or reducing the budget. He did not want \nany smoke and mirrors, he wanted a plan.\n  This is not a plan that gets you to a balanced budget. Mr. President, \nyou have an obligation--you have an obligation to lead this country and \nto show us where. So, I will put up, now, unfortunately, day 2 of the \ndays with no proposal to balance the budget from President Clinton. I \nwill be here every day that we are in session, adding number after \nnumber after number, until we reach 135 days, which is October 1 of \nthis year when the new fiscal year starts and it is then basically too \nlate to do anything about it.\n  Mr. President, we beseech you: Participate. Take the job seriously. \nGet involved in the process. Try to make a difference. Show the \nAmerican people you really do care about what happens to the future of \nthis country.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Pennsylvania \nwill yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask the Senator from Pennsylvania, how much does the \nPresident's budget show in annual deficits every year?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If we go back to the previous chart, the purple line is \nthe line that the Congressional Budget Office has estimated will be the \nannual deficit under this budget, the Clinton budget. It starts out at \nabout--using rough numbers because I do not have them exactly--about \n$175 billion for this fiscal year, the one we are in right now, \nincreasing to over $200 billion in 1996, about $230 billion in 1997, \nabout the same amount in 1998, and then up around $290 billion for 1999 \nand 2000.\n  Mr. KYL. So over the 5 years of the President's budget, we are \nlooking at an average of over $200 billion a year.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. And going up.\n  Mr. KYL. And going up.\n  I further ask the Senator from Pennsylvania, according to my \ncalculations, for every year that we have a $200 billion deficit, the \naverage young person in this country is going to have to pay an \nadditional $5,000 in taxes, with the result that after 5 years of Bill \nClinton's budgets that is a $25,000 tax bill for the average young \nperson in this country?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The reason for that is that is more debt we accumulate, \nmore interest we have to pay on the debt; interest that will be paid by \nchildren being born today for the rest of their lives. So that is where \nwe come up with this number, that is not a phony baloney number. This \nis actually numbers we add to the debt that we will have to borrow \nmoney for and children in the future will have to pay interest on for \nthe rest of their lives, if we continue this.\n  Mr. KYL. Let me ask the Senator from Pennsylvania a couple of other \nquestions here. It is my understanding we are going to have the \nopportunity to vote on the President's budget later on today. I am sure \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania and I will not be voting for this budget. \nDuring the debate on the balanced budget amendment I seem to recall a \nlot of our colleagues from the other side of the aisle, our Democratic \nfriends, asking us how we were going to get to a balanced budget. They \nargued they did not need to support a balanced budget constitutional \namendment because they could do it on their own. They did not need a \nconstitutional amendment. So our constitutional amendment failed by one \nvote.\n  I do not recall--perhaps the Senator from Pennsylvania could help me \nhere--I do not recall any budget having been submitted by a Senator on \nthe Democratic side of the aisle, a budget that will bring us in \nbalance by the year 2002 or any other year--am I mistaken? Have I \nmissed something here?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. No. I think the Senator is right. I have not seen any \nbudget being put forward either by the President, obviously, or by any \nMember of the other side of the aisle that gets us anywhere near zero \nwithin the 7-year timeframe or, frankly, any time thereafter. I am \nactually pretty excited about this possibility, because having sat \nthrough the balanced budget debate and listened to the numbers of \nSenators getting up and saying, ``Look, we do not need the balanced \nbudget amendment. We can do this on our own. We have the courage within \nus to make these decisions. We will stand up when the time comes to be \ncounted,'' so I am guessing, but I suspect we will get all 54 \nRepublican votes on this side for this budget, I am hopeful that we do \nthat. If you add the 30, what, about 35 or so Democrats who voted \nagainst the balanced budget, who, of course, have the courage now to \nstand up and say we are going to be for a balanced budget, I think we \nwill get 90 votes for this. I think we can get close to about 90 votes \nfor this. We should.\n  If everyone who is serious--if you are serious over there, if you \nreally want a balanced budget, if you really think you can make those \ntough choices, if you really are willing to stand up to the American \npublic and say we are willing, we can do it ourselves, we do not need \nany balanced budget amendment to force us to make tough decisions, we \nhave the power within us to do that--then here it is. Let us do it.\n  Mr. KYL. May I ask the Senator from Pennsylvania a couple more \nquestions here?\n  So, the bottom line here is you have not seen a budget proposed on \nthe Democratic side, and I have not seen a budget proposed on the \nDemocratic side. The only budget is the one proposed by the President. \nI guess we will have a chance to see whether our Democratic friends \nwill support the President's budget, because they have no other \nalternative.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I cannot imagine they would because they said during \nthe balanced budget amendment debate that they have the courage to \nsupport a balanced budget and since the folks on the other side are so \nserious about getting to a balanced budget and see this as such an \nimportant thing, I cannot imagine then they would support this.\n  Mr. KYL. Has the Senator seen any constructive suggestions from the \nother side about how we might achieve a balanced budget by the year \n2002?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I imagine there will be several amendments. Of course, \nall of them will be deficit neutral. I am sure they will not offer any \namendments to raise the deficit or get us off the glidepath here to \nzero. I am sure they are not going to be interested, since they have \nthe courage over there to make sure we get to this balanced budget, \nthey are not going to offer any amendment that is going to increase the \ndeficit or throw us off this path. So I am sure they will have \nconstructive suggestions about how we might tinker with this, and I \nlook forward to debating those. But I do not think they are going to \nhave any substitute proposal that is going to get them to a balanced \nbudget on a completely different tack.\n  Mr. KYL. Of course, that is what I had reference to. If I could just \nask the Senator from Pennsylvania one final question? I have listened \nto the debate over the last 10 or 12 hours here. Much of the debate has \nfocused----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. You are a brave man.\n  Mr. KYL. Pardon?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I said you are a brave man.\n  Mr. KYL. I listened to part of it, anyway, although it gets a little \nrepetitious. The argument I have heard discussed most from the \nDemocratic side of the aisle is about how they would like to spend the \ndividend that is created by the fact that we balance the budget.\n  In other words, the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nDomenici, has done a very good job of putting this thing together in \nsuch a way that after 7 years, because interest costs will be reduced, \nwe will actually have in effect a dividend of about $170 billion. While \nI have not heard any suggestion from the Democratic side about how they \nwould balance the budget, and they have certainly not indicated that \nthey would support the way that we will achieve that balance by the \nyear 2002, I have heard a lot of discussion about how they would like \nto spend the money that we save.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, it is amazing--if the Senator will \nyield--I remember we were in the House together and we had the peace \ndividend. Remember the peace dividend? That was the time the Soviet \nUnion was crumbling and we could cut our defense budget a little bit, \nand it turned out to be a lot. Therefore, we would save money. So we \nhad a peace dividend. So what did we do? We were running, by the way, \nover $200 billion in annual deficits. But we had a dividend. \n[[Page S6952]] \n  So what were we going to do? Spend it somewhere else. We were not \ngoing to put this toward the debt; oh, no. This was a peace dividend \nthat was earned by the American public, and so we have a right, here in \nthe Congress, to spend it.\n  Here we are again. We get a dividend, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office, by balancing the budget, and it will come down to zero \nby the year 2002. The Congressional Budget Office says they will change \ntheir economic assumptions to assume lower interest rates, lower \ninflation, and greater growth in the economy, which will mean less of a \ndebt. So there will be a dividend.\n  So what do we hear? Are we hearing, ``Well, we should put that toward \nthe deficit,'' or ``We should give people who worked hard for this \nmoney some of that money back''; in other words, let them keep the \nmoney they worked for? No, no, no. On the other side of the aisle, you \nwill hear suggestion after suggestion after suggestion how we should \nspend this money because it is our dividend. It is not yours, American \npublic; it is our dividend. We did this. So we should take your money \nand spend it on things that we think are best.\n  This is kind of ridiculous, having this kind of talk about let us get \nserious. Let us get serious. This is not our money; this is your money. \nTo suggest that we could finally do something that we were hired to do, \nwhich is to get our house in order; that if we do our job, somehow we \nshould get the dividend, to go out and take more of your money and \nspend it somewhere else? It is absolutely absurd.\n  Mr. KYL. If I may conclude with this comment to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, I think he certainly helped me to understand this issue \nbetter than I did.\n  I guess I would summarize it this way: During the debate on the \nbalanced budget amendment, we said we think we need a constitutional \namendment because, otherwise, too many people in the Congress will not \nhave the discipline to make the tough choices to bring the budget into \nbalance. Most of our Democratic friends, many of them, said, ``No; we \ncan do this on our own.''\n  Then the Senator from Pennsylvania said the only alternative to the \nbudget that we have prepared, that brings us into balance, is a budget \nthat the President proposed, that does not bring us into balance. \nAccording to the Senator from Pennsylvania, as a matter of fact, it \naverages deficits of over $200 billion a year as far as this President \nhas calculated it, and the trend is up over $200 billion a year. That \nis about a $5,000 tax every year on each American.\n  I learned from the Senator from Pennsylvania that, in addition to the \nfact that the Democratic side of the aisle here has proposed no \nalternative that will achieve a balance by the year 2002, the bulk of \nthe discussion so far has been how to spend the dividend that is \ncreated by our budget.\n  So not only are they not willing to support our budget, but at the \nsame time they are criticizing our budget, they want to take the money \nthat we save by our budget and spend that rather than returning it to \nthe American people.\n  Do I have this straight? Is that about the size of it?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire is here, \nand he is on the Budget Committee. My understanding was during the \nbudget debates in committee that the Democratic Members had, most of \nthe debate on the committee was how to spend this $170 billion, whether \nwe should do tax cuts or whether we should go out and spend a lot more \nmoney on a lot more programs.\n  I do not know if the Senator wanted to comment on that. It is my \nunderstanding that they were just anxious to get at this pot of money \nso they could create some more spending here at the Federal level.\n  I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if the Senator from Pennsylvania will \nyield, he has put it absolutely correctly. Of those worthy amendments, \nthe vast majority of amendments--I have forgotten the number, 17 \namendments--offered by the members of the Democratic Party on the \nBudget Committee, and everyone wanted to spend the dividend, which \nresults from the lower interest rates as a result of getting to a \nbalanced budget.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I want to make it absolutely clear. Of all of the \namendments in the Budget Committee offered by the other side----\n  Mr. GREGG. ``All'' may be too many, but the vast majority.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The vast majority of the amendments offered by the \nDemocrats in the Budget Committee were not how to get to a balanced \nbudget--were not.\n  Mr. GREGG. There were not any amendments offered as to how to get to \na balanced budget.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. There was no substitute offered as to how they would \nget to a balanced budget. There were no amendments offered on how they \nwould change spending priorities. But the amendments were focused on \nwhat? The $170 billion dividend that the CBO gives us by getting to a \nbalanced budget, which assumes lower interest rates and more growth, \nhow could they spend that money?\n  How can you take seriously people coming to the floor during the \nbalanced budget debate, saying that they have the courage to balance \nthe budget; they are willing to make the tough cuts, and when the bill \nactually comes to the floor to do that, all they do is focus in on how \nthey are going to spend more money? It is almost incredulous to me.\n  You are going to hear speaker after speaker on the other side of the \naisle talk about how terrible this is, and all their amendments will be \non how to spend more money and how we have to get to balance. This just \nis not the right way. They do not have a way, but this is not the right \none.\n  All I suggest to the Senators in this Chamber--and you want to \nlisten--is look at the big picture. Let us look at our responsibility \nto the future of this country, to the children of this country, to \nleave this country better off than it was left to us. We have a moral \nobligation to do just that, to balance this budget for future \ngenerations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized, if \nhe will suspend for a question of the Senator.\n  Mr. GREGG. I just arrived on the floor. I understood there was an \nagreement that at 9:15, we would go to the statement on your side by \nSenator Dodd.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator repeat the question?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it was my understanding that by 9:15, we \nwould go to a statement by Senator Dodd on your side.\n  Mr. EXON. Is the manager of the bill on the Republican side trying to \ninterfere with the lineup that we agreed to offer on this side?\n  Mr. GREGG. No.\n  Mr. EXON. There was no agreement, to my understanding. I ask the \nChair, was there an agreement as to who was to speak at what time? Last \nnight as we left, I understood that we jointly yielded to allow your \nside to have the first half hour of debate. Chairman Domenici just came \n2 minutes ago, 20 seconds ago, and stood right here and said it is our \nturn now. I would give that advice to the manager of the bill on the \nRepublican side. Maybe I am wrong. But I ask the Chair if I am mistaken \nand misunderstood the binding agreement that had been previously \nentered into.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The agreement previously entered into reserved \ntime for the Senator from Nebraska from 10:15 until 10:30, and reserved \ntime from 10:30 until 10:45 for the managers on the Republican side.\n  Mr. GREGG. I simply say we were looking forward with great enthusiasm \nto hearing the Senator from Wisconsin and also the Senator from \nConnecticut, and whatever order the leader of the Democratic side, the \nmanager of the bill on the Democrat Party side, wishes to go forward \nwith, that is fine with this side. We were just trying to get \nclarification of what was happening as to the priorities as we \nunderstood the gentlemen's agreement. [[Page S6953]] \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has yielded time to \nthe Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. President, as we debate the fiscal year 1996 budget, I would like \nto discuss some of the principles I hope this year's budget embodies. I \nbelieve these are bipartisan principles that the majority of Americans \nand majority of Senators can support.\n  I would like to talk today about a budget that is balanced, both \nfinancially balanced and balanced in the sacrifices it asks Americans \nto make. There is no question about our need to get to a balanced \nbudget--and to get to a balanced budget in 7 years--but we must get \nthere in a manner that does not do damage to our economy or to the \nbasic principles of our democracy.\n  We must balance the budget, but we must do it in a way that is fair \nand is perceived to be fair by all Americans. That is my central \ncriticism of the plan before us. It asks that the budget be balanced \nentirely by sacrifices from elderly Americans, middle-class and lower \nincome Americans, and students, and it asks nothing from the wealthiest \namong us.\n  I support a balanced budget. I voted for the balanced budget \namendment that was defeated earlier this year. And I support a balanced \nbudget by the year 2002. I am pleased that we are starting this debate \nwith the Budget Committee plan that gets to balance in 2002, and I hope \nthat we end up with a budget that does, indeed, get to balance by 2002.\n  We all know why it is essential to get to the balanced budget. Simply \nput, our economic survival depends on it. Our almost $5 trillion in \nGovernment debt is money taken directly away from private sector \ninvestment. The interest payments that are now our third largest \nspending program are dollars which are totally wasted. They are dollars \nwe cannot spend educating our children, paving our roads, or providing \ntax relief to middle-income American families. And, just as bad, our \nmounting Federal debt pulls up interest rates and threatens our \nstanding as a world economic power. With each year of deficits adding \nto that debt, we are rolling the dice: Will this be the year that the \nworld turns its back on a country that cannot stop spending more than \nit takes in?\n  So there is no question that our current fiscal irresponsibility is \nnot sustainable. There is no question that we have to balance the \nbudget if we want to reassert control over our economy and our destiny. \nThe only question is how are we going to achieve this balance.\n  Balancing the budget is a huge undertaking. It requires immediate \nreductions in Government services and real sacrifices from the American \npeople. I believe the American people will respond to this challenge \nbut only if the challenge is considered to be fair. We need to balance \nthe budget in a way that brings our Nation together in pursuit of the \ncommon good and not in a way that would drive us apart in pursuit of \npartisan political gain or just monetary gain for a few interests.\n  Achieving solvency is vital to our Nation's strength, but solvency \nalone will not make us strong. After all, a family is not strong only \nbecause its checkbook balances. A family is strong because it has \nstrong values. Our country is the same. We need to balance our books. \nBut if we do so in a way that pushes us apart, then we will find we \nhave bought fiscal balance at the cost of values that make our \ndemocracy strong, values like equality of opportunity and fairness and \ncompassion.\n  As most of us know or should know, there exists a very disturbing \ntrend toward increasing inequality in our country today. The wealthiest \namong us are getting wealthier and everybody else is losing ground. \nBetween 1973 and 1993, the wealthiest 20 percent of American families \nsaw their incomes increased 25 percent while the poorest 20 percent saw \ntheir incomes decline by 15 percent, all in real terms. And families in \nthe middle of the income distribution in this country saw very little, \nif any, increase in their average income over the same period. Today, 1 \npercent of the households in our country control about 40 percent of \nthe Nation's wealth. Households that have net worth above $180,000--the \nmost well off 20 percent of American families--control a full 80 \npercent of America's wealth. And this trend is increasing. This \nconcentration of wealth is more by far than is found in any other \nindustrialized country.\n  Mr. President, our divisions are not just among income classes. They \nare among generations as well. Our poverty rate is 25 percent for \nchildren under 6 years old and only half of that for our senior \ncitizens.\n  These growing inequalities have produced a vicious and unproductive \ncycle because poor children are poor students and poor students are \npoor workers. Poor workers are poor wage earners and poor producers, \nand no one wins in this sort of an economy. The inequality fuels the \nenemies of democracy, things like resentment and fear, anger, and \nmisunderstanding.\n  In balancing the budget, we must not exacerbate these inequalities. \nWe must balance our books but not by knocking off balance the ladder of \nopportunity that should allow every American working family to work \ntoward a better life and a better standard of living.\n  In my judgment, unfortunately, the Republican budget proposal moves \nus in the opposite direction. Instead of helping lower income children \nout of the cycle of poverty by investing in education and child \nnutrition, this budget slashes Medicaid for children, takes $14 billion \nout of student aid, and cuts $34 billion out of nutrition programs. \nInstead of proposing ways to help working families stretch their \nprecious dollars, the budget proposal before us reduces the earned-\nincome tax credit by $21 billion. That is, it raises taxes on our \nlowest income taxpayers. And instead of offering constructive \nsuggestions on reducing the huge medical costs that overwhelm our \nsenior citizens, the budget before us includes one-quarter of $1 \ntrillion in unspecified Medicare costs.\n  The policy of the Republican budget for upper income taxpayers is \nexactly the opposite of this. It asks nothing from upper income \nAmericans and wealthy corporations in our effort to balance the budget. \nIt allows tax expenditures which are special tax subsidies that give \nbenefit mostly to wealthy Americans and corporations to grow by almost \n49 percent over the next 7 years, faster than any other category of \nspending.\n  In short, this budget gets to balance without any help from the 2 \npercent of our wealthiest Americans who control the bulk of our \ncountry's wealth and without help from the biggest corporations that \nstand to gain the most from a reinvigorated economy.\n  Mr. President, in my judgment, this is not a fair plan. Working \nmiddle-income families will not and should not tolerate unremitting \nreductions in their standard of living to finance special-interest tax \nbreaks. If we are to come together as a country to solve our deficit \nproblem and if we are to come together as a bipartisan Congress to \nbalance the budget, we have to support a plan that asks something from \neveryone.\n  I am ready to support such a plan. I am ready to work with the \nRepublican majority, Democrats, and anyone else who wants to balance \nthe budget in a fair and a balanced manner. It may not happen this \nweek, but soon when we are all done scoring political points, Mr. \nPresident, I believe we will sit down together and draft a budget that \ncontains the best and the fairest proposals from both parties. That \nwill be a budget that balances fiscally. It will also be a budget that \nis balanced in the sacrifices it asks from all Americans and in the \nopportunities that it provides for all Americans.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I have been listening with keen interest to \nmy good friend and associate from the State of Wisconsin. We have \nworked together on many things, and I thank him very much for his kind \nand thoughtful remarks. Suffice it to say I join with him again and \nappreciate his appeal for some bipartisanship on this matter. We will \ncontinue to pursue those goals.\n  Has the Senator from Wisconsin finished his remarks or did he wish \nadditional time?\n[[Page S6954]]\n\n  Mr. KOHL. I did finish.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, Senator Dodd is on his way to the Chamber \nfloor. I am prepared to make some remarks. Is there someone on that \nside of the aisle who wishes to speak at this time?\n  I see the Senator from Colorado has just come in. We would be very \npleased to yield on the basis that we generally have, going back and \nforth on these matters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the Senator from Colorado 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Chair.\n  Many Americans, as they listen to this debate, will think this is \njust another discussion in Congress about a budget with a lot of \ndetails.\n  Mr. President, it is not that. This is a discussion of the future of \nthe Nation. This is a discussion of whether we follow the Clinton plan. \nMr. President, the Congressional Budget Office, which the President has \nsaid is the right one to decide these things, has evaluated the Clinton \nplan. The Clinton plan increases the deficit from under $200 billion to \nin the neighborhood of $300 billion by the end of the 5-year plan and \nabove $300 billion by the end of the 7-year plan if projections go on.\n  It is a debate between having a deficit at the end of 7 years of over \n$300 billion, according to President Clinton, or a balanced budget \naccording to the Republican plan. Mr. President, it is quite simply a \nquestion of whether or not we bankrupt this Nation or whether or not we \nput it back on sound footing.\n  Members have come to the floor and talked about children. Mr. \nPresident, that is a fair evaluation. We ought to ask about the impact \nof these budgets on children. I hope every person, Democrat, \nRepublican, or Independent, liberal or conservative, will ask \nthemselves what are the consequences of bankrupting our Nation. That is \nwhat this question is all about.\n  And please do not kid yourself. There is no alternative to the \nRepublican balanced budget plan. There is none, except President \nClinton's bankruptcy plan. Now that is the difference that is being \nquestioned here.\n  Hopefully, moderate Democrats will come together with a plan that \nalso balances the budget. I personally would welcome it. I would be \nhappy to look at their alternatives. But that has not been presented. \nNot once, not once in all the amendments that came up in the Budget \nCommittee was that offered.\n  Mr. President, does it make a difference with regard to whether or \nnot we adopt the Republican plan?\n  Let me point out in a world economy how the world reacted when they \nsaw Republicans were willing to turn this Nation around. As a young \nman, when I was in the Navy and I visited Japan, there were 460 yen to \nthe dollar. When President Clinton came into office, there were 130 yen \nto the dollar. Before the Democrats defeated the balanced budget \namendment in the U.S. Senate, you can see the yen to the dollar ratio, \nsomewhere a little above 97. When the Democrats defeated the balanced \nbudget amendment, the yen-dollar ratio plummeted. We had one of the \nbiggest movements of current situations of any time in our history.\n  Let me remind Americans that every working person in this country who \nbuys a product produced overseas, there is an impact to that because it \nis instant inflation, it is an instant increase in cost, whether you \nbuy oil products or you buy Japanese cars or other products.\n  What we saw was a world referendum on American policy. And what \nhappened was one of the most dramatic drops in the value of the dollar \nat any time in our history. Within a few days, we lost 14 percent of \nthe value of the U.S. dollar against the yen when the Democrats \ndefeated the balanced budget amendment.\n  But take a look at what happened, Mr. President, when Republicans \npassed the balanced budget in the House of Representatives. It \nreversed. You had one of the biggest increases in the value of the \ndollar in history.\n  Take a look at the headline. This is Friday, May 12, from the \nWashington Times. The headline is simple and straightforward: ``Dollar \nJumps in Biggest One Day Advance in Four Years.''\n  Mr. President, that is what has happened. That is what the difference \nin this is.\n  If you want to destroy the value of the dollar and you want to \ndestroy the credibility of the United States in the world economy, \nadopt the bankruptcy budget from President Clinton. And I say that \nbecause it is perfectly accurate. It is exactly where that budget heads \nus to.\n  If you want to straighten it out and if you want a future for \nAmerican citizens, if you want our children to have a chance to compete \nin the world market, then you will adopt the Republican budget.\n  Mr. President, I want to make one other point, because I know time is \nscarce. Mr. President, I am not a millionaire. I admire those people \nwho have done well. But, Mr. President, I have listened over the last \nseveral days to a series of Democratic millionaires, many of whom \ninherited their money, won and earned by someone else, come to this \nfloor and bash the Republican budget because of how kind it is to \nmillionaires. Now, being lectured about the evils of wealth from \nDemocrats who inherited millions of dollars, I think, challenges the \ncredibility. But what challenges it even more is the fact that they \nmisrepresent what this budget does.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used the allotted time.\n  Does the manager yield additional time to the Senator?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Colorado an \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I think the point needs to be made that \nthese millionaires, who inherited their money and have the audacity to \ncome down and lecture Republicans who are working people, have \nmisrepresented the facts. To suggest that the Republican budget \nprovides tax cuts for the millionaires is absolutely false. As a matter \nof fact, the Boxer-Brown amendment that is included in the budget \ndocument specifically addresses the question of tax cuts and \nspecifically allocates 90 percent of any tax cuts that might come down \nfor those working people who earn under $100,000 a year. Mr. President, \nthe allegation that they make is absolutely false.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BROWN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The remaining time controlled by the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire is 8 minutes and 45 seconds. The time remaining to \nthe Senator from Nebraska is 31 minutes and 27 seconds.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, my friend and colleague, Senator Dodd, will \nbe speaking in a very few moments. Let me take this time to make some \nremarks on the procedures and what the hopes are on this side of the \naisle.\n  Mr. President, I am very disappointed by the amendment that is before \nus, because I do not think it is particularly helpful but it creates \npolitical drama.\n  Yesterday I made a sincere offer to my Republican colleagues to work \nwith them to craft a bipartisan budget. I offered the hand of \nfriendship and the hand of reason.\n  This amendment, the first amendment offered by those on the other \nside of the aisle, is a stinging rebuke to that offer of \nbipartisanship. The Republicans have decided to begin their part of the \nbudget debate with a bit of political theater, and we have seen that \ntactic vividly displayed this morning. Theatrics and voice quivering \ndramatics is not the stuff of which reasonable debate and a sound \nbudget is reached. They seem to want to deflect attention from the \npriorities in the Republican budget by setting up a straw man and then \nknocking that straw man down.\n  Time and time again in the debate this morning, we Democrats have \nbeen accused by the majority, basically walking in lockstep, of wanting \nto make changes in the Republican-offered budget, that we are trying to \nbe [[Page S6955]] helpful and reasonable in offering changes as an \nattempt by the Democrats to spend, spend, spend.\n  I think that anyone who has followed the debate thus far would have \nto concede that we on this side of the aisle are not spending, \nspending, spending, as has been accused in the theatrics that have \ntaken place thus far on the floor of the Senate. What we are trying to \ndo is to be reasonable, to restore some of the cuts on some of the most \nneedy programs, to not allow the budget offered by the Republicans to \ndo terrible harm in certain areas that I think we and, basically, most \nof the Republicans hold very, very dear.\n  We are trying to be reasonable, Mr. President. We are not trying to \nspend money. We are trying to alleviate some of the draconian cuts in \ncertain programs that we think are very vital to the United States of \nAmerica and the people that dwell happily therein.\n  Mr. President, I would simply say--and I want to emphasize once \nagain--that we on this side of the aisle have not offered a single \namendment on the floor, nor did we as Democrats in the Budget Committee \noffer a single amendment that basically changed the goal of balancing \nthe budget by the year 2002 and making some necessary and painful cuts \nthat we recognize and realize are vital if we are going to get to that \npoint of balancing the budget in the year 2002.\n  I noticed in the debate this morning that there was much ado about \nnothing with regard to the continued reference to the fact that those \non this side of the aisle, and at least one on their side of the aisle, \nprevented the balanced budget constitutional amendment to pass. Well, \nthis is a Senator that rejects that proposal, rejects what I consider \nlack of reasoning, because as the Chair and everyone else in the Senate \nknows, this Senator has long sought a constitutional amendment \nrequiring a balanced budget. I, and others on our side of the aisle, \nsupported that when it lost by only one vote on the floor.\n  But we come back to the matter of what is reasonable, what is \npossible, what can be done. This confrontation that I see we are \nrunning into on that side of the aisle is back to, I think, what can be \npointed to as the failure link, if you will, of the budget offered by \nthe Republicans which the Republicans seem to be defending at every \nturn in the road. You cannot move a comma, you cannot dot an ``i,'' you \ncannot make a change. I do not believe that that kind of theatrics that \nwe have heard this morning, that kind of rhetoric or that kind of what \nI consider lack of reasoning is beneficial to getting us to a place \nwhere we can balance the budget by the year 2002 and do it in a \nresponsible fashion.\n  Congress received the administration's budget on February 6. The \nPresident, frankly, admitted that he invited Congress to come forward \nwith its alternative, and the Congress has, so that we as a nation \ncould begin our great discussion on the budget.\n  A lot of things have happened since February 6. For one thing, we had \na thorough debate on the amendment to the Constitution that would have \nrequired a balanced budget. As I said, I supported that amendment, and \nso did nearly two-thirds of both Houses in recorded votes. So, of \ncourse, the political landscape has changed dramatically since the \nPresident submitted his budget on February 6.\n  As we stated on the floor of the Senate yesterday, there is a broad \nconsensus in favor of balancing the Federal budget by the year 2002. \nAll of the amendments offered on this side of the aisle in the Budget \nCommittee and the debate that was held there, and with regard to what \nwe will be offering later on today and next week, all are deficit \nneutral, as far as throwing us further into debt, expanding the debt, \nand all are designed to balance the budget by the year 2002, which is \nthe central theme of the majority budget that has been offered. I said \nsome good things about that yesterday.\n  I just simply want to point out, Mr. President, and have everyone \nunderstand that every single amendment that we offered in the committee \nand which will be offered on the floor of the U.S. Senate, to my \nknowledge, would have balanced the budget just as quickly and at the \nsame time as the Republican-offered budget that seems to be sacrosanct \nin which no change, even one cent, can be made. We do not disagree \nabout the goal of balancing the budget. What we disagree with is the \npriorities, or lack thereof, that has been set and made part of the \nbudget process that has been offered by the opposition. This is a \ndebate we should be having, and I look forward to our proceeding to \nthat debate.\n  Because so much water has gone over the dam since then, I cannot \nsupport the President's budget as offered, and certainly it is not a \nstarting point, but it was something that the President started and was \nrequired to do some months ago. I certainly was not enthusiastic about \nthe President's blueprint when it was first offered.\n  As I said in my opening remarks, we on this side will offer \nperfecting amendments to the Republican budget to try to enter into a \nconstructive process to improve the Republican budget. In my view, the \nPresident's budget should be handled in the same manner, but we all \nknow the fate of that proposal. So there is no point whatsoever in \nattempting to amend it.\n  I have never been a Senator who blindly follows the President, \nregardless of party. In 1993, I worked hard to make changes in the \nPresident's budget. As a result of those efforts, the proposed cut in \nagriculture was significantly reduced. I would not--I would not--have \nsupported the President's budget then had it not been changed along the \nmanner that I suggested.\n  I can only hope, Mr. President, that as this debate continues, there \nwill be some on the other side of the aisle who will choose not to \nblindly follow their leadership and who will vote against the \nRepublican budget unless the hits, the unfair hits on some key \nproposals, are reduced. If those on that side of the aisle want to call \nthat irresponsible spending--it is not true--they have to live with \ntheir words.\n  But the important part is that we need to start with the budget that \nhas a chance of getting the votes to pass and then work to improve that \ndocument. The sooner we begin that process, the sooner we will start to \nget something serious and constructive done. The sooner we get to that \nprocess, the sooner we will end the political theater.\n  Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes to my colleague from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \n20 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Thank you, Mr. President. Let me at the very outset thank \nmy colleague from Nebraska, the ranking member of the Budget Committee. \nLet me also express my gratitude to the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Domenici, for whom I have a high degree of respect \nand regard. I just want to say at the outset that while I have \ndisagreements with the budget proposal as presented by the Senate \nBudget Committee, the budget presented by the majority party in this \nbody is substantially better than the budget presented by the majority \nin the other body. A great deal of attention has been focused on the \nso-called Republican budget, but I invite all to examine the \nsignificant differences that exist between Republicans in the other \nbody and this body. There is a substantial difference.\n  While I said at the outset that I have my disagreements with this \nparticular product, I want to begin my remarks by at least suggesting \nthat the product that has been produced by the majority on this side of \nthe Congress is a far more honest proposal, with numbers that I think \nare real.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, let me also say that I am \ndisappointed that the first amendment to come up, to be offered by my \nfriends on the other side, is to propose the President's budget. This \nis not a serious effort.\n  It is unfortunate, with a subject matter as serious as this is, to \nbegin the process by putting forward a proposal that the President made \nand recommended--and that is what Presidents do, they recommend. \nPresidents do not sign these resolutions. There is no Presidential \nparticipation and no room for a veto pen on a budget resolution. Unlike \nother matters that will come before us, this is a matter for the \nCongress. The law requires that we deal with a budget resolution. \nCertainly the President's voice and his priorities are critically \nimportant in any discussion involving the budget. But to \n[[Page S6956]] have as the first matter of business a proposal more \ndesigned to garner a headline than to deal with the underlying problems \ndoes not speak well for the direction in which we begin this \ndiscussion.\n  What will ultimately be critically important is that there be some \nconsensus developed, hopefully, on these matters. That is the only way \nin this body that you can move the ball forward at all.\n  So I am disappointed that we are consuming our limited time on an \nissue that really has very little legislative relevancy at all and, \ntherefore, detracts from what we all should be engaging in, and that is \na way to try to come to some consensus on these matters.\n  Earlier this year, our colleagues on the other side roundly denounced \nthe President's budget as dead on arrival. Apparently, it is not quite \ndead because we are now considering it here. So it must be a bit like \nLazarus. We are going to raise it from the dead only to try to kill it \nonce more so we can achieve again the kind of headlines that will \nsubmit it to yet a further death. Maybe we can go through this during \nthe next week or so to kill it and raise it, kill it and raise it, if \nthat is going to advance the public awareness and knowledge of the \nproblems of our budget. Having been denounced dead on arrival, it is \napparently alive and will shortly be dead again.\n  I see my colleague from New Hampshire. Does he want to ask me to \nyield?\n  Mr. GREGG. I was just wondering, if I might ask the Senator from \nConnecticut, if it is the request of the Senator that we offer the \nPresident's budget next week as our second amendment?\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my good friend that I suspect if this keeps up, it \nmay be the second, third, and fourth amendments. Maybe it will be the \ngift that keeps on giving, as we once described another amendment in \nthe Budget Committee. Nonetheless, it is disappointing to this Member \nthat that is the first matter of business that we have before us.\n  Let me say for the record--and, again, I say this more in sorrow than \nanything else--the budget proposal that is before us, the product of \nthe Budget Committee, basically was crafted with one side alone being \ninvolved. The minority, our side, got our first look at this budget \nlast week--38 days late, I might point out, by the law. This comes \nalmost 6 months to the day after our friends on the other side have \neither known they were in power or have assumed power. They announced \nthey would have a budget for us in December, January, February, March, \nApril, and finally in late May, 38 days after the law requires it, the \nbudget was reported by the Budget Committee. The budget was presented \nto the minority just last week--a day and a half after the Budget \nCommittee began its consideration of the proposal. Now, the first \namendment offered by the majority is an amendment that brings up the \nPresident's budget. So this looks more like theater than legislating, \nand I regret that that is the case.\n  It is clear that no Members of the majority here have any intention \nof supporting the very resolution they have asked us to vote on. So by \ndefinition this substitute will fail. So why are we wasting our limited \ntime debating it, Mr. President? Why do we not talk about what really \nmatters in this country?\n  A budget resolution, I point out, is much more than just a \ncompilation of figures. Members of Congress are much more than green-\nvisored number crunchers. A budget should be a road map for the future \nof this Nation. It plots the course we will follow as a country, and it \nshould be the embodiment of our values and priorities as a people.\n  The values in the majority budget, the Republican budget plan, in my \nview, are wrong. It treats our people not as assets to be developed, \nbut as items in a spending cut process. It burns, in my view, the \nbridges that ordinary Americans use, or hope to use, to cross over to a \nbetter life for themselves and their families.\n  American politics is about change, Mr. President. But it is not about \nthis kind of change. This debate should be about how we build a \nstronger and a richer America, not just fiscally, as important as that \nis, but economically and socially and morally, as well. Using this \nstandard, I believe the Republican budget proposal just does not \nmeasure up.\n  I would like to take a few moments, if I could, and provide some \nhistorical perspective on balanced and unbalanced budgets. Over the \nlast decade, we have had a tendency to look at our current deficit and \ndebt problems in isolation.\n  Contrary to popular perception, balanced budgets have not been a \nnatural part of our national experience. There have been wide \nvariations throughout the 200-plus-year history of our country in \nspending patterns. We have had surpluses, Mr. President, as high as 102 \npercent of Federal spending in 1835, and deficits as great as 89 \npercent of Federal spending in 1862, during the height of the Civil \nWar. We have run deficits in half of our last 200 years as a nation.\n  Our current difficulties, I point out, are small relative to deficits \nthat our Nation has experienced in the past. In 1983, at the height of \nour current deficit problems, the Federal deficit was 26 percent of \noverall spending. It is now about 13 percent.\n  This historical perspective is not designed, I point out, to diminish \nthe severity of our current deficit problems. Quite to the contrary. \nEverybody agrees that we must reduce our deficits and bring our budgets \nas close to balance as possible.\n  Clearly, balanced budgets are desirable. I know of no Member here \nthat believes otherwise. But they are not and should not be seen as our \nonly goal. Providing economic and military stability, raising living \nstandards, promoting adequate savings and investment, and reacting \nappropriately to unforeseen events are also critically important \nobjectives. It is unrealistic to expect any great nation to achieve all \nof these goals in every given year. Yet, all are critically important \ngoals for any great nation.\n  This economic reality has not been our experience alone. According to \ncommentator Kevin Phillips:\n\n       Among the group of seven industrialized nations, the United \n     States has either the lowest or second-lowest annual budget \n     deficit as a percentage of overall gross national product.\n\n  Having provided a historical perspective, let us remember for a \nmoment, at least, how we got into this present mess that we now find \nourselves in.\n  If we go back to 1981 when President Reagan was the leader of our \ncountry, and there was a Republican Senate, the majority then promised \nto--and listen to these words--``cut taxes, increase defense spending, \nand balance the budget by 1984.'' I am not making that up, Mr. \nPresident. Those were the words and language used more than a decade \nago.\n  The majority is now making a very similar argument for why we ought \nto accept the budget they have presented us with. It did not work in \nthe 1980's. Instead, as most Americans are aware, since 1984, we saw \nthe national debt quadrupled in this country.\n  Our fiscal year 1996 budget would be in balance, Mr. President, if we \nwere not paying the interest on the debt accumulated during the Reagan-\nBush eras. We would be in surplus next year.\n  In January 1993 when the Governor of Arkansas, who never served in \nCongress, never served in the Senate, arrived in town as our newly \nelected President, what did he inherit? He inherited a $327 billion \ndeficit for that year alone. He had to, and was committed to, clean up \nthe fiscal train wreck of the 1980's. Just 27 days--not 38 days late \nunder the law, but 27 days--after being sworn in as the President of \nthe United States, President Clinton submitted a detailed budget plan \nthat contained more than $500 billion in deficit reduction; 27 days \nafter coming into office, this former Governor of Arkansas, who \ninherited the problem, made difficult and painful choices. The choices, \nin fact, were so hard that not a single Republican Member of this body \nsupported his deficit reduction initiative. Instead, they attacked it \nand said, ``This is going to create economic havoc in the country and \nit is going to destroy our ability to have a growing economy.''\n  Yet, we know the opposite has proved to be the case. The President \nreversed the trend of the Reagan-Bush era. Then the national debt, as I \npointed out a moment ago, was growing faster than the economy of this \ncountry. Now our economy, for the first time in a decade \n[[Page S6957]] and a half, is growing faster than the debt of this \ncountry. That happened without a single Member of today's majority \nvoting for that deficit reduction plan.\n  The combined rates of unemployment and inflation have reached a 25-\nyear low. Now, do not believe me, do not believe the talk you hear in \nthe body of the U.S. Senate; talk to the people on Main Street and Wall \nStreet in this country. The best evidence that President Clinton's \nbudget plan provided the kind of leadership that he said he would is \nevidenced by what happened to the economy over the last several years. \nThe marketplace is telling us that he did the right thing--not \npolitical rhetoric, but the marketplace.\n  The deficit is now at its lowest level as a percentage of GDP than at \nany time in the last 15 years, about 2.7 percent. Again, that is not \nrhetoric. That is not talk. That is a fact.\n  In February, the President submitted his 1996 budget and recommended \nan additional $81 billion in deficit reduction. The President \nrecommended consolidating Federal programs, devolving Federal functions \nto the States, privatizing some functions that the private sector can \nperform at least as well at a lower cost, and terminating many programs \nthat have outlived their usefulness.\n  The President's budget resolution was not designed as an end point. \nThe President made eminently clear that we cannot succeed in reducing \nour deficits without reining in rising health care costs.\n  The identification of a $200 billion deficit problem as long as the \neye can see in the future is right. My colleague from New Mexico has \nsaid that. He is correct. That $200 billion deficit item is sticking \nout there. But why is it sticking out there? It is sticking out there, \nwe all know the reason, because of rising health care costs.\n  I say to my friends on the other side that the health care problem is \nnot going to go away by just talking about Medicare. If we read the \nContract With America--and again none of my colleagues here signed the \nso-called contract--we cannot find the words ``health care'' mentioned. \nThe word Medicare does not show up in the contract. Yet we all know \nthat health care is the 1,000-pound gorilla sitting out there that has \nto be addressed.\n  So the President, in his budget, recognized that fact. He said last \nyear we did not get it done, we should try again this year and step up \nto the plate and deal with the issue.\n  With all due respect to my colleagues on the other side, the budget \nplan that has been presented ducks the genuine health care reform \nissue. Instead, it takes a meat ax to a Federal health care program, \ncutting more than $430 billion from Medicare and Medicaid.\n  The resolution provides no details of how these cuts are to be \nachieved, but says instead we will appoint a commission, a commission. \nThat, in my view, is nothing more than an effort to disguise the \nproblem rather than facing up to it ourselves. Our colleagues pin all \ntheir hopes on some outside group which will have the miraculous power \nto turn water into wine and to magically extract $430 billion from \nMedicare and Medicaid without causing any pain to anyone. Mr. \nPresident, it simply cannot be done.\n  Let us assume for a moment that this budget becomes law and that its \nassumptions are carried out. What will the America of 2002 look like? \nThis budget may achieve balance. But, it would also, in my view, \ninflame our social and economic conditions. We may find the Holy Grail \nof a balanced budget, but will we have suffered enormous casualties in \nthe crusade to get our hands on it?\n  Where will senior citizens be in the year 2002? After decades of hard \nwork, many will face retirement years full of anxiety over medical \nbills. Medicare recipients, who, I might point out, Mr. President, have \na median income of $17,000 a year, will live in constant fear that the \nnext illness will bankrupt them or worse. Seniors will face higher \ndeductibles, copayments, and premiums on the order of $900 a year as a \nresult.\n  We can say this is only a cut in growth, but tell that to a person \nout in the country who is living on $17,000 a year or less. Let me \npoint out, Mr. President, 95 percent of the 35 million people on \nMedicare have incomes of $50,000 or less; 7.7 million of the 35 million \nhave incomes of $10,000 or less.\n  Last year, Medicare recipients paid almost $3,000 in out-of-pocket \ncosts toward their medical expenses. This budget proposal will ask them \nto pay $900 more on average; $900 more in Medicare costs. These people \ncannot afford that.\n  We have got to come up with better answers to solve the overall \nMedicare problem. Do not tell me it will not hurt. Do not tell me it \nwill be painless.\n  Every Member of this body has a health care plan. If we get sick, we \nare covered. We have incomes of $135,000 a year. To a person out there \nliving on $10,000, $15,000, $14,000, $16,000 or $20,000 a year, this \nkind of increase in their out-of-pocket expenses hurts deeply. We have \nto do a better job.\n  Medicare is not the cause of the problem, it is the symptom. It is \none feature. To put all of our eggs in the Medicare/Medicaid basket and \nsay we have now solved the health care problem is to be totally \nunmindful of the magnitude of this issue.\n   Mr. President, when those who say on the other side of the aisle, \n``Sorry, this is painful''--but we have spread the pain widely, they \nare not being fair to or honest with the American people. I say to my \nfriend from New Mexico--and I respect him because he does not have the \nkind of tax cut in his proposal that exists on the other side--but how \ndo we say to someone watching that House budget pass with massive tax \ncuts for the affluent on one hand, and massive cuts in Medicare--by far \nthe largest in our history--that this is the least bit equitable. The \nsurveys in this country say that Americans would like to have a tax \ncut. Everybody would. But we think deficit reduction is more important. \nAnd yet we will sacrifice the people on Medicare, people on Medicaid, \nfor a tax cut. What kind of balance is that? What kind of fairness is \nthat? That is not what people asked for in this country when they voted \nlast fall.\n  Now, Mr. President, let me turn to education, because that is also a \ncritical issue. It is the key to our society's and our economy's \nsuccess. Ask any person in this country what is the single most \nimportant issue in many ways and they will say an educated society.\n  With income increasingly correlated with educational achievement, it \nis quite obvious. According to the New York Times, the wage gap between \ncollege graduates and high school graduates doubled during the 1980's. \nCollege graduates used to earn about 30 percent more than high school \ngraduates. Today they earn 60 percent more than high school graduates.\n  Labor Secretary Bob Reich reports that every year of post-secondary \neducation or training boosts earning power by 6 to 12 percent. It is \nnot just a question of learning something, it is also economic power. \nIt is the opportunity to climb out of a difficult situation that a \nfamily may be in. Education is the key to success. At a time when we \nshould be devoting more resources to the 21st century needs of this \nNation, in the year 2002 of this budget, we will be spending a third \nless than we are today--a third less, Mr. President--on education.\n  Ask the American public whether or not they think it is wise fiscal \npolicy to slash the education needs of middle-income families. Half of \nall college students count on Federal financial aid to put themselves \nthrough school, but this budget puts them under the gun.\n  By 2002, interest will start accruing on student loans while students \nare still in school. These cuts will lift higher education out of the \nreach of many of American families. A million students, Mr. President, \nwill lose their Pell grants. Other forms of financial aid will become \nscarce.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator is expired.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I do not see my colleague to ask for time. \nWe are out of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator is expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on that note, let me just say to the \nAmerican people, there will not be 1 million Pell grants lost under the \nSenate proposal. We will prove that in due course, but that is a nice \nway to end the Senator's remarks, by making this commitment and \nobservation to the people.\n  I yield to Senator Gramm 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Texas.\n  [[Page S6958]]\n  \n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank our dear colleague from New Mexico \nfor yielding.\n  I want to make a couple of points about the President and his budget \nand his lack of leadership. I will only make a few points, because the \nPresident has decided to make himself irrelevant to the number one \nissue in the Congress by submitting a budget that over the next 5 years \nhas the deficit explode up to almost $300 billion a year. Now, \neverybody has to understand that represents a total lack of leadership.\n  Now, let me begin by talking about the President's budget 2 years \nago. It was a budget that raised taxes by $252 billion, taxed Social \nSecurity benefits on Social Security families that were earning over \n$30,000 a year, taxed gasoline, imposed a massive tax on small \nbusiness. Yet what happened to the deficit? It went up. The deficit is \nrising.\n  If we went back and took away Bill Clinton's tax increase and took \naway the spending increases that have occurred since he has become \nPresident, the deficit would be lower today if there had been no tax \nincrease and no spending increase.\n So it is true that Republicans voted against the Clinton budget \nbecause it raised taxes, and raised spending more than it raised taxes.\n\n  I think it is also important, since many people are going to talk \nabout defense--we won the cold war. We tore down the Berlin Wall. We \nliberated Eastern Europe. We changed the world through the leadership \nof Ronald Reagan.\n  But if every penny of defense savings since 1985 had gone to deficit \nreduction instead of being spent, we would have a balanced budget \ntoday. So not only have we spent every penny of massive increases in \ntaxes, but Congress and the President have spent every penny of defense \nsavings since we won the cold war.\n  Finally, in terms of Medicare, I will tell you one thing about our \nDemocratic colleagues and that is they are willing to take an issue \nwhere they have no standing and cloak themselves in righteousness on \nit. When the President proposed a 1,300 page bill to have the \nGovernment take over and run the health care system, to reinvent the \ngreatest health care system in the history of the world in the image of \nthe post office, the one part of the American health care system that \nhe chose to exclude from health care reform was Medicare.\n  Now the Democrats tell us, look, you cannot possibly do what a \nbipartisan commission tells you that you have to do to prevent Medicare \nfrom going broke without having the Government take over and run the \nwhole health care system. And yet, when they proposed that the \nGovernment take over and run the health care system, they exempted \nMedicare. So I am afraid their words simply do not have the ring of \ntruth in them.\n  What has happened to the Federal budget? If we went back to 1950 and \nwe looked at the growth of Government's budget relative to the growth \nof the budget of the average family in America we see a very, very \nclear picture. Government's budget at the Federal level has grown 2\\1/\n2\\ times as fast on average as the budget of the average family in \nAmerica since 1950. Let me convert that into something I think people \nwill understand. If you went back to 1950 and you had the Federal \nGovernment's budget grow at the rate that the family budget has grown \nin America, our Government today would be one-third its size. If the \nfamily budget, beginning in 1950, had grown as fast as the Government \nbudget has grown, the average working family in America would be \nearning $128,000 a year today.\n  Now, I think if you ask most people if they would rather have that \nAmerica or the one we have now, I think most Americans would prefer to \nhave that America. But what the President is proposing, what our \nDemocratic colleagues are proposing, is more of the same. The President \nis so committed to preserving the Government he knows and loves, \nprograms which he has a political and emotional attachment to, that it \ndoes not matter that in the last 40 years those programs have failed. \nIt does not matter that people on welfare are poorer, more dependent, \nand less happy today than they were in 1965. The President's answer is \nmore spending on welfare.\n  It does not matter that Medicare is going broke and a bipartisan \ncommission, appointed by President Clinton, says that by the year 2002, \nwe will not be able to pay the bills because the average retired couple \nis going to end up having expenses of over $110,000 more over their \nlifetime than we have in the system to pay for their benefits. The \nPresident says not to worry about it; 2002? I guess President Clinton \nfigures he will be out of office and the roof will fall on somebody \nelse's head. This budget worries about it.\n  How do we deal with deficits? Basically, what the budget that is \nbeing offered on the floor of the Senate does is limit the growth of \nGovernment spending to 3.3 percent a year. In fact, if you look at this \nred line I have on my chart here, that is what Government spending in \ntotal looks like under the Domenici budget, the budget that the \nDemocrats are here attacking, saying the world is coming to an end if \nwe adopt this budget. Government spending grows every single day under \nthe Domenici budget. It grows by 3.3 percent a year. And I submit there \nare a lot of working families in America who are not going to see their \nincomes grow by 3.3 percent a year. By limiting the growth of \nGovernment spending to 3.3 percent a year, we can balance the budget \nover the next 7 years.\n  Now, we have some people who say that is enough; that is as hard a \njob as we can do. I believe we can do better. I believe we should limit \nthe growth of Federal spending to about 3 percent a year so we can do \nwhat the House has done, balance the Federal budget and cut spending \nfurther so we can let working families keep more of what they earn, and \nso we can provide incentives for job creation and economic growth.\n  Our people need less Government and more freedom. They need the \nopportunity to spend more of their own money on their own children. We \nneed incentives for job creation. We can do that by adopting a budget \nwhich balances the budget but which cuts spending further so we can let \npeople make investments.\n  I hope on Tuesday to give Members an opportunity to both balance the \nbudget and to cut spending further so we can let people keep more of \nwhat they earn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Under the agreement of 15 minutes on each side before the vote at \n10:45, the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I yield myself, on behalf of the ranking \nmember of the Budget Committee, 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, those not familiar with the workings of the \nSenate might find it strange that the first amendment offered by \nproponents of this budget resolution is one they will vote against.\n  Let me explain why. Last night, I heard one of the most disrespectful \nspeeches I have ever heard on the Senate floor. I saw one of the most \ndisrespectful charts I have ever seen. What I saw was disrespectful of \nthe President of the United States personally and of the office of the \nPresidency.\n  The amendment before us is a further attempt to embarrass the \nPresident.\n  In January 1993, President Bush presented his last budget to Congress \nas required by law. That budget showed deficits climbing to $320 \nbillion by fiscal year 1998. I do not intend to offer President Bush's \nlast budget as an amendment, but I do ask unanimous consent to have a \nsummary of that budget printed in the Record so the Record will show \nthe contrast.

One minute has expired.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. What a difference 2 years has made.\n  What it means to me is also a loud signal that those on the other \nside of the aisle have no intention of developing a bipartisan approach \nto deficit reduction. I think that is regrettable.\n  I do not intend to vote for either the pending amendment or the \nunderlying budget resolution. It is still my hope that we can find a \nbipartisan solution at the end of the day. But not by offering \namendments like this one, for political purposes.\n  I think it is unfortunate and I urge its defeat.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have reluctantly concluded that I cannot \nsupport the President's budget as submitted. The major change that \nshould be made to his budget, in my judgment, would be to eliminate his \nproposed tax cut and, instead, apply the amount that would be required \nfor this purpose toward deficit reduction.\n  The President deserves great credit for his leadership in proposing a \nmajor deficit reduction package shortly after he assumed office in \n1993. That deficit reduction package was subsequently enacted into law \nwithout one Republican vote in either the House or the Senate. It \nresulted in deficit reduction over a 5-year period of approximately \n$500 billion.\n  I note that in this year's budget submission, however, the \nPresident's budget proposals would result in a continuation of annual \ndeficits in the $200 billion range for each of the next 5 years. I \nthink that we can, and must, do better. The place to start is to \nrestrain ourselves from making the easy choices like tax cuts and \ninstead make the difficult choices that may be necessary and apply any \nsavings to deficit reduction.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there are two starkly different budgets \nbefore us that would move this country in opposite directions. First, \nthere is the Republican budget now before this body. That budget offers \na vision for the future. Under that plan the deficit would slowly \ndecline until it would disappear in 2002. It is the only budget with a \nvision and a future. It would balance present-day needs with long-term \nneeds for seniors, for children, for the needy, and for the taxpayer.\n  There is another budget before us, Mr. President. It is the \nPresident's budget. And his budget moves in the opposite direction. \nUnder his vision of the future, deficits would rise as far as the eye \ncan see. His direction would be devastating to our children and \ngrandchildren, and to America's future. It would saddle future \ngenerations with an additional $1.7 trillion in debt over the next 5 \nyears.\n  I have not seen a more irresponsible budget proposed by a President \nsince the Rose Garden budget proposed by President Reagan in 1984. That \nbudget did nothing to attack the deficit. This one does even less.\n  The President's budget submission represents an abdication of \nleadership by the President. At a time when he could have carried \nfiscal responsibility across the goal line, he punted. He took a walk. \nHe decided to play Pontius Pilate and wash his hands of the matter.\n  Mr. President, I hope this budget is soundly defeated. This body has \nto send the message that the direction taken by this President in his \nbudget is unacceptable. It represents abdication, retreat, and failed \nleadership. It represents the triumph of business-as-usual over vision. \nI urge its defeat.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, just this week my Republican \ncolleagues, belatedly, unveiled their budget priorities to the American \npeople and the U.S. Senate. Their priorities are expressed in Senator \nDomenici's budget proposal which is now pending on the Senate floor. \nThe loss leaders in this Republican budget are the basic health \nprograms protecting our Nation's senior citizens, poor children, the \ndisabled, and pregnant women, also known as Medicare and Medicaid. \nHistoric levels of cuts in these programs--$256 billion out of Medicare \nand $175 billion out of Medicaid--make the major contribution to the \ndeficit reduction in their proposal. Education gets hit hard, as do \nother investment priorities I care about, like job training. Our \nNation's veterans lose. Working families who depend on the earned \nincome tax credit lose. In my judgment, the people of West Virginia, \nwhom I represent, lose under the Republican budget proposal. \nNevertheless, the Republican budget priorities are here. Their budget \nis finally on the table and the subject of discussion and debate in the \nU.S. Senate. Is that what Republicans want to debate and talk about? \nNo.\n  The Republicans' first order of business during the floor action of \ntheir budget has been to exercise their parliamentary right to offer \nthe first amendment. Their first amendment, offered by the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, is to substitute the \nPresident's fiscal year 1996 budget for their long-awaited proposal. It \nseems rather odd to propose a complete substitute for their much \nanticipated proposal before there has been any real debate on the \nSenate floor about what is in their proposal--who wins and who loses \nunder their plan. And it is even more extraordinary that my Republican \ncolleagues would choose to move to adopt the President's budget \nproposal as a substitute, after purporting to have just outlined their \nversion of a responsible budget before the Senate. Why have they asked \nthe Senate to vote on the President's budget before any meaningful \n[[Page S6960]] discussion has ensued about the details of the \nRepublican budget proposal? Why have they changed the subject?\n  This amendment is nothing more than a political ploy. I suppose it is \nmeant to make the point that the President's budget would not garner a \nmajority of votes in the Senate. But we already know that. They are not \ngoing to vote for it and they are the majority of Members of this body. \nUndoubtedly, their proposed amendment will fail, regardless of how \nDemocratic Senators vote. So they must be using their parliamentary \nright purely to make a political point. A point which seems obvious to \nme.\n  I believe they have chosen to pursue this strategy because they want \nto distract the American people, the Senate, the media, from what ought \nto be the focus of our budget debate--the affects of the Republican \nbudget proposal on the budgets of America's working families, seniors, \nsmall businesses, students, and on the investments I believe are \nimportant to the job creation and job growth.\n  They do not want to talk about the details of their plan. They want \nto talk about somebody else's plan. They want to score political \npoints. Well, much as they seem to dislike the fact that they are now \nbeing asked to produce the details of their budget and explain what \ntheir priorities are, it is their responsibility to do so. They are the \nnew majority. We made tough choices when we were in the majority. We \nproduced consistent deficit reduction. Under Democratic congressional \nleadership we reduced the deficit by over a trillion dollars in the \nlast 5 years. We have met the challenge. It is their turn to lead.\n  Their first response is to say let us talk about something else. Well \nthat is just not good enough. They have a duty to explain what is in \ntheir proposal and why. They have yet to do that in any meaningful way, \ndespite a slew of opening statements given on the floor today.\n  For instance, we have heard people suggest the Medicare Program's \ngrowth is out of control and that is why it ought to be restricted. \nThat is not the real reason the Republican budget slashes in Medicare. \nThe real reason, I believe, is that they need huge amounts of Medicare \ncuts to pull off balancing the budget on their arbitrary timetable. The \ntruth is Medicare's growing at the same rate as the health care costs \nof other Americans, including our health care costs of those of us here \nin Congress, maybe a percent higher. That is hardly way out of sync \nwith the increases that individual Americans are coping with, and it is \nto be expected when we have yet to address the country's basic need for \nfundamental health care reform. So why the need to zero in on Medicare \nfor mammoth cuts--to pay for an irresponsible and unfair tax cut for \nthe rich.\n  I would be derelict not to note that our failure to deal with the \ncomplicated issues of health care reform last year means that our \ndeficit problem is even greater. Indeed, the major complaint about the \nPresident's fiscal year 1996 budget--that it does not produce \nsufficient deficit reduction--would be moot if we had achieved \ncomprehensive health care reform last year. As Democrats have been \nwarning for years, and as President Clinton insisted throughout his \ncampaign, if we don't deal with our Nation's health care problems which \naffect our\n families, our businesses, our children and our seniors, and each of \nour Federal health programs, we will never get the deficit under \ncontrol. I would like to believe that the Congress is still willing to \nstep up to the health care challenge, although outside of rhetoric and \na forced march to meet a predetermined budget target, I have not seen \nany evidence that my Republican colleagues are in fact willing to step \nup to the plate.\n\n  I wish that was not the case, but I have to tell you what I believe \nto be true.\n  Finally, I want to point out that even without reaching agreement on \ncomprehensive health care reform, if the President's budget proposal \nhad not included an additional tax break for working class families it \nwould produce continued significant deficit reduction. The basic \nbuilding blocks of the President's budget proposal focus on all the \nright priorities--it delivers on two promises to West Virginia and the \nrest of America:\n  It comes through with funding for what matters most to our State: \njobs, health care, fighting crime, and children. It has more money for \nhighways, for education, and for job training.\n  The President's budget proposal also continues to cut wasteful \nspending. It mothballs 130 programs that the President thinks should be \nshelved. It is a tight-fisted budget aimed at continuing the efforts of \nOBRA93 to cut the Federal deficit.\n  But I recognize what is going on here. So do my colleagues, and so \nshould the American people. I will not dignify the Republicans' attempt \nto shift the debate from their budget to an alternative that has no \nhope of passing with my vote. This important debate is about \npriorities. And it is their turn to explain theirs. I do not share \nthem, but I have yet to hear an articulate defense of the details of \ntheir proposal.\n  To conclude, I will vote against Senator Domenici's amendment to \nsubstitute the President's fiscal year 1996 budget for the hard-\nhearted, extreme proposals in the Republican budget plan--regarding \nwhich they seem unwilling to discuss in any careful detail. I will vote \nno despite the fact that I believe the President's budget, and \ntherefore the amendment, would be a much better basis for a discussion \nof our national goals and priorities than the underlying Republican \nbudget we have before us today, if only because it does not devastate \nthe Medicare and Medicaid programs on which 70 million Americans rely \nfor their health care.\n  I am interested in hearing the Republican's explanation of how they \nbelieve their budget puts the emphasis where it belongs: on our \nNation's economic development, jobs, health care, crime, and children--\nor why it does not. That is the kind of Federal budget that deals with \nthe day to day needs of West Virginia and that is the only kind of \nFederal budget which I can support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  We are about to vote on the first amendment in this budget resolution \ndebate. Let me say, as far as most of us on this side of the aisle are \nconcerned, it is not a serious vote. This is purely political \ngamesmanship. It is a rite of every budget year. Democrats did it when \nPresidents Reagan and Bush were in office, and now our Republican \ncolleagues are taking their turn.\n  This is not a serious vote. This vote has nothing to do with the \nbudget resolution that is on the floor of the Senate. The Budget \nCommittee has reported its resolution. That is the operative document. \nThat is the document that will guide congressional action.\n  That is the document Senate Democrats find defective, and are seeking \nto improve with a series of amendments that we will be offering over \nthe course of the next 3 or 4 days.\n  The budget resolution is a congressional document. It is not \npresented to the President, and it does not require his signature. It \nis our internal guideline.\n  The next stage will involve the President for he must sign or veto \nthe reconciliation bill. The President has already indicated his \nwillingness to work toward a common solution, a bipartisan solution. \nBut he has been very clear about the conditions which must be met.\n  The Republicans must abandon their tax cut that favors the very rich. \nIf there is to be a tax cut, it must be targeted to the middle class, \nand it must be paid for.\n  Second, the Republicans must rescind their tax increase on working \nAmericans. We simply cannot accept a tax increase of $1,500 per year on \nthose people who are struggling just to stay off welfare.\n  Third, the Republicans must restore their cuts to education. Asking \ncollege students to pay an additional $3,000 a year is simply wrong.\n  Fourth, any changes in Medicare must take place in the context of \noverall health care reform. We have said that over and over again. A \n$256 billion cut in Medicare is draconian.\n  The stock market yesterday went down 82 points, and a lot of us have \nbeen convinced that is simply senior citizens selling their stock to \npay for Medicare insurance in the next several years.\n  Those conditions are the reality of the budget. Those issues will be \nthe [[Page S6961]] ones that define this budget year. Those are the \nissues that count with all Americans.\n  But this current vote has nothing to do with reality. It is a \nmeaningless political gesture.\n  In light of this, I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment. \nI suggest we not dignify this vote by taking it seriously.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, do they have any additional time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 10 minutes remaining on that side, \nand 15 minutes remaining on the other side.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand our 15 is our wrap-up time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I take 30 seconds of my time and then yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I just wanted to say most of us think the reason the \nstock market went haywire is the President threatened to veto a \nrescissions bill which means that he is not going to sign a \nreconciliation bill which means we are going to continue the deficit \nspending for as far as the eye can see. I think that is what the stock \nmarket saw yesterday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank the distinguished \nDemocratic leader.\n  Let me say at the very outset, that I want to commend the Democratic \nleader for his work putting together packages which we will be able to \nraise in the next few days highlighting our disagreements with the \nbudget proposal as submitted by the majority party. Let me also \nunderscore the points that the minority leader has made; and, that is, \nthat if our colleagues on the other side will drop their tax cut \nproposals and be willing to deal with comprehensive health care reform, \nif they will not take a meat ax to education and the working poor, I am \nconfident that we can put together a budget here that would get us to a \nbalance hopefully by the year 2002, and, if not then, shortly \nthereafter and do it in a meaningful way.\n  I have already talked briefly on the issue of Medicare, and \neducation. But under the proposal being submitted to us by the \nRepublican majority, 12 million working poor Americans will face \nincreased taxes in the year 2002. These working families who are trying \nto play by the rules and to provide for themselves and their children \nnear the poverty level will face a tax increase in the form of a \nreduction in the earned income tax credit. They will pay on average \n$350 a year more in additional taxes in the year 2002.\n  This unfair and shortsighted deficit saver will make welfare look \neven more attractive compared to low-wage work, and people working full \ntime at a minimum wage will not be able to lift themselves out of \npoverty.\n  I have said for years the best social program anybody came up with is \na job. Here we have an awful lot of people who are living on the \nmargins in this country. The earned income tax credit has been one of \nthe most successful programs in providing economic relief to people \nliving on the margins. President Reagan called it the best idea we have \nfor assisting people at the margins.\n  Our colleague and chairman of the Budget Committee has heralded the \nsuccess of the EITC in the past. There are problems. I do not disagree. \nWe ought to deal with those problems. But to change this program and to \ntake $21 billion out of it at a time when we are going to be talking \nabout welfare reform, when we are trying to lift people out--not \ntemporarily, but permanently off public dependency--does not make any \nsense. Those not benefiting from economic growth are going to find \nthemselves falling further and further behind.\n  Since 1979 the bottom 20 percent of Americans, by income, have seen \ntheir real wages plummet 17 percent. We have expanded the earned income \ntax credit to address this dangerous trend on a bipartisan basis. I \nwould point out that by gutting the credit the Republican budget will \nonly make matters worse.\n  Working Americans are going to find themselves increasingly cut off \nfrom the American dream in the year 2002 if this budget is approved. \nWho is going to be better off under this proposal? The well off or the \nbest off in this country are going to do relatively well.\n  The budget leaves the door wide open to a tax cut along the lines \napproved by the House. More than half the benefits in that package \nflow, as we know, to people earning more than $100,000 a year. Here we \nare talking about people at the low-income level who are working today, \nnot living on welfare, not getting AFDC, trying to make ends meet, \ntrying to take care of their families. And we are going to hit them \nwith a $21 billion hit while we are providing relief for many people \nmaking $100,000 or more. I do not fault anybody in that income \ncategory. Everybody wants to be in that income category. But to get \nthere you have to make the investments. You have to give them a chance \nto get going.\n  Here we have a budget proposal that goes after people right on the \nfringes, and to pay for that we take people at the upper-income levels \nand we give them a tax break. What kind of logic is that? What does \nthat say about the direction we are heading in as a country in the year \n2002?\n  Mr. President, almost 60 years ago we heard another American \nPresident, Franklin Roosevelt, say:\n\n       In every land there are always at work forces that drive \n     men apart and forces that draw men together. In our personal \n     ambitions we are individualists. But in our seeking for \n     economic and political progress as a nation, we all go up, or \n     else we all go down, as one people.\n\n  In my view we should heed this wise advice as we prepare to close out \nthis century and begin the 21st century.\n  This budget resolution gives to the strong at the expense of the \nweak. It provides relief to those least in need of it at the expense of \nthose with nothing extra to spare. It is not a road map to a place that \nwe as a nation should go. I certainly hope we come to our senses and \nchoose a different course than the one proposed by this budget. It is \nnot just a question of knowing the price of everything but knowing the \nvalue of things as well.\n  A generation of Americans benefited from the GI bill. Today, if we \nwere to pass the GI bill, it would cost $9,700 for every recipient. \nThat is what those dollars meant in the latter part of the forties and \nearly fifties. How many people in this country benefited? How many \nfamilies today are better off because that investment was made? Those \nwere hard dollars to vote for. Yet, we grew as a country. We benefited \nas a country.\n  VA mortgages--2-percent loans gave people in this country a chance to \nbuy their first home. How many people today are doing better, have good \nhomes because they got a start? How many people got jobs in building \nthose homes? Those were investments we made in people.\n  Today we have to think along similar lines to make those investments \nin education, in growth, in opportunity. The best deficit reducer in \nthe long-term is a growing economy.\n  So we ought to keep that in mind as we go through this process of \ndeciding the kind of investments and cuts to make.\n  Again, Mr. President, there is no debate about deficit reduction in \nthis body, none that I know. We ought to get there as soon as we can \nbut do so with moderation, intelligence, and sensitivity about what \nmakes a great country stronger. Fiscal responsibility is a critical \nelement. Investing in education, in health, in social progress also \ncontributes significantly to a strong country.\n  My deep, deep fear is that the budget proposal I am fearful we are \ngoing to adopt takes us in the opposite direction. I say that in all \ndue respect to its authors, but I think this is a time to be coming \ntogether in seeking some common ground as to how we can put a proposal \ntogether that allows us a deficit-neutral society, creating surpluses, \nbut does so in a way that grows America and gives this next generation \nan opportunity to enjoy the dreams and visions that this Nation ought \nto be providing.\n  So with that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and look forward to \nthe debate next week.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  [[Page S6962]]\n  \n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 7 minutes to Senator Snowe from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Chair. I thank the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Domenici, not only for yielding me this time but, as \na member of the Senate Budget Committee, I have certainly appreciated \nthe leadership he has provided on this most serious and critical of \nissues.\n  I am a little surprised by what the Senate minority leader mentioned \nearlier when he said that offering the President's budget which he \noffered this year for fiscal year 1996 was really empty, meaningless, \nand not a serious gesture.\n  What is that saying, that the President was not serious about \noffering his proposal to the American people to address deficit \nreduction and, indeed, balancing the budget for future generations?\n  I think it is a sad commentary to suggest that the President is not \nserious in engaging in this issue. Is he suggesting that the President \ndoes not want to be relevant in balancing the budget and joining \nCongress in doing what is important for the American people?\n  I think it is very much a fair comparison because we have heard over \nand over again about the proposal that came out of the Senate Budget \nCommittee. We worked very hard. We wanted a bipartisan agreement. But \nthe administration's proposal is a monument to status quo. The irony is \nthat the administration has referred to the Republican budget \nresolution, which achieves a balanced budget through serious deficit \nreduction by the year 2002--that is what, in fact, many of the minority \nMembers of the Senate have indicated during the debate on the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, that they did want to \nbalance that budget by the year 2002. They just did not want a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. But the administration \nand administration officials have referred to our budget as ``dumb and \ndumber'' and ``clear and present danger.''\n  Frankly, if the administration would like to invoke a film fee, I \nwould be happy to oblige them because, due to the years and years of \ndeficit and red ink that the President extends in his budget into the \nnext century, I certainly would describe the President's budget as the \n``crimson tide'' because that is the legacy the President is leaving \nfuture generations. That is in fact his budget. It is a sea of red ink.\n  Compare that to what we have offered in the Senate Budget Committee--\nresponsible deficit reduction that does achieve a balanced budget by \nthe year 2002. I think it does not take an Einstein to figure out who \nis doing something for the future of this country, for the future of \nchildren and seniors and the stability of this country. Do we leave a \nmonument of red ink to future generations just beyond the turn of the \ncentury that will require them to pay an 82-percent tax rate to finance \nthis red ink that is in President Clinton's budget? Or do we do \nsomething now so that they can have a better future and invest in the \npriorities that everybody wants this Nation to invest in, such as \neducation and health care and our infrastructure?\n  They cannot do that with the President's budget, because it is a sea \nof red ink. So I am dismayed that the President offered a budget that \nwas not serious in reaching and achieving a balanced budget by the year \n2002. The fact is the President is offering $2 trillion by the year \n2002 in additional debt. Even the Washington Post had this editorial \ncomment a day after the President released his budget, and I quote:\n\n       It is troubling that he has now decided to take a holiday \n     from the hard and painful responsibility to keep working the \n     deficit downward. The issue is this country's future standard \n     of living.\n\n  Even the distinguished ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee \nsaid earlier today that he was not enthusiastic about the President's \nplan. In fact, he noted a month or two ago ``In the administration's \nfailure to chart a new fiscal course for our Nation,'' he said, ``the \nPresident dropped the ball by offering a budget that falls short, way \nshort of the deficit reduction we need.''\n  This budget tells a tale of two Presidents, one who promises a \nbalanced budget and another who fails to deliver; one President who \npromises deep cuts in the Nation's deficit and another who oversees a \nmore than doubling of the predicted deficit in the year 2004; and one \nPresident who promises middle-class protection and another who saddles \nthe middle class with increased per capita debts, increased taxes on \nSocial Security benefits and increased taxes on those who own family \nfarms and small businesses.\n  Simply put, there is a nagging fundamental disparity between what \nthis President says and what he does. It reminds me of the Shakespeare \nquote ``action is eloquence.'' If that is the case, we better tongue-\ntie the administration when it comes to budget policy and economics.\n  President Clinton made a statement on April 15 in which he presented \na three-point legislative priority list which included welfare reform \nand crime, but he also mentioned tax and spending cuts that both reduce \nthe budget deficit and the spending deficit. But you would not know \nthat reducing the deficit was even one of the President's legislative \npriorities because, again getting back to this chart, he has $200 to \n$300 billion in annual deficits between now and the end of this decade \nand beyond into the next century.\n  The President had said in February that his budget plan will by 1997 \ncut $140 billion in that year alone from the deficit.\n  Well, that being the case, it must have been another President that \ncrafted the budget plan for the next 5 years. \nAccording to the reality-based reestimate by the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the 1996 budget deficit will be $211 billion, not the $197 \nbillion the administration projected. The 1998 deficit will rise to \n$231 billion, not the $196 billion projected by the administration, and \nthe 1999 deficit will reach an estimated $256 billion, a far cry from \nwhat the administration projected of $197 billion.\n  And if that is not bad enough, we have to look at the year 2000. CBO \nsays the deficit will reach $276 billion rather than the $194 billion \nprojected by the administration. That is almost a $100 billion \ndifference in the deficit between what the administration projects and \nwhat the Congressional Budget Office estimates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. SNOWE. There is no question as to where we need to go and who is \nbeing responsible for the future of this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President and fellow Senators, first of all, I \noffered this amendment after asking if any Democrats would like to \noffer it, so I would like to make that very clear. I do not like to \nintroduce the President's budget. I am not for it, but I thought it \ndeserved a vote. Normally, we vote on Presidents' budgets whether we \nagree with them or not. When they did not agree with the Republican \nPresidents' budgets, obviously, they were offered just for the same \nreason--to see how many people really supported it.\n  But equally as important, the press secretary for the President on \nMay 15 said, and I quote:\n\n       It would be a good place to begin. It's better than what \n     they're talking about.\n\n  So I do this to oblige. Since, speaking for the President, his is \nbetter than ours, we would like to have a vote and see.\n  Now, Mr. President and fellow Senators, there are 2 approaches to the \nfuture of our country, not 15 or 20. There are two at this point in \nhistory: This one, the President's budget--the President's budget \nsurrenders to the deficit, makes few if any hard choices--and the \nRepublican budget which I was privileged to help craft with many \nMembers and many task forces, this budget.\n  Now, this budget is a budget for the future.\n  This budget is a budget of the past.\n  This budget changes things.\n  This budget is the status quo.\n  This budget says the future generations should not be taxed without \nrepresentation--little children born today should not be taxed without \nrepresentation.\n  This budget says we will tax the next generation. We will tax every \nman, [[Page S6963]] woman, and child who is working today to pay for \nprograms that we insist on spending their money for even though they \nare not even around to be consulted, they are not being asked, and they \nmay not even know that they are being taxed without representation. \nBecause, indeed, we just continue to borrow money and say, ``You pay \nfor it.'' This budget says, ``We'll keep borrowing money. Kids cannot \ncomplain anyway. Children cannot vote anyway. Children are not even \ngoing to be heard on this budget. But we are going to keep on taxing \nthem by taking away their standard of living, by making them have to \nwork ever harder and ever longer to pay for this budget and the \nprograms that we refuse to restrain, reform, make relevant, or get rid \nof duplication.''\n  This budget says the Government of the United States can continue to \ngrow. Our responsibility to millions of Americans will continue. This \nbudget says, make Medicare solvent. This budget says we want Medicare \nnot only for the current seniors but for seniors yet to join and need \nit for their health care. This budget says we want to help the poor in \nour States who need health care because we are going to have a program \nthat can be sustained, that we can afford.\n  This budget says to keep on paying for a Medicaid Program that we \ncannot afford. Sooner or later, 2, 3, or 4 years from now, we will have \nto say to the poor people that get Medicaid, ``We can't afford it \nanymore.''\n  This budget says start fixing it right now.\n  So, fellow Senators, let me suggest that we hear a lot about our \nsenior citizens. And we say to them, ``When all of this is over, you \nwill have a Medicare Program. It will be as good or better than the one \nyou have now.''\n  We say to the poor, who are getting health care from Medicaid, ``You \nwill have a program and it will be better than the one now.'' And, yes, \nwe will say in one loud voice, ``There is a future with an increased \nstandard of living and opportunity,'' if you adopt this budget, the \nRepublican budget, and fail to adopt the President's budget which is \npending before us today.\n  Many comments have been made today about various programs. We do not \nhave an opportunity to answer right in the middle of these speeches, \nbut before you pass judgment on education and what reforms we have \nrecommended on Medicare, Medicaid, and on the earned-income tax \ncredit--which, incidentally, will grow at 40 percent while some are \ntalking about it being cut--wait for the details. We will discuss them \none by one with the American people.\n  But, for now, we have an opportunity to reject a status quo budget, a \nbudget of the past, and set in motion the budget of the future.\n  I yield to Senator Stevens, who wants to make a unanimous-consent \nrequest.\n  I yield to the majority leader whatever time I might have remaining.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may use 5 \nminutes of my leader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, first let me quote from what I consider to \nbe a fairly reliable source.\n\n       The budget which came from the President said, ``I've given \n     up; that as long as I am President of the United States there \n     will never be a balanced budget.'' That is an astonishing \n     statement.\n\n  That quote came from former Senator Paul Tsongas, Democrat of \nMassachusetts, cochairman of the bipartisan antideficit Concord \nCoalition.\n  Another quote from our former colleague, Senator Tsongas:\n\n       Let me say as a Democrat it's very easy for Democrats to \n     poke fun at what these two people [Senator Pete Domenici and \n     Representative John Kasich] are doing because, unlike our \n     party, they've decided to really address this issue. And the \n     fact is, they're prepared to put a balanced budget amendment \n     on the table. The balanced budget amendment died because of \n     the Democrats--not because of the Republicans, not because of \n     the vote in the Senate, and we Democrats are equally \n     responsible to our kids.\n\n  That was not a statement by Bob Dole or anybody on this side of the \naisle. That was a statement by Senator Paul Tsongas, who used to grace \nthe Senate Chamber. He was seated on the other side of the aisle. I \nthink he speaks volumes in just these two statements.\n  Along with Senator Domenici, I was on the House floor yesterday for \nthat historic vote when they adopted the resolution that will put us on \na path for a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n  It was a very exciting moment, and we hope to repeat that moment in \nthe Senate sometime in the early afternoon next Wednesday.\n  We will be here late, late, late Monday night and late, late, late \nTuesday night, so we can finish sometime midafternoon on Wednesday.\n  After the vote in the House yesterday, the President issued a \nstatement, saying, ``There is a right way and a wrong way'' to reduce \nthe deficit, and the House plan was ``The wrong way.''\n  Americans have a right to ask, if the House plan was the ``wrong \nway'' and if the Senate budget resolution is the ``wrong way,'' then \njust what does President Clinton define as the ``right way'' to reduce \nthe deficit?\n  He would not even let us save $10 billion in the rescission package. \nHe threatened to veto that because it does not meet his standards of \nhigher spending.\n  Well, the only evidence we have of what he believes is the right way \nis what he proposed, and that is the question now before us.\n  As Senator Domenici said, he asked if any Democrats wished to offer \nthe President's budget as an amendment and they declined, so he did it \nto make a point. The point is the President does not have a plan, a \ncredible plan. And the point is, the Democrats do not have a credible \nplan.\n  Their plan is to attack Republicans, attack Republicans, attack \nRepublicans--we are out there cutting Medicare; cutting everything to \nhelp the rich. That effort has been tried for years. It is called class \nwarfare. It was tried in 1994--and we liked the results. And maybe it \nwill be tried again in 1996.\n  I assume the President was serious about his budget plan when he \nproposed it. We learned a number of things about what the President \napparently believes is ``right.''\n  The President believes that, as Senator Tsongas said, the status quo \nis right.\n  The President believes it is right to take no action and let the \ndeficit continue, $200 billion a year as far as the eye can see, well \ninto the next century.\n  The President believes it is right to allow entitlement spending to \nconsume 57 percent of total spending by the year 2000.\n  The President believes it is right to ignore his own trustees' \nwarning of the impending bankruptcy of the Medicare Trust Fund, and to \ntake absolutely no action to preserve, improve, and protect Medicare.\n  And, Mr. President, I have a suspicion of something else the \nPresident has proven he believes is right. He said \n[[Page S6964]] yesterday he is ``Eager to work with Congress'' to \nreduce the deficit, and since his budget refused to do that by reducing \nthe growth of Government spending, that can leave only one possible \nanswer: Tax increases; tax increases.\n  Are we going to be told by the President, ``Well, we have to balance \nthe budget. This is the wrong way. The right way is to do what I did in \n1993, have a big, big $255 billion tax increase''? I have not heard any \nother options. We have to conclude something.\n  The only conclusion I can reach is the President does not want to \nbalance the budget, does not want to cut spending, does not want to \npreserve, protect and improve Medicare. So it seems to me we have been \nwaiting now 11 days since we proposed our balanced budget plan. We have \nnot heard a word from anybody on the other side of the aisle. We have \nnot heard a word from the President, and the deficit has increased $4.9 \nbillion since we submitted our balanced budget plan.\n  Is our plan perfect? No, but it is an honest effort to transform \nGovernment to make it smaller, to make it smarter, to make it more \nsensitive, to make it more responsive, to make it less expensive and to \nreverse the 40-year tide of power to the Federal Government.\n  Let me say, we look forward to next week. I guess you could say we \nare prepared to make the tough decisions, the President will not make \nany decision. That is a clear difference in party philosophy: Do not \nmake any decisions, come to the floor and complain about what happens \nto senior citizens, children, veterans, farmers and everybody else, but \ndo not worry about the next generation, do not worry about your \ngrandchildren, do not worry about your young children. It will all be \ntaken care of by red ink, as the Senator from Maine, Senator Snowe, \njust pointed out.\n  It seems to me that if we want status quo policies, I guess we can \nhave those, if the Democrats prevail. But what we need to do right now \nis defeat the President's budget and then have serious debate on the \nbalanced budget proposed by the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, \nSenator Domenici. It is not because it is good political theater, as \nsome have suggested, but I think it is time to do the right thing.\n  I think the President, in his inaugural address, used the word \n``change'' 11 times. Apparently he is out of change. He does not want \nany more change. He wants the status quo: ``Do not cut farm subsidies, \ndo not do this, do not do that, do not cut anything until after I am \nreelected in 1996.''\n  I do not believe that will sell. I believe the American people are \nready--they have been ready for leadership on the budget. We have had a \nlot of leadership on the other side over the years on the budget, and I \nam still hopeful we will still have leadership on the other side on the \ndeficit.\n  We ought to be in this together.

Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes off the bill \nto speak on the budget issue and the defense issue.\n  Mr. President, next week some time, I presume it would be Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle, but I am sure it will be led by some \nSenator from my side of the aisle, we will discuss the issue of \nincreasing the Senate Budget Committee's numbers for defense.\n  I do not want to speak directly to that point, but I want to set the \nstage for my position that I think is very unwise to do that. I will \nwant to say in connection with some of the remarks I am going to say \nthat there is an article in the Washington Post today on the Federal \npage where it refers to Senator Glenn, and I agree totally with Senator \nGlenn.\n  He was holding a hearing on the bad accounting practices of the \nDefense Department. It refers to Senator Glenn this way:\n\n       Glenn, who held hearings this week on the subject, lamented \n     the fact that while his colleagues worry about budgetary \n     restraints, so few of them have been interested in the \n     Pentagon's wasteful financial practices.\n\n  Senator Glenn spoke about the wasteful financial practices. I have \nspoken on that subject many times. I thank Senator Glenn for his \nleadership.\n  I want to take a few moments to express concern abut a new policy \nthat is being pushed by the comptroller at the Department of Defense, \nMr. John Hamre. I think, basically, Mr. Hamre is trying to do a lot of \ngood but he is running into a cement wall on many of the things he is \ntrying to accomplish.\n  His plan undermines the case for pushing up the defense budget. Mr. \nHamre is proposing just to write off--just write off--billions of \ndollars of unmatchable disbursements. Now, unmatchable disbursements \nare expenditures that he says he cannot link to supporting \ndocumentation, so he is really ready to throw in the towel and to write \nthem off the books.\n  The Armed Services Committee held hearings, and I refer to Senator \nGlenn on this and related matters. The defense appropriations \nsubcommittee is going to hold similar hearings next Tuesday.\n  Not being a member of either committee, I am unable to participate in \nthose discussions.\n  But because of my intense interest in the subject, the chairman of \nthe Defense Subcommittee, my good friend Senator Ted Stevens, invited \nme to submit a statement for the record.\n  So, I would now like to share my thoughts on this issue with my \ncolleagues.\n  I think the issue has a direct bearing on the proposal to pump up the \ndefense budget, which will be an issue next week, I think.\n  I am deeply troubled by Mr. Hamre's proposal. [[Page S6965]] \n  Allowing him to write off billions of dollars of unmatchable \ndisbursements would set a dangerous precedent.\n  Allowing him to write off billions of dollars of unmatchable \ndisbursements underscores the continuing lack of effective internal \nfinancial controls at the Defense Department.\n  I fear that there is a near total breakdown of internal controls at \nthe Pentagon, and this leaves the Department's accounts vulnerable to \ntheft and abuse. That really bothers me.\n  One of the most elementary ways to maintain internal control over \nmoney is to match disbursements with obligations.\n  Unfortunately, this very basic financial control device is largely \nignored by disbursing officers at the Pentagon--even though DOD has had \na longstanding policy, specifying that potential payments must be \nmatched with obligations before a payment is made.\n  The extent to which DOD accounts are vulnerable to theft and abuse is \ntruly frightening.\n  The latest figures provided by the General Accounting Office [GAO] \nindicate that DOD has $29 billion in problem disbursements--mostly \nunmatched disbursements. That means DOD does not know how $29 billion \nwas spend. DOD does not know what was bought with the $29 billion. Even \nthough it might be legal, they still do not know exactly where it was \nspent.\n  Until the proper matches are made, those responsible for controlling \nthe money at the Pentagon do not know how the $29 billion was used.\n  They do not know whether the $29 billion in payments were all \nlegitimate.\n  They do not know whether the $29 billion in payments were in the \ncorrect amounts or whether there were underpayments, overpayments, or \neven erroneous payments, for instance, to the wrong persons or \nbusinesses. They do not know whether the payments were fraudulent. They \ndo not know whether money is being stolen.\n  Despite all Mr. Hamre's hard work, and I compliment him for a lot of \nthe work he has done to clean up the mess and fix the problem, the mess \nseems to me to be getting worse by the day.\n  New problems crop up faster than old ones can be resolved.\n  In frustration, Mr. Hamre is now moving toward a solution that I \nconsider dangerous and unprecedented. His proposed solution needs close \nscrutiny.\n  Mr. Hamre wants to write off a substantial number of problem \ndisbursements.\n  Mr. Hamre is now telling Congress that some of the problem \ndisbursements can never be matched. They are unmatchable disbursements, \nin a sense.\n  In some cases, disbursements are unmatchable because all the \nsupporting documentation has been destroyed.\n  The audit trail is cold. It leads nowhere. In other cases, the \ndocumentation is so poor that it would take an inordinate amount of \ntime and money to make the fiscal hookups. It is just too much trouble \nand too costly to make the proper matches. So the answer is just write \nit off.\n  Mr. Hamre also suggests that the inspector general and the general \ncounsel agree that the write-off procedure is the only viable option.\n  Mr. President, if Mr. Hamre asked Congress for authority to write off \n1 or 10 billion dollars' worth of unmatchable disbursements, it would \nnot be so bad--if heads would roll of those responsible for the bad \nmangement. But that does not seem to be the pattern.\n  Writing off billions of dollars of unmatchable disbursements would be \nan insult to the citizens of this country.\n  This money was taken out of the pockets of hard working American \ntaxpayers, and the Pentagon bureaucrats say it is just too much trouble \nto find out how their money was spent.\n  Mr. President, could you imagine how the IRS would treat a citizen \nwho claimed to have no documentation for $100,000 of income? The IRS \nwould say: ``We know you got that money. You pay the tax. Period. End \nof discussion.''\n  But not with the DOD.\n  We should hold the Pentagon bureaucrats to the same standard that the \nIRS holds the taxpayers to. The DOD should have to play by the same \nrules imposed on the taxpayers.\n  We should tell the Pentagon bureaucrats: ``We know you received $10 \nbillion in appropriations. Now, how did you spend it? No more money \nuntil we get the answer.''\n  The taxpayers have the right to know how their money was spent--every \npenny of it. They are entitled to that under the Constitution.\n  Section 9 of the Constitution says that there will be ``a regular \nstatement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public \nmoney published from time to time.''\n  Pentagon bureaucrats cannot fulfill that responsibility today.\n  They cannot give the taxpayers a full and accurate account of how \ntheir money was spent. That is unacceptable and must not be tolerated.\n  Mr. President, if there is no documentation supporting a \ndisbursement, then there is no way to reconcile that account.\n  Under those circumstances, Mr. Hamre's proposed solution is an \nundesirable and an unfortunate necessity. However, we in the Congress \nshould not approve this plan until two stringent conditions are met: \nNo. 1: Those responsible must be held accountable for what has \nhappened; heads must roll.\n  No. 2: A new DOD policy should be put in place that specifies: \nEffective January 1, 1996, all DOD disbursements must be matched with \nobligations and supporting accounting records before a payment is made.\n  We also need to have the answers to two questions before we approve \nMr. Hamre's plan to write off unmatchable disbursements.\n  First, how much money is involved? Nobody knows for sure, but \npreliminary information suggests that the total amount Mr. Hamre would \nlike to write off could easily approach $10 to $12 billion.\n  Second, is it legal to write off disbursements because supporting \ndocumentation is either inadequate or nonexistent.\n  Sections 1501 and 3528 of title 31 of the United States Code, for \nexample, seem to imply that all Government expenditures must be \nsupported by documentary evidence. The legal issues involved need to be \nexamined.\n  The authority to write off unmatchable disbursements should be a one-\ntime event. It must never happen again. Unfortunately, I fear it will \nhappen again, unless we come down hard and impose severe penalties and \nrestrictions. Furthermore, my approach would help to strengthen and \nreinforce section 8137 of the fiscal year 1995 Defense Appropriations \nAct--Public Law 103-335.\n  Mr. President, the people of this country desperately want to trust \ntheir Government. But a Government that does not hold dishonest and \nincompetent officials accountable for their actions will lose the \npublic trust.\n  A failure to hold corrupt officials accountable breeds mistrust and \ninvites more waste and mismanagement.\n  An inability to provide a full and accurate accounting of who $29 \nbillion of the taxpayer's money was spent is mismanagement at its very \nworst.\n  Pentagon bureaucrats have an unblemished track record of mismanaging \nthe peoples' money.\n  They have proven over and over again that they cannot control the \npeoples' money. And they cannot account for how they are spending the \npeoples' money.\n  Some of my colleagues are talking about an amendment to increase \ndefense spending.\n  Now, is it smart to give a bureaucratic institution that cannot \ncontrol and account for the use of public money more public money?\n  Does that show good common sense?\n  DOD should not get any extra money until DOD cleans up the books.\n  I will vigorously oppose any amendments to increase defense spending.\n  More money is not the solution. Better management is.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time \nfor the Republicans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. \nRockefeller] is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I believe the minority leader had \nagreed to yield 1 minute to the Senator from Maine, and also for a \nunanimous-consent request to the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, let me just proceed very briefly. I was \nsomewhat taken by surprise by the Senator from Iowa suggesting we ought \nto look [[Page S6966]] to the IRS as an example of how they can audit \ntheir particular systems. Just a few years ago the IRS came before the \nGovernment Affairs Committee and said it needed more agents because \nthere was $125 billion unaccounted for in uncollected taxes. It turned \nout that many of those uncollected taxes belonged to people who were \ndead, bankrupt, in jail or otherwise unable to pay. The IRS came in \nfinally and fessed up that maybe there was only $60 billion in \nuncollected taxes. But they could not even prove that particular \nfigure. Do you know why? Because the IRS does not have books that can \nbe audited.\n  This is a great irony that should not be lost on the American people. \nImagine how the Internal Revenue Service would treat a small business \nor an individual who made a comparative mistake on their tax return?\n  For the Senator from Iowa to point to the IRS as an example of how we \nshould proceed, I think misses the point entirely. There may be, in \nfact, some explanation for Dr. Hamre's suggestion as to why we ought to \nforego this particular matter, but I think it is premature to condemn \nhis approach without at least having some illumination on the facts.\n  I will try to abide by my 1 minute, but I wanted to make it clear for \nthe record we should not point to the IRS as a model.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask the distinguished Democratic leader to grant \nme 1 minute?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I just wanted to elaborate slightly on the \nimportant statement Senator Cohen made. The Senator from Iowa enjoys \nsavaging the Defense Department in their operations. Mr. Hamre worked \nas one of the most respected members of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee staff. I noted with some interest, in his savaging of the \nDefense Department, the Senator from Iowa had no viable solution to \npropose himself. I would look forward to that. I suggest he have \nanother solution before he condemns that one. To use that as an excuse \nto not support a reasonable level of defense spending to me is \nsophistry at best.\n  I would finally say, it is pretty easy to savage the Defense \nDepartment when you are from a Midwestern State and at the same time \ncome over and defend the 13th swine research center at the cost of some \n$29 million, and $10 million a year to maintain at taxpayers cost, so \nwe can figure out how best hogs can have babies. In my view it borders \non a double standard.\n  I thank the Democratic leader for allowing me that time.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n        Privilege of the Floor--Senate Concurrent Resolution 13\n\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that for the \nduration of consideration of the budget resolution, Kinka Gerke, my \ncongressional fellow who is handling the issue for me, be allowed the \nprivilege of the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1112\n\n (Purpose: To reduce the tax cut and apply the savings to Medicare and \n                               Medicaid)\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller], for \n     himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \n     Wellstone, Ms. Mikulski, and Mrs. Boxer, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1112.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 74, strike lines 12 through 24 and insert the \n     following: ``budget, the spending aggregates shall be revised \n     and other appropriate budgetary allocations, aggregates, and \n     levels shall be revised to reflect up to 59 per cent of the \n     additional deficit reduction achieved as calculated under \n     subsection (c) in budget authority and outlays for \n     legislation that reduces the adverse effects on medicare and \n     medicaid of--\n       ``(1) increased premiums;\n       ``(2) increased deductibles;\n       ``(3) increased copayments;\n       ``(4) limits on the freedom to select the doctor of one's \n     choice;\n       ``(5) reduced quality of health care services caused by \n     funding reductions for health care providers;\n       ``(6) reduced or eliminated benefits caused by restrictions \n     on eligibility or services; or\n       ``(7) closure of hospitals or nursing homes, or other harms \n     to health care providers.\n       ``(b) Revised Allocations and Aggregates.--Upon the \n     reporting of legislation pursuant to subsection (a), again \n     upon the submission of a conference report on such \n     legislation (if a conference report is submitted), the Chair \n     of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate shall submit to \n     the Senate appropriately revised allocations under sections \n     302(a) and 602(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, \n     budgetary aggregates, and levels under this resolution, \n     revised by an amount that does not exceed 59 per cent of the \n     additional deficit reduction specified under subsection \n     (d).''.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, now that we have had what we consider to \nbe the first political vote, I hope we will have the opportunity to \nthoroughly debate what we consider to be not only political questions \nbut the very important substance.\n  Let me emphasis what this debate is not about. It is not about the \nbalanced budget because I think people on both sides of the aisle feel \nstrongly that indeed we need a balanced budget.\n  It is not about whether we must make tough choices. Indeed, we must \nmake tough choices.\n  It is not about agreeing on a time certain. I believe the year 2002 \nis a valid date.\n  This debate is about how we spend the limited resources we have \nbetween now and the year 2002; about where this country ought to invest \nits money.\n  This year the budget process has proceeded with virtually no \nconsultation between Democrats and Republicans. For all the talk of \nbipartisanship, there was none when this resolution was drawn.\n  Not surprisingly, the committee has produced a budget resolution that \nis extreme, unreasonable, unfair, and unacceptable.\n  The closer one looks, the worse it gets. It is evident that the \npriorities that it reflects do not reflect the priorities of the \nAmerican people, or the fairness the American people expect.\n  It is wrong to begin with a tax giveaway to the wealthiest people in \nthis country. It is doubly wrong to help finance it with a tax hike on \nthe lowest income working people in the country.\n  To impose a tax hike on those earning the lowest incomes in order to \nhelp pay for a tax break for the wealthiest Americans turns common \nsense and fairness on its head. It is not just wrong. It is perverse. \nIt directly contradicts all the pro-work, anti-welfare rhetoric \nextolled by so many. It sends exactly the wrong signal to Americans.\n  Instead of saying work pays, it undercuts the value of the work ethic \nfor all working Americans, not just those who are eligible for the \ncredit. The signal here is not to welfare families to shape up and get \non a payroll. The signal here is to the well-off and the well-\nconnected. This budget tells them they will get their tax cut. It tells \nworking people they are out of luck.\n  We have had too many Republican so-called tax cuts that turn out to \nbe a tax increase or a tax wash for working people and a big tax break \nfor those at the top.\n  Americans are waking up to the hidden promise in a Republican tax \ncut. They are learning that it is a promise as believable as the check \nis in the mail.\n  Senate Democrats believe there are important priorities that are not \nreflected in this budget at all. Those priorities are education, health \ncare, and the needs of working people.\n  This budget resolution cuts education, slashes health care for \nseniors, and discourages work for low-income people. It is an extreme \nset of priorities. It undermines the very things that give people hope \nand security in order to finance another trickle-down tax cut.\n  Democrats say at least these three things should be corrected. If \nthey can be corrected, we can produce a sound, workable, bipartisan \nbudget that we must have ultimately--a budget that will be put into \neffect, backed by legislation that will make the necessary changes, and \na budget that will produce the long-promised balance in the years \nahead. [[Page S6967]] \n  First, and the direct attention of this particular amendment. \nMedicare and Medicaid savings must come in the context of broad health \ncare reform. Anything else is just a guarantee that costs will be \nshifted to the private sector.\n  Second, working people should not see a tax hike, by whatever name, \nwhen their wages barely raise them above the poverty level. We should \nbe encouraging work over welfare, not penalizing it. Work should pay.\n  Third, this is precisely the wrong time to make education more \nexpensive and further beyond reach for the children of middle-class \nfamilies.\n  All three of these priorities can be protected and should be \nprotected.\n  But first, there must be bipartisan agreement that we do not need to \ncreate new tax loopholes. Our purpose ought to be to reach a balanced \nbudget, not to fulfil the tax wish list of our richest corporate and \nprivate taxpayers.\n  About half the budget savings in the Republican budget come from \nMedicare and Medicaid.\n  It is good that finally, after resisting health care reform last year \nin any form, after resisting even incremental reform, after repeatedly \nopposing anything remotely like a reduction in costs, Republicans have \nadmitted, in this resolution, that health care costs are driving the \nFederal budget.\n  But it is bad that they have chosen to deal with this reality--a fact \nDemocrats have been pointing out for at least 3 years--by simply \ncapping spending and shifting costs to beneficiaries.\n  I agree with what Senator Dole said last year, ``* * * if you only \nspend so much money on health care and you run out of money, you either \nhave to ration or raise taxes, or find some way to find more money.''\n  So what is the Republican answer to health care? Impose a cap on \nMedicaid and shift the whole burden back on the States. That is the \nproposal. That means that when it is time to ration or raise taxes or \nfind more money, it will be the States that will be forced to do it.\n  The budget proposal to reduce Medicaid costs by $176 billion will not \nonly burden the taxpayers of our States, it will threaten coverage for \nmore than 800,000 low-income elderly and disabled people. Medicaid is \nthe only source of assistance for the frail elderly who need long-term \nnursing home care and who do not have the $38,000 a year that such care \ntypically costs.\n  Medicaid now provides for 1.6 million persons in nursing homes, and \nnearly 1.1 million receiving home health care. Those funds are not \nlikely to be made up by the States, because the States are hard-pressed \nto meet their current Medicaid costs.\n  Instead of seeking to control costs in the system--the only way to \nultimately slow health care spending--the Republican budget would shift \ncosts.\n  The Republican budget proposes a precise Medicare savings figure--\n$256 billion--without an iota of detail as to how it is to be achieved.\n  There is no way to save $256 billion and cover more people--as \nMedicare must, since our population is aging and more people become \neligible for Medicare each year--without shifting costs to others.\n  Those others will be Medicare beneficiaries themselves. This proposal \nwould mean dramatically higher costs, fewer benefits and a worsening \nquality of care.\n  The Republican Medicare reductions are the largest Medicare cut in \nhistory. At least half the burden of those cuts will fall on \nrecipients.\n  The chairman of the committee that approved this reduction has \nalready endorsed the idea of increasing the part B Medicare premium to \n31 percent of the program's costs. That, alone, will mean nearly $500 \nin additional out-of-pocket costs to Medicare recipients by 2002.\n  It has been calculated that those on Medicare will see a cut of $900 \nin benefits by the year 2002. The $256 billion in savings will be paid \nfor by them--to the tune of $3,500 each between now and then.\n  The budget resolution does not spell out where the so-called savings \nwill come from. But, coincidentally, the savings raise the same amount \nof money as all the CBO proposals for savings already compiled. So, \ntaking those as a benchmark, we can see the outlines of what will be \ncut and who will pay for it.\n  Nearly 83 percent of Medicare benefits go to persons with incomes of \n$25,000 or less. Only 3 percent of Medicare costs are paid in behalf of \npersons with incomes over $50,000. So whatever additional costs there \nare, they will be borne disproportionately by those with the least \nability to pay.\n  The net effect of this is simple: Extra Medicare costs will eat up \nSocial Security cost-of-living increases. The Republican promise to \nprotect Social Security is hollow. One in four Social Security \nrecipients rely exclusively on Social Security benefits for income. For \nthese people--among the lowest-income of our retirees--there will be no \nmore COLA's, because they will all be swallowed up by rising out-of-\npocket Medicare payments.,\n  The effects of cost-shifting in health care have been long studied \nand are well known. When providers like hospitals and physicians see \nrepayments from one source cut, costs are shifted to those who will \npay--privately insured individuals. If even one-third of the proposed \nMedicare reductions are passed along to privately insured payers, it \nwill amount to a hidden tax of $40 to $50 billion on businesses and \nfamilies in the next 7 years.\n  Instead of reforming the system to control costs, it would be the \nsame old shell game of cost-shuffling, only on a much larger scale.\n  It is wrong to threaten the health care security of retired Americans \nto finance a tax cut for the wealthiest corporations and individuals. \nIt is wrong to slash at the health care safety net of the low-income \nelderly and disabled to finance a tax cut that will restore some of the \nmost egregious corporate loopholes of the 1980's.\n  The Republican budget does more than that. In a stunning display of \nindifference to real hardship in American families, the Republican \nbudget would cut $21 billion out of the earned income tax credit.\n  The earned income tax credit does not go to anyone who does not work. \nIt goes only to those who are doing their best to stay off welfare by \nworking at whatever job they can find, and by earning whatever an \nemployer is willing to pay. It is perverse to tell a woman to get off \nwelfare and work and then to turn around and reduce the one work \nincentive program that actually helps work pay.\n  It is contrary to common sense to dramatically cut back an incentive \nto work so that we can afford to give a tax cut to some of the most \nwell-off households and businesses in the country.\n  The Republican budget also cuts educational funding by $60 billion. \nStudent aid alone is slashed by $14 billion. Under the Republican \nbudget, students will have to pay higher loan origination fees and \nhigher interest rates 6 months after they graduate. They will graduate \nwith a degree and a heavier debt load because the in-school interest \nsubsidy will be cut.\n  Who uses the student loan program? Not the children of the wealthy, \nwhose parents can afford to pay yearly tuition costs. It is the \nchildren of middle-income working families who rely on loan assistance \nto get the higher education in the first place.\n  Today, more than ever, how much education a person has dictates the \nstandard of living he or she will enjoy throughout life. Every extra \nyear of schooling adds an average of 8 percent to one's income \nthroughout life.\n  Equally important is that economic growth depends upon better \neducation in our work force. A recent study found that increases in \nworkers' education produced twice the productivity growth as investment \nin new equipment.\n  A survey of over 3,000 private companies employing 20 or more workers \nfound that a 10-percent increase in workers' education led to an \naverage 8.6-percent rise in productivity; a 10-percent increase in \ncapital stock--equipment, buildings, and machinery--led to a 3.4-\npercent rise in productivity.\n  Anyone who cares about the future economic growth of our country \nknows that as American companies become more productive, they compete \nbetter and find more markets. Anything that helps our firms compete \nsuccessfully in a global economy ought to be supported and encouraged, \nnot cut back.\n  Yet, that is exactly what the Republican budget does. It cuts \neducation by $60 billion over the next 7 years, potentially cutting out \nan enormous promise [[Page S6968]] of higher productivity and economic \ngrowth for our private sector.\n  It is wrong to reduce our Nation's commitment to education by the \nequivalent of 25 percent when education is more critical now than it \nhas ever been before. It is wrong to reduce our commitment to a better \nstandard of living for our children in order to finance a tax cut for \nthose who already enjoy high living standards.\n  It is wrong to cut back on the door to opportunity in our society. It \nis the wrong priority.\n  Despite assertions that the Republican budget would go after \ncorporate welfare, there is not a single corporate welfare cut in this \nbudget resolution.\n  Instead, we are being asked to squeeze Medicare recipients, to burden \nnew graduates with an extra $3,000 or so in debt, and deny the lowest-\npaid, hardest-working Americans a tax credit. Republicans cannot find \ncorporate welfare so these are the priority cuts they have aimed at \ninstead. I do not think that reflects American values or American \npriorities, Mr. President.\n  Senate Democrats will respond to these misguided priorities in this \nbudget resolution with a series of amendments designed to correct them.\n  Our amendments will preserve the goal of balancing the budget by the \nyear 2002.\n  Each of our amendments will be fully paid for. Saving Medicare and \nstudent aid will not add a penny to the budget deficit. Our amendments \nwill use the different offsets to preserve the priorities that we think \nare important because we agree that it is necessary to make the choices \nin order to balance the budget.\n  We just think that a tax cut is exactly the wrong choice. We think \nthat the budget ought to reflect the priorities of working Americans. \nWe believe our amendments reflect those priorities and deserve broad \nsupport. And beginning with this amendment, we hope Republicans will \njoin us in coming to a better set of priorities, a more realistic set \nof assumptions, and a clear message to the American people that we are \non their side.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am going to yield to the Senator very shortly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Then I am going to put Senator Packwood in charge of \nthe time after Senator Gregg speaks. I just want to put up one \nstatement on Medicare and Medicaid, and then I will yield to the \nSenator for the time he needs and then Senator Packwood for a \nreasonable amount of time. He will be in charge; I designate him to \ncontrol time on our side.\n  I just want to quote this one statement for the Senate, for those \ninterested in where we are, by talking about what the President said on \nOctober 5, 1993. And these are quotes. And I will just read them. That \nis October 5, 1993.\n\n       Today, Medicaid and Medicare are going up at three times \n     the rate of inflation. We propose to let it go up at two \n     times the rate of inflation.\n\n  And now these are the very interesting words.\n\n       That is not a Medicare or Medicaid cut. Only in Washington \n     do people believe that no one can get by on twice the rate of \n     inflation.\n\n  And I have a little parenthesis; there was a laugh in the crowd.\n\n       So, when you hear all this business about cuts, let me \n     caution you that that is not what is going on. We are going \n     to have increases in Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n  Now, essentially, Mr. President, and fellow Senators and those \ninterested, the President of the United States and some on the other \nside of the aisle are today, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday going to be \nsaying this budget cuts Medicare and Medicaid. Right? In yellow on this \none:\n\n       That is not a Medicare or Medicaid cut.\n\n  Medicare is going up 7.1 percent in this budget.\n\n       That is not a Medicare or Medicaid cut.\n\n  Quote Domenici? No. Quote President Bill Clinton.\n  Now, frankly, I anticipate there will be arguments about he had a \ncomprehensive health care plan. The truth of the matter is the \nPresident reduced Medicare $180 billion and spent it some place else \nand yet proceeded to say:\n\n       That is not a Medicare or Medicaid cut.\n\n  Now, frankly, that frames the debate. The President said it better \nthan we can. That is a perfect statement of what the American people \nwere expected by our President to believe on October 5, 1993. And I \nbelieve that is the same statement they ought to believe today, even if \nthose on the other side of the aisle and the White House choose to say \nit no longer. Because it is ours, it is our proposal, it is not to be \nsaid any longer. I do not believe that is the case.\n  Now, with that, we have a number of Senators who wanted to address \nthis issue. We are under controlled time, an hour on each side on the \namendment. Clearly, we are going to use more time than that. I am going \nto yield now --15 minutes, 20 minutes, 5 minutes?\n  Mr. GREGG. A half-hour.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, ordinarily \none goes back and forth between the two sides, and are we planning to \ndo something different today?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are going to do something different if the Senator \nis going to assume that those brief remarks are the Republican response \nto the minority leader. We have not answered the minority leader. \nSenator Gregg is going to start answering him. And then we will go to \nthe Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The comments of the Senator from New Mexico were \nkind of incidental?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mine were incidental, very irrelevant, trivial.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time would the Senator like?\n  Mr. GREGG. A half-hour.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All right. And then Senator Packwood is in charge of \nthe time on our side. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  I wish to simply congratulate him on his excellent brief and \nincidental statement because I think it summarizes a lot of the concern \nthat many of us have as to the duplicity of this administration on the \nissue of Medicare and how we should address it. And I wish to get into \nthat in some depth.\n  Initially, I simply must respond to much of what the Democratic \nleader said, or some of what the Democratic leader said because I found \nit to be inconsistent in the extreme for him to come to the floor and \nmake the statement, as a number of his colleagues have said, that, oh, \nwe all now believe in a balanced budget. We all believe in a balanced \nbudget. And, yes, we are even willing to accept the year 2002.\n  We have heard this from a number of Members on the other side. But at \nthe same time he gives us a litany, a litany of areas where we can take \nno action, of areas where we must spend more money.\n  He gives us no suggestions as to how they would get to this balanced \nbudget. There is no program from that side. There is no budget. There \nis no proposal. All we had was the President's proposal and the \nPresident's proposal, as we now recognize, has been rejected by \neveryone in this Chamber who voted, the 99 Senators who were present.\n  The President's proposal was rejected because, on its face, it was \noutrageous. It presented a budget which would have given us deficits of \n$200 billion or more for as far as the eye can see. It would have added \n$1.8 trillion of new debt to our children's backs over the next years. \nAnd it did not in the slightest way even address the core issues of \nwhat are confronting this country in the area of fiscal policy, which \nare the issues of how we manage Federal spending in the area of the \nentitlement accounts. It did not have one suggestion in the entire \nbudget on that issue, even though some of the leaders in his \nadministration have said that that is the core concern and even though \nhe, 2 years ago now or a year and a half ago, said that that was a \nmajor concern, as the statement from Senator Domenici so adequately \nreflected.\n  So I think it is critical for those who are following this debate to \nunderstand the inherent and incontrovertible inconsistency of the \nDemocratic leader's [[Page S6969]] statement--that they are for a \nbalanced budget, but do not touch anything that is important, do not \ntouch anything that we deem to be critical, do not try to reform a \nsystem which is so out of control that it has generated this huge \ndeficit and debt that is bankrupting our country.\n  And if we are talking about a commitment to a better standard of \nliving for our children, nothing could be more critical to a commitment \nto a better standard of living for our children than to bring under the \ncontrol the debt of this country and the deficit.\n  I brought along a chart to reflect that fact. This is the critical \nissue of this debate. This is why we, as Republicans, have brought \nforth a budget which is in balance. It is because if you look at what \nis going to happen to the Federal Government in the spending we are \nundertaking, we are on a nosedive to bankruptcy, which we are going to \nend up passing on to our children.\n  The blue squares represent discretionary spending, the yellow squares \nrepresent interest payments, and the red squares represent spending on \nentitlements. The green line is the revenues of the Federal Government, \nwhich have been fairly constant over the last few years.\n  If you notice--and these are numbers which come from CBO--if you will \nnotice, beginning in about the year 2010, our Federal Government, \nbecause of the explosion in spending we have undertaken as a \nGovernment, will only be able to pay for entitlement spending and \ninterest on the Federal debt. That means all the discretionary spending \nwill not be affordable--things like national defense, libraries, roads, \neducation, things the minority leader was talking about, things which \nwe are concerned about.\n  Then around the year 2015, we will not be able to pay interest on the \nFederal debt. What does that mean? That means we are bankrupt; that we, \nas a nation, are insolvent. That means our children will be living in a \ncountry like our unfortunate neighbor of Mexico, which does not have \nthe capacity to pay for the cost of the burden for carrying its own \ndebt.\n  What happens at that point? Well, our children's futures become \ndestroyed because the country will either have to go through some huge \neconomic calamity or else it will have to inflate the economy so much \nthat the dollar will be virtually valueless.\n  So we, as Republicans, recognize this. We accept the fact that \nsomething has to be done about this, and we have put forward a budget \nwhich gets us to balance over the next 7 years.\n  This is our budget line, the black line. It goes to balance over the \nnext 7 years.\n  This is the President's line, the purple line, estimated by CBO. This \nis what he told us it was, but he would not use CBO figures, even \nthough he said he was going to. Even as he told us, we still have a \nhuge gap, $1.8 trillion of new debt added to our children's backs as a \nresult of the President's proposal.\n  But if we get on the course of this budget, we will get this under \ncontrol and we will have us down to balance in 7 years, which is the \nobligation that we owe our children.\n  And there is something else that should be noted. When we get out to \nthis point here, get out to this point here, there is, of course, \nanother way that you could address all this Federal spending. You could \ntax people.\n  What does the President's budget--not of this year, because he did \nnot want to put this number in--but of last year tell us the tax rate \non all Americans would be in order to bear a Government of this size? \nIt would be 82 percent; 82 percent of everybody's income in this \ncountry would have to go to the Government in order to bear the burden \nof the Government if we allow it to continue to grow at that rate. \nObviously, we cannot afford that.\n  Now, a large part of this debate has been about the issue of \nMedicare. And, boy, there has been some significant misinformation \nabout that issue floated around here. And I am glad the Senator from \nNew Mexico started out by pointing out the distinct difference between \nwhat President Clinton said a year and a half ago and what he is saying \ntoday about the Republican efforts in this area.\n  But I think it is important to start on this issue with what the \nproblem is. The problem is pretty clear. It was not defined by us. It \nwas not defined by myself or the Republicans, or the Democrats, for \nthat matter. It was defined by the trustees of the Medicare trust fund, \nironically, four of whom were appointed by the President of the United \nStates and are members of his Cabinet, including Donna Shalala, \nSecretary of HHS, and Secretary Rubin.\n  And the problem is that the Medicare trust fund is going bankrupt on \na much faster time track than the country, in fact, and it will be \nbankrupt, according to the trustees in the very near future. They are \ntelling us--and this is the trustees' report--that ``the Medicare \nprogram is clearly unstable unsustainable in its present form.''\n  Why are they saying that? Because of this chart here.\n  This is the fund of the Medicare trust fund. It goes into bankruptcy \nin the year 2002. Beginning in about next year, it starts to draw more \nout of the trust fund than goes in.\n  What is the practical effect of bankruptcy of the Medicare insurance \ntrust fund? It is that there is no health insurance for our senior \ncitizens. None. Because, under the law, they cannot pay out health \ninsurance proceeds if they have no sources to pay it from. And the \ntrust becomes bankrupt and does not have any sources in the year 2002.\n  Now I suppose the Democratic position or the President's position now \nappears to be, ``Well, let's wait until the year 2002 and face the \nproblem then.''\n  That only compounds the problem if you do that, of course. It is much \nmore logical, as the President suggested a year and a half ago, to \naddress it and address it in a constructive and thoughtful way, which \nis the proposal we have put forward in this budget specifically to do \nthat.\n  Now there has been a lot of debate about the number necessary to get \nthis trust fund into actuarial solvency, and the fact that this number \nthat we have in our budget is somehow outrageous, the number of $256 \nbillion of adjustment in this fund over the next 7 years, which is the \nnumber that we feel will put this fund in some form of solvency and \nassure that seniors have health insurance, which is our goal, to give \nseniors health insurance and make sure they have a health insurance \nfund.\n  Now we heard the leader come down here and say that this idea of \naddressing the insurance trust fund by adjusting it by $256 billion \nover the next 10 years, or Medicare by that amount, is a number that is \njust outrageous and not obtainable and is a ridiculous number.\n  Well, let me refer them to the number that came from Secretary Donna \nShalala and Secretary Rubin and the other members of the trustees of \nthe Medicare trust fund. Their number was, in order to get actuarial \nsolvency in the health trust fund over the next 5 years, we would have \nto adjust it by $262 billion. That is in 2 years. Remember, ours is 7 \nyears. And, over 7 years, to get actuarial solvency, we would have to \nadjust it by $387 billion.\n  So the number that we are talking about, which is $256 billion, \napproximately, over a 7-year period, is clearly in the ballpark of the \nnumbers which are being given to us by the people who are responsible \nfor managing this fund, although there is obviously a merger of A and B \ntrust fund issues, which is a really complex issue.\n In any event, the numbers are clearly in the same ball park.\n\n  So the idea that our adjustment is unreasonable or our proposal is \nunreasonable in this area is just a lot more smoke and mirrors that we \nare hearing from the other side as they attempt to dance around the \nbasic responsibility that we have, which is to assure solvency in this \ntrust fund.\n  So Members on our side have put forward a proposal which, remember, \ndoes not cut Medicare funding. In fact, it allows Medicare funding, as \nSenator Domenici noted earlier, to grow at about 7 percent. This shows \n6 percent. We actually ended up with about 7 percent. Today, the \nMedicare trust funds are growing--the rate of growth of the cost of \nhealth care costs is around 10.5 percent. That is three times the rate \nof growth of inflation in this country today.\n  You might say, ``It's health care; therefore, it has to grow faster \nthan inflation.'' Let me simply note that last year in the private \nsector, the health care inflation rate was actually a negative number. \nIt was about negative 1.9 [[Page S6970]] percent for the rate of growth \nof premium costs in health care last year in the private sector. So not \nonly is it three times faster than the basic inflation rate in the \neconomy, 10.5 percent, the rate of growth of Medicare costs, but it is \nactually 10 times the rate of growth of health care inflation generally \nin the private sector.\n  So it is explosive, and it is clearly not sustainable. It is not \nsustainable from the standpoint of financial viability of our country. \nMore important, it is not sustainable from the viewpoint of having a \ntrust fund that is solvent and having a health care system for our \nseniors that is solvent.\n  What we are suggesting is not radical or unreasonable. We are \nsuggesting a response which was in the same frame of reference as what \nthe trustees are talking about. We are talking about slowing the rate \nof growth of the Medicare trust funds from 10.5 percent down to \napproximately 7 percent--7 percent rate of growth. Is that \nunreasonable? I do not think so. It represents twice the rate of growth \nof inflation generally and seven times the rate of growth in health \ncare insurance premiums in the private sector.\n  As was noted by the chart put up by Senator Domenici, it happens to \nbe the same number that back in 1993 President Clinton thought was \npretty reasonable. Not only did he think it was reasonable, but Hillary \nClinton, his wife, thought it was fairly reasonable. She said:\n\n       We feel confident we can reduce the rate of increase in \n     Medicare without undermining the quality of Medicare \n     recipients.\n\n  And Ira Magaziner, her guru of health care, said:\n\n       Slowing the rate of growth actually benefits beneficiaries \n     considerably because it slows the rate of growth of premiums \n     they have to pay.\n\n  So the administration, a year and a half ago, when they were not \nthinking about reelection so aggressively, was talking about slowing \nthe rate of growth of the health care fund, just about what we were \ntalking about today. Maybe they were going to slow it a little more, in \nfact, if you look at their numbers.\n  So what is the practical application of how do you get to a 7-percent \nrate of growth, because that is where the rubber hits the road. Who is \ngoing to be impacted? Who is going to be affected? Who is going to have \nto take the slowing down?\n  Basically, what we have seen in the private sector is that as the \nmarketplace is changed and health care delivery has moved into the \n1990's and on, that the manner in which health care is delivered has \nchanged and, as a result, we have seen more efficiencies in health care \ndelivery, and that is why the price of health care has gone down, that \nis why we have seen the inflation rate in the private sector drop.\n  What we are going to suggest as a party, and we think it is fairly \nreasonable, is that we take the public health care insurance system and \napply to it some of the same attitudes and approaches that are being \nused today in the private sector. We are essentially going to say to \nsenior citizens, ``We're going to give you more choices,'' because that \nis what has driven the price of health care down in the private \nsector--competition, choices--and in giving seniors more choices, we \nare going to not force them into other programs, we will make it \nvoluntary.\n  For example, I have a proposal--it may not be the one finally \nadopted, but I think it makes sense--which says to senior citizens: \n``You essentially will have the same choices that I, as a Member of \nCongress have, or other Federal employees have. You don't have that \nchoice today.''\n  Most seniors are in fee for service, the most expensive form of \nhealth care. They are in fee for service because they grew up that way \nin the fifties, sixties, even in the seventies. The only way we \ndelivered health care in this country was fee for service. You had your \ndoctor, you dealt with your personal doctor, but it is the most \nexpensive form of medicine. Ninety percent of seniors are in a fee-for-\nservice approach to medicine.\n  What I suggest in the proposal I have put forward, basically the \nproposal we are talking about generally, is that seniors be given a \nchoice, not only to use fee for service, but to use other forms of \nhealth care, health care which is less costly in its rate of growth but \ndelivers just as good health care--managed care, fixed-cost care, \nPPO's, HMO's, things that most Americans, especially in the private \nsector, are familiar with today.\n  We are not saying to seniors, ``You have to go into a PPO or HMO.'' \nWe are going to say, ``Listen, if in your area of the country it costs \n$5,000 a year to take care of your fee-for-service health care, then, \nsenior citizen, to the extent that you can go out in the private sector \nand you can buy a health care system which delivers you the same basic \nbenefits package, and maybe even more because there will be competition \nthere, but for less, let's say it is for $4,500, we will let you keep \n75 percent of the savings. Seventy-five percent of that $500 savings \nwill go to you.''\n  So there will be a significant economic incentive to senior citizens \nto move from fee for service into managed care, if they decide to do \nso--they do not have to do it--if they decide to do so.\n  That type of approach creates three different positive events.\n  No. 1, it gives senior citizens the opportunity to look at other \nhealth care plans and gives them a financial incentive to do it and, \nobviously, health care incentives to do it.\n  No. 2, it creates in the marketplace competition. It means a lot of \ndifferent plans are going to come forward that we cannot even imagine, \nbecause the marketplace is much more imaginative than the Government, \nand we will propose different approaches to caring for seniors, things \nthat are attractive to one senior group over other seniors--one for \neyeglasses, for drugs, one might take out the part B premium. Who \nknows; there will be a lot of variables, a lot of options.\n  And No. 3, it gives the Federal Government a fixed cost over an \nextended period of time as to how much health care is going to inflate.\n  It is only reasonable to assume, although obviously difficult to \nscore, that that fixed cost is going to track fairly closely to what \nhas happened in the private sector. In the private sector, what we have \nseen is there has been a 50-percent drop in the inflation rate in \nrelationship to the amount of people going into HMO's and fixed-cost-\nbased health care plans, and we may not get that precipitous a drop, \nbut we do not have to, because all we are looking for is a 3-percent \ndrop in the inflation rate.\n  We are not looking to reduce the inflation rate down to zero, as has \nhappened in the private sector. We are looking to reduce it just twice \nthe rate of growth of the inflation rate, a 7-percent rate. It is very \nreasonable that we will get that number. There are ways to assure we \ncan score that number, and we make those proposals in our package.\n  So what we are talking about is not limiting seniors' opportunities, \nwe are talking about giving them more choices, more chances to go to \nthe marketplace and find better care, types of care that will be more \nattractive to them and more appropriate to their personal position. In \nthe process, we hope to get these types of reductions in the inflation \nrate that the Federal Government is paying.\n  Is this not reasonable? I suggest to you that the President thought \nit was reasonable a year and a half ago; that Ira Magaziner thought it \nwas reasonable a year and a half ago; that Hillary Clinton thought it \nwas reasonable a year and a half ago.\n  What has happened? The argument is, ``Well, this isn't part of a \ncomprehensive health care reform.'' I remember comprehensive health \ncare, and I am sure you do, too. That is this chart here where the \nFederal Government comes in and takes over the private sector. I do not \nthink we have to do this in order to get Medicare's inflation rate down \nto twice the rate of inflation in the private sector.\n  I do not think we need to have comprehensive health care reform, and \nI think that has been shown by a number of factors.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. At the end of my statement, I will be happy to yield for a \nquestion.\n  The point is that Medicare is a system which is out of kilter, and \nthat if you want to move it into a system that is in the 21st century \ninstead of in the 1960's--which is where it is now--you \n[[Page S6971]] do not need to take over the private sector to do that. \nIt is the public sector that is failing to keep the costs under \ncontrol, not the private sector.\n  The idea that we need to nationalize the private health care system \nin order to get to a correction of the Medicare and Medicaid system is \nridiculous. The President has, in fact, acknowledged that. Secretary \nShalala, before the Budget Committee, said they were no longer \nperceiving that they needed comprehensive health care reform in order \nto get Medicare reform. They expected to have targeted--I presume they \nmeant insurance market reform, which we will probably have down the \nroad. All of that can be accomplished, of course, and Medicare reform \ncan be accomplished at the same time.\n  So we, as Republicans, are not proposing the devastation of the \nMedicare system. In fact, we are proposing just the opposite. This \nchart reflects what the trustees have told us, which is that the \nMedicare system is going to be bankrupt in 7 years, that there will be \nno system. That has to be corrected, and the senior citizens of this \ncountry will be given a system which is solvent. We have done it with a \nbudget that happens to get in balance at the same time.\n  Is that inconsistent or ironic? No. Statements like the minority \nleader made may be inconsistent or ironic. But it is fairly logical \nthat if one of the primary reasons you are spending more than you are \ntaking in is that you have a Medicare system on the verge of \nbankruptcy, when you correct that system and get that self-righted, at \nthe same time you are going to assist in getting your budget under \ncontrol, which is exactly what we end up doing--getting the budget \nunder control--and the Medicare effort is part of that exercise. And in \nthe process, we make the Medicare system solvent.\n  What is it all about in the end? Very simply, it is about making sure \nthat when our children get to the year 2015, when we pass on to them \nthis great and wonderful Nation, that at that point, they have a Nation \nwhose Government is not in bankruptcy; that they have a Nation which is \nable to sustain their prosperity the way it was able to sustain our \nprosperity. If we do not do that--by that, I mean the Bill Clinton \npostwar baby boom generation, of which I happen to be a member--we will \nend up being the first generation in the history of this great country \nthat has passed less on to our children than was given to us by our \nparents. That is not right and it is not fair.\n  We were sent here to do a job and that was to straighten out the \nfiscal house of this country. This budget does that job. And in doing \nthat, it also addresses the fiscal house of the Medicare insurance \nsystem, which is equally destitute and insolvent.\n  Therefore, I strongly urge the Senate to reject the amendment which \nhas been proposed by the Senator from South Dakota.\n  I will be happy to yield, if I have any time left, to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has approximately 8 minutes left.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I will just proceed with my \nstatement, and I thank the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the rest of my time back to the manager of the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. The Senator \nfrom New Hampshire had a certain amount of time because he was granted \nthat by Senator Domenici. But other than that, there is no control of \ntime, is there? In other words, time is controlled here, 6 hours on one \nside and 6 hours on this side, but not any automatic amount of time for \neach speaker?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is being yielded off the resolution. \nThere is no consent agreement that has been entered into.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. As for individual Senators?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Chair.\n  The amendment that I sent up on behalf of Senator Lautenberg and \nmyself, and other Senators, was not explained because the reading of it \nwas cut off. So I thought I would just give a very quick explanation of \nwhat the amendment does.\n  The Republican Senate budget resolution sets up a $170 billion \nreserve fund for cuts. The Republican budget makes room for even \nfurther tax cuts, in fact, beyond the $170 billion if they are financed \nwith spending cuts. That is in the resolution. Under the budget \nresolution, Medicare, which is our subject of this day, would be cut by \n$256 billion. Medicaid would be cut by $175 billion over a period of 7 \nyears. The Rockefeller-Lautenberg amendment simply would restore, of \nthe $170 billion reserved, $100 billion now reserved for tax cuts, and \nit would put that money back into Medicare and Medicaid. That is the \nentire purpose of the amendment, and I want my colleagues on both sides \nto know that.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to note several points. Over the past few \nweeks, many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been \ntrying to portray their intention to cut Medicare benefits as necessary \nto save the Medicare Program. They point to the projected insolvency of \nthe Medicare hospital trust fund in 7 years and say that immediate \naction is necessary to maintain its solvency. They are working to save \nthe Medicare Program, not to dismantle it. That is the way the logic is \npresented.\n  Frankly, I question their motives. I had heard nary a word about the \nMedicare crisis from my colleagues until very, very recently. But \nshort-term solvency of the Medicare hospital trust fund is not a new \nfinding that was just discovered this year. The Medicare trustees \nsounded the alarm, in fact, about the short-term insolvency of the \nMedicare Program several years ago.\n  For the past few years, the Medicare trustees have urged action on \nsomething called comprehensive health care reform. They have urged that \nwe do comprehensive health care reform to address our country's overall \nsystemic problem of rising health care costs that are, in turn, \ndraining the hospital trust fund and the pockets of American families \nand businesses.\n  In fact, the chart that the distinguished senior Senator from New \nMexico had giving a quote of President Clinton was said within the \ncontext of doing comprehensive health care reform in which a whole \nvariety of circumstances would come into play; and it was not just \nabout cutting Medicare and Medicaid, it was about changing the entire \nsystem. And they have selected out a sentence which fits their current \nargument. But it does not fit the current argument, in fact, because it \nwas about a comprehensive health care reform approach that he was \ntaking at that time--and he was not successful, as the Presiding \nOfficer and the American people well know.\n  As my colleagues know full well, President Clinton responded to the \nwarnings and to the alarms by putting a comprehensive health care plan \non the table for congressional consideration. Now, one can argue that \nit did not get very far. One can argue that nothing happened at all. I \nwould argue that it was dead on arrival, because the interest groups \nthat did not want to see it succeed had a several month lead on \ntelevision in terms of discrediting the program and talking about it as \nsocialism and a Government takeover. The Government takeover argument \nis the one I particularly love. When people use that argument, I take \nout my Government takeover card.\n  I belong to the largest Government program in the country. But, this \nis a Blue Cross/Blue Shield card. Senator Packwood, who is pacing the \naisles on the other side, probably carries the same piece of plastic.\n  The last I heard, Blue Cross/Blue Shield is a private company.\n  In any event, the health legislation did not get anywhere because it \nwas buried under a cloud of Harry and Louise ads and a lot of money. It \nwas very sad, in fact, I think, because a lot of the problems we are \nnow facing are because of the failure of this body to address \ncomprehensive health care.\n  The President's plan not only addressed rising health care costs in \nthe Medicare program, but rising health care costs for all American \nhouseholds and businesses, and especially small businesses.\n  Mr. President, I strongly agree with my Senate colleagues who urge \nimmediate attention to the very serious problem of solving the trust \nfund. That [[Page S6972]] is a very serious problem, and it is \nsomething to worry about.\n  So far I have not seen a single serious proposal that really \naddresses the solvency of the trust fund. Therein lies a real problem \nfor me. In writing, not a proposal; on paper, not a proposal. In \nrhetoric, not really a proposal.\n  I have heard a lot of rhetoric about restructuring and giving seniors \nmore choice, but all I have seen and read about, and what is actually \nin the budget resolution, are huge cuts in Medicare--historic, \nunprecedented cuts in Medicare--to reduce the deficit by the year 2002. \nHuge cuts in Medicaid, also.\n  The House-passed tax cut bill actually raids, as the minority leader \nindicated, raids the Medicare HI trust fund by $23 billion. That has \nnot been pointed out very much on this floor. Now, we are the Senate, \nnot the House, but the House has presented its plan and the Senate has \nnot.\n  A raid of $23 billion on the Medicare HI trust fund actually moves \nforward the date of the insolvency of the trust fund by 8 or 9 months. \nSo they, in their wisdom, made the problem worse insofar as the trust \nfund was concerned.\n  I have yet to see a serious role from my Republican colleagues about \nensuring that the Medicare program will still be solvent when the baby \nboom generation comes into full play, about the year 2010. We are in \nthe easy period now. This is calm time. A calm sea. It begins to change \nshortly after the turn of the century.\n  I hear no acknowledgment from my colleagues that Medicare is, in \nfact, the most successful insurance program this country has. There may \nbe some who wish to debate that. I would welcome that.\n  The Medicare Program provides universal coverage for all seniors. \nThere is not a senior that does not have health insurance, and does not \nknow that when he or she wakes up in the morning or goes to bed at \nnight. There is no need to have an annual tabulation on the number of \n65-year-olds without insurance. We do not have to do that because it \ndoes not exist.\n  We have to do that, of course, for children in this country. We have \nto do that for women in this country. We have to do that for men in \nthis country who are under the age of 65, but not over the age of 65, \nbecause they are covered by Medicare. Everybody is covered. We are, in \nthat respect, like every other modern industrial nation in the world, \nfor 65 years and older.\n  Medicare does not deny medical coverage because of a preexisting \nmedical condition like most private insurance plans. Medicare does not \ncharge sick people more for their health care, like most private \ninsurance plans. Medicare allows seniors to continue seeing their \nlifelong doctor and go to any hospital they want.\n  Now, one can attack the fee-for-service concept, but one cannot say \nthat a senior is denied from seeing precisely the doctor they want or \ngo to the hospital they want. If an HMO is available in an area, \nseniors can sign up with an HMO. They can often times receive \nadditional benefits for so doing. But they have all of those options \nopen to them right now.\n  Up until very recently, the Medicare Program outperformed the private \nsector in holding down its costs. Over the past couple of years, \nMedicare costs have been slightly higher than the private sector costs, \nas I will get to in a moment--about 1 percent.\n  Realize that the private sector is, in fact, insuring fewer and fewer \npeople as the days, weeks, and months go by. Indeed, it is projected, \nas I know the Presiding Officer knows, that by the year 2000, 50 \npercent of Americans who work for a company will receive no health \ninsurance benefits from that company.\n  Now, over the past couple of years, as I indicated, Medicare costs \nhave been slightly higher. Then again, Medicare's enrollment is \nincreasing. People are getting older faster. The fastest growing age \ngroup is the 84-year-old and over age group.\n  Also, Medicare pays for home care services and skilled nursing home \ncare, types of services that are not normally covered under private \ninsurance plans.\n  According to the CBO projections, Medicare is actually projected to \ngrow by only 1.1 percent more than private health insurance over the \nnext 7 years, our budget window. And enrollment in that figure is \nfactored out. So it becomes a more honest figure because we do not have \nthe increased number of people.\n  Medicare, in fact, is projected to grow by 8.3 percent a year on a \nper person basis; private health insurance is projected to grow by 7.2 \npercent a year on a per person basis; that is a 1.1 percent difference \nover the next 7 years.\n  Medicare insures older people and the disabled--people with health \nneeds, people with terrible health needs and preexisting conditions. \nRemember, the private market casts them off to the side. It should not \nbe a surprise to my colleagues on either side of the aisle that \nMedicare's per-person health care costs are projected to grow slightly \nahead of private health insurance plans.\n  Mr. President, I have heard a lot of talk about needing to move the \nMedicare program into the 21st century by restructuring. I guess I do \nnot share an enthusiasm for certain aspects of our private health \ninsurance system as much as some of my colleagues. The Medicare \nprogram, in fact, was established because private health insurance \nrefused, failed, to provide affordable insurance to senior citizens. \nThat is why we did Medicare in the first place, because private \ninsurance would not insure seniors.\n  Now, many of my colleagues like to talk about the wonders of the \nmarketplace. I understand that. Some remarkable things are happening in \nthe marketplace. But I still see cherrypicking, red lining, medical \nunderwriting, policy cancellations, job lock, families paying more and \nmore money for fewer and fewer benefits.\n  As I know the Presiding Officer knows, that is now what is happening \nin the private sector in so many companies. Companies are many times \nnow saying, ``Yes, we will insure you, the employee, but we will no \nlonger insure your dependents.''\n But, then again, by the year 2000, 50 percent of people who work for a \ncompany will not receive any health insurance benefits at all, if CBO \nis correct.\n\n  There has been an incredible amount of rhetoric about expanding \nchoices for seniors. I was very active over the past 2 years in health \ncare reform and there was constant talk that health reform would reduce \nchoices.\n  It is funny, I guess, how last year opponents of health reform tried \nto scare people about the Clinton plan by telling people it would take \naway their freedom to choose their own doctor, which in fact is not \ntrue; it did not. The truth is the President's plan would have greatly \nexpanded the health care choices that Americans have today. But that \nhas done nothing to stop people from misrepresenting the President's \nplan, because a dead plan is easy to misrepresent. Just a few months \nago I read a document released by the office of my colleague from New \nHampshire, Senator Gregg, who was speaking only a moment ago, that \nsaid:\n       The Clinton health care reform plan projected $207 billion \n     in savings under Medicare, forcing all seniors into managed \n     care systems with per capita spending limits.\n\n  That is not true, that was never true, about the Clinton plan. That \nis false.\n  Now these same people are using the same powerful theme of choice as \na way to disguise their own plan to cut Federal spending on Medicare. \nThey are planning to force seniors to pay more out of pocket for their \nhealth care, and actually offer this as a savings to the Medicare \nProgram. Not only does this strike me as disingenuous, but it ignores \nthe real problems that our senior citizens have.\n  I, frankly, have never had a senior citizen complain to me in the 31 \nyears that I have been in West Virginia about Medicare not having \nenough choices. I have heard complaints about Medicare, but not about \nMedicare not having enough choices. They tell me they cannot afford \nprescription drugs and Medicare does not provide those, or that they \nhave long-term care needs and Medicare does not provide for those. But \nI have never heard a single complaint from West Virginia senior \ncitizens that they do not think they have enough choices.\n  Just yesterday I received a letter from a West Virginia senior who \nlives in Mason County. She gets by on her Social Security check. That \nis it for her. Right now she cannot even afford to buy her heart \nmedicine. It costs $138 a month. Fortunately, her doctor provides it to \nher without cost. She said [[Page S6973]] ``If anything happens to him \nI don't know what I will do.'' She also said, ``It's frightening to \nthink that you have worked all your life and to have it taken away is \nvery frightening.''\n  And then she said, ``If Senator Rockefeller cannot help us, who \ncan?'' Well, I hope I can help. I will do all I can to help this good \nlady from Mason County. But to say something that I think casts a pall \nover this entire debate, and is deep within my own worry and concern \nabout the future of America and American health care and Medicare and \nMedicaid in particular, I do not think I am going to be able to help \nher. Because I do not think there are going to be enough people voting \nin the way that I do to overcome the number of votes on the other side \nof the aisle.\n  I predict that a majority--the Republican Party will vote virtually \nen bloc on this matter, and that there will not be enough Democrats to \ncounter that by virtue of our numbers, and that we will lose, and the \nlady, my constituent from Mason County, will lose. And she will have to \ndepend on her doctor providing her with her heart medicine at $138.\n  Mr. President, even a $256 billion Medicare cut will do very little \nabout the long-term solvency of the Medicare hospital trust fund. At \nmost, these kinds of huge cuts may add a few more years of solvency to \nthe hospital trust fund--a few more years. I would hardly consider \nthis, however, saving Medicare. A few more years; 2 years, 3 years? It \nis not exactly saving Medicare. Given that the baby boom generation \nwill just begin relying on Medicare in the year 2010, so anything only \na few more years down the line will be worth very little in 15 years.\n  If my colleagues truly cared about protecting the Medicare program \nthey would realize that taking the Medicare debate out of the budget \ndebate is essential. And it may be that my colleague from the State of \nOregon agrees with me on this. They say they intend to do that, but in \na different way, a way that I disagree with. I think plugging a figure \ninto their budget resolution that adds up to $256 billion in Medicare \ncuts does not fool anyone. It does not fool any seniors in our State. \nListening to talk shows and participating in radio talk shows in the \nlast couple of weeks is providing clear evidence of that to me, about \nwhat seniors in West Virginia believe is about to happen to them, and \nwhich I am afraid is about to happen to them.\n  It is a deep fear. We desperately need--and this is where I hope my \ncolleague from Oregon might agree with me--we desperately need a \nbipartisan process to put Medicare on sound financial footing for the \nlong term. We need to move past the current rhetorical budget-driven \ndebate to the most important issues at hand, how best to keep Medicare \ndependable, secure, and valuable to seniors for generations.\n  The short-term budget need of cutting Medicare by unprecedented \namounts of money will have disastrous consequences on health care \nproviders and beneficiaries. That is the short term. Rural hospitals \nin, I think, all of our States will close in the aggregate by the \nhundreds. Doctors will shun some Medicare patients in some States for \nthe first time. Medicare beneficiaries, which is seniors and the \ndisabled, will learn firsthand what Medicaid beneficiaries have had to \ncope with in trying to get a doctor to treat them when reimbursement \nrates are set so very low.\n  I talked to a doctor in one part of our State the other day, 2 weeks \nago, who told me he was seeing 65 patients a day. He is now in a \nmanaged care program and therefore his reimbursement is much less per \npatient. I know him. He is a very fine, good person. But, in order to \nkeep up a living standard he has to see 65 patients a day. And I \nhonestly do not know how you can see 65 patients a day without quality \nsuffering.\n  I could not do 65 appointments a day, individual appointments a day \nin my office. How can a doctor do 65 appointments a day? But he is \ndoing that because he is in a managed care program and he has to do \nthat because he is being reimbursed less for each patient. So, again \nthe question of quality and how that plays.\n  There is, I think, a right way and there is, I think, a wrong way to \ngo about assuring the short-term and long-term solvency of the Medicare \nprogram. I believe the Republican proposal is the wrong way.\n  Under this way--the wrong way--up to 55 percent of seniors' Social \nSecurity COLA will be eaten up by increased Medicare costs to that \nsenior. For the one in four Americans that rely on Social Security for \ntheir entire income, this is brutal hardship.\n  Under the proposal before us, Medicare's growth rate per person will \nbe cut below the growth rate of private health insurance per person. \nThat is an important statement. The rate of growth will be less under \nMedicare than under the private system, seriously again threatening \nhealth quality--65 patients a day, 70 patients a day?\n  The amendment that Senator Lautenberg and I are offering on behalf of \na number of our colleagues is not going to solve the Medicare solvency \nproblem. I do not pretend that it will. The budget resolution before us \nwill not solve the Medicare solvency problem. Our amendment is about \nsetting priorities.\n  Before we start legislating any new contracts with America, let us \nnot forget about a contract that we already have with America's \nseniors, their families, and future generations. For all our zeal for \ndeficit reduction--and that is good, that is well-meaning, well-\nintentioned, profoundly important, necessary work--we have lost sight \nof what Medicare is all about. It is a promise. It is a pledge to the \nAmerican people that they will be able to live their lives in dignity \nand security far past their working days; that the sweat, the labor, \nthe intellect and the care that they put into building America and in \nkeeping our Nation strong and prosperous will be appreciated and valued \nwhen their resources wear out.\n  We, the Federal Government, made a promise and no amount of \nbookkeeping should ever sway us from that promise.\n  So instead of seeing a bankbook in Medicare, we should see an \ninvestment, not made by us but made in us. And it is our responsibility \nto ensure that investment of both funds and faith is always worthwhile.\n  So, Mr. President, before we go too far into looting Medicare we \nwould do well to strengthen it so that a pledge given to the Nation can \nbe fulfilled many generations over.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Senator Lautenberg does not appear to be on the \nfloor.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. If the Senator will yield, I talked to Senator \nLautenberg, and will have a unanimous-consent request between the two \nof us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I talked to the Senator from New Jersey. He agreed I \nwould go next. I do not know how much time I will take. I am handling \nthe floor for Senator Domenici now. I ask unanimous consent that when I \nam finished Senator Lautenberg be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I almost do not know where to start. \nThere are so much misimpressions, half truths, bad statistics that you \ndo not know whether to start at the very beginning and shoot down two \nor three and then try to do something sequentially. So I will start as \nfollows first.\n  Let us define some things we talk about. The word ``cut.'' Only in \nWashington, DC, in my experience in any municipal body that I know of, \nnot in the State legislature when I served there, the term ``cut'' \nmeant spending less than we spent last year. If we spend $1,000 on the \nfire department this year, and we spent $900 the next year, that was a \n$100 cut. And all of the budgeting that we did, when I served in the \nState legislature, was based upon what we spent last year, what we are \ngoing to spend next year, and in almost all cases it was up from what \nwe had spent last year. I think that is probably true of most cities \nand counties. But in Washington, DC, we define ``cut'' differently.\n  We say if we spent $1,000 on the fire department this year, and we \nhad planned to spend $1,200 on the fire department next year --\n``planned''--but we are in a budget, so we are only \n[[Page S6974]] going to spend $1,100, in Washington, we do not call \nthat a $100 increase. We call it a $100 cut. We never spent $1,200 on \nthe fire department. We never spent more than $1,000 in our lives. Yet, \nmy good friends from across the aisle in the Democratic Party are \ntalking about Medicare cuts.\n  Mr. President, there are no cuts.\n  I want to explain how we got to the situation we are in, the \nfinancial bind that we are in. In 1965, we enacted Medicare. We \nestimated that the hospital part of Medicare--now first let me define \nwhat I mean by the hospital part. We on the inside refer to part A of \nMedicare as hospitals, part B as doctors. We estimated in 1965 that in \n1990 we would spend $9 billion on hospitals. That was our estimates, 25 \nyears out. Actually, in 1990, we spent $67 billion. Were we off. We \nwere off by a factor of close to 700 to 800 percent; just missed it.\n  Or, take a look at the first full year of Medicare spending, in 1967. \nThe first year we spent on everything, hospitals, and doctors, $3.2 \nbillion. This year we are going to spend $178 billion. How did we miss \nso badly?\n  Here is what happened initially. We started down the road on a cost-\nplus basis, a term from World War II. We were in a bind. Japan had \nbombed Pearl Harbor, Germany was succeeding in running rampant all over \nEurope. We got into the war. And the war was our priority.\n  We argue today about defense spending. Defense spending today may be \naround 4 percent of our total gross domestic product, around 21 or 22 \npercent of our budget. To put it in perspective, at the height of World \nWar II, 1944 and 1945, defense spending was 40--4-0--percent of our \nentire gross domestic product and 90 percent of the Federal budget. We \nwere a war machine. And we were not too worried about costs. When all \nof a sudden you are asking the General Motors plant to shift in 6 \nmonths from making Chevrolets to making tanks and they had been used to \nworking a dayshift only, you say you want them to work three shifts a \nday and you want them to work Saturdays and Sundays and get this done--\nand hang the costs--we need the tanks.\n  We saw it in Oregon in the shipyards. Henry Kaiser, great \nindustrialist, put up in a short period of time three immense shipyards \nin the Portland metropolitan area and at the zenith of the war was \nemploying 30 percent of the adult labor force, and toward the end of \nthe war was turning out in one of the yards what were known as baby \nflat tops. It is a small aircraft carrier. They were turning out one \naircraft carrier every 7 days. Today we spend 3 or 4 years building \naircraft carriers.\n  How can you do it in 7 days? You can do it in 7 days--and hang the \ncosts--it does not matter. The priority is the war.\n  This in essence is what happened with Medicare. We had no restraint \non cost. We reimbursed doctors, and we reimbursed hospitals based upon \ntheir costs. It would be as if you were to say to a trucker, will you \ntruck my load of tomatoes from California to New York, and I will \nreimburse you your costs.\n  The trucker loads up his truck with tomatoes and he takes off. He \nneeds more gas. He comes to the gas station. No point in stopping at \nthe self-service station and saving 15 cents a gallon. He will have \nsomebody fill it up for him, 15 cents more a gallon. Add it on to the \ncost. No point in staying at Motel 6 at $25 a night when you can stay \nat the Hilton and add it on to costs.\n  Pretty soon, hauling the load of tomatoes across the country gets to \nbe very, very costly. And finally the shipper says, ``Listen, your \ncosts are too high. What I am going to do, I will give you $100 a day, \n$150 a day. You figure out how to make it. You don't want to haul it \nfor that, I will find somebody else.''\n  We live with all that when we travel in our States. We are given a \nlimited amount of money we can spend. Per diem it is called. We can \nspend it on a hotel or spend it on meals or spend it on things that we \nare allowed to spend it on but you cannot go over a certain amount and \nyou cannot have three expensive meals a day and stay in a reasonable \nhotel and stay within a reasonable amount. You learn to have a modest \nbreakfast and a light lunch, or you learn you can do just as well at \nthe hamburger stand as the Hilton Hotel and live within it.\n  Hospitals never had to do that. For the longest period of time, we \nreimbursed them on their costs. Now, what goes into the cost of a \nhospital? It is not just the doctor. It is not just the \nanesthesiologist that gives you gas, whatever he gives you when they \nare operating. Everything goes into it--all of their labor costs, all \nof their meal costs. You have an executive dining room for doctors with \ngold-plated handles on the toilets. It is all part of their cost.\n  The hospital would estimate what their cost was per day, per patient. \nBy the time you add all of their costs together, whether that is a \nparking lot, whether that is janitorial fees, you add it all together, \nand kind of figure a per day cost and you say to Medicare, well, it \ncost $500 a day to run our hospital. That is our costs.\n  And there was no limit, there was no limit on doctors early on. \nDoctors would perform a service. My cost was $100. Send it in. We \nreimbursed them. Finally, it is no wonder that Medicare costs exploded \nbeyond belief, when you are reimbursed with no restraint.\n  So we started about 10 years ago attempting to restrain payment for \ncosts. We set up a variety of commissions. We would say to a doctor we \nare only going to give you so much money for an appendicitis operation, \nso much money for a cataract operation.\n  But we discovered that the delivery of medical service was amazing, \nand--Senator Moynihan has used a wonderful term--that ``demand would \nrise to supply.'' So long as you had doctors that would perform \ncataract operations, you ended up doing more cataract operations than \nyou would otherwise do. So normally you thought this year there is \ngoing to be 100,000 cataract operations and we are only going to \nreimburse the doctors $100 an operation, and you think if we hold it to \n$100 an operation, then we will save money. But the next year you end \nup doing 200,000 cataract operations. You do not save money.\n  So that did not work very well. And there was no real competition.\n  So, let us get to the use of this word managed care, health \nmaintenance organizations, preferred providers. They are all variations \non a theme. A health maintenance organization is basically an \norganization that says we are going to attempt to restrain your and our \nhealth costs by having you receive most of your health services in our \norganization.\n  On the west coast, we are very familiar with it. We first saw it \nheavily again in the Kaiser operation. It started in California--Henry \nKaiser was from California--and in Oregon because at the same time that \nMr. Kaiser built the three shipyards in Portland and at the zenith of \nWorld War II was employing 30 percent of the adult labor force, he also \nhad a health plan for all of those 30,000 workers plus their \ndependents.\n  By the time you counted husband, wife, a couple kids and you were \nemploying 30,000, 30 percent of the adult labor force, you are covering \nan immense portion of the population, and this was the opportunity for \na managed type of care. This was the Kaiser health plan. You used the \nKaiser doctors and the Kaiser clinic. And Kaiser was able to restrain \ncosts by managing care much more than what we called fee-for-service \ndoctors or fee-for-service hospitals.\n  Back in the early days of the Kaiser organization it was very \nsuspect. Its doctors were not allowed to join the local medical \nsocieties. There was actually a lawsuit brought against one of the \nWashington Kaiser doctors who had just put a sign over the entrance to \nthe Kaiser clinic about Kaiser Permanente, a good health plan, or \nsomething like that, who was sued for advertising. I mean it was \nridiculous.\n  The fee-for-service doctors hated Kaiser. Kaiser was an early entree \ninto managed care, but they managed to hold their costs down.\n  I can recall in the late 1950's I was a labor lawyer in a law firm, \nlarge law firm in Portland. I was the low man on the totem pole in the \nlabor law division. And even in those days some of the employers in \nOregon, some of the big ones, some of the small ones, contracted with \nKaiser for their health services. As I recall, the plans were then $30, \n$40 a month. If you were an employee and you did not want to use \nKaiser, you could opt out. I do not even [[Page S6975]] think there was \nan additional fee for opting out.\n  The thing that intrigued me was that, on a voluntary basis, most of \nthe employees in these companies used Kaiser. Kaiser was very good \nabout coming over with sort of a little mobile van, medical truck for \nlack of a better term, and they would try to do some primitive exams, \nwhat we call annual physicals today, but they were doing them in a \nmobile van. And I cannot even remember what they looked for in those \ndays, but they were trying to screen, they were trying to catch, they \nwere trying to prevent, because they knew full well prevention was \ncheaper than hospitalization.\n  I well remember their testimony before the Oregon Legislature saying \nthat it was not the hospital operations per se that were cheaper. What \nKaiser said was, ``We are better at not hospitalizing as many people, \nbecause we catch the diseases earlier in our program''.\n  So we had this history of managed care in Oregon. The term is HMO, \nhealth maintenance organization. You also have something called a \npreferred provider organization. This is a variant on the managed care \ntheme in which, an insurance company, like Blue Cross/Blue Shield, says \nwe will write an insurance policy covering you but you must use our \nlist of doctors. And they will have a list of 100 or 200 or 500 \ndoctors. And so long as you use those doctors--it is a very wide \nchoice--they have agreed with the doctors they are going to pay them a \ncertain price for certain things and no more, and the doctors agree to \nthat and the patients are referred to those doctors.\n  And the preferred provider organization type of managed care, called \nPPO, worked out pretty well, too. Both of them, HMO's and PPO's, are \nmanaged care. Both of them save money over what we call a fee-for-\nservice style of health care. The problem is in most parts of the \ncountry they are not used to managed care.\n  I will give you some rough statistics, and I have picked these \nstatistics because they are the States of the principal sponsors of \nthis amendment.\n  In Oregon--and this is Medicare coverage in health maintenance \norganizations, not the entire population--in the Portland area, we are \nnow slightly in excess of 50 percent of the Medicare patients in \nmanaged care. Throughout the State, it is 30 percent managed care, but \nincreasing rapidly. Managed care obviously starts in the urban areas \nfirst and then moves out into rural areas gradually.\n  But I wish to put it in perspective by comparison to several other \nStates. For Medicare managed care enrollment, Oregon is 30 percent, \nMassachusetts is 6 percent, New Jersey is 2 percent, South Dakota is \nzero, and West Virginia is 2 percent.\n  So in essence the States represented by the principal sponsors of \nthis amendment have no experience of any substance, of any overwhelming \nconsequence, in Medicare managed care.\n  For managed care enrollment for the whole Portland population, not \njust Medicare beneficiaries, but everybody, Portland has 64 percent \nenrollment.\n  Bear in mind, people do not have to go into managed care. On Medicare \nespecially you do not have to go into managed care. It is voluntary. If \nyou want to keep the normal Medicare system you have now and be treated \nthat way, that is fine. Why would people go in there? They go in for a \nvery simple reason. The managed care providers provide more benefits \nthan Medicare.\n  I will read you across the list. Here is the ``Shopping for Health \nCare'' and it lists six major companies in Oregon that sell Medicare \nmanaged care policies to Oregonians. Let us just take prescription \ndrugs. Medicare does not provide prescription drugs.\n  In First Choice--that is the name of one of the HMO Oregon plans--\ndiscounts available. Preferred Choice, part of HMO Oregon, but in a \ndifferent area, discounts available. Good Health Plan, discounts \navailable with the basic plan and in the plan plus it pays 50 percent \nfor prescription drugs up to $100 a month. For Kaiser Permanente, it \npays 70 percent of prescription costs up to $50 maximum per \nprescription. On PACC, it has discounts available. Now you come to \nSelectCare. They do not cover drugs. They are like Medicare. And then \non Secure Horizons it is discounts available, mail order and walk-in.\n  You have a variety of different choices. And all of these companies \ncompete with each other. And you talk about the number of doctors that \nare available? First Choice has 500 primary care and 1,200 doctors \nincluding specialists that you can choose from. That is a reasonably \nadequate supply of doctors to choose from.\n  Preferred Choice has 300 primary care doctors, 1,000 including \nspecialists. And you go on, and there is none that has less than 400 \nthat you can choose from. So you are not hard pressed to get the care \nyou want.\n  And why do people go there, in addition to getting better service, \nbetter service than they are getting in Medicare? Again, they do not \nhave to go there. They can keep the usual fee-for-service Medicare \nservice.\n  Another reason is that they are used to it, if you have gone there \nall of your life.\n  Here is what happened. The Kaiser shipyards closed at end of World \nWar II. The Kaiser health plan was so popular that when they sold the \ncompany and the shipyards closed, Kaiser continued on with its health \nplan, in essence opened it up to the public. And, clearly, by the \nmidfifties to the late fifties it was a very significant provider of \nhealth care in Oregon, this managed care plan.\n  Today, it is growing in leaps and bounds. I am doing this from \nmemory, but I do not think I am off 5 percent. Blue Cross/Blue Shield \nis our biggest carrier. In 1984, Blue Cross/Blue Shield had zero in \nmanaged care. Today, as I recall--that was 1984--10 years later, they \nare at about 65 percent. By the end of 1998, they plan to be at 90 \npercent in managed care.\n  Now, what is the effect of all this? Here is the essence of the \ndifference. The difference is because of this long, long experience \nwith managed care--which no other State has. There are a couple that \nare close, but most of them have managed care in the zero to 5 percent, \n5 to 10 percent.\n  Oregon continues to increase managed care. By the end of this \ncentury, I would wager that counting both Medicare and the non-Medicare \npopulation, Oregon will have 90 percent managed care.\n  Because of this long history of managed care, Oregon has been able to \nrestrain its costs and give options in terms of plans and doctors that \nabsolutely beats the medical costs of any other State.\n  We are the lowest per capita cost State in the Union. And it is not \nbecause we are a low-income State. We are about in the middle; \nsometimes we are above the middle, sometimes we are below in terms of \nincome of our citizens and other prices. But we are not a poverty State \nin the normal sense of the word. But our per capita health care costs \nare the lowest in the country.\n  I will give you a comparison. Now this is for Medicare per capita \ncosts. In Oregon, the average Medicare per capita cost is $3,300 a \nyear. We are at the top. The bottom is Louisiana, at $5,400 a year--\nsame kind of operations, same kind of doctors, same kind of \nanesthesiologists, same kind of hospitals, $2,100 a year difference per \nMedicare enrollee. Louisiana has almost no managed care.\n  Let us just split that difference. Let us assume you do not get \neverybody down to Oregon's Medicare per capita cost of $3,300, where \nyou have a $2,100 difference. Let us just assume you could save $1,000 \na year. The savings is $40 billion a year in the Nation. That is $280 \nbillion over 7 years. That exceeds the savings that we're trying to get \nin this bill.\n  Can it be done? You bet it can be done. It is being done. Will it all \nhappen next year, like that? No it does not happen next year, like \nthat.\n  But if we start moving toward managed care, we will soon find that \ninstead of States being at 2 or 3 percent, they will reach 10 or 20 or \n30 percent. Of course, you do not increase in quantum leaps of 10 or 20 \nor 50 percent per year. But, whether you start from zero or 5 percent \nmanaged care coverage, you can get to 50 percent pretty quickly because \nyou will find that once people have managed care, they will choose \nmanaged care voluntarily because of better service.\n  Let us assume that we cannot save $280 billion a year over 7 years. \nLet us [[Page S6976]] say it takes time to move toward managed care all \nover the country, so we save half as much, $140 billion. Nobody is \ngetting less service. Everybody is getting the choices they want, and \nthey can stay in Medicare fee-for-service plans, if they want. But let \nus say you save $140 billion.\n  Now let's take a look at Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B and how \nwe pay for each.\n  Here, again, I want to emphasize the difference. Part A is hospitals; \npart B is doctors. Part A is paid for out of your payroll tax. You pay \n1.45 percent and your employer pays 1.45 percent. And then we recently \nincreased the taxes on Social Security from 50 to 85 percent on the \nupper earning income Social Security recipients and we took that 35 \npercent and we put it into this part A hospital trust fund. And this \ntrust fund owns some bonds and they had a slight surplus for awhile. \nThey get interest on the bonds. So you have these different sources of \npayments coming into the part A hospital trust fund.\n  Part B is doctor services. From the very start, it was funded \ndifferent than part A. From the time Medicare was adopted onward, we \nsaid the patient will pay part. We said that the Federal Government \nwill pay part out of the general funds, not out of our payroll tax, out \nof the general funds, everyone's taxes. We put up about $45 billion a \nyear out of the Federal Government General Treasury for that.\n  When we started out, it was agreed that the patient would pay 50 \npercent and the Federal Government would pay 50 percent. Had we held to \nthat, Part B would be in good shape now. But it gradually dwindled down \n45 percent, 40 percent, 35 percent, until it finally got as low as 25 \npercent and was causing a tremendous drain on the Treasury. So now it \nis set at 31 percent. However, the 31 percent expires and it is due to \ngo down to 25 percent.\n  Bear in mind, originally it was intended to be 50 percent. If we did \nnothing but hold the part B percentage that the Medicare recipient pays \nto its current 31 percent, same percent it is now, instead of letting \nit drop to 25 percent, that picks up $61 billion over 7 years; that is, \nif you could keep it where it is.\n  (Mr. KYL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Do you know what would happen if you were to go back to \nthe 50 percent that was agreed upon? You would pick up $173 billion in \nthe next 7 years.\n  Now, nobody is talking about that, but if we did that, all we would \nbe doing is keeping Medicare as it was intended when it was passed.\n  Now let us halve the difference. Let us say you were to go up to 35 \nor 36 percent and you pick up somewhere between the current $61 billion \nand the $173 billion. I will take a guess at $80 to $90 billion. You \nadd the $140 billion you saved on managed care and you are now at $230 \nbillion.\n  We are now at $256 billion.\n  This is done without any decline in service. This is done with better \nservice--because people in managed care are getting better service or \nthey would not be joining it--than they get from Medicare. They get \nprescription drugs in most cases, if they want to choose the plan that \nhas it. No wonder they join.\n  It is just that these plans do not have a lot of enrollees or do not \nexist in some States and they could in most States if we encouraged it. \nAnd every one of these plans has to offer the basic Medicare services. \nYou cannot go below it. You can offer more, like prescription drugs, \nbut you cannot offer less.\n  I can picture the savings that we would make if we allowed these \nplans to offer less if they wanted. Let us say you are a wealthy \nretiree, and for the life of me, I do not understand why we do not \nincome relate some of these benefits--let us take this part B that I am \ntalking about, where you are paying a certain percentage.\n  You are paying about 31 percent and the Federal Government is paying \n69 percent of the premium. It is the same 31 percent regardless of your \nincome. It is the same dollar amount whether the only income you have \nis $10,000 a year from Social Security or whether you are J. Paul \nGetty's heirs. They pay the same amount of money you do.\n  There is no reason why somebody who has $50,000, $100,000, $150,000 \nin retirement income, other than Social Security--and by retirement \nincome of $100,000, you have to have assets of about $2 million--there \nis no reason why they could not pay a bigger share of their premium.\n  Because you know what you have now, you have some poor devil working \nin a mill--if the poor devil has not been put out by the Endangered \nSpecies Act--that is making $25,000 a year and paying his taxes into \nthe general fund to support someone who has $100,000 a year in income, \nand these taxes in the general fund have to pick up 69 percent of that \nfellow's premium.\n  It is not fair. We ought to means test it. We ought to pick up more \nmoney doing that. We have to say to the rich: ``You have to pay more of \nyour benefits. You can afford it.''\n  Can we do it? You bet we can do it. We are often compared to Germany \nand Canada. People say, ``Well, they have single payer.'' Germany does \nnot have single payer. Single payer is where the Government collects \nall the money and pays all the bills. Anybody who thinks when the \nGovernment collects all the money and pays all the bills it is getting \nefficiency is dealing with a different government than I have dealt \nwith over my life.\n  We will be compared to Germany or Canada and they say, ``Their health \ncosts are much lower than ours.'' It is no wonder. For years they have \nnot reimbursed on a cost basis the way we do.\n  With managed care, can we get our costs under control? You bet we \ncan. Can we do it without cutting services and benefits? We have proven \nyou can do it.\n  I am going to emphasize again, Mr. President, in the Portland area, \nover 50 percent of the people on Medicare have chosen these private \ninsurance plans rather than straight Medicare. None of them have to. It \nis totally voluntary.\n  The Medicare payment goes to the insurance company and their \ninsurance company gives them these benefits in a Medicare managed care \nplan. It is cheaper and better than the present Medicare system, or \notherwise people would not leave the fee-for-service system.\n  As I say, I will predict by the end of this century, 5 years from \nnow, that all of Oregon--maybe the Portland metropolitan area, with the \nrural areas slightly behind--Portland will be roughly 90 percent for \nall of its health care coverage in managed care and Medicare will be \nsomeplace, in the Portland area, 70 and 80 percent managed care \ncoverage.\n  So the answer is, yes, we can do it. Therefore, when people say the \nRepublicans want to cut Medicare, first--here it is. This year, we are \nspending $178 billion on Medicare. What the Republicans are suggesting \nin the budget resolution is that we spend as follows on Medicare over \nthe years: 1996, $187 billion; 1997, $197 billion; 1998, $213 billion; \n1999, $227 billion; 2000, $244 billion; 2001, $262 billion; 2002, $283 \nbillion.\n  Mr. President, by anybody's definition, that is not a cut, that is an \nincrease every year. Is it as much as we would otherwise spend if we \ndid not have any restraint? It is less than we would spend if we did \nnot have any restraint. It is about $367 billion more than we are \nspending now if you add up the years.\n  So I am going to say, in conclusion, that this can be done. But one \nthing I want to say--I do not want to say ``in conclusion.'' I have a \ncouple more facts.\n  One is there has been an argument about the Medicare trust fund--this \nis part A--in bankruptcy. Is it bankrupt? It clearly is.\n  Here is what has happened. On average--I am averaging these off, and \nI will average it to the nearest thousand--on average, a one-wage-\nearner family with a spouse will pay in over their lifetime of earnings \ninto Medicare, about $60,000. That counts your payroll tax, your \nemployer's payroll tax, part B premiums and income taxes of yours \ndevoted to Medicare part B and any interest that is paid on the \naccumulated money until you retire. You have husband, wife, one of them \nworking, the other not, paying about $60,000.\n  On average they will collect in benefits about $185,000, roughly \n$125,000 more than they pay in, on average. Well, it is obvious you \ncannot run on that basis very long.\n  What happened in 1992 with Medicare? The Medicare trust fund for \nhospitals started to pay out more money [[Page S6977]] than it took in \nin taxes. It did have some extra sources of revenue. It held some \nbonds. It did have a surplus. It held some Government bonds and \ninterest was paid on the bonds, so they collected that money. They did \nhave a few people that belonged to the Railway Retirement System, and \nthey paid taxes into it and got some coverage. It was a relatively \nsmall amount.\n  Then, finally, a year or so ago, we took the cap, as we call it, off \nof wages. We used to limit the amount of tax that you had to pay on \nMedicare to a certain fixed amount. It was the same amount as Social \nSecurity, and you paid it up to a certain amount of money.\n  Finally, we took the cap off and said you are going to pay this \nMedicare tax on everything you make, $200,000, $300,000, $400,000, pay \nit. So all of this went into the fund, but by 1992, we are paying out \nmore than we are taking in in taxes.\n  Next year, 1996, we will pay out more in total than we take in from \nall sources, and next year onward--interest on the bonds and everything \nelse--from next year forward, the only way that Medicare keeps its head \nabove water is it is going to liquidate the bonds, it is going to sell \nthe bonds.\n  I am not talking about interest on the bonds. Medicare is going to \ntake its bonds to the Treasurer of the United States and say, ``Here, \nwe have a $100 bond. We held it in our surplus. Give us $100.''\n  By the year 2002, the bonds will be gone. There will be nothing left \nin the trust fund, and we are already paying out more money than we \ntake in in taxes.\n  By everybody's estimate--liberal, conservative, Congressional Budget \nOffice, Social Security trustees' report--everybody says that to meet \nthe short-range test of financial adequacy, just 10 years, we are about \n$145 billion to $165 billion short.\n  There are three ways you can make it up. You can raise taxes. That is \nbasically the Democrat's answer and has been their answer ever since \nMedicare has been short of funds--raise taxes.\n  You can cut benefits, and here I use the word ``cut'' in the exact \nsense, and this is what the Democrats accuse us of doing. We are not \ntalking about cutting benefits. We are talking about a combination of \nmanaged care and payment on part B premiums, and we can save the trust \nfund.\n  At the same time that you save it--that is a budget savings, I am not \ntrying to cover that up--but whether or not we have a surplus in our \nbudget or a deficit in our budget, the trust fund for Medicare is short \nand will be gone in 7 years.\n  So that we ought to save, in any event. And if in the savings it \nhelps on our budget problem in addition, so much the better. That is \nnothing to be ashamed of.\n  What does this amendment do? I love this. This amendment takes what \nthey call the reserve--that is a misnomer, as that assumes you have \nmoney.\n  If we pass the balanced budget, it is a three-step process. We will \nbe debating this particular resolution for the next 4 or 5 days. If we \nadopt this budget resolution, it is a broad outline of the money to be \nsaved.\n  It does not specifically say here is where you save money in \nMedicare, or here is where you save money in defense, or here is where \nyou save money in education.\n  It is a broad outline of we would like to save x amount of dollars in \nMedicaid or in defense. This resolution is then parceled up and given \nto the committees of jurisdiction in Congress.\n  The Armed Services Committee will get the defense portion and they \nwill have to live within the totals. My committee, the Finance \nCommittee, which I chair, will get Medicare and Medicaid and welfare \nand earned-income tax credit, and we will have to live within the \ntotals.\n  We all give our recommendations back to the Budget Committee in a \ncertain time and say here is how we have met the totals. Then we put \nthat into a big process called reconciliation and that bill is brought \nto the floor and voted on.\n  The second part is passing this budget. That is the real vote. That \nis where the real outlines are reduced to specifics. That is the second \npart.\n  The third part is, will the President sign it? Because he can veto \nit. But it will be balanced, and that will be the third part.\n  If, at the end of this process--I have been here 25 years, and the \nlast time I saw a balanced budget was in 1969, and that was by \naccident; we did not plan a balanced budget. But the economy was a bit \nbetter than we thought it was going to be, and when the economy is \nbetter, revenues come in better and, by accident, we collected more \nmoney than we thought, and we did not have time to spend it, so we had \na slight surplus. That was in 1969.\n  Well, if everything works right in this budget process, if there is \nno phony budgeting--and so far, there has been none--and, \ninterestingly, the press, who does not like some of our priorities, has \nnot criticized this budget as being unreal.\n  Always, in the past, the press has talked about blue smoke and \nmirrors, and moving the pea around under the shell. They have said this \nis a real budget and they are starting to say to the Democrats, ``Where \nis your real budget?''\n  Let's assume that all of the committees report back to the Budget \nCommittee and it is all put into this reconciliation package and it \npasses and the President signs it. Then, the Congressional Budget \nOffice, which is a group of professionals that advise us, they work for \nus and advise us as to the economic effects of what we have done, have \nsaid that there will be an additional, over 7 years, beyond the \nbalance, a $170 billion surplus. They have said this will be the case \nif everything else is in place at the end of this process, which is \ngoing to be, my guess is, October or November.\n  What do the Democrats want to do now? That reminds me. It has been 25 \nyears since I have seen a balanced budget. And I will believe it when I \nsee it. I will believe it when this process is over.\n  But if, by chance, we make it and if the Congressional Budget Office \nsays there is $170 billion extra, what do the Democrats want to do? \nSpend it. The Democrats say, do not try to reform Medicare, or do not \ntry to get Medicare enrollees into managed care, do not try to get \nveterans service for less money. Spend it.\n  That has been the answer to our problems for too long. You may have \nheard the Democratic leader say today that these tax cuts are going to \ngo to the wealthy and the Republicans can give their fat cat friends \ntax cuts.\n  There is no tax cut in this budget resolution that we are talking \nabout. There is in the House's. That is not the budget resolution that \nwe are talking about. In this Senate budget resolution, there is no tax \ncut for the rich, the poor, not for anybody. We are reserving the \ndecision as to what to do when we get to the end of this process if we \nhave a $170 billion surplus.\n  If I had any druthers about it, my preference would be to pay off \npart of the past debt with any surplus. Lord knows, that is not going \nto be a popular idea, I am sure, if we have this money.\n  So we may get into a debate at that time as to whether or not, with \nthis $170 billion extra over 7 years, whether we should spend it or \ngive it back to the taxpayers. If we give it back to the taxpayers, we \nwill debate who should get it, what is the best form of tax, and should \nwe have a capital gains tax and a $500 tax credit, and should you limit \nit to people who make over $100,000 a year so the rich do not get it? \nThat is a debate for another time.\n  There is nothing in this budget resolution that says there is going \nto be any tax cut. I would be the happiest guy around if next November \nwe have done everything we say we are going to do and the Congressional \nBudget Office comes to us and says we have $170 billion extra. I have \nnot done tumbling since I was 10 years old at the YMCA. But if we do \nthat, I will do a back flip on this floor.\n  So I suggest that we simply get on with this debate. We are going to \nhave ample time again. If this resolution is adopted, we are going to \nhave ample time to debate the nature of the Medicaid restraints in \ngrowth and the nature of the Medicare restraints in growth.\n  Do not worry; there is not going to be any debate about cuts. We will \nhave a debate about whether we should encourage people to move toward \nmanaged care in Medicare. There will another debate--and it is going to \nbe an [[Page S6978]] interesting debate--about whether we should say \nthat some plans on Medicare can be allowed to sell a policy if it \nprovides less than the current Medicare benefits if a senior wants to \nbuy it?\n  I will give an example. You do it with normal insurance all the time \nwith a homeowner's policy or a car policy, where you have a $250, or \n$500, or $1,000 deductible. It depends upon the loss you are willing to \nbear. The more you are willing to bear, the less your policy costs. \nShould we consider selling a policy or allowing a policy to be sold \nthat says: Mr. or Ms. Medicare recipient, we will guarantee to pay all \nof your medical expenses over $3,000 a year if you will pay all of your \nmedical expenses up to $3,000 a year? My hunch is that a fair number of \npeople will buy that kind of a policy voluntarily. Somebody else might \nwant a policy that pays all of their expenses over $100 a year. We \ncould allow that to be sold, too.\n  There was the wonderful idea you heard Senator Gregg from New \nHampshire talk about. If we say the average Medicare cost now \nthroughout the country--and Oregon is way lower than average--is $5,000 \na year, and we are going to give you a voucher and the voucher is worth \n$5,000. You can go out and buy health insurance with it. You can shop \naround in Oregon with different plans. I will bet if every Medicare \nrecipient had a voucher, you would have 12 or 15 plans all competing \nwith each other.\n  If you said: I feel pretty healthy and I have retirement income of \n$25,000, $30,000 a year, so I will take a chance and buy that policy \nthat I pay the first $3,000, and Medicare and my company that I buy it \nfrom pays everything above $3,000. Let us say that policy--I am \nguessing that a policy like that would not cost $5,000 a year; it \nprobably would cost $3,500, maybe $3,000 a year. Let us say $3,000. So \nyou have saved $2,000 out of what we are otherwise paying for Medicare.\n  If we say if you buy that kind of a policy, you can keep $1,500, and \ngive us $500 back, you bet we would save a lot of money. There are so \nmany options, so many varieties, so much diversity and competition that \nhelps deliver good service in this country that we have proven works. \nSo let us get on with the debate, and about 3 or 4 months from now, we \nwill have the debate over the specific Medicare and Medicaid programs \nthat we will suggest to meet these totals.\n  Will they be cuts? Absolutely not. They will be increases from what \nwe are spending now. Will we give people more choice than they have \nnow? You bet. Will a person be able to shop for delivery systems that \ngive a variety of services? I hope so. That is a debate for another \ntime. It is not the debate for today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, restraining myself from getting into \ndebate with the Senator from Oregon over his closing paragraphs, I \nwould yield such time to the Senator from New Jersey as he requires.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. President, Senator Rockefeller and I have sent an amendment to \nthe desk. It is cosponsored by Senators Mikulski, Kennedy, Daschle, \nWellstone, and Boxer.\n  This amendment, Mr. President, is based on an amendment that I \noffered last week in the Senate Budget Committee. It is pretty simple. \nIt takes up to $100 billion from funds set aside for tax cuts for the \nwealthy and puts them into Medicare and Medicaid. I would like to \nrepeat that this amendment eliminates any suggested tax cuts for the \nrich and puts the proceeds into Medicare long-term care.\n  Now, Mr. President, the budget resolution that we are considering \ntoday forces Members to make a fundamental decision. It is a decision \nabout what we stand for. Whose side are we on? The debate on this \nresolution is going to reveal a fundamental difference between our \nfriends on the Republican side and those on the Democratic side.\n  As Democrats, we believe that Government was meant to serve average \nAmericans, middle-class families, who struggle to keep things afloat; \nsenior citizens, who struggle to make end's meet on a fixed, often \nmodest, income; and children, the future of our Nation.\n  By contrast, the Republican Party has a very different philosophy and \na different constituency. The Contract With America and the budget \nresolution before the Senate today is designed to serve the most \npowerful and wealthy members of our society. It has a group of winners. \nIf a person makes $350,000, that person will get a $20,000 tax break. \nThere is protection for corporate subsidies. And a number of tax \nloopholes have been protected--as usual.\n  On the other hand, it impairs the Medicare program that served our \nsenior citizens so well for 30 years. It leaves intact a variety of \nsubsidies and loopholes for the wealthy, and it lavishes massive new \ntax cuts for the rich.\n  The losers are ordinary Americans. Medicare, for a senior citizen \ncouple, is going to cost that couple $6,400 more over the next 7 years. \nIn the last year of that 7-year cycle we are discussing with the \nbudget, it will cost around $1,800. We chopped away at education. And \nwe increased taxes in place after place for hard-working Americans.\n  Mr. President, yesterday I had a radio call-in show to New Jersey. \nPerson after person--these were working people, some retired--who said \nfor goodness sake, please put aside that tax cut. We do not need it. We \nwould like to have it, but America needs our help more at this time. \nAnd my kids will need help more one day in the future.\n  I noted with interest and pleasant surprise that seven colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle, Republican friends, U.S. Senators, said, \n``Forget tax cuts. We are not taking them. We are opposed to them.'' \nHowever, the budget resolution stores away $170 billion on the other \nside, and over $350 billion on the House side, specifically earmarked \nfor tax cuts, principally for the wealthy.\n  If my view and the view of my fellow Democrats, these priorities are \nfundamentally wrong. In our view, Government must stand on the side of \nordinary Americans.\n  Mr. President, nothing better illustrates the fundamental difference \nbetween our two parties than the budget resolution's drastic cuts in \nMedicare--again, socked away for tax cuts for the rich. It is denied, \nit is not stated, but it is very clearly in the air.\n  To Democrats, this kind of proposal is just abhorrent. It runs \ncompletely contrary to everything we stand for as Democrats. It will \nhurt millions of ordinary Americans around our country.\n  As we can see, Medicare recipients are people of typically very \nmodest means. Seventy-five percent of these people have incomes of less \nthan $25,000 a year. I know that in high-cost places like my own State, \nlike New York State, like other industrialized States, $25,000 a year \ndoes not permit the basic necessities of life, especially when \nconsidering that over 20 percent of their income is needed to \nsupplement the Medicare health benefits that they already get.\n  Thirty-five percent of these people live on less than $10,000 a year, \nor make less than $10,000. Twenty-five percent of them rely solely on \ntheir Social Security checks. That is tough going, especially when the \nprospects are that they will have to pay a lot more for their health \ncare in the future.\n  On top of this, we see on the chart and are reminded that seniors \nalready paid 21 percent of their income on out-of-pocket medical \nexpenses. If someone is earning $25,000, 20 percent, roughly $5,000, on \ntop of their Medicare program.\n  Despite, however, interestingly enough, the high out-of-pocket costs \nand the lack of adequate medical care coverage for prescription drugs \nand long-term care, Medicare recipients are basically happy with the \nprogram.\n  The polls that have been done, the analysis that has been developed, \nwe see that 89 percent of the senior citizens--the Medicare \nbeneficiaries--89 percent say they are basically satisfied with the \nquality of care that they derive from Medicare. That will change if \nthis resolution is approved.\n  Mr. President, we simply cannot cut $256 billion from Medicare \nwithout having a real impact on senior citizens.\n  Now I have heard our colleagues from the other side say, ``No, no, it \nis not a cut. You do not understand it. Democrats do not understand \nit.'' People across the country must not understand it, because I get \nlots of phone calls saying, ``Whatever you do, do not permit them to go \nthrough with this.''\n  It says it is intended to reduce the growth in costs for Medicare. \nMedicare [[Page S6979]] is going to get more money than it does today. \nBut that does not account for the swelling of the population or the \nlong-term needs of that population or the services that they need as \nthey age and as their health deteriorates, which is natural in older \npeople. These cuts threaten to force seniors to pay higher premiums, \nhigher deductibles, and higher copayments. And it also threatens to \nundermine the quality of their health care, which they are content \nwith, if not to deny many seniors the right to choose their own doctor. \nThese cuts will fundamentally change Medicare and make it a lesser \nsystem, much more costly and less complete.\n  How do we do this to people with whom we have engaged in virtually a \ncontract? How do we violate our word? How do we breach that trust?\n  The Republican cuts in Medicare are wrong. They break a promise with \nour Nation's senior citizens, people who have worked often their entire \nlives and have paid into the Medicare program. For this hard work the \nFederal Government promised health security through Medicare. This \nbudget resolution breaks that promise. It will force senior citizens to \npay, as we saw earlier, approximately $3,200 individually in additional \nMedicare costs; that is $6,400 for a retired couple, a $6,400 tax \nincrease over the next 7 years, to retired persons.\n  Further, these are just average figures which grossly underestimate \nthe real impact for many seniors, for those who are at the bottom end \nof the income scale, for those whose health care needs accelerate \nsubstantially, for those, frankly, in the greatest need. The added \ncosts would be a terrible burden.\n  This last chart kind of sums it up. The budget that is proposed, the \nRepublican budget: $6,400 tax increase for every senior couple, and for \npeople on the upper end of the scale, earning $350,000 a year, it is a \n$20,000 bonus.\n  I have been lucky in my lifetime. I developed a good business. As a \nmatter of fact I helped develop an industry. And I am a member of, \nthough it is not an auspicious hall of fame, but there is a hall of \nfame called the Information Processing Hall of Fame, that puts New \nJersey as the only State with two Hall of Famers, Bill Bradley in \nbasketball and me in information processing. The kids just run after me \nfor my autograph. But the fact of the matter is, I have been successful \nin business and as a result of that I have enjoyed the fruits of that \nsuccess. And this is one U.S. Senator who is not ashamed of his \nsuccess. I understand one of my colleagues complained about being \nlectured about programs for modest-income people, poor people, by those \nwho inherited their wealth.\n  I know lots of people with inherited wealth who turned out to be \nselfless, giving citizens who have turned back their energies into the \ncommunity to try to make it a better place. But speaking for myself, I \ncame from a family where my mother was widowed when she was 36 years \nold. I was 18. I had already enlisted in the Army. My father died. We \nwere left worse than penniless. There was no health care plan around to \ntake care of us. The family owed $2,000 to doctors and hospitals, which \nwe had to pay over a lengthy period of time, I think about a year and a \nhalf. I sent home my allotment from the military. And I worked like the \ndevil to build a business with hard work and with the help of loyal \npartners. And success came our way.\n  But I remember a period of time when my father had to resort to the \nWPA, for those old enough or knowledgeable enough about that period, to \ntry to keep food on the table, to try to have a job that would permit \nhim to lift his head up and not be disgraced by the fact that he had to \nresort to Government help for his family.\n  So my success did not come from any inheritance. It came because I \nworked for it, and I did it the old fashioned way, the American way. \nAnd as a consequence, when I talk about ordinary working people I know \nvery well what they are going through and I want to try to give them an \nappropriate helping hand where necessary. And this is where it is \nnecessary. This is a commitment that was made to people, people who \nhelped build this country to its greatest levels after World War II, \nafter first, in many cases, serving in the military during that period \nof time.\n  It is not fair to our Nation's seniors. It is unfair, and for many it \nis calamitous. People can weave and dodge, wink at the truth and say, \nlisten, just remember, we are in the Budget Committee. I am one of \nthose. And we cannot tell the Finance Committee what to do. But \nindividual Members of this body have said that they stand on a \ncommitment to give tax cuts and that they would do whatever they could \nto block a budget resolution that does not include them. And the \nRepublican Party, in charge in the House, made it very specific. They \nset aside the funding, $350 billion in the contract on America. I think \nit is outrageous. Why should we make senior citizens, 75 percent of \nwhom make under $25,000 a year, pay more so we can give a $20,000 tax \ncut to the richest 1 percent of the population? Where is our sense of \npriorities? Where, for that matter, is our sense of fairness and \ndecency?\n  We would be a lot better keeping a promise that we had, taking care \nof the education of our children so they can help lead this country in \nthe next century to a more competitive position and regain the \nleadership that this country so rightly deserves and has had in the \npast. This amendment is an effort to reverse these misguided policies. \nIt will take the money that is being set aside in the slush fund for \ntax cuts for the rich and leave it in the Medicare and Medicaid \nProgram. That is where it belongs.\n  The amendment will help ensure that the Medicare recipients will not \nhave to pay higher deductibles or copayments when they go to the \nhospital. It will help protect against the serious decline in the \nquality of their health care. It will help ensure that seniors are not \ndenied the freedom to choose their own doctor. And it will help ensure \nthat the Federal Government keeps its promise to senior citizens who \npaid and labored in good faith.\n  We are discussing a bill to achieve a goal, a balanced budget goal. \nAnd I think it is fair to say that almost every one of us, Democrat or \nRepublican, would like to achieve that goal. The question is how does \nit get done? Does it get done by assigning taxes to senior citizens, \nhigher taxes? Does it get done by taxing students who want to further \ntheir education but will have to pay substantially more in the $4,000 \nto $5,000 range, on average, to get their college education? Or to deny \nmodest-income families, with incomes under $28,000, their earned income \ntax credit?\n  Everyone knows how tough living on that kind of income is. By saying \nto them, no, no, you are going to have to pay more taxes, the three--\nthe seniors, the kids who want to go to school, and the modest-income \npeople--you have to pay more taxes so we can balance the budget and, by \nthe way, on the trail to a balanced budget we are going to drop off \nsome tax cuts--$20,000 if you make $350,000 in a year. It sounds like a \nlot of money to me.\n  Mr. President we will hear a lot of denials. We have heard them this \nmorning from the other side of the aisle. They say, no, there is not a \ntax cut for the rich in this resolution. It is not here. They will say \nthe House has a tax cut for the rich. No one is fooled by these \ndenials. The resolution that comes before us contains the fund, the \nslush fund to reach into and pull out a tax cut for the rich.\n  According to some estimates, this slush fund will contain about $350 \nbillion for tax cuts over 10 years--not just the $170 billion that \npeople talk about over the next 7 years.\n  The House hit the number on the head, $350 billion. I do not think \nthat the intention is to deceive or to fool. But the result comes out \nthat way. Are the American people supposed to believe that the \nRepublican budget will not cut Medicare to pay for tax cuts for the \nrich? The American people know better than that. They are not going to \nbe fooled by the rhetoric.\n  If anyone has any doubts, consider what happened during the Budget \nCommittee's deliberation on this resolution. I offered an amendment \nthat would have required a 60-vote supermajority to cut Medicaid or \nMedicare to pay for a tax cut for the rich. I did not have much \nRepublican support. As a matter of fact, if memory serves me right, it \nwas nobody, no one, who said, ``Yes, we are willing to test this \nSenate. We are willing to put the test to our colleagues in the Senate. \nWe will require 60 votes to cut Medicare [[Page S6980]] and Medicaid to \npay for a tax cut.'' Nobody came through.\n  As a matter of fact, it was so extreme and the attitude was so harsh, \nso rigid, that I offered an amendment that said let us get after the \nBenedict Arnolds in our society, the expatriates who take their \nfortunes that they have made in this country and renounce their \ncitizenship, and go to another country so they do not have to pay State \nor other taxes for the privilege of living in America. I said let us do \nthat, let us cut that out--it is over $3 billion for a period of 7 \nyears--and give it to veterans programs. I could not even win this \ncommonsense amendment.\n  This morning I had a phone call to a veterans hospital in New Jersey. \nThere is a new program that I helped get put into place. It is bedside \nphones. It is to give someone who is confined to bed or a wheelchair or \nis immobile a phone alongside their bed so they can communicate with \ntheir families, so they can have some contact with the outside world, \nand not have to go down the hall and stand where everybody is smoking \nand wait to put a quarter in the telephone.\n  That program had struck such a cord with the people in the veterans \nhospital, but when it came to saying OK, we want to recapture the taxes \nthat these people are evading by running out of the country after they \nmade it here and lived here and renounced their citizenship, and give \nto the veterans, I could not get one Republican Member to say, ``Frank, \nthat is not a bad idea. Let us at least try it.''\n  So I think, Mr. President, it is fair that it reflected an attitude. \nIt is evidence. It says that we are going to take it from modest-income \npeople, and we are going to give some of it to the rich, people who do \nnot need it, and in many cases do not even want it. People I have \nspoken to have said let us invest in our society. In Speaker Gingrich's \nworld, it is the crown jewel of the Republican agenda. There is no way \nto get around that.\n  So when we get right down to it, this amendment is simple. It asks \neach Senator to decide what we said initially: Whose side are you on? \nThat is what is going to be judged as we count the votes. That is what \nI stand for. That is what my Democratic colleagues stand for, and I \nthink it is what the American people believe in. It is the right thing \nalso for our Nation.\n  We have an opportunity to prevent our senior citizens from being \nsocked with a $6,400 tax increase. Let us say no to tax cuts for those \nwho have the wealth. Let us say yes to our senior citizens and the \nmiddle-class families who help support them.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I am going to yield, in about 30 seconds, to the \nSenator from Tennessee for 15 minutes, but I want to say one thing in \nrebuttal.\n  You will notice the Senator from New Jersey kept talking about these \ntax cuts for the rich. There are no tax cuts in the resolution we are \nconsidering--not for the rich, not for the poor, not for the middle \nincome, not for Congress, not for veterans, not for Medicare \nbeneficiaries, not for anybody. That is a decision we may or may not \nconsider when this resolution is adopted. We may have tax cuts, and we \nmay not have tax cuts.\n  They love arguing over the House budget resolution which does have \ntax cuts, and not this resolution which has no tax cuts in it at all.\n  I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, if the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee will permit me for a moment, and our friend from \nTennessee, as well, just to say, while it is not specifically \nearmarked, there are distinguished Members of this body from that side \nof the aisle who say that this bill without a tax cut is not going \nanywhere. The distinguished majority leader made himself very clear on \nwhat he expects. He expects a tax cut to result from this bill.\n  I know it is the province of the Finance Committee. But we had a long \ndebate in the Budget Committee about it was not for tax cuts and it was \nfor tax cuts. At one point, it was kind of squeezed out that it was for \ntax cuts. At another point, it was said, ``Well, that is not our \ndecision to make.''\n  Whether it is done in all fairness with a wink of an eye or the \nimplicit suggestion that, OK, it is there. Listen, if the Finance \nCommittee elects to give it to a tax cut program, why, that is up to \nthem. But seven Members of the Senate from the Republican side were so \ndiscomforted by the notion that tax cuts are being considered that they \nrenounced them immediately.\n  I think it tells you something.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, he and I agree. He does seem to say \nthere are no tax cuts. He says, ``Well, there is a reference to them. \nThere is a discussion about them. I am discussing them. There is a \npossibility at the end of this process, if there is $170 billion, that \nwe might have tax cuts. I am not sure who they might be for, or I am \nnot sure what geographic area they will cover, or income groups they \nwill cover. But at least he and I both agree there is nothing we are \ndebating today that says there has to be any tax cut.\n  With that, I would like to yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after \nthe Senator from Tennessee has spoken, that the Senator from Maryland, \nSenator Mikulski, may speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak as a physician, someone who \nspeaks from personal experience, who has spent the last 18 years of his \nlife taking care of and working with Medicare patients. I have \npersonally treated thousands of Medicare patients, and I have seen the \nbeauty of that system, that the system works, and that it is an \neffective system.\n  But I have also seen the problems with Medicare that we have today; \nthe fact that it is a system that works, yes, but a system that can be \nimproved and, in fact, must be improved if it is to be saved.\n  In addition, I have two 84-year-old parents. Both Mother and Dad have \nbeen beneficiaries of the Medicare Program for collectively almost 40 \nyears; to treat a heart attack, bypass surgeries, a broken neck, a \nbroken arm, phlebitis. My remarks are made from this perspective, with \na desire to preserve Medicare, to improve it.\n  Several quick points. First, Medicare is not Social Security. If \nthere is one thing I hope the debate today and Monday will bring forth, \nit is that Medicare and Social Security are two entirely different \nprograms.\n  Second, Medicare, if we do nothing, will be bankrupt in 7 years.\n  The Medicare public trustees, David Walker and Stanford Ross, in \ntheir summary of the 1995 Annual Medicare Trustees' Report, said very \nclearly:\n\n       * * * it is now clear that Medicare reform needs to be \n     addressed urgently as a distinct legislative initiative.\n\n  In that same document, these public Medicare trustees say, and I \nagain quote:\n\n       We feel strongly that comprehensive Medicare reforms should \n     be undertaken to make this program financially sound now and \n     over the long term.\n\n  Finally, they say, in that same document:\n\n       We strongly recommend that the crisis presented by the \n     financial condition of the Medicare Trust Funds be urgently \n     addressed on a comprehensive basis, including a review of the \n     program's financing methods, benefit provisions, and delivery \n     mechanisms.\n\n  Third, let me say once again that in 15 years, unless we do \nsomething, that spending on Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, \nFederal and military pensions, and interest on the debt will consume \nthe entire Federal budget, leaving no money for defense, for education, \nfor roads, or any other programs. Yes, we must act now, and unless we \ntake some action, it is very clear, that if spending continues at the \nsame rate Medicare will go bankrupt in just 7 years.\n  The proposed bill before us is the first step because it will save \nMedicare in the short term. But the second step, and one that we have \nnot talked very much about thus far, is the specific policies needed to \npreserve Medicare in the short and long terms. The Republican balanced \nbudget includes a provision for the establishment of a bipartisan \ncommission to make very specific recommendations on the solvency of \nMedicare, both in the short term and in the long term. This bipartisan \ncommission will include appointments from [[Page S6981]] both sides of \nthe aisle to address the fundamental challenges before us.\n  And third, as has been pointed out, we do need to update the Medicare \nstructure. We need to bring it into 1995, 1996, and 1997 terms. And \nherein lies the reform effort. But as has been pointed out, the budget \nresolution before us today only sets the target numbers. The actual \npolicy decisions on how to meet those targets will be made by the \nvarious committees of jurisdiction, and they will be made with the \ninput, the advice, the counsel of this bipartisan commission and their \nrecommendations.\n  Mr. President, I do bring a different perspective to this budget \ndebate than many of my colleagues, for several reasons. First, I am a \nnewcomer. I have been here only 5 months. I have been a member of the \nBudget Committee. I participated in that debate. And I appreciate that \nopportunity and that challenge to address this overall budget.\n  Second, I came directly to this body from the Medicare arena as a \nphysician. Just 18 months ago, I was treating Medicare patients. I was \ntransplanting hearts into Medicare patients, and I was taking care of \ntheir heart and lung disease.\n  Yes, I was a health care provider, and, yes, I was a specialist. I \nvery directly felt the blows and saw the impact of some very good \nreforms--reforms such as the Resource Based Relative Value Scale \n[RBRVS] which drastically altered the way Medicare pays physicians. I \nhad the opportunity as a hospital-based physician to see the effects \nnot so long ago of the introduction of diagnosis related groups \n[DRG's]. I have lived with repeated changes in hospital physician \npayments. And most importantly, I have been a provider of heart-related \nprocedures to Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Heart disease requires long-term management. It requires acute \nmanagement and chronic management. I bring this personal experience to \nthe table.\n  My patients, thousands of Medicare patients, have told me what they \nhave come to expect with Medicare, but also what they would like to \nexpect in the future, and bankruptcy is not there.\n  Before I entered medical school, I had the opportunity to study \nhealth care policy. It allows me to take that step back and look at the \nbig picture as well. And quite frankly, coming to this body, coming to \nthis Congress, I find it incredible that Congress has allowed Medicare \nto come to this point where in 7 years, unless we act through this \nbudget resolution, Medicare will be bankrupt.\n  I am here to talk to my colleagues as well about and participate in \nthat dialog of fundamental improvements to the Medicare Program.\n  Eventually, I plan to return to my medical career. I will return to a \nhealth care system which will be very much determined in effect by what \ndecisions are made here over the next 7 years. I can tell you, as I \nlook back at the alternatives, the past failures of Congress have not \nleft seniors with choice in Medicare and really have not left taxpayers \nor providers with much choice. Failure for us in this body to address \nthe problems driving Medicare's cost growth will only cripple the \nfuture of our health care system.\n  My appeal is very different from what we have heard over the last \nhour. My appeal is for bipartisanship, and I support the establishment \nof this bipartisan commission put forth in this bill. The budget \nresolution in this bill sets a reasonable target. It allows Medicare to \ncontinue to grow at more than twice the rate of inflation. No, not 10 \npercent as it has historically, but over 7 percent.\n  Last year, President Clinton recognized that the program was \nunsustainable at a growth rate three times the rate of inflation and \nproposed to allow Medicare spending at twice the rate. President \nClinton, speaking to the AARP in California in 1993, said:\n\n       Today, Medicaid and Medicare are going up at three times \n     the rate of inflation. We propose to let it go up at two \n     times the rate of inflation. That is not a Medicare or \n     Medicaid cut. Only in Washington do people believe that no \n     one can get by on twice the rate of inflation. So, when you \n     hear all this business about cuts, let me caution you that \n     that is not what is going on. We are going to have increases \n     in Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n  Mr. President, that was the President of the United States speaking \nin 1993. Those words could have been spoken by any Member of this body \ntoday. I would encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nrecognize several things: First, we have essentially all agreed there \nis a problem. The documentation is there. Second, we have all agreed, \nincluding the President of the United States, on what can be an \nacceptable rate of spending growth if we are to guarantee the solvency \nor the existence of this program. And, third, we all agree, on both \nsides of the aisle, on the desire to preserve the integrity of the \nMedicare program.\n  We are not that far apart. From some of the remarks today--and I \nexpect there will be more later this afternoon and Monday--you would \nnot think that, but in truth we are not that far apart. And remember, \nit is in the best interest of every American that we must speak to and \naddress this issue of Medicare.\n  The board of trustees for the Medicare trust fund recommended that we \nreestablish an advisory council. In the Budget Committee, I offered the \namendment which is now part of this plan to create a bipartisan \ncommission on Medicare solvency. We are all trying to do the same \nthing; namely, to come up with solutions that protect Medicare's \nfuture. And I commend my distinguished colleague from Illinois, Mr. \nSimon, for joining me in support of pursuing bipartisan solutions to \nthese tough challenges that we all recognize are ahead.\n  It is my understanding that President Clinton believes Medicare \nreform must be confined to wholesale, complete, overall reform of our \nhealth care system, of all aspects. Well, that was rejected last year \nby the American people. I also understand that the two trustees \nrepresenting the public reported to Congress that Medicare urgently \nneeds to be addressed and, as I said earlier, should be considered as a \ndistinct legislative initiative.\n  I, for one, am willing to consider all solutions to Medicare's \ninsolvency. I would love to review plans put together in a bipartisan \neffort. The one thing I ask, because this is what my patients have told \nme, is that we must address Medicare's pending bankruptcy so it will be \nhere in the next 7 years. The President's budget clearly failed in that \ndepartment.\n  First, as a newcomer, I would appreciate learning from my colleagues, \nlearning from Senator Simon, who spoke out in support of this \nbipartisan commission. I would also like to hear from my colleague from \nNew York, Mr. Moynihan, about his thoughts for how together we can \nguarantee Medicare's future. As the ranking minority member of the \nFinance Committee and an expert in economic policy, he has much to \noffer us in this debate. And my colleague from Nebraska, Mr. Kerrey, \nwho served as chair of the Bipartisan Entitlement Commission, has been \na strong voice in the need to address the long term Medicare dilemma.\n  I know I can benefit from the expertise of my many colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle. Let us go at it in a bipartisan way.\n  The budget resolution before us should not be an argument driven by \neach and every special interest. Rather, I urge each of us to begin \nwith this plan, agreeing upon a target and follow that with an honest \npolicy debate on how to get us there.\n  Mr. President, right now, we are talking about Medicare. We are \ntalking about health care. We are looking for solutions. I caution my \ncolleagues not just to look for short-term solutions. We need to \nparticipate over the long haul.\n  There is no question that Congress must absolutely slow the rate of \ngrowth by finding Medicare savings just to shore up the trust fund in \nthe short term and buy us some time so we can address the program's \nlong-term future, but we cannot forget those fundamental problems. The \nbottom line is that we cannot end up in a situation addressing, as this \nbody has so many times in the past, only those short-term solutions.\n  The underlying problems will continue and our job will not be done \nuntil Medicare is restructured to prepare us all, to prepare this \ncountry, to prepare the program for the entrance of the post-World War \nII baby boom population. If we only try to slow the \n[[Page S6982]] growth in the near future, our attempts will be in vain.\n  We need structural Medicare reform--reform which expands choice.\n  My hope is that this will be the last budget resolution where we have \nto make some arbitrary provider payment cuts and across-the-board \nchanges to benefits or cost-sharing requirements. Part of my hope in \ncoming to the Senate was to share my experience and perspective with my \ncolleagues. I reach out to them in a bipartisan way, No. 1, to pass \nthis budget--it guarantees Medicare solvency--No. 2, to support the \nbipartisan commission outlined in this budget; and, No. 3, to join us \nall at the table as we develop a policy which will protect Medicare in \nthe future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Medicare amendment now \nbeing discussed.\n  I oppose the cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, and also in this budget \nresolution, I oppose the cuts in veterans' health care.\n  I rise in defense of the GI Joe generation. And who am I talking \nabout when I say the GI Joe generation? I am talking about the World \nWar II generation--the men who fought on the battlefront overseas and \nthe women who fought on the homefront here in our own communities; \nthose wonderful Rosie the Riveters who kept the United States of \nAmerica running while the men fought for democracy around the world.\n  Now they are our senior citizens. They are the very ones who are the \nbeneficiaries of Medicare and particularly the long-term care component \nof Medicaid. And they are the ones this budget will place an undue, \ndevastating, and debilitating burden on. That is why I oppose these \ncuts in Medicare and Medicaid.\n  In this budget, we are given cuts, not compassion. And here we are, \non the eve of Memorial Day. We just commemorated V-E Day. In a few \nmonths we will commemorate V-J Day and the end of World War II. And now \nwe are telling this gallant GI Joe generation that promises made are \nnot promises kept.\n  I am an appropriator. I once chaired the VA-HUD Subcommittee. I know \nabout budgets. And I know firsthand what these cuts will mean.\n  These are not numbers or statistics or line items. These are issues \nrelated to people's care--primary care, acute care, long-term care, and \nto making sure that people have the prosthetic devices they need.\n  Mr. President, I ask my fellow colleagues in the Senate: Have we no \ncharacter? Have we no memory of who these men and women are?\n  They are the men who fought from the shores of Normandy to Iwo Jima. \nAmerica's veterans fought to save Americans; they fought to save this \nWestern civilization; and they fought to defend the very principles \nthat this country was founded on.\n  These were the women, as I said, who were called the Rosies, who made \nsure that not only the schools and businesses operated, but they were \nthere making sure that we built airplanes, mobilized our defense, kept \nthe United States of America running. And when the war was over, they \nwent back home to raise their families, and they contributed to the \ngreatest prosperity that this country has ever seen. We would not be \nhere as a nation today, we would not be a superpower today, if it had \nnot been for the GI Joe generation.\n  They did not hesitate when they were called to service, whether it \nwas the battlefront or the homefront in their own neighborhoods and \ncommunities. They organized and mobilized to save America. They \norganized and mobilized to save Western civilization. And now they must \norganize and mobilize to save their very own health care.\n  Well, they are not alone. They should know I am on their side. I \nvalue them and I appreciate them. And that is why I oppose these cuts \nin Medicare and Medicaid and in veterans' health care.\n  This budget deals with Medicare and Medicaid. It proposes to cut $250 \nbillion in Medicare and $170 billion in Medicaid.\n  The Lautenberg-Rockefeller-Mikulski amendment seeks to reduce some of \nthe devastating effects and impacts that this would have on the very \npeople who rely on these programs.\n  Let us be clear. This is the single largest cut in the history of the \nMedicare Program.\n  What will it mean to the GI Joe generation? It will mean that senior \ncitizens in Maryland and throughout this Nation will have less access \nto health care. It will mean fewer visits to the doctor, reduced \npreventive care, including screenings for breast cancer and prostate \ncancer. It means fewer laboratory tells, such as delayed diagnosis for \ntreatable illnesses like pneumonia. And it will also mean fewer doctors \nand hospitals accepting Medicare patients--those very doctors and \nhospitals that are now willing to treat senior citizens.\n  There are going to be fewer home health care services and seniors \nwill have less access to lifesaving equipment, like oxygen and kidney \ndialysis.\n  The impact on long-term care is devastating. It will mean, in my own \nhome State, that 4,500 Marylanders, senior citizens, will see nursing \nhome care shrink in 1996 alone. They will see cuts in preventive care. \nThey will lose prescription drug benefits for chronic diseases like \nhigh blood pressure, angina, and colitis.\n  Mr. President, I am saying no to these cuts in Medicare. I am saying \nno to the cuts that would hold up treatment of heart disease and \nstrokes for Maryland's World War II veterans. I am saying no to the \ncuts that would delay the mother and grandmother in Maryland from \ngetting their yearly mammograms. I am saying no to these cuts.\n  Of course, we have to worry about sustainability and solvency of the \nMedicare and Medicaid programs. But while we are looking at the bottom \nline, let us make sure we do keep the ``care'' in Medicare; let us make \nsure we keep the ``security'' in Social Security; and let us keep the \n``aid'' in Medicaid.\n  Balancing the budget should not be about rhetoric or scoring \npolitical points. Balancing the budget should be about honoring the \ncontributions of the GI Joe generation, the generation who worked hard, \nplayed by the rules, created prosperity for this country. And it should \nbe about fighting for the future generations, as well.\n  This is a crucial time in our Nation's history, when we decide what \nkind of Nation we want to be, when we decide if promises made are \npromises kept, when we will decide if we will honor our mother and our \nfather, which is not only a good commandment to live by, but I believe \nit should also be strong public policy.\n  By supporting this amendment, I do believe that we take a stand as to \nwhere we will be going in the 21st century.\n  Fifty-five years ago, a great First Lady by the name of Eleanor \nRoosevelt stood before the American people at a political convention. \nEurope had been invaded, Poland was occupied, the blitz had begun in \nLondon. We were on the brink of war here. She said to the American \npeople that this was no ordinary time, and it called for no ordinary \neffort. And the people that she sent out that call of arms to were no \nordinary generation. They were the men and women who organized and \nmobilized an incredible war effort--and they made the difference and \nthey made no ordinary sacrifice.\n  So now, here we are on the brink of Memorial Day and there will be \nthose who will want to honor the GI Joe generation with platitudes and \nplaques and parades.\n I say we honor them by offering our gratefulness, our gratitude, our \nappreciation, and our commitment to them in the U.S. budget as we pass \nit.\n\n  So I hope when they call the roll, we will vote aye for the \nLautenberg-Rockefeller-Mikulski amendment and fight for this GI \ngeneration that fought so hard for us.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senate and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Arizona?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask that the Senator from Arizona may be permitted to \nspeak for whatever time he wants to, and I yield it in behalf of the \nminority.\n[[Page S6983]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed at this \ntime as part of the majority time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. President, I would like to correct one thing briefly before \nproceeding to the comments I intended to make. It is my understanding \nfrom the staff of the Budget Committee that the veterans medical care \nis not--I repeat ``not''--being cut under the Senate budget resolution. \nTo the contrary, under the President's plan, VA medical care is cut by \n$780 million by the year 2000. That is a cut under his 1995 budget \nnumbers.\n  Mr. President, as long as we are talking about promises made and \npromises kept, I think it is important for us to reflect a little bit \non the promises made in the last campaign for President. President \nClinton, of course, promised to give us a balanced budget. He said he \nwould submit a balanced budget. He bragged in his first year about \nsubmitting a budget that would get us to balance. This last budget, the \none we just rejected by an overwhelming 99-0 margin, of course, would \nnot get us to a balanced budget. As a matter of fact, it has deficits \nfor 5 years, averaging $200 billion a year, adding $1 trillion to the \nnational debt of this country.\n  So, Mr. President, in terms of promises made and promises kept, \ncertainly the President has not kept a promise that he has made to help \nus get to a balanced budget.\n  Insofar as the Democrats are concerned, many of them opposed the \nbalanced budget amendment when it was debated on this floor, arguing \nthat they did not need a constitutional constraint, they could do it \nwithout a requirement. Yet, today, we find that there is no Democrat \nalternative pending before us; none has been offered. The only one \ncoming from a Democrat--the President--was opposed by all Democrat \nSenators in this Chamber just a few hours ago.\n  So while our Democratic friends are very good about suggesting \nproblems with the approach we have taken, it is all negative, it is all \ncriticism. There is no constructive suggestion as to how we can achieve \na balanced budget. So I suggest when we are talking about promises made \nand promises kept, it is the Republicans--first in the House last night \nand in the Senate this week--who by Wednesday of next week will have \nkept the promises we made in the last election--promises made and \npromises kept.\n  That will be a good test for the voters next time we have an \nelection. Who promised to balance the budget and who is keeping their \npromise? I submit, Mr. President, that the voters will decide it has \nbeen the Republicans that have kept the promises that they made.\n  A few minutes ago we had on the floor of the Senate a chart, which \nwas the basis for the comments of the Senator from New Jersey, and the \nchart had the title, ``Whose Side Are You On?'' Much of the debate of \nthe Senator from New Jersey at that time focused on this division of \nour country, the winners and the losers in this entire debate.\n  It was typical of the politics of division, which are, frankly, the \npolitics of losers, the politics of fear, the politics of a zero-sum \ngame, of pitting one side against the other, pitting part of our \nsociety against another part of our society. It is the us-against-them \ngame, the rich versus the poor, the old versus the young. It is a zero-\nsum game, as I say.\n  They cannot conceive of any situation in which there are not winners \nand losers. In their view, if we balance the budget, there will be \nwinners and there will be losers. I submit, Mr. President, that if we \nbalance the budget, as the Republicans promise to do and as our budget \nsays we will do, we will all be winners. Every American will be a \nwinner under that scenario. And the fear that is being preached on the \nother side of the aisle here, that somehow there will be losers, will \nbe found to be incorrect. That for every winner there must be a loser \nis wrong historically, and it will be wrong under this budget.\n  The amendment that is on the floor right now attacks tax cuts for the \nrich. As the Senator from Oregon pointed out a while ago, there are no \ntax cuts for the rich in the Senate proposal. There are none. What the \namendment that is on the floor proposes is to take a sum of money--$100 \nbillion--and spend that money, even though it has not been created yet. \nThis is what we hope can be achieved as a result of achieving balance \nin the budget by the year 2002, as a result of reduced interest rates. \nAnd so because there is the potential that we will have saved that much \nmoney, Democrats are already suggesting to us in the amendment pending \non the floor ways to spend that money. They will not agree with us on \nthe budget to achieve that reserve or that windfall. They will not vote \nfor it. But they will sure as heck find a way to spend it.\n  That is what characterizes this entire debate. First, they say, no, \nwe do not need a balanced budget amendment; we can do it on our own. \nThen they say, no, we do not have any idea how we can do it on our own \nand we will not support yours, but we would like to spend what you \nsave. That is the amendment pending before us and the amendment we \nshould defeat.\n  The sponsors of this amendment attack our budget as ``hurting \nordinary Americans.'' That was an exact quotation of the Senator from \nNew Jersey. It is the failure to act that will hurt ordinary Americans.\n  But, Mr. President, I would like to really phrase it in a different \nway. Too many Democrats want to protect ordinary Americans. They would \nlike to keep them dependent on the Government. Most Republicans \ndisagree. Frankly, we do not think there is such a thing as an ordinary \nAmerican. We think all Americans are extraordinary, and that given the \nopportunity, they can all improve their own lives and the lives of \ntheir families. And that is what we are trying to do by balancing the \nbudget. We are trying to provide that opportunity for them so that all \nof the extraordinary Americans in this country can provide for \nthemselves without having to rely upon a Federal Government that taxes \nthem and regulates them to death.\n  We believe in opportunity, not dependency. We believe that almost all \nAmericans can achieve more for themselves and their families if they \nhave opportunity. But they will not have that opportunity if we \nbankrupt this country, and that is what will happen if we do not \nbalance the budget. That is what will happen if we do not adopt the \nbudget before us that will achieve balance by the year 2002.\n  Balancing the budget is about our future, about our children's \nfuture. It is about reducing the tax burden on our families, about \nallowing the Government to spend money on something other than interest \non the debt, about reducing interest rates. As a matter of fact, Mr. \nPresident, let me cite some statistics from the Joint Economic \nCommittee. According to the committee, the deficit adds a 2-percent \nsurtax on all interest rates; 2 percent more on car loans, student \nloans, credit cards, and on mortgages. Two percent on a $75,000 30-year \nmortgage, for example, adds up to $37,440 over the life of the loan. \nThat is what not balancing the budget is costing average Americans.\n  If current patterns continue, we will be spending $5.2 trillion on \ninterest payments over the next 15 years.\n  That is money we cannot spend on other things like health care, \nhousing, nutrition assistance for the poor, veterans care, or whatever.\n  By 1997, gross interest--$300 billion annually--will amount to about \nas much as we will spend on income security programs, the welfare, \nhousing, nutrition, AFDC, SSI, EITC, food stamps, education and \ntraining, employment and social services, all of these things combined. \nBut eliminating the deficit will result in lower interest rates, which \nwill, in turn, lead to the creation of an estimated 4.25 million jobs \nover the next 10 years, increased per capita incomes by over 16 \npercent, and will generate more revenue for Federal and State and local \ntreasuries as a result of increased economic activities.\n  So by balancing the budget, we will be assuring our children a \nbrighter future. In the last election, I was very troubled by the fact \nthat many people believed--and surveys confirmed this --that the next \ngeneration, our children's generation, will not have as much \nopportunity as we have had.\n   [[Page S6984]] Part of the election was about turning that around, \nabout changing the direction in our country so that we could guarantee \nthat our children and grandchildren would have the same opportunity \nthat we have had to make a better living for themselves.\n  The national debt now amounts to about $4.8 trillion. That is about \n$18,500 for every man, woman, and child in the country, about $74,000 \nof debt for the average family of four. Even if we balance the budget \nat this very moment, the average American family would be stuck with a \nbill of $74,000, an amount that rivals the size of the mortgage on a \nhome. In order to pay just the interest on that debt each year, the \naverage family would have to pay more than $5,000 annually in taxes. \nThat is $430 a month just in interest payments, and that assumes that \nCongress does not run any more budget deficits starting this very \nmoment.\n  Fortunately, this budget resolution will eliminate the deficits by \nthe year 2002. That compares with President Clinton's budget which \nwould have given us $200 billion deficits every year for the \nforeseeable future. Just to put this in perspective, for every year in \nwhich the Federal Government runs a $200 billion deficit, the average \nyoung person will pay an additional $5,000 in taxes over his or her \nlifetime. The $1 trillion in new debt that President Clinton proposed \nin his 5-year budget plan represents an additional $25,000 in taxes, an \nadditional $25,000 for every young man and woman.\n  So you see, Mr. President, why it is so important that we pass this \nbudget and balance the budget. It is for the future of our country. \nWhat will happen if we do not do it? That is the question. Our \ncolleagues on the other side, too many of them, ask what will happen if \nwe do. Somebody might be a loser, but everybody in this country will be \nlosers if we do not balance the budget.\n  The burden of the national debt does not just show up in people's tax \nbills. It also adds a surtax in interest, as I said. The estimate is \nthat the debt surtax adds about 2 percent to those interest rates. By \nbalancing the budget, we can help eliminate that surtax and make a home \npurchase more affordable, make it easier for families to send their \nchildren to college and to do all the other things we want our families \nto do.\n  I want to commend the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nDomenici, for his work in putting together this budget resolution, and \nall the members of the Budget Committee. It was not easy. Special \ninterests, their allies at the White House and others are already out \ntrying to destroy it.\n  The naysayers have not gotten the message the American people sent \nloudly and clearly in the last election that they want less spending, \nless Government and more freedom.\n  The critics have nothing to offer but fear. Their argument is to \nscare everybody about what will happen if we reduce spending. They do \nnot want us to cut spending. They are not even satisfied with some \nlimitation on the growth in spending. All they know is more spending, \nhigher taxes and bigger Government. It is a prescription for economic \ndisaster. The red ink has to stop. Look where Medicare is headed. The \nMedicare board of trustees say if nothing is done, the trust funds will \nbegin losing money in 1997 and go bankrupt by the year 2002.\n  Mr. President, I will have more to say about this Medicare issue \nlater. The Senator from Tennessee, who spoke eloquently on this issue \nand who is himself a physician, has made it very clear in his remarks \nthat we have to solve this problem of the Medicare trust, and if we do \nnot, every American will suffer.\n  We also have the question of tax cuts before us, but they are not in \nthis budget resolution. I will support the Gramm amendment which will \nprovide tax cuts because we believe that not only should American \nfamilies have more to spend of the money they have worked hard to earn, \nbut that tax cuts can actually assist us in generating more revenues to \nthe Treasury and providing more jobs and in stimulating the economy.\n  Mr. President, I am going to have more to say about those things \nlater. I would just like to close with this point. For me, there are \nthree very personal reasons to vote for this balanced budget \nresolution. Their names are Frances, Christopher, and Jonathan. Those \nare my three grandchildren. Born just a week ago today, Jonathan \nalready owns a share of the debt, $18,500 and growing. The last thing \nany of us wants is to leave our grandchildren a lower standard of \nliving, and yet that is precisely what will occur if we do not balance \nthe budget.\n  The last thing we want to leave our grandchildren and children is the \nobligation to pay the large and growing debt that we have accumulated \nto pay for things that we wanted, but that is exactly what will happen \nif we do not get the Federal budget under control.\n  So I urge my colleagues not only to oppose the amendment which is \nbefore us but to support the budget resolution from the Budget \nCommittee, because it offers us the way to a brighter future for \nourselves, for our generation, for our children and, as I say, for \nthose grandchildren that we care so very much about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself such time as I might use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have been listening to the debate over \nthe course of the afternoon and before making some particular remarks \non the amendment that is before us, it is perhaps useful to try and put \nthis whole debate into some historical context.\n  I was here in 1981 when we had the Reagan budget. I happened to be 1 \nof 11 Members of the U.S. Senate that voted against it because of what \nit was going to do to the size of the Federal deficit. We heard at that \ntime, ``What we are embarked upon is a new federalism. All we have to \ndo is see these massive tax cuts, dramatic increases in defense \nspending, and we are going to stimulate the economy and we are going to \nbe able to have balanced budgets.''\n  At that time, we had a $450 billion deficit. At the end of 12 years, \nwe had a $4.7 trillion deficit. I yielded time to someone on the other \nside and they said, ``Well, the Democrats controlled the Congress.''\n  Let us not forget. There was only one time during that whole period \nof time that the Reagan recommendations to the Congress were less than \nwhat was actually appropriated--less.\n  So when I listen to all this talk about how we ought to examine where \nthe Democrats have been and where they are, I can ask our good friends, \nwhere are those speeches now when we followed their advice some years \nago and put this country into the kind of deficit that the Senator from \nArizona has talked about and complained about?\n  So we ought to look a little bit about where we are. The fact of the \nmatter is, if we did not have the kind of deficits that have been run \nup over the period of the last 12 years, effectively our budget would \nbe balanced. It was their economic policy that put us in here. And it \nwas the economic policies that were accepted in this body without one \nsingle Republican vote that moved us to reduce the Federal deficit by \n$800 billion and also provided some incentives, some financial \nincentives for those Americans who are at the lower level of the \neconomic ladder--the working Americans, those who are making $26,000.\n  Effectively, they have about a $1,100 benefit from it. Well, no \nlonger, not under this budget. No longer, not under this budget. They \nhave closed that down as well. They have taken the EITC away. A program \nthat was even supported by President Reagan years ago, they closed that \nprogram down.\n  So when they talk with crocodile tears about equity and they talk \nabout who has been benefiting, it was during that period of time, from \nthe 1980's to the 1990's, when the wealthy got wealthier and the \nworking class got poorer. That is what has happened over that period of \ntime. What is repugnant to many Members of the Senate is now that we \nare taking those Americans who are the most vulnerable--our elderly and \nin instances our young people, the millions of children who are on the \nMedicaid Program--and putting them at further risk and saying, ``Well, \nwe have to do that, we have to do that, what are the alternatives?\n  There is no cutting here with regard to corporate welfare in this \nprogram. In the House of Representatives, Mr. [[Page S6985]] Kasich had \na bundle of $25 billion, and the powers that be in the Republicans \nsaid, ``Oh, no, put that aside.''\n  Why is it the Budget Committee had time to consider raising taxes on \nthe working poor and did not have the time to put taxes on the \nbillionaires that are forfeiting their citizenship in order to escape \ntaxes?\n  They did not have the time to do that. They could not give that \nconsideration. They need to study that more. They did not need to study \nhow to put more taxes on working families. No, they did not need to \nstudy that. They have to study about how to put on some taxes on the \nbillionaires that are renouncing their American citizenship after they \nhave made their resources here, to go to another land and not pay their \nfair share. They could not think about that.\n  They could not find, out of all the tax expenditures, any funds for \nhelp and assistance. They could not look into the kinds of grazing fees \nor the kind of mining agreements or other kinds of subsidies that are \ntaking place out there. They could not even find nickels and dimes in \nthere. No, they could not.\n  So we are faced with this. We have a serious issue and problem. The \nlast time that I read the Lautenberg-Rockefeller-Murkowski-Kennedy-\nMurray amendment, it said that in the little honey pot that has been \ndesignated out there, the $170 billion that can grow up to $350 billion \nin the outyears, all it says now that is that it can be used for tax \ncuts.\n  We know what the purposes are. There can be those that want to deny \nthat on the floor. Except the majority leader has indicated that he is \nfor a tax cut. Senator Gramm of Texas says he is for a tax cut. \nRepublicans say they are for the tax cut.\n  All we are saying is, put it into Medicare. Put it back into \nMedicare. If they are going to have it there, make sure it goes on back \nto Medicare.\n  Mr. President, I think it is fair to put Congress into some kind of \nunderstanding about where we are at this particular time. There is \nnothing in terms of the amendment that is before Members that will \nundermine the basic structure of the budget resolution that comes out. \nMany Members have and will have different amendments on that, that will \ndeal with education and also deal with the earned-income tax credit.\n  I see my colleague and friend from Washington, who addresses that \nissue with such eloquence and knowledge, and I think, with such \nfairness, about what the implications are for working families.\n  Then, Mr. President, we hear about the questions of fear, those who \nare say this should not be fearmongering. I will say, Mr. President, \nthat senior citizens ought to have a concern when we are talking about \nthe kinds of cuts in Medicare--and I will get into that in a few \nmoments--that we are talking about and also the kinds of cuts that will \nbe in Social Security. I will come back to that.\n  This is the stealth cut on Social Security. Stealth cut on Social \nSecurity. Remember all the speeches--``We are not going to touch Social \nSecurity.'' This budget does. I will come back to that in just a few \nmoments.\n  The fact is when our seniors are living at the edge, they ought to be \nconcerned about this. We hear, well, look what happened last year. We \nhad President Clinton talking about how growth is not really a cut in \nterms of the Social Security and the cuts in Medicare.\n  The fact of the matter is, under the health reform bill last year, \nmore was put in than was taken out under the Medicare. More was put in \nthan was taken out. That was in the prescription drugs and also in the \nlong-term care provisions.\n  That is not what we are talking about here. We are talking about the \nmajor cuts that are going to be used for tax cuts for the wealthy.\n  Now, our friends on the other side can talk about where the President \nwas last year and try to confuse the debate. It should not be confused \namong the American people. They knew they were going to get help and \nassistance on prescription drugs and they knew they were going to get \nhelp and assistance on long-term care.\n  My friends, all that will happen under this Medicare proposal if this \nbudget goes through and it is followed through will be very, very \nsignificant cuts.\n  Now, another argument that I have heard this afternoon, well, where \nis the President's program? Where is the President's program? The \nPresident said where it will be. He said, just drop that tax cut, \nindicate how we want to change Medicare in terms of health care reform. \nHealth care reform is important because Medicare and Medicaid are a \nquarter of the Nation's health care expenditures. We will not be able \nto get a real handle on those expenditures unless we do the total, all \nfour quarters. That is the only way we will ever reform the system, the \nonly way we will stop the cost shifts that are taking place in every \nhospital in this country. Everyone in this body understands it and \nknows it. We have to deal with it in the totality. That is what the \nPresident said. Deal with Medicare in terms of overall reform.\n  Eliminate the cuts in education. I am amazed at the kind of cuts we \nare facing in terms of education. We passed last year the reform of our \nHead Start program, on the basis of a bipartisan review, and we had \noverwhelming support--I do not think there were five votes against the \nHead Start program. At least 500,000 young people will be cut out of \nthe Head Start Program under this budget. We revamped the chapter I \nprogram, and had an important debate about allocations of resources and \nformulas, about how we would try to meet the greatest needs in our \nshifting population, a result of the flow of migrants, which has a \nsignificant impact in this country. We spent a lot of time on that \nmatter. Republicans and Democrats alike, bipartisan support, \nrestructured that program.\n  Even on the Goals 2000 program we had bipartisan support. On the \nschool-to-work program, Gov. Tommy Thompson, a Republican from the \nState of Wisconsin, thinks it is one of the most important and \nsignificant education programs to come down the line. Ask the former \nRepublican Governor from the State of Maine, who has written a book \nabout it. I was with him yesterday and we celebrated the 1-year \nanniversary. He talked about the difference it has made in the lives of \nthe young people in his State. Bipartisan support. We moved to a direct \nloan program for higher education. Bipartisan support.\n  Each and every one of those programs--bipartisan support. And we got \nsome funding for those programs. Effectively, this budget is going to \nemasculate those programs.\n  I will go through this at another time when we come to the education \ndebate. What is it? Is this allegedly what the vote for change was \nabout last fall? I do not believe so. I do not believe so. I do not \nthink that people in any part of this country, if we are asking, think \nthat those are the areas that we want to cut. And these are the cuts \nthat are being made in this particular budget area. And we will come \nback to those. I do not think that is what the people are asking.\n  The President has indicated his willingness to move forward in a \nbipartisan manner, dropping the tax cuts, put the Medicare proposals in \nterms of a comprehensive reform program, and to continue commitment to \neducation.\n  Education, when I came here, for the first 20 years was a bipartisan \neffort. We never had a single partisan debate on education policy until \nvery recent times. Everything was virtually a bipartisan effort. It was \ntrue in this body and the other. And bipartisan even in the last year \nwhen we were moving into a difficult election cycle and period, we were \nstill together in terms of the bipartisan nature of the education \nprograms. Those programs now have been undermined.\n  Mr. President, we are talking in this debate about fairness. We are \ntalking about equity. We are talking about the impact of these budget \ncuts on working families. They all hit working families. Cut back on \nthat Medicare program and we are hitting the parents of working \nfamilies. We cut back on the student loan program and we are hitting \nthe sons and daughters of working families. We cut back on the Head \nStart Program, the other kinds of support programs, chapter I--we are \nhitting the sons and daughters of working families.\n  Basically, this amendment is saying we have to make some adjustments \nin Medicare, but do not put your greedy, budget-cutting hands on \nMedicare in [[Page S6986]] order to provide a tax cut for wealthy \nindividuals.\n  Now, we ought to be able to agree on that. That is what the issue is. \nWe want to restate it, reconstruct it, and say OK, we will do it. That \nis the point.\n  Mr. President, we have heard other Republican arguments in support of \ntheir cuts. The first argument is total Medicare spending will continue \nto grow under their plan, so there has not been a real cut. The second \nis, as I mentioned, that the Clinton plan cut Medicare just as much as \nthe Republican plan, so the Republican cuts must be OK.\n  There seems to be a double standard here. When you do not keep up \nwith inflation in the Defense Department budget, that is a cut. That is \na cut. When you do not keep up with inflation in Medicare, that is an \nincrease. I hope our friends are going to explain that, why, if we do \nnot keep up in terms of inflation in DOD, we are going to see that as \nreal cut in terms of our national security. That is what the debate is. \nWe have heard it. We understand it. We know it and it is a policy \ndecision that has to be addressed.\n  But let us address it all fair and square. Let us say we understand \nthat and now we are either going to increase it or not increase it. \nSenior citizens are not stupid. They know what is a cut and what is \nnot. Under this proposal they will pay $442 more a year for their part \nB premiums than they would under current law. That is a cut and it \ncomes straight out of their Social Security check. It comes right out \nof their Social Security check.\n  So much for the promise never to cut Social Security. They know that \nunder this proposal they are likely to see a doubling of their part B \ndeductible to $200. When you have to pay an additional $100 to go to \nthe doctor, that is a cut. And under this proposal they are likely to \nsee a new 20 percent coinsurance increase for home health services. \nThis means that of the very sick lower-income women over the age of 75 \nwho need home care, most will pay an additional $3,800 a year. When \nMedicare gives you $3,800 less protection, that is a cut.\n  Overall, on average, senior citizens are going to pay an additional \n$900 per year when the plan is fully phased in; $3,200 over 7 years. An \nelderly couple will pay an additional $1,800 a year and $6,400 over the \nnext 7 years. Our Republican friends may not call that a cut but every \nsenior knows that when your Medicare program will not buy you the \nhealth care you need at a price you can afford, your standard of living \nhas been cut. And that is just plain wrong.\n  The Medicare cuts in the Health Security Act were not comparable to \nthe ones proposed today. I would like to address that particular issue.\n  Mr. President, I want to just take a moment or two of the Senate's \ntime to explain how this particular proposal that is before us now, the \nbudget, is really a cut in Social Security; a cut in Social Security. \nWe remember the debates we had. ``We are not going to cut in Social \nSecurity.''\n  In regards to the part B proposal, in the 1993 OBRA we established a \ncertain dollar figure that represented the 31 percent of the part B \npremium. But that was really higher than was expected under the \nagreements that were decided in the early 1980's under the 1990 tax \nbill, and without the changes in this budget proposal, it was intended \nthat the premium would go down to 25 percent. It would go down to 25 \npercent. But the Budget Committee now is not letting it decline to 25 \npercent but setting it at 31.5 percent from now and continuing. It was \ngoing to go down.\n  When I hear on the floor we are just extending the current law, the \ncurrent law, if you did not touch it and did not extend it, the premium \nwould go down. It would go down to 25 percent. They are continuing it \nat 31.5 percent. So what happens? You get an increase if you are in the \nbottom percentile for Social Security. You would get your increase on \nthe COLA, but with a 33 percent cut due to the part B premium \nincrease--that $161 which was to represent the increase in the COLA is \nnow $27. That is a cut in terms of what you were going to get in Social \nSecurity. The part B premium is part of Social Security. It is \nvoluntary, but basically there is uniform acceptance, and \nunderstandably so, in light of doctors' fees. And that cut is right \nacross the board. The 25th percentile, or the average, is where the cut \nwould come. The real COLA will be down some 57 percent; instead of \ngetting $237, you get $103; instead of getting $303 for those with \n$10,000 or more you end up with $169. That is a real cut in the Social \nSecurity.\n  The Republican budget will raise premiums and reduce Social Security \nby more than $1,750 per senior over the life of this budget. If you did \nnot have that provision written into the budget by the Budget \nCommittee, if that provision concurred with existing law where it was \ndown to only 25 percent, every senior citizen would have $1,750 more \nover the life of this budget plan.\n  So, that is a cut in terms of real income. For whom? For Social \nSecurity recipients. And for an elderly couple the reduction in the \nSocial Security check will be a whopping $3,500. Next year alone, as a \nresult of the Republican budget, the seniors will see a premium \nincrease of $134 compared to current law. That will cut out more than \nhalf of the average COLA increase of $237. Lower-income seniors will \nlose 83 percent of their COLA. The last time the Republicans tried to \ncut the Social Security COLA they were forced to back down. Now they \nare trying to do it by stealth, but it is not going to work.\n  It is not only through Medicare that the Republicans are attacking \nSocial Security. Look what has happened over in the House budget. In \nthe House budget the Republicans have arbitrarily assumed an \nunprecedented and unilateral reduction of CPI (Consumer Price Index) by \nsix-tenths of 1 percent; the goal or effect of this change is to rob \n$23 billion in Social Security benefits over the next 7 years. There is \nthe House Republican tax break for the top 1 percent of the incomes, \nthose over $200,000. The House Republicans' six-tenths of 1 percent on \nthe Consumer Price Index is $23 billion of that.\n  There are those who can say look, we have reviewed this. The Consumer \nPrice Index was worked out in the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It has \nbeen there over a very considerable number of years, with Republicans \nand Democrats. Maybe it ought to be adjusted. Maybe it ought to be \nchanged. Maybe it ought to be altered. But is it not interesting that \nthe time the Republicans alter it is the time they wanted the resources \nfor the taxes for the wealthiest individuals in the country?\n  I mean, at least make the adjustments and change at a neutral time. \nConvince the American people that this has nothing to do with trying to \nget additional resources to give to the benefit of the wealthiest \nindividuals. Do it at a neutral time and have those hearings in both \nthe House and Senate. Do it at a neutral time. But that is not the way \nit was done. It was tied in to this particular budget resolution.\n  I personally think that there ought to be an adjustment. I think \nthere ought to be an adjustment. And I think when you have a real kind \nof evaluation of the adjustment you are going to find out that seniors \nare the ones who are paying more for the most important items that are \nabsolutely essential in their lives: More for their rent, more for \ntheir food, more for their health care. Look at what has happened to \nhealth care since the time Medicare has been put in. Where $1 out of \n$12 was being used for health care, now it is $1 out of $5 or $1 out of \n$4, that is being used to pay for health care.\n  If you say there are certain items that ought to be weighted in order \nto be able to live with some degree of dignity in our society, some \ndegree of peace, some degree of security, I think a careful evaluation \nof this program would indicate that they probably are being \nshortchanged. Maybe yes or maybe no. Maybe yes or maybe no. But one \nthing I do understand, and that is that this change, this alteration--\nwhether it has the support of Mr. Greenspan, whom I respect, and other \neconomists--we can listen to the same number of economists who feel the \nother way, who do not support these kinds of reductions. It should not \nhave been done as part of a budget program to provide for those kinds \nof benefits. It is basically and fundamentally wrong.\n  So, how can any budget plan that purports to be part of a Contract \nWith America break America's contract with the elderly? It is bad \nenough to propose these deep cuts in Medicare at [[Page S6987]] all. It \nis even worse to make these cuts in order to pay for an undeserved and \nan unneeded tax cut for the wealthiest Americans.\n  The cuts in Medicare are unpleasant--$256 billion over the next 7 \nyears by the time the plan is fully phased in. The average senior \ncitizen will likely have to pay $900 more a year in Medicare premiums \nand out-of-pocket costs, and an elderly couple would have to pay $1,800 \nover the life of the budget, in additional costs. The typical senior \ncitizen needing home health services would pay an additional $1,200. If \nanyone is sick enough to need the full home care, they will have to pay \n$2,400.\n  The fundamental unfairness of this proposal is plain. Because of the \ngap, senior citizens already pay too much for the health care they \nneed. The average elderly American pays an outstanding one-fifth of \ntheir income to cover health care costs, more than they paid before \nMedicare was even enacted 30 years ago.\n  The reason we enacted Medicare was because the elderly faced a health \ncare crisis then. The lower income older seniors pay even more than \none-fifth of their income for health care, and Medicare does not even \ncover prescription drugs. The coverage for nursing home care is \nlimited.\n  I see other colleagues who I know want to address the Senate. But let \nme just conclude finally in this debate so our senior citizens \nunderstand exactly where we are during the course of this debate and \ndiscussion.\n  At the start of this session, we heard a great deal about how we \nwanted to make sure that all the laws that we passed in the Congress \nwere going to be applicable to the Members of Congress. The Democrats \nsupported that. The Republicans supported it. It would have passed last \nCongress. It passed now. We have supported it, and we are glad. We have \nheard a lot of speeches about it at the start of the year, and we will \ncontinue to hear about it.\n  There is an interesting other side of the story that we do not hear \nvery much about; that is, why are we not providing for the American \npeople what we are providing for ourselves? We have said we will \nprovide for ourselves what we have extended in laws to the American \npeople.\n  The other side of that is that we have a very good health care \nprogram; very good, indeed. Are we debating here on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate how we are going to provide for the seniors the kind of \nhealth care bill that we have? Oh, no. We are talking about cutting \ntheirs. And we heard last year, well, if you look at the Members of \nCongress and the senior citizens, you can say, ``Well, you know, we \nchanged it now with the Members of Congress. We are capping them. We \nare going to cap the amount.'' My Lord. When we talked about that last \nyear, that was price fixing. We cannot do that. We cannot talk about \nthat. That was price fixing.\n  At least we are making some attempt to try to deal with it. But let \nus take a little look where the average senior citizen is, and where we \nare and where we are going under this budget proposal. The average \nannual income, $133,600 (for a Senator); the average annual income for \nsenior citizens, $17,700--$17,700 for those senior citizens.\n  The monthly premium, individual, part B, is $46.10. This is the one \nthat is going to rise on up under the proposal of the budget.\n  The deductible for Members of Congress, $350--$816 for our senior \ncitizens. And they are going in one direction; they are going up.\n  Hospital care, unlimited; for the senior citizens, limited; \nprescription drugs, covered; and not covered for the senior citizens.\n  Go in to any room of senior citizens in this country. Ask them, ``How \nmany of you are paying $50 a month or more for prescription drugs?'' \nHalf the hands will go up. Ask them how many are paying $25. Do you \nknow what you get? You get a roar of amazement, like they cannot \nbelieve you do not understand that 70, 75, 80 percent of them are \npaying $25--closer to $50--but $25 a month out of their Social Security \nchecks for prescription drugs, the prices of which have gone way up as \nthey have for the last 2 or 3 years.\n  We have that kind of coverage. We have that kind of coverage, not \nsenior citizens. There is nothing in this bill to try to deal with \nthat.\n  On dental care, we are covered with a good program. They are not \ncovered at all. And preventive services, we have the cervical, prostate \ncancer, and other preventive diseases. They have some benefits. Out of \npocket limit, $3,750. They have none. It is $3,750, for Members of \nCongress, but they have none.\n  You would think most people around here would think: ``How are we \ngoing to have this group look more like that group?'' That is what you \nnormally would think that we ought to be debating around here.\n  How many of you are going to let the senior citizens have closer to \nwhat Members of Congress have and 10 million Federal employees have? \nThat is what we ought to be debating around here. Instead, what we are \ntalking about here is how we are going to make this less valuable, with \nincreases in each and every one of these categories. Not so over here; \nnot so for the Members of Congress. But over here, for who? Our senior \ncitizens who are averaging $17,700 in annual income; and Members of \nCongress, $133,600.\n  Mr. President, this is the reason that the President of the United \nStates was saying: Look, you want to try to figure out how we can try \nto deal with health care as a way of making it fair and equitable, \nkeeping our citizens healthier, enhancing preventive programs so that \nit will be less costly, keeping elderly people out of the emergency \nroom, and being able to treat them with in-home care, in congregate \nsites in their communities. You want to try to deal with those kinds of \nissues, home care and other issues, but do not provide further cuts on \nour senior citizens to have a designated fund that will be available--\nnot just for education, not just for health care reform, but for tax \nreduction.\n  We will hear, ``Well, this really is not a fund. We do not know \nwhether it will be there. And if it is, we may use it, and we may \nprovide a lot of tax cuts for all the people that we are concerned \nabout.''\n  It is so interesting that we could look at the background to know \nwhere those tax cuts will come, both in the House and the Senate, as \nthose that have been designated for the wealthiest individuals.\n  So, Mr. President, this debate is important. It is important because \nof the issue of Medicare. It is important not because of just the \ndollars and cents, although we focus a great deal on the dollars and \ncents; it is important because of the degree of anxiety that is going \nto be out there for our seniors.\n  We do not give much weight to the problems of anxiety that affect our \npeople. We cannot put into the budget what a parent thinks when they \nhave a sick child crying in the night and they are wondering whether \nthat child is $150 sick, because that is what it costs to go to the \nemergency room. ``Maybe I should wait a day or 2 days, and let that \nchild get better or sicker because I cannot afford that $150.'' We do \nnot measure that in this budget resolution.\n  We treat it too cavalierly, the kind of concerns that elderly people \nhave, those that have lost their eyeglasses and wait 6 or 8 weeks \nwithout being able to read a book because they have not gotten their \nnext Social Security check to be able to buy a set of eyeglasses, let \nalone the other problems that you have. Every Member in here hears from \nthem.\n  Medicare does not cover dental care. How many Members in here spend \nstaff time trying to get a doctor that will say an elderly person has \nindigestion or major internal problems, and the only reason they have \nit is because they are not chewing properly and, therefore, in order to \nsolve an internal problem, they need to get a set of dentures?\n  I mean, that is going on every single day, the amount of staff time \npeople spend, the anxiety that people have. The same is true of foot \ncare. The same is true with the tragedy of prescription drugs.\n  I want to conclude with the very story of two witnesses that I had \nlast year, one named Clifford Towne, who lived with his wife, Marie, in \nSouth Dartmouth, MA.\n  Clifford Towne is a veteran who fought in World War II. He worked \nhard all his life in the textile business, and when he retired he had \nover $100,000 in the bank. He owned his own home. He had a good pension \nfrom Social Security. Both he and his wife developed serious medical \nproblems. High medical costs that Medicare does not cover, especially \nthe prescription drugs, had [[Page S6988]] wiped out his savings. He \nhad to run up large debts, and, as he told our committee, he tried to \nqualify for Medicaid but his Social Security income was too high.\n  He said:\n\n       I told him the only way I could get help for my wife was to \n     leave her, but after 48 years I just couldn't do that. I \n     would rather kick the bucket than be forced to get a divorce.\n       So my wife and I talked it over and decided that when we \n     could not pay for the drugs anymore, we would just have to \n     stop taking the prescription drugs. We would rather pass away \n     together--or at least as close together as we can. After 3 or \n     4 months ago I already cut down on drugs for my blood \n     pressure. I don't want my wife to have to cut down on her \n     medications until we have no other choice.\n\n  Mr. President, that is happening every single day in every single \ncommunity of this country. And this debate ought to be how we are going \nto try to help and assist that family--not how we are going to put that \nfamily at even greater risk with the kind of cuts that are included in \nthis budget proposal that attacks the Medicare Program.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, it \nis my intent to speak for 15 minutes. The Chair will please notify me \nat the end of 15 minutes.\n  Mr. President, in listening to my friend from Massachusetts, it is \ninteresting to note that he did not say ``here is a better idea.'' It \nis interesting to note that he did not say the President had a better \nidea. I believe the Senator from Massachusetts voted against the \nPresident's budget. I would say he was right because the President's \nbudget needed to be voted down. The President's budget allows the \ndeficit to continue to climb. The President in his state of the union \nspeech and in his campaign speeches said he was going to bring the \ndeficit down, but, unfortunately, that is rhetoric. That is not fact.\n  The facts are that under the President's budget the deficit goes up \nevery single year and it is shocking to see how rapidly it goes up. As \na matter of fact, under the President's budget the deficit increases by \n$100 billion in the first 5 years. The deficit right now is $177 \nbillion, in 1995. Under the President's budget, in the year 2000, it \ngoes up to $276 billion. That is a $99 billion increase.\n  By balancing the budget for the first time in 29 years, we have a \nchance to make history. The House of Representatives made history when \nthey passed a budget last night that says, as scored by the \nCongressional Budget Office, we are going to eliminate the deficit.\n  The President's budget as scored by the Office of Management and \nBudget has deficits that stay at $200 billion for the next 5 years and \nthen go up to $300 billion. But the President in his State of the Union \nAddress in 1993 said he was not going to use fictional numbers; he was \nnot going to use smoke and mirrors. He stated that he would use the \nestimates of the Congressional Budget Office. The Congressional Budget \nOffice says that his deficit increases nearly every single year.\n  Next year, under the President's budget, the deficit increases from \n$177 billion to $211 billion, then to $232 billion in 1997. By 1998, it \nis $256 billion; in the year 2000, $276 billion. So in a clear trend \nthe deficit is going up $100 billion in 5 years under the President's \nproposal and really crossing $300 billion by the year 2002.\n  We have a clear alternative. The House voted for a budget plan that \nbrings the deficit down to zero. In the Senate, we now have a plan that \nbrings the deficit down to zero. That is a big difference. That means \nwe will be borrowing significantly less.\n  I know I heard my friend from Massachusetts say, we are slashing \nspending; we are cutting; we are eliminating spending in many programs. \nI will put a table in the Record that shows spending under the \nRepublican budget in Medicare. In 1996, we will be spending $9 billion \nmore than we did in 1995 in Medicare. In 1997, we will be spending $20 \nbillion more than we did in 1995. In 1998, we will be spending $35 \nbillion more than we did in 1995. $50 billion in 1999, $66 billion in \nthe year 2000, $84 billion in the year 2001, over $100 billion more in \nMedicare spending in the year 2002 than we are spending in 1995.\n  Medicare spending is going up. It may not be going up as fast as it \nwould be under present law but present law says it goes broke. The \nPresident is AWOL, or absent without leadership, because he does not do \nanything to save the Medicare system. He allows it to go broke. The law \ndoes not allow Medicare to borrow from other trust funds so unless we \nraise payroll taxes or reduce the growth of spending, it is going to go \nbroke. That is not acceptable.\n  Now we have two plans, the House and Senate. The President does not \nhave a plan. The President's plan was renounced by the Senate today 99 \nto nothing.\n  Looking at this chart of deficit estimates, the President's deficit \ngoes up every year. This line represents the House budget plan. I \ncompliment them. They were able to pass it in 1 or 2 days. It is going \nto take us 5 days, but we will eventually pass it. The Senate plan \nshows up on this chart as almost a straight-line decline to get to a \nbalanced budget. We even do it faster than the House does. Of course, \nthe House has some tax cuts. The House gets there. We get there \nquicker. Frankly, I hope we stay on a quick, straight, level decline to \nget to a balanced budget because that means we are going to borrow less \nin these intervening years. And that is what we should do. We should \nbalance the budget as soon as possible.\n  Now, my colleague from Massachusetts said we are not going to be \nspending enough. He said we need to spend more money, I heard him say \nwe should be spending more money in education; we should be spending \nmore money on earned income tax credits; we should be spending more \nmoney for Medicare; we should be spending more money for Medicaid; I \nthink I heard him say we should be spending more money for every single \nprogram with the exception of defense.\n  Looking at this new chart, you see right now we are spending $1.5 \ntrillion, and I would like to put that in perspective because I know my \ncolleagues on the other side seem to think we are not spending enough. \nTo put it in perspective, in 1960, we spent less than $100 billion. In \n1970, we spent less than $200 billion. In 1980, we spent less than $600 \nbillion. In 1990, we spent about $1.25 trillion. And now we are at $1.5 \ntrillion. Amazingly enough, even under the so-called slashing, cutting, \ngutting budget of Senator Domenici total spending will still go up to \n$1.8 trillion.\n  My math may not be accurate, but $1.8 trillion is a lot more money \nthan $1.5 trillion. As a matter of fact, that is about $350 billion \nmore after 7 years than this year. Actually, spending goes up every \nsingle year, in almost every category except defense which is is \nbasically frozen.\n  I have a table which shows that show under the present budget does \nnot even stay frozen at $270 billion. It actually declines for a few \nyears and then comes back up. Domestic discretionary spending has a \nslight reduction. We reduce it by $30 billion. With regard to Social \nSecurity--and I know I heard my colleague from Massachusetts say \nseveral times that we are cutting Social Security--we are spending $334 \nbillion in 1995, and we are going to be spending $480 billion in Social \nSecurity in the year 2002. Medicare spending will grow from $178 \nbillion in 1995 to $283 billion in 2002. That is over a $100 billion \nincrease in Medicare; Medicaid, this year we are spending $89 billion. \nIt goes up to $125 billion. Other mandatory programs increases from \n$146 billion to $197 billion.\n  My point is, spending is escalating. It escalates from $1.5 trillion \nto almost $1.9 trillion. To put that in perspective, when we are \ntalking about spending $1.5 trillion--there are 12 zeros in $1 \ntrillion. That is about $6,000 for every man, woman, and child in the \nUnited States. I have a family of six. That is $36,000. Under the \nRepublican budget, spending increases to about $7,500 for every man, \nwoman, and child in the United States.\n  Under President Clinton's proposal, spending would grow to about \n$8,500 for every man, woman, and child in the United States.\n  So we allow spending to grow but it does not grow quite so fast. \n[[Page S6989]] \n  A lot of people are talking about Medicare going broke by the year \n2002. The trust fund will be bankrupt.\n  I hate to inform my colleagues, but by the year 1997, that is next \nyear, the Medicare trust fund already has a deficit. In 1997, there is \na $5 billion deficit and in 1998 there is a $10 billion deficit. That \ndeficit continues to escalate to the year 2002 when it reaches $41 \nbillion. So we are losing money already. That means more money is going \nout than coming in.\n  Some people, say, ``Well, we will just draw down the reserves of the \nMedicare trust fund.'' How are we drawing down the trust fund? There is \nno bank account. If there is a bank account anywhere in Washington, DC, \nthat we can pull those funds out of, I would like to know about it.\n  The facts are, we are going to borrow that money. Actually, the \nGeneral Treasury will borrow $125 billion between now and the year 2002 \nto pay to the Medicare trust fund, which will in turn pay benefits. \nThere is not a bank account which holds excess Medicare taxes from \nprevious years. Not in First National, not in Chase, and not in City \nBank. We are going to borrow the money to pay Medicare benefits. The \nfund is already broke.\n  But we have heard so much rhetoric, ``Oh, we can't allow these \nMedicare spending cuts. This is going to cut Medicare recipients.''\n  The facts are, if we do not reduce the rate of growth in Medicare \nspending we are going to have to raise payroll taxes. And I have not \nheard one of my colleagues yet who said, ``Let's raise payroll taxes to \nsave the Medicare system.'' If they think that is an option they should \nuse, let them offer that as an amendment.\n  But if we do not do that, we must reduce the rate of growth of this \nprogram. Those are our only options.\n  As I mentioned before, the law precludes us from borrowing from other \ntrust funds. And we should not do that anyway. That is playing a shell \ngame. The Medicare tax right now is 2.9 percent on all payroll. That is \na lot of money. The program has been growing in cost at rates that are \nnot acceptable. These claims are not just from Don Nickles. They come \nfrom President Clinton, and Mrs. Clinton, and Secretary Shalala, and \nthe other trustees of the Medicare trust fund. All have said we have to \nreform the system.\n  And we can reform the system. We can do a better job of providing \nhealth care for senior citizens at lower rates of growth, at rates of \ngrowth that are right now a couple of times the rate of inflation. \nRight now, they are three times the rate of inflation. We are trying to \nsay it should be no more than two times the rate of inflation.\n  Is that realistic? Yes, it is. Can it be done? Yes, it can. Actually, \nit has to be done or the fund is going to go broke. Then what are we \ngoing to do? In the year 2002, we are not going to pay the bill. We \nwill tell people, ``I'm sorry you went to the hospital. I know you owe \nmoney. But we can't pay you.'' That is not acceptable.\n  I will just mention that there is a lot of rhetoric on Medicare and a \nlot of demagoguery. I know a lot of people are trying to scare senior \ncitizens, but I think they are smarter than that.\n  This chart shows that under current policy the rate of growth in \nMedicare is not sustainable. Under the plan that we now have in the \nbudget before us, the growth rate of Medicare is a little over 7 \npercent per year. That will keep the fund solvent at least temporarily \nso we will not be bouncing checks.\n  This line represents a freeze on Medicare and Medicaid. I have heard \na lot of my colleagues say, ``Let's freeze all spending.'' That is what \na freeze is. I doubt that we will long hear that argument.\n  I think it is vitally important, Mr. President, that we be \nresponsible. I think it is vitally important that we say, no, we are \nnot going to allow deficits to continue to increase, we are not going \nto take a deficit right now that is $177 billion and allow it to go up \nto $277 or $300 billion. That is not responsible. That is not \nleadership.\n  I looked at the current services budget and it just happens to track \nright along with President Clinton's figures. There are no changes. It \nis just like the President said, ``Well, I've given up.''\n  And I have heard other claims, ``In 1993 we made a giant step toward \nreal deficit reduction and we did this without Republican help. So too \nbad for you guys. You're going to have to do this one on your own.''\n  There is a good reason why Republicans voted against the 1993 budget \npackage. And I want to take issue with some of things that President \nClinton and Mr. Panetta have said. They claim to have reduced the \ndeficit by nearly $600 billion. I have heard that figure time and time \nagain.\n  I am going to insert into the Record several tables which make my \npoints.\n  One of these tables shows the source of deficit decline since \nPresident Clinton took office.\n  Tax and fee increases account for $262 billion of that decline. I \nwill give the President credit for those. Yes, we know he passed the \nlargest tax increase in history.\n  I might mention, it was a large tax on middle-income Social Security \nrecipients and on low and middle-income people that buy gasoline.\n  As for his claims to cut spending, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office he has not yet cut any spending. In fact, he increased \nspending $4 billion in 1993, $9 billion in 1994, and $3 billion in \n1995.\n  I might mention, the House has passed a rescissions bill, the Senate \nwill pass a rescissions bill, in all likelihood, next week, and the \nPresident already said he would veto it. So we will have had a chance \nto cut 10 billion dollars' worth of spending and the President said he \nwould veto that.\n  If you believe the assumptions for 1996, 1997, and 1998 he will have \nsome spending reductions totaling $88 billion.\n  The remainder of the deficit reduction since 1993 is attributable to \ntechnical, economic, and other changes. In other words, $213 billion of \nthe deficit decline is in no way attributable to this administration.\n  So if you add all those figures together, yes, CBO says there is a \n$500 and-some-billion deficit reduction from the amount they have \nestimated in January 1993 compared to January 1995. But the truth is \nthere are no real spending cuts. The truth is we have not had a \nspending cut yet all the way through 1995. The truth is we have \nspending increases and big tax increases.\n  This administration likes tax increases a lot and they like to spend \nmore money.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is advised he has used 15 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. So the facts are, taxes under this President go up \ndramatically and spending continuing to rise even faster than it would \nhave under normal pretenses. And then if you look at the President's \nbudget for the next several years we continue piling up debt upon debt \nupon debt. That is not acceptable.\n  I am excited about the fact that now we have balanced budget plans in \nboth the House and the Senate.\n  The House has their assumptions, and the Senate has theirs. There may \nbe some changes. I know some people are thinking about making some \nchanges on the tax side. Fine, as long as we get to zero. And I would \nlike to get there sooner if we can. I would like to get to where we had \nto borrow as little as possible. But let us get there. Let us do it.\n  In all the other previous budget resolutions that I have seen and I \nhave been involved in, we have talked about trading off how much we are \ngoing to reduce the rate of spending with how much we are going to \nraise taxes. We are not doing that in this package.\n  My friend from Massachusetts said we need more taxes on big \ncorporations or we need more taxes on somebody else.\n  Republicans are not going to raise taxes. The problem is not that we \nare undertaxed. The problem is we are overspent.\n  So we are going to attack the problem. We are going to reduce the \nrate of spending. Spending under this proposal will grow at over 3 \npercent per year. Under business as usual, it would have grown at over \n5 percent per year.\n  A lot of special interest groups are going to scream and say it is \nnot fair. The Senator from Massachusetts criticized the Senate and the \nHouse for making a reduction in the CPI.\n\n[[Page S6990]]\n\n  I hope we do follow the instructions of this resolution and have \nanalysts give us a correct determination of what they think an accurate \nreflection of CPI is. If we are going to have cost-of-living \nadjustments, they should be accurate, and if there are savings to be \nmade in that, fine, they should be accurate. When you have people like \nAlan Greenspan say the CPI is overinflated and has been for some time, \nthat tells me we should make a change.\n  Finally, I know we are going to have a debate on earned-income tax \ncredit next week, and I will save most of my remarks on that subject. \nBut I heard my colleagues say that our proposal is a tax increase on \nthe working poor. That is totally false. We ought to deal with the \nfacts.\n  The earned-income tax credit is inappropriately named. Over 80 \npercent of the spending on this program is a direct handout to people \nwith zero tax liability. And it is a program that is fraught with \nabuse. How in the world can our colleagues defend a program when the \nGeneral Accounting Office says that they found 42 percent of the people \nreceiving benefits received too much in benefits, and 32 percent of the \npeople were not even eligible to receive benefits--32 percent. We do \nnot have a program that I am aware of that is so open for fraud and \nabuse and it needs to be reformed.\n  Do we reduce the rate of growth of earned income tax credit? Yes, we \ndo, and we should. We can get more than the savings we proposed if we \njust eliminate the waste and the abuse in the system. But the system \nhas been enlarged and expanded to such an extent, people can receive \nsuch large annual lump sum payments that there is a great incentive for \nfraud. They can file fraudulent tax returns and they can get cash.\n  It is false to say, ``Hey, this is a tax increase on low-income \npeople,'' when only 20 percent of the people who receive this benefit \nhave any tax credit whatsoever; 80 percent do not have tax liability. \nThey get a lump sum cash payment at the end of the year and that \npayment this year is over $3,000 if you receive the maximum amount. It \nwill grow up to about $4,000.\n  We allow it to grow under this budget; we just do not allow it to \ngrow so much, quite so fast. Every year under our proposal, the EITC \nwill grow in total amount, but it will not continue to compound at 55 \npercent per year as it has done in the recent past. We cannot allow a \nprogram where we are writing checks to be growing at such unbelievable \nrates. The program cost a few billion dollars a few years ago and now \nwe are looking at a $25 and $30 billion program. It still grows to $30 \nbillion under Senator Domenici's plan. We reduced the rate of growth in \nthat program. We need to reduce the rate of growth in that program. We \nneed to clean out the waste and abuse in that program. We ought to be \nashamed of ourselves if we do not, and we are going to try to do that.\n  For our colleagues on the other side or others to say that is a tax \nincrease on working poor, I beg to differ. I think they are entitled to \ntheir own opinion, but they are not entitled to their own facts.\n  I thank the indulgence of the Chair and my colleagues. I ask \nunanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to be serious when \nwe take up this budget. It bothers me to see that it is so partisan. It \nbothers me to see that there are not more bipartisan efforts to get to \na balanced budget. If there is a better idea--and there is bound to be \na better idea because this is not a perfect plan--bring that plan \nforward.\n  When we took a vote on the balanced budget amendment a couple months \nago, a lot of people said we should balance the budget whether we pass \na constitutional amendment or not. We were serious, and now we are \ngoing to try to do it. It is going to take some votes from both sides \nto pass a reconciliation bill.\n  So I hope we will not get so polarized that we are not able to work \ntogether to make sure we quit piling up endless debts on our children \nand on our children's children. To me that is a vital question: Are we \nserious? Are we actually going to finally start living within our \nmeans? I remember going to a town meeting and somebody raising their \nhand: ``Senator Nickles, will we ever see a balanced budget in my \nlifetime?'' The person was in their early twenties. I want that answer \nto be ``yes.'' I think this Congress has a chance to make it yes, and I \nhope that we will during the course of next week. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. I was listening to the debate \nearlier this afternoon about the pending amendment that restores some \nof the tremendous cuts to Medicare that occurred in this budget. I \nwanted to come over to the floor to just make a few points.\n  I heard many of my colleagues talk about the tremendous impacts that \nare going to occur to senior citizens as we cut Medicare in the budget \nthat is pending. I, like many people, have two elderly parents, both of \nwhom have chronic health care problems, and they are very concerned \nabout the Medicare Program and they let me know about it. But I came \nover today to remind all of us that the impacts on cutting Medicare do \nnot just hit the elderly, they hit the people I also care a lot about \nin this Nation--working families.\n  What we see happening here is cuts to Medicare that will no doubt \ncause premiums to be raised or seniors to be shut out of care or will \ngut quality. The impact of that will not only be felt on our seniors, \nbut it will be felt on everyday working families.\n  I know those families well. I am one of them, raising two kids and \ntaking care of my parents at the same time. I can tell you exactly what \nis happening in many working families across this Nation today.\n  We get up, we race our kids off to school, we worry about whether or \nnot they are getting a good education, we get to work, we try to do a \ngood job, we race home in time to get them to a baseball game, get food \non the table and, at the same time, we worry that our parents are going \nto call and say, ``I need to go to the doctor,'' or, ``I need to go to \nthe hospital,'' or ``I have run out of medication.'' It is an added \npressure to many working families in this Nation today.\n  If we cut the Medicare Program as drastically as is proposed, it will \nadd to the pressure of those parents, those working parents, those \neveryday average working parents, because then they will worry that \ntheir parents will not go to the doctor because of the added cost, they \nwill worry that they will not be taking their medication because their \nout-of-pocket expenses have increased, they will worry that their \nparents are not eating right because they are having to choose between \nwhether or not to go to the doctor, buy a prescription, or put food on \nthe table.\n  These cuts to Medicare will have a tremendous impact on everyday \naverage working families who are just trying to make it every day \nraising their own kids and worrying about their parents as well. But it \nwill also have an economic impact because, I assure you, if we just cap \nthe costs of Medicare that we pay out, we are not going to see \nhospitals reduce their costs, they are going to shift that to somebody \nelse. Guess who that is going to be? People who are going to work every \nday and paying their taxes and paying their insurance. Working middle-\nincome families will see their insurance rates rise, their out-of-\npocket medical care costs rise in order to pay for seniors who go to \nthe hospitals and to the doctors and who no longer are being paid back \nby the Medicare Program.\n  This will create a tremendous pressure on families and a tremendous \ncost shift to families. That is why it is absolutely critical that we \ndo not reform health care within this budget by just cutting costs to \nMedicare and Medicaid, but we go back to understanding that we have to \ndo health care reform in totality, look at the entire picture, figure \nout how much we are going to spend on health care in this Nation and \nimpact all ends of the age spectrum and life spectrum, or we are going \nto put tremendous burdens on a few people. I urge my colleagues to \nremember that Medicare cuts will dramatically impact working families \nacross this Nation.\n  I have heard over and over that these budget cuts to Medicare are \nbeing done to save it. I have to tell you that [[Page S6991]] makes no \nsense to me. If we care about our seniors, if we care about our \nfamilies who are going to work every day, then we also should care that \nwe have a moral responsibility to ensure the well-being of our \ncitizens, and frankly, this budget says just the opposite to me. It \nsays we care about the rich, it says we care more about the Pentagon \nthan people, but it says we do not care about those working-class \nfamilies.\n  This budget will have a tremendous impact on working-class families. \nIt will say to them: ``We're going to cut your Medicaid. If your child \nhas cystic fibrosis or severe asthma and you don't have the medical \ninsurance to take care of it, Medicaid will be cut back and you may not \nbe able to rely on that.''\n  It says to parents, ``Your children may not be taken care of if they \nare sick,'' a pressure to working-class families.\n  It says to working-class families that ``Your child may not be able \nto get a loan to go to college.''\n  It says to middle-class families that ``Your education dollars will \nbe cut,'' and it will mean eventually, as this gets passed on to the \nStates and our local school districts, that class sizes will increase \nand our good teachers will go elsewhere for jobs that pay enough to \nkeep them going.\n  And it says to low-income families, we are going to take away the \nearned-income tax credit. The one thing that they have, they go to work \nevery day, they earn less than $28,000 a year and we are going to take \naway a small bit of cash they have just to help them make it by gutting \nthe earned income tax credit.\n You bet this is a tax increase on those earning less than $28,000. It \nis absolutely a tax increase on them. I think it is unfair and \nwrongheaded.\n\n  Finally, let me just say, I talk to many teenagers day in and day out \nas a parent of two teenagers. And they fear, more than anything, that \nthere is no hope for them in this world, that there is no opportunity \nout there. And this budget, I assure you, does not send a message of \nhope and opportunity.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Lautenberg-Rockefeller amendment, \nto restore some of those cuts to Medicare, to give some hope back to \nmiddle-income, working families in this Nation and eventually to defeat \nthe budget that is before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I appreciate the concern that everyone is \nshowing here on the floor for Medicare and Medicaid and the desire that \nthey have to keep these programs well and healthy and viable for the \npeople who depend upon them.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the desire to keep these programs \nhealthy and well has been translated into a desire to keep them as they \nare. And life being what it is, if they stay as they are, they will be \nneither healthy nor stable for the people who depend upon them; indeed, \nthey will ultimately disappear.\n  Let us talk about Medicare for just a moment and go through the \nhistory of that program. Although I am a newcomer to the Senate, I am \nnot a newcomer, if you will, to this issue. Back in 1962, when my \nfather was running for reelection to the Senate, I was his campaign \nmanager, and this was an issue in his campaign. Yes, that is right, Mr. \nPresident, in 1962; it has been around that long. At the time, there \nwas no Medicare. It was passed by the Congress after the 1962 election. \nThere were all kinds of projections about how much it would cost and \nwhat it would do.\n  As we look back over this last 30-year period, we see that all of \nthose projections were wrong, and they were wrong on the wrong side; \nthat is, they were all too low. Medicare has been growing much more \nrapidly than its initial authors ever thought it would, and it has been \ncosting the Federal Government an ever-increasing percentage of gross \ndomestic product. There have been charts on that, and I will not repeat \nthe charts because people have seen all of those.\n  However, when people talk to me about Medicare and how it must be \npreserved, I go back to the 1960's and my memory of that debate, and I \nmake this point. I say Medicare is a wonderful program as it is \ncurrently structured and would work perfectly, indeed we could afford \nit, if people would just have the courtesy to die at the same rate they \ndid in the 1960's when Medicare was established. And, indeed, if we \nwent back to practice medicine the same way we did in the 1960's, they \nprobably would.\n  But we practice medicine in a vastly different way now than we did in \nthe 1960's. I have been told that 90 percent of the medicine we \npractice today did not exist in the 1960's. It has all been invented \nsince that time. The treatments have changed, the equipment has \nchanged, the facilities have changed. But the program by which it is \nfinanced has not changed. It is still built around the notions that we \nhad when we watched that 1960's television program, ``Marcus Welby,'' a \nsingle practitioner who operated out of a single facility set in an \nidyllic setting, assisted by the most caring, wonderful nurse in the \nworld, Consuela. He would sit there and somehow figure out all of your \nills, and not only take care of your medical problems; he would solve \nyour divorce, take care of the teenage child that was in trouble, and \ncounsel you in your employment problems. Well, Dr. Welby does not exist \nanymore. Medicine has changed. Our way of delivering it has changed. \nAnd the old notion of having a ``Dr. Welby'' who will be reimbursed \nfrom the Federal Government for all of his skill and all of his counsel \nhas to change, too.\n  I am standing here in support of the underlying budget proposal not \nbecause I hate Medicare, not because I am heartless toward those in the \naging population. I am not unfamiliar with those. I guess I am aging a \nlittle myself. But within the past year, year and a half, my wife and I \nhave buried three of our children's four grandparents. We have had the \nMedicare experience with my father, my father-in-law, and my mother-in-\nlaw. The forms are incomprehensible. They create a regulatory thicket \nthat virtually no one can plow through.\n  I have a constituent who tells me, ``Senator, I have to take care of \nan aging mother. The idea that she would be able to understand any of \nthe forms she gets from Medicare is on its face ridiculous. I am a \ncollege graduate, I am a successful business woman, and I think I know \nmy way around, but I cannot figure out these forms, let alone my \nmother.'' So she said, ``I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out \nwhat they meant until I finally adopted the following strategy. I \nrealize it is high risk, but it is low stress. Every form from Medicare \nI throw away, and at the end of the month I call the Salt Lake Clinic \nand say, `Do I owe you any money for my mother?' I let them do the \nbookkeeping and do not worry about the form that says `This is not a \nbill' and is covered with numbers and that says we cover this \npercentage and you that percentage.'' She says, ``I throw them all \naway, and once a month, I call the Salt Lake Clinic and I say, `Do I \nowe you any money for my mother?' They say, `Yes, according to our \ncomputers, you owe us X amount,' and I write out a check and do not pay \nany attention to the rest of it.''\n  I hope the Salt Lake Clinic, for her sake, is keeping good books. \nThat is the kind of program we have under Medicare. Is that what we \nwant to preserve exactly as it is? Or do we want to say: Wait a minute; \nthe time has come to restructure; the time has come to reform. And we \nare convinced if we do restructure and reform, the time has come to \nhave a handle on the costs that make sense.\n  To repeat that which has been said here on the floor so many times--\nand it may be wearing out now, but it needs to be repeated--we are not \ntalking about cutting Medicare below its present rate of reimbursement; \nwe are talking about increasing Medicare above its present rate of \nreimbursement on the basis of roughly 7 percent per year compounded. \nAnybody who has been in the business world long enough to know the \npower of compound interest rates knows how powerful a 7-percent per \nyear compounded increase can be in raising the benefits for Medicare.\n  Right now, the per capita spending is around $4,300 per person, and \nat the end of the 7-year period outlined in this bill, it will be \n$6,300 per person, and that rate of increase is roughly the same as the \nrate of increase for health [[Page S6992]] costs in the private sector \ntoday. So we know that health care can survive, indeed thrive, with \nthat rate of increase. What we need to do is say we are going to take \nthe private rate of increase, lock it into the Federal circumstance so \nthat it cannot grow any more rapidly and then, within those parameters, \nmake the kinds of administrative changes necessary to make this thing \nwork.\n  What is wrong with that? What is threatening about that? I assure \nyou, as one who has had to deal with these forms and had to deal with \naged parents and had to struggle with the medical challenge, and as an \nadministrator, if you will, for my father and in-laws,\n I would welcome that kind of circumstance. I am not threatened by it. \nNo one in our senior population should be threatened by it.\n\n  There is a saying that I learned in college. I wish I could quote it \nall. I do not have the photographic memory that the Senator from West \nVirginia possesses, so I will do my best. It is out of the literature \nthat talks about King Arthur and Camelot. That should strike a chord \nsomewhere around here. There are people that have talked about Camelot \nwith respect to a past administration.\n  At the moment where Camelot is over, in the epic poem by Sir Walter \nScott, there are those who mourn the loss of the Knights of the Round \nTable and say how terrible it is that this is gone. Then this phrase:\n\n       The old order changeth, yielding place to new, lest one \n     good custom should corrupt the world.\n\n  Mr. President, we are at that point in Medicare. The old order has \nbeen a good order. It has helped a lot of people. But if we try to \npreserve it absolutely as it was written and established and laid down \nover 30 years ago as we move into the next millennium, that one good \ncustom will corrupt the world. The old order changeth, and we must \nchange the law to go with it.\n  I repeat and summarize, Mr. President, I am not here in any sense to \nchallenge the need of our senior citizens for the Federal Government to \nstay fully involved and fully committed to the notion that they are \nentitled--entitled, yes, I use the fatal word--they are entitled to \nsupport in their medical costs in their declining and retired years. I \nsupport that absolutely.\n  I stand here fully committed to a budget that will cause that support \nto increase at a rate of 7 percent per year compounded. But I say to \nthose who want to keep the old system exactly as it is and keep pouring \nmoney down the black hole that it has become, those people are wedded \nto a mechanism of the 1960's while we are living in the 1990's and \npreparing for the new century and the new millennium.\n  When we do that, regardless of how pure the intent, we are doing our \nsenior citizens no favor. We are doing them no benefit.\n  We must recognize that the old order and everything changeth, \nyielding place to new, lest one good custom should corrupt the world. \nWith that attempt, Mr. President, to sound at least somewhat as \nclassical as the Senator from West Virginia, recognizing that I could \nnever truly approach him, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished senior Senator from Rhode \nIsland is recognized.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Rockefeller \namendment to restore $100 billion in funding for Medicare and long-term \ncare, to be offset by the funds which the committee bill would reserve \nfor tax cuts.\n  This amendment coincides with my own philosophy on the matter of the \nbudget. We must curtail spending and reduce the deficit, but we must do \nso by the most humane means. And we should not even think about tax \ncuts until we have achieved some kind of equilibrium between income and \nexpenditures, and have done so without shifting the burden to those \nleast able to bear it.\n  While there is no question that we must take seriously the recent \nreport of the Medicare trustees which warns that--if we don't do \nsomething--the Medicare trust fund will go bankrupt in the year 2002, \nour efforts to fix the system should not be driven by our desire for \ndeficit reduction. While reducing the deficit is a goal that we all \nshare, it is not something that can be accomplished without affecting \nreal people, who have real needs and real problems.\n  Let's look for a moment at the House Republican budget proposal. \nHouse Republicans propose to cut $286 billion from Medicare and to use \nthe proceeds for deficit reduction and a $20,000 tax cut for the \nwealthiest Americans. In my view, this defies logic.\n  By paying these Social Security taxes, a portion of which goes to \nfund the Medicare trust fund for part A hospital benefits, the citizens \nof this country have a contract with the Government that this program, \nfor which their hard-earned money is collected, will be used to provide \nthem with health care when they are aged or disabled. Not to provide \ndeficit reduction.\n And not to provide tax relief, especially to those who need it least.\n\n  And the Senate Republican budget proposal isn't much better. It \nproposes to cut $256 billion from Medicare solely for deficit \nreduction. This level of cut fails to recognize that--in future years--\nmore and more people will reach the Medicare age of 65, will depend on \nits benefits, and will have to rely on a much smaller pot of funds to \npay what are likely to be higher costs for the same care they are \nreceiving now. So there is no comfort in the explanation that the \nproposed cuts are simply reductions in the rate of growth of the \nprogram.\n  These proposed cuts will clearly mean higher deductibles, higher out-\nof-pocket costs, and a greater burden on the family members of \nbeneficiaries who cannot afford the increase. And with the proposed \ncuts in Medicaid which are also part of the Republican plan, any safety \nnet for all but the very poorest Americans will be eliminated, offering \nno help at all to hard working, middle-income families.\n  Mr. President, the medical inflation rate and the changing \ndemographics of our population are not the fault of our senior \ncitizens. As Government leaders, it is our responsibility to anticipate \nour citizens' needs and to prepare for them. It is my strong view that \nneither the House nor the Senate Republican budget proposals do this. \nRather, both proposals will cause a bad situation to become worse.\n  I have examined my own views and conscience on the matter of Medicare \nvery carefully. I know that we must make changes--some of which may be \nvery painful--in order to ensure that Medicare is there not only for \ntoday's senior citizens, but also for future generations of senior \ncitizens. I believe that today's senior citizens understand that--and \nthat, while they are deeply concerned about the cost of their own \nmedical care--they truly want this fine system to be around when their \nchildren and grandchildren need it.\n  So I am prepared to take steps that are needed to cut costs, even if \nthis causes some pain to current and future recipients. But I do not \nintend to balance the budget on the backs of senior citizens.\n  And I do not intend to support using Medicare trust funds, or making \nmodifications in the Medicare Program, that do not go directly to the \neffort to strengthen the Medicare Program and ensure its long-term \nviability, unless it is part of more comprehensive health care reform \nthat improves the overall health care system for all our citizens, \nincluding our seniors.\n  Mr. President, the problems plaguing Medicare today are the same \nproblems that have plagued our health care system for some time: the \nrate of medical inflation, the increased use of expensive medical \ntechnology, and more hospital admissions--due in part to the aging of \nAmerica. And while I recognize fully that the Nation may not be ready \nfor the kind of comprehensive health care reform that was proposed last \nyear, I believe that we cannot intelligently address the rising health \ncare costs of one segment of the population--the elderly--without \naddressing the system as a whole and the fact that those who are not \nelderly today will--if they are lucky--be elderly tomorrow. So I \ncertainly hope that we will revisit health care reform very soon and \nrecognize that a crucial part of reform is the strengthening of the \nMedicare Program.\n  I hope that as the budget debate begins, we will be able to focus \nmuch more on what cuts the Medicare system can withstand and much less \non the amount that Members believe they [[Page S6993]] should cut to \nprovide deficit reduction or tax cuts to the favored few. I believe \nthat if Members of Congress pursue policy over politics, we will be \nable to pass legislation that will start us on the road to protecting \nand preserving Medicare's promise for future generations, while leaving \nroom for future programmatic reform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Chair inform the Senator from \nNevada if there are time constraints at this time in the proceedings?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this time both sides retain time on the \nbill. There are 16 hours 22 minutes remaining on the Republican side; \n16 hours 51 minutes on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. REID. So there is no time agreement on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. This amendment will not be voted on until \nMonday.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Whatever time the Senator may choose to take \nwould come out of the overall time.\n  Mr. REID. I understand that. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I think it is appropriate to once again mention that \nwe have heard far too many cries about how bad things are. I think it \nis important that we talk about how good things are in this country.\n  We, in the fall of 1993, passed a deficit reduction plan that was the \nlargest deficit reduction plan in the history of this country. It \npassed, however, sadly, Mr. President, without any help from those on \nthe other side of the aisle. We received no help in the House from the \nRepublican Party or from the Republicans in the Senate. And that is too \nbad. It should have been a bipartisan effort to do a better job of \nhandling the yearly deficits that have accumulated.\n  As a result of that bill that passed, the deficit reduction package \nthat I talked about, we have reduced the deficit by over $600 billion. \nTo be exact, the deficit will be $616 billion less, as a result of that \naction, over the 5 years from the time the bill passed. It will drop in \nhalf as a percentage of national income, from 4.9 to 2.4 percent. \nBecause of the deficit reduction plan, the 1994 deficit as a percentage \nof GDP, as projected, is tied among the lowest for all G-7 countries. \nAs a result of that plan, the unemployment rate is 5.8 percent, down \nfrom over 7 percent in 1992. There now are 1.4 million fewer people \nunemployed than at the start of this administration, a 15-percent drop. \nThere are, as a result of the deficit reduction plan, 6.3 million more \njobs than we had previous to that plan having passed. And keep in mind, \nthese jobs that have been created are good jobs. For example, \nmanagerial and professional jobs make up 58 percent of the new jobs \ncreated since 1994.\n  In addition to that, 170,000 fewer people are working for the Federal \nGovernment than at the beginning of this administration. That is \nsignificant and it is important. The deficits have been reduced, and \nthey have not been reduced enough, but interestingly this will be the \nthird year in a row that there has been a declining deficit; for the \nfirst time in 50 years that has taken place in this country. That is \nsignificant.\n  According to the CBO, this deficit reduction package resulted in \nlittle more than 1 percent of the American people paying more in taxes. \nA significant number paid less in taxes. Inflation? We have the lowest \ninflation and the lowest unemployment since the years of John Kennedy. \nThat is significant.\n  Home sales for 1994 amounted to almost 4 million. This is the largest \ntotal since 1978 and the second largest total ever. Consumer confidence \nis up by 78 percent.\n  Mr. President, the reason I mention this is I think we tend to dwell \non the negative. We are doing extremely well as an economy. Certainly \nwe would all agree that what we have to do is a better job of handling \nour deficit, and that is what we are here to talk about today. Can we \ndo a better job? I believe the answer is yes, we can do a better job. \nBut I think what we are going to talk about today is a matter of \npriorities.\n  There is no dispute that we are going to be on a glidepath to the \nyear 2002 to have a balanced budget. The question is how should we \narrive at that figure? There is a significant difference between how \nthose of us on this side of the aisle feel and those on the other side \nof the aisle feel as to how we should arrive at that balance. This will \nmake a distinction between the philosophy of the two parties. It is a \nmatter of priorities.\n  We now have the long-awaited budget proposal that we received from \nthe Budget Committee. What we are here to talk about today is not the \nfact that not only does the budget proposal we have received lower \ntaxes for the wealthy, but it also increases taxes for people who work \nevery day. People who make less than $28,000 a year will pay an average \nof $400 a year more in the way of taxes. That is their priority.\n  We do not believe, on this side of the aisle, that we should have a \ntax decrease for the wealthy until we get our fiscal house in order. \nAnd certainly we should not increase taxes for working people in this \ncountry, the people who make under $28,000 a year, so the wealthy can \nget a tax decrease. That does not make a lot of sense and it does not \nsound fair.\n  I am not going to talk today about the fact that the proposal we have \nreceived from the Budget Committee devastates many educational \nprograms. The reason I am here today is to talk about Medicare. Why are \nwe being asked to vote for a budget resolution that takes a bigger cut \nout of Medicare than it does anything else? Why are we being asked to \ndo that? That does not seem fair.\n  These cuts will shift $900 a year in costs to the Medicare recipient. \nEvery Medicare recipient will receive in effect a tax increase. Every \nsenior citizen will pay $900 more in additional health care costs. This \ndoes not seem appropriate.\n  What really makes it significantly bad is that many of the costs are \nbeing shifted back to the State and local governments. They are going \nto have to pick up these costs. Throughout the debate that has \nsurrounded these cuts, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nhave consistently cited their concern about the Medicare trust fund and \ntheir commitment to solve the Medicare crisis. No one within the sound \nof my voice should be fooled that suddenly we have a Medicare crisis. \nWe have had a Medicare crisis because Medicare is only part of the \noverall health care crisis that we spent days and weeks on last year.\n  When we started the debate on this floor saying there was a health \ncare crisis, over 80 percent of the American public agreed there was a \nhealth care crisis. When we finished the debate, no one agreed there \nwas a health care crisis. Why? Because the health insurance industry \nset out to try to confuse and frighten the American public. And they \ndid a masterful job. It cost them about $200 million for their Harry \nand Louise ads and the other things they did to frighten and confuse \nthe American public, but they were the champions. They were the only \nwinner in the health care debate. There were lots of losers. They were \nthe winner, and you have to hand it to them, they did a good job.\n Because, when we finished the debate nobody favored health care \nreform. Even seniors were frightened and confused, even though they \nwould have done extremely well because they would have gotten a \nprescription drug benefit and a lot of other health care reforms which \nwould have benefited them significantly.\n\n  The crisis has no more urgency this year than it did last year. The \nonly reason it has more urgency this year is because all the cuts are \ntaken from Medicare to finance a tax cut.\n  The rhetoric for Medicare reform is nothing but a smokescreen for the \ntax cuts for the wealthiest of Americans. In fact, despite earlier \nclaims to the contrary, the budget resolution being debated in this \nbody on this day does call for tax cuts. It is disguised. They are \nsaying we are going to have these savings, and, therefore, the savings \nwill be given to the Finance Committee. And what can the Finance \nCommittee do according to the budget resolution? They can do one thing, \nand that is to give tax cuts. So we should not be fooled. The Senate \nresolution calls for tax cuts, and the House resolution calls for tax \ncuts of just a little bit more than the Senate version. [[Page S6994]] \n  Let us be clear. What has been proposed in this budget resolution is \ntaking more than $900 a year from every senior citizen in America on \nMedicare to pay for the $20,000 annual tax cut for Americans making \nover $350,000 a year. In fact, over half the tax cuts proposed will go \nto Americans with incomes well over $100,000. When the facts are \nfiltered from this rhetoric, it is not the Medicare trust fund they are \nconcerned about at all. If it were, the recommendations of the Finance \nCommittee would be any savings we get should be to restore the cuts \nthat have been made in this resolution to Medicare. It would be to \ndivert the savings achieved from a balanced budget back to the Medicare \nprogram ensuring health coverage for our Nation's seniors.\n  Those on the other side of the aisle continue to mask their tax cut \nas Medicare reform. But there is no reform in this resolution. The \nRepublican approach to reform contained in this resolution is the \nappointment of yet another government commission to study the issue. \nThe American public, and certainly we in this body, should understand \nwhen we call for a commission, when we call for a study, it is a way to \ncamouflage the inability to make a decision. What we need now is the \ncourage to implement change; that is, to go back and do some good, \nreasonable health care reform, reforms that will not decrease benefits \nor increase costs. But certainly we do not need the kind of slash and \nburn approach taken in this resolution.\n  I received, as we all do, letters regarding the Medicare proposal \nwithin this budget resolution. A letter that I have is quite clear and \nquite direct. It says:\n\n       Dear Senator: * * * We see and hear all around us stories \n     of the wasteful spending by Government in this country--the \n     Commissions that are obsolete, the entire Departments that \n     are without a mandate (DOE comes to mind--how long has it \n     been since there was a need to supply power to rural areas?) \n     the graft that must be present if we are actually paying \n     $10.00 for an item that can be bought in any hardware store \n     for 80 cents, and the $350 vacuum cleaners that we pay $1350 \n     for.\n       Much of the above are things that the average citizen sees \n     no need for at all, let alone at such inflated prices. \n     Medicare is one thing that we get back from our years and \n     years of paying taxes that we can see and understand. Granted \n     there may be excesses. But why is this program singled out \n     for dismemberment when programs that benefit other countries, \n     or sadly, nobody but those on the Government payroll, are \n     kept well beyond their usefulness?\n       If you want to cut the cost of Medicare, you must phase it \n     out over time. You must not yank the rug out from under those \n     of us who earned our money in days when we earned less than \n     half what people in our former positions earn today. Yet the \n     inflation that brought their salaries up and affects the \n     prices we all pay applies to us equally with them. It could \n     mean the difference between living with dignity and living in \n     abject poverty for those with medical problems.\n\n  Mr. President, I have another letter here which is dated April 12, \naddressed to me.\n\n       Dear Senator Reid: I know you fought to save Social \n     Security, but not a word about Medicare.\n\n  This is interesting because it is written from someone from Nevada.\n\n       The Washington Post had an article February 28, 1995 citing \n     that huge Medicare cutback foreseen by Packwood.\n       I am not a rich Senior Citizen nor do I get enough for my \n     money. I am not in the poor variety but a few dollars above. \n     This is why we cannot reduce the balanced budget on the backs \n     of the poor and the elderly. I want to be able to choose my \n     own doctors for in my case I have trigeminal neuralgia which \n     is uncurable. I need to find the best specialists around to \n     help me. I don't want to be forced to go into any HMO's.\n       As far as voting I go for the person and not the Party.\n       I feel this way. If an encumbant or any candidate running \n     for office does not care about me than I do not care about \n     their future. I will not vote for him/her.\n\n  Remember the debate we had last year. We have to maintain choice. \nWhat we were going to do in health care reform, as you will recall, was \nhave health cooperatives, which was the original idea where we would \nhave a number of people go out and bid to get the best and cheapest \ncoverage. We were criticized for that. But now that is being \nrecommended.\n  Managed care is the word of the day, which is certainly a lot worse \nthan anything we ever suggested because what we suggested was there was \nno middleman that would eat up all the money. Who are the highest paid \nexecutives in America today? Among the highest paid executives in \nAmerica today are the people who run these health maintenance \norganizations, who run these managed care operations. They do not know \nhow to spend all of their money.\n  I go on with the letter:\n\n       As far as voting, I go for the person and not the party. I \n     feel this way. If an incumbent or any candidate running for \n     office does not care about me, then I do not care about their \n     future.\n\n  Mr. President, in my office, like in your office, I receive phone \ncalls when issues come up, whether it is on the gun control issue, \nabortion issue, or in this instance, cutting Medicare. We have received \nhundreds and hundreds of telephone calls in my Reno office, my Carson \nCity office, the Las Vegas office, and the Washington office.\n  Here is a call we received from Dottie, living in Las Vegas, in an \napartment.\n\n       Opposed to Medicare cuts. If it were not for Medicare, you \n     would not be talking to me today; three strokes and a car \n     accident.\n\n  A note from Harry Decker:\n\n       Don't cut Medicare irresponsibly. This will hurt people.\n\n  I can tell Harry Decker that, if this budget resolution passes, he \nwill have his worst dream fulfilled because that is what is done in \nthis budget resolution. We are cutting Medicare irresponsibly.\n  A call from Michael:\n\n       Oppose cuts to Medicare. I am going to have to go on \n     welfare. Making it very tough on seniors.\n\n  Another message from Robert:\n\n       Don't cut Medicare until there is a plan in place. Do it \n     correctly and less painfully.\n\n  I do not think he is being unreasonable. We do not have a plan in \nplace.\n  Frank:\n\n       Please don't cut our Medicare. The money just does not \n     cover now what is needed.\n\n  These are just a few at random telephone calls and letters that I \nhave received. If we all sorted through our mail, we would all find the \nsame type of responses from the public.\n  Why, I repeat, is it fair to give tax cuts to the wealthy, tax \nincreases to the workers making $28,000 a year, cuts in education, and \nthen make the biggest cut of all, Medicare. This does not sound fair.\n  Mr. President, these letters that I shared with the Senate and the \ntelephone calls are not just a few here and a few there. As we are \nspeaking, my office is receiving lots of telephone calls. My staff is \ngoing through the mail. If these cuts are implemented, there are \napproximately 200,000 Medicare enrollees in Nevada who will pay an \naverage of $1,080 more in the year 2002 alone and $3,620 more over \nthese next 7 years.\n  It is interesting also that the burden will be the greatest for the \none in four seniors; that is, the 25 percent of seniors who rely solely \non Social Security, who do not get a penny from anyone else. This will \nhurt them more than anyone else. These recipients will be forced to use \nmuch more of their Social Security check to cover these out-of-pocket \ncosts for health care.\n  This budget proposal is not only about seniors. It is also about \nAmerican families because, if there is an impact on a senior, most of \nthe time it affects that person's family. These drastic cuts in \nMedicare not only threaten the pocketbooks of seniors, but also those \nof their families.\n  Why do we have Medicare? Why do we have Social Security generally? We \nhave it, Mr. President, to give independence to the seniors,\n to make people feel like they are somebody.\n\n  I related during the debate we had on the balanced budget amendment \nthe story of my grandmother, Harriet Reid, born in England, citizen of \nthe United States. I can remember as a little boy going to the post \noffice and picking up my grandmother's old age pension check. I did not \nknow it had a fancy name at the time, her Social Security check. That \ncheck gave my old grandmother independence. She had children, but she \ndid not have to depend on her children for everything because she had \nher old age pension.\n  What we are doing with these cuts in Medicare is taking away the \nindependence of people, of people like my grandmother. My grandmother, \nwere she alive today, if this budget resolution passes, would become \nmore dependent [[Page S6995]] on her family, if in fact she was \nfortunate enough to have a family.\n  We can cart out all the charts and graphs showing how bad things are, \nbut I ask everyone to go back again and realize how good things are in \nthis economy today. For the third year in a row, we have had a deficit \ndecline--170,000 fewer Federal employees, lowest inflation, lowest \nunemployment since the days of Kennedy, economic growth significantly \nhigh. We are doing very well.\n  And no one on this side of the aisle is saying we should not have a \nbalanced budget. We believe that we should. And we are going to have an \nopportunity on a vote on a fair budget resolution. What we are saying \nis do not take the money out of the pockets of senior citizens, people \nwho are going from hand to mouth with their Social Security checks.\n  We are saying it should not be tax cuts now. We want to give tax cuts \njust like everyone else would, but we want to do it when we can afford \nto give tax cuts. We want to get our budget deficit that comes every \nyear under control. It is not fair, I say also, to raise taxes for \npeople who work every day for a living making less than $28,000 a year. \nWhy would we want to increase taxes for them in the same budget \nresolution and lower taxes for people making hundreds of thousands of \ndollars a year?\n  The burden will not only be felt by seniors directly, but it will be \nfelt very significantly, strongly in rural America.\n  Nevada is the most urban State in the Union, I have been told, Mr. \nPresident; 90 percent of the people approximately live in the Reno and \nLas Vegas areas. In the huge State of Nevada, with 175 million acres, \nonly about 10 percent of the people live outside of the metropolitan \nareas, but they are going to be hurt real bad. That 10 percent of the \npeople of the State of Nevada also need health care.\n  We have a study by Lewin-VHI, a consulting firm. It recently unveiled \nan analysis of the impact these Medicare cuts that are in this Senate \nBudget Committee resolution would have on hospitals and beneficiaries. \nThe study found that ``by the year 2002, Medicare could pay hospitals \nonly 89 cents on the dollar for the operating costs of delivering \ninpatient care to a Medicare patient.'' Today hospitals almost do not \nbreak even, but this would be even more drastic than that.\n  The study also found that every type of hospital would suffer under \nthose reductions and that the average hospital in the year 2002 would \nlose almost $900 per Medicare patient. But I am particularly concerned \nabout rural hospitals. We are having fewer and fewer rural hospitals in \nNevada all the time. They cannot stay in business because, \ninterestingly enough, Medicare pays them less than it does an urban \nhospital for the same procedure, and we need these hospitals in rural \nNevada. We have areas in Nevada that are separated by hundreds of \nmiles, and we need these little hospitals. They are very important.\n  Nearly 10 million Medicare beneficiaries, that is, 25 percent of the \ntotal, live where? They live in rural America. They live in rural \nNevada where there is often only a single hospital in their county, if \nin fact you are lucky. We do not have a hospital in every one of our \ncounties.\n  Significant cuts as in this budget resolution in Medicare revenues \nwill most likely force many of these hospitals, which are already in \nfinancial distress, to close or turn where? Turn to local taxpayers for \nmore money. And where will local taxpayers be asked to contribute? From \nproperty taxes, from other types of taxes that local governments will \nhave to come up with if they want to have rural hospitals. This is a \nway to make State and local governments pay more if they want to have \nhospitals because we are bailing out; the Federal Government is saying \nwe want no more. That is what this resolution says.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Nevada will \nyield to me for a moment for a question.\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will not take much time. I know others are waiting. I \nwill come and speak on Monday morning on this subject, but I was \ninterested to hear the Senator from Nevada speak on rural hospitals.\n  I listened to some of the debate earlier today and it is framed by \nsome in this Chamber as a debate between those who want a balanced \nbudget and those who do not.\n  That is not the debate we are having at all. The question is not \nwhether. The question is how. We think we ought to balance the budget. \nWe think we ought to balance the budget by 2002. The question is what \nroute do you take to get there.\n  The Senator from Nevada is talking about rural hospitals. If someone \nsays the route we ought to take to get there is to have a very \nsubstantial cut in Medicare and give a big tax cut to folks that have a \nlot of income, a $20,000 tax cut to those whose incomes are $300,000 a \nyear; if someone says we can afford to do that but we cannot afford to \nprovide Medicare sufficient to keep rural hospitals open, we on this \nside of the aisle disagree with the how. We believe in this country \nthat it is important to keep rural hospitals open. We believe you can \ndo that and we believe you can still balance the budget.\n  The point the Senator is making I assume is pretty much the same \npoint that we have in my State. In North Dakota, many rural hospitals \nfind that up to 80 percent of the people who walk through the front \ndoor are Medicare patients.\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely right. Same in Nevada.\n  Mr. DORGAN. A very high percentage of the people are on Medicare. If \nyou just precipitously decide to lop off the money on the health care \nside, even as you are giving tax cuts to the very affluent and doing a \nlot of other things we do not need to do and taking it out of the hide \nof those to whom it means the most, what you end up with is closure of \nrural hospitals.\n  In North Dakota, I estimate at least a dozen rural hospitals will \nclose rather quickly if we see these kinds of cuts in Medicare without \nsome kind of a plan to reduce the price of health care in a thoughtful \nway that still allows us to keep a structure out there so we can keep \nrural hospitals up and open and operating.\n  That is the issue. The issue is how do we get to a balanced budget, \nnot whether. And some in this Chamber want to stop their vehicles at \ndifferent intersections. They want to stop and give a little tax break \nto those affluent people in the house on the hill, and then they want \nto stop at this little house down below and take Medicare funds away \nfrom the person who does not have much income, and they want to stop at \nthe next house on that street and take a few dollars away from those \nwho want to send their kids to college.\n  We just have a different system for the delivery truck to get to the \ndestination. We would like to ask everybody to pay their fair share.\n  The point we are making about rural hospitals is a very important \npoint. It applies not just to Nevada but it applies to every State in \nthis country that is a rural State.\n  I appreciate the Senator yielding to me.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from North Dakota, he is absolutely \nright. He very, very precisely laid out the program.\n  You can present all the charts on the budget, saying if we do not do \nsomething, we are going to be in big trouble, all these charts showing \nwhat has gone on in the past.\n  I have done a couple things, I say to my friend from North Dakota, \nhere today. I pointed out, No. 1, the economy is doing great. But \nhaving said that, I recognize, as we all do on this side of the aisle, \nthat to continue the economic growth and viability of this country we \nhave to have a glidepath to a balanced budget. We all want a balanced \nbudget. I do not know of anyone over here on this side of the aisle who \ndoes not want a balanced budget. We all want one. I say to my friend he \nis absolutely right. It is a matter of priorities.\n  And I would say, one of the things that I have talked about here \nalso, we have talked about the tax cuts for the wealthy, the tax \nincreases to people making less than $28,000 a year, but also disguised \nin all of this is a heavy burden on State and local governments because \nwe have to keep those rural hospitals open. And the Federal Government, \nbecause it will not live up to its responsibility to the senior \ncitizens \n[[Page S6996]] of this country, will pass that burden to State and \nlocal governments. They are going to have to try to keep those \nhospitals open and they can only do it through taxation of people that \nlive in those States.\n  So it is a disguised way of increasing taxes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for 1 moment?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This is about priorities.\n  We have people who say, ``Let's rebuild star wars.'' And we have \npeople in the Contract With America saying, ``Let's now start on a \nbrand new, gold-plated weapons system called Star Wars. Let's build it \nnow. Let's take money out of Medicare. Let's decide to freeze Head \nStart.''\n  This is about priorities. Frankly, some of us do not agree with the \npriorities that have been brought to the floor.\n  It is not a disagreement about whether we have a balanced budget. It \nis a disagreement about priorities.\n  I think the Senator from Nevada is laying that out and I appreciate \nhim yielding.\n  Mr. REID. Again, I thank my friend from North Dakota, who has done \nsuch an outstanding job during this entire debate on the balanced \nbudget. There is never an example in this Chamber that I have seen more \neffectively used than the fact that this Senator from North Dakota, who \nhad years of experience in the House of Representatives on the Ways and \nMeans Committee--I congratulate and applaud him for using that \nexperience to come here and help explain and make more apparent some of \nthe things we are doing on budget matters here in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, again talking about rural hospitals and rural health \ncare delivery, closing hospitals will ultimately result in the loss of \njobs and loss of physicians and, of course, hospitals in these \ncommunities.\n  This is very troublesome for the health care of rural Nevadans \nbecause, even though we do not have a lot of people who live in rural \nNevada, those people who live there, few in number, are as important to \nme as the people who live in the big cities.\n  I am from rural Nevada, born and raised in rural Nevada. \nUnfortunately, it appears that those who are in the majority here are \nnot as concerned about rural Americans as the rest of us.\n  In Nevada, a health profession shortage is already there today. It is \na fact of life. Thirteen of Nevada's seventeen counties are identified \nas health profession shortage areas; 11 counties are classified as \nfrontier, meaning there are 6 persons or fewer per square mile and more \nthan 45 miles between medical service sites. The distance between major \ntowns averages 100 miles, with distances of 180 to 200 miles in more \nisolated areas.\n  So, Mr. President, as you can see, drastic Medicare cuts resulting in \nthe closure of rural hospitals would be devastating to the delivery of \nhealth care in rural Nevada and rural America.\n  What it all boils down to, I repeat, as my friend from North Dakota \nstated, is a matter of priorities. We all believe there should be a \nbalanced budget and it should be by the year 2002. But what we are \nsaying is that we do not believe the budget should be balanced on the \nbacks of those people in their golden years; that is, the senior \ncitizens of this country.\n  It is interesting to note that the amount of money that is going to \nbe cut from Medicare is almost the same amount of money that is going \nto be given in tax cuts. That is unfair.\n  I think it is important to repeat again, Mr. President, the fact that \nwe also believe in a balanced budget. We are going to have a plan that \nwe will offer that will not devastate Medicare and will allow education \nto receive its fair share, and we will not give tax increases to people \nmaking less than $28,000 a year, nor will we give tax decreases to the \nwealthy.\n  This amendment which is now before this body which calls for a \nrealignment is something that should pass. We believe that $100 billion \nof money that is being taken from Medicare should be replaced with the \nmoney that is going to be generated in this package that is marked by \nthe Budget Committee to go to the Finance Committee for tax cuts for \nthe wealthy. In effect, $100 billion in tax cuts for the wealthy should \nbe returned to Medicare.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Who yields time?\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nfrom the Republican side.\n  I ask unanimous consent, since we have had two Democrat speeches in a \nrow, that we might have two Republican speeches in a row.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I know Americans listening in and those here must sometimes find \nCongress a puzzling place. There is no question that at times rhetoric \nis inspirational and at times it is less than that. But let me just \nsay, anyone who has listened to this discussion very long will find all \nkinds, and I think at times will find it quite puzzling.\n  Sometimes they will hear cuts in spending described as increases, and \nincreases in spending described as cuts. What is a person to think? \nSometimes we will find people who avoided the draft giving glowing \nspeeches about what vehement hawks they are in military affairs, and I \nguess vice versa. Sometimes those who consistently vote for higher \ndeficits make the most eloquent speeches about balancing the budget. \nIndeed, this is a confusing place.\n  But, Mr. President, few things have equaled the millionaire lectures \nin this debate on class warfare. Let me be very specific. Throughout \nthe last day, we have listened to those who went to private schools \nwhen they grew up lecture those of us who went to public schools about \nwhat it is like to be poor. Mr. President, they do not know what they \nare talking about.\n  Mr. President, we have listened to people who, when vacation time \ncame in school, took their trips to the bay in Massachusetts or went to \nFlorida for vacations, lecture those of us who worked when vacation \ntime came.\n  Mr. President, we have listened to those who went to Ivy League \nschools, of which they are duly proud, lecture those of us who went to \npublic schools.\n  We have listened to those who are millionaires and had their daddy \nbuy everything they wanted at college lecture those of us who worked 30 \nand 40 hours a week to get through college. And when they lecture us, \nthey tell us what it is like to be poor. They do not know what they are \ntalking about.\n  Mr. President, I have listened to people on this floor who, when they \ngot out of college, did not take advantage of the opportunity to serve \nour country in the Armed Forces, but had daddy pay for their trip \naround the world or a vacation or maybe they got a Government job, or \nperhaps they even started in business. But the chances are they started \nat the top, not the bottom. Those same people have turned to us who \nhave served our country in the military when we got out of school, or \nbegan work and started at the bottom, and they have lectured us about \nwhat it is like to be poor and what it is like to be rich. These \nmarvelous, inspiring speeches about class warfare have seen trust-fund \nliberal millionaires come to this floor and lecture people who are from \nworking-class, conservative backgrounds about the class warfare that is \nin this budget.\n  Men and women, Democrats and Republicans, will understand that people \nof good conscience disagree over this budget and disagree over the \nimplications of it. But I suspect most Americans will find themselves \nchoke over the irony of trust-fund millionaires coming to this floor \nand talking about class welfare and lecturing those of us who worked \nour way through life.\n  Mr. President, this debate ought to be about facts. It ought to be \nabout the truth. And let us cover it, because I think some frank words \nare appropriate.\n  The trust-fund millionaires have come to this floor and said this \nbudget slashes Medicare. Mr. President, I do not care how rich your \nbackground is, I do not care what your father did, you ought to at \nleast have the decency to come to this floor and be honest.\n  Now, what are the facts? The Medicare funds go up, not down. Let me \nrepeat that. Under this budget, Medicare goes up $105 billion. Now, I \ndo not care if you are a multimillionaire, $105 billion is an increase, \nnot a cut. And no [[Page S6997]] one in this country, no matter how \nrich they are or how liberal they are or how much they inherited, is \nentitled to come to this floor and misrepresent the facts. Medicare \nspending goes up every year. It goes up $105 billion, and that is not a \ncut. That is an increase. Medicare spending goes up 7.1 percent a year \nevery year on the average.\n  Medicare spending per capita goes up from $4,950 to $6,400. \nRegardless of where you learned your math, that is an increase, not a \ncut.\n  To come to this floor and say we cut Medicare and imply that is class \nwarfare is simply inaccurate. Tragically, Mr. President, I fear some of \nthose who have done that know better.\n  One of the great ironies is these trust fund liberals have come to \nthe floor with another story. They have said this budget involves tax \ncuts for the rich. One said it is tax cuts for the wealthy. One said it \nis a redistribution to help the wealthy. You are entitled to your view \non whether you like this budget or not and you are entitled to dislike \nthe idea you are going to go to a balanced budget--it is a change for \nAmerica--but, Mr. President, to say this budget involves a tax cut for \nthe rich is simply not true, is simply a reflection that they have not \nread it. You can be a Democrat or Republican or liberal or \nconservative, but you cannot come to this floor and say it with a \nstraight face because it is a lie, it is not true.\n  Here are the facts: There is no tax cut in the Senate budget that \ncame out of committee. There is a provision that says if we balance the \nbudget, if we pass the reconciliation, and if there is a recalculation \nby CBO of the economies of this, that there could be a tax cut only \nwith the money that comes from refiguring the numbers.\n  But, Mr. President, what it also says specifically--and it is a \nDemocratic amendment that I cosponsor--it deals with any tax cut that \ncould come about that way; that is, through a recalculation of the \nnumbers. That amendment specifically addresses how any tax cut would be \ndealt with. That amendment specifically states it is the intent of the \nSenate and eventually the intent of Congress that 90 percent of any tax \ncut would go to working people who have incomes under $100,000.\n  You can say, ``I don't agree with that policy,'' or you can say, ``I \nagree with it,'' but to come and say that this budget is all about a \ntax cut for the rich is simply not accurate, it is not true. All you \nhave to do is bother to read the budget.\n  Mr. President, I have heard others come here and say it penalizes the \npoor. That is interesting. That is interesting. This budget increases 3 \npercent a year, and the programs that go up the fastest are the ones \nthat are aimed at the poor. The ones that are cut most dramatically \nfall in the category, in many areas, of corporate welfare.\n  To say this budget's net effect is to penalize the poor is simply not \naccurate. You can disagree with what the budget does, and it does many \nthings, but to inaccurately describe it and misrepresent it, I think, \ndetracts from the quality of the debate this Chamber ought to have.\n  I have heard people come to the floor and say, ``This budget takes \naway the earned income tax credit.'' Others have said it savages it. \nMr. President, this budget will leave the earned income tax credit \nhigher when it finishes than when it starts.\n  Does it change current law? Of course, it changes current law. It \ndoes not allow the earned income tax credit to increase as much. You \ncan disagree with that. You can say it ought to increase more. Honest \nmen and women can disagree about that subject, but to say it wipes out \nthe earned income tax credit is simply not accurate.\n  This budget recognizes the fact that the earned income tax credit had \na problem. There were indications of fraud and abuse in excess of 30 \npercent of the claims. This budget suggests that you ought to take a \nlook at that fraud and eliminate it, that you ought to correct the \nfraud.\n  I can understand how someone could say, even though an objective \ncongressional body said there was fraud in it, ``We do not agree.'' \nThey are entitled to say that. I do not believe that is accurate, but I \ncan understand they disagree with it. But they have not said that. They \nsay this wipes out the earned income tax credit.\n  I can see how someone can come to the floor and say, ``Look, even \nthough it had fraud in it, I think it is still worthwhile and you ought \nto increase it the way it originally was done.'' I do not agree with \nthat, but I think it would be an accurate statement. But to come and \nsay this wipes out the earned income tax credit is not true.\n  I think what offends me most is those who have had the most in their \nlife, who have been given millions and inherited millions come to the \nfloor and lecture us on class warfare.\n  Mr. President, there are a couple things that I think are specific \nthere that the American people ought to be aware of. For you as a \nSenator or any Member of this body to vote for endless and increasing \ndeficits for our country, I honestly do not believe is a benefit to the \npoor of this Nation. That is what the President's budget is. It is an \nincrease in deficits that continue on and increase. If there is someone \nwho honestly believes that is a benefit to the poor, they have a \ndifferent view of the world than I do. All you have to do is look at \nthe burden of paying the interest on what we owe.\n  Some people have come to the floor, some of the millionaires have \ncome to the floor and talked about how this involves tax increases on \nworking people. Mr. President, those are exactly the same ones, or at \nleast some of them are exactly the same ones that in prior Congresses \nhave voted a tax increase on Social Security on working people, or \npeople who had worked for those benefits. They are exactly the same \nones who came, or at least there are as many of them that are the same, \nthat voted for the tax increase on fuel who now come and decry tax \nincreases on working people.\n  Mr. President, the fact is this: This country has the lowest net \nsavings rate of any major industrialized country in the world. Young \nmen and women who want an opportunity in this country depend on savings \nto give new investment and new jobs. One of the reasons that we have \nproductivity increasing at a slower rate in this country is because as \nAmericans we have not reinvested in our future and in our Nation.\n  I hope the level of debate will deal with the facts in this case, and \nI hope the level of the debate will be accurate because there are \ndisagreements here and they are honest ones. But for trust fund liberal \nDemocrats and trust fund liberal millionaires to come to this floor and \nlecture those of us who work for a living about class warfare I do not \nthink contributes to the quality of debate.\n  For Members to come to this floor and misrepresent the facts of what \nthis budget does I do not think contributes to this debate. Mr. \nPresident, I think what is more important is the working men and women \nof this country have an ability to see through the quality of rhetoric \nthat has appeared on this floor about the budget. Most working men and \nwomen in this country understand that bankrupting this Nation is not to \ntheir benefit. Most men and women who work for a living in this country \nwant a future for their children and they are willing not only to work \nfor it but to sacrifice for it and to commit for it.\n  And most working men and women in this Nation understand, above all \nelse, that there is not any gift of free things in this world; that \nultimately what we have is what we work for, and that a politician who \nwants their vote by giving them handouts is not their friend nor their \nsavior, and that someone who offers them a hand up, not a handout, \nperhaps offers them the greatest gift of all.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Colorado seek to yield \ntime?\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Maine such time \nas she requires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding and concur \nwith the remarks that have been made by the Senator from Colorado in \nterms of being able to deal with the facts, because I think that this \nissue is far too important to ignore the realities of the problem that \nare facing this country for now and future generations, but also the \nfacts with respect to the plan that is before this Senate.\n  First of all, as a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I certainly \n[[Page S6998]] want to commend Senator Domenici as chair of the Senate \nBudget Committee for doing a magnificent job and providing the \nleadership necessary to bring forth a balanced budget plan.\n  What has been interesting about this debate so far as a member of the \nSenate Budget Committee and formerly as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives in the last Congress--I also served on the House Budget \nCommittee--at that time we were in the minority and we were challenged \nby the President and administration officials as a minority to bring \nforward our specific recommendations for budget cuts. The President put \nforward a plan and challenged Republicans to bring forward a plan. We \ndid and it was rejected by the Democrats and it was rejected by the \nadministration. But nevertheless, we put forward $433 billion worth of \nspecific deficit reduction recommendations.\n  Now, here today, we are in the majority and we feel that we have a \nresponsibility, as we promised the American people, to provide a \nbalanced budget by the year 2002. Indeed, the first month of this \nCongress, we debated a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. \nWe heard, time and time again, from many Members of the minority, who \nsaid, ``I support a balanced budget. I think we should balance the \nbudget. I think we should have a balanced budget by the year 2002, but \nI do not think a constitutional amendment is necessary.'' In fact, we \npassed an amendment instructing the Budget Committee, with a vote of 87 \nto 10, to come forward with a balanced budget plan.\n  What has happened in the interim is that we have had no alternatives \nfrom the minority as to how to balance the budget. What we have heard \ntoday here, and in previous debates, is attacking and criticizing the \nspecifics of our plan. I do not doubt that we can find fault with a \nplan that attempts to balance the budget over the next 7 years, given \nthe fact that it has been 26 years since this Nation has experienced a \nbalanced budget. But the fact is that there has been no constructive \ncontribution as to how we balance the budget.\n  I have two charts here, because I think it is important to illustrate \nthe point. To my right, we have the balanced budget proposal before the \nSenate. You can see over 7 years, we find that in the year 2002 we put \nthe budget back into the black. It is not perfect. There are a lot of \nthings I do not like in it either. But we have to get to a bottom line, \nwhich is to balance the budget by the year 2002. It is in the interest \nof this country, in the interest of future generations to do just that.\n  Now the other chart I have is pretty much of a blank. It is the \nDemocrat plan to balance the budget. There is nothing. We are not \ndebating alternatives or competitive plans. We had a vote earlier today \non the President's plan. The vote was 99 to zero against.\n  So the point is that the only plan before this Senate is a credible \nCBO-scored plan that says we can balance the budget by the year 2002. \nWe have no other plans. We heard in the Senate Budget Committee, well, \nit is not really a balanced budget because we have not addressed the \nsurplus of the Social Security trust fund. Again, I agree, that would \nbe another approximately $700 billion that we would have to address \nbeyond the $1.2 trillion. But I also would suggest that this plan gets \nus off the trust fund eventually and is the only plan to do so.\n  Now, if other Members have suggestions as to how we can take the \ntrust fund off now with finding an additional $700 billion in cuts over \nand above the $1.2 trillion we have to find to balance the budget by \n2002, we would welcome those recommendations. But you hear time and \ntime again about attacking specifics of this plan and what we have \ndone. But they do not talk about the positive benefits, which I will \nget into in a moment. They do not have an alternative. You do not hear \nabout competing balanced budget plans here. We do not hear about \nconstructive recommendations as to how we can do it differently.\n  All we are hearing is criticism and bickering about what is wrong \nwith the plan. I think that those who support the principle of a \nbalanced budget, and support it in reality, have an obligation to come \nforward with a specific plan and alternative if they cannot support \nthis plan. They owe it to the American people. We can cite, as we did \nin committee time and time again, the fact that many Members made \nstatements in the last few months saying how much they supported a \nbalanced budget and they wanted to work together. But when we faced \nthat reality in committee, we did not have any ideas forthcoming. They \ntalked about spending a dividend that might or might not materialize at \nthe end of 7 years, and the Congressional Budget Office has said if in \nfact we put in place a plan over 7 years that balances the budget, we \ncan realize a dividend of $170 billion. But that will happen over 7 \nyears, assuming that all we put in place happens. So what we faced in \nthe committee were numerous amendments on how to spend the dividend. \nThere were more than $500 billion worth of recommended increases in \nspending. But we did not get the corresponding reductions. We did not \nget recommendations as to how we could cut this budget and balance it \nby the year 2002.\n  So I think that people as they are watching these debates are going \nto understand the difference between those who are trying to do \nsomething for the future of this country and those who are not doing \nanything.\n  The President's budget, as I mentioned earlier today, did not address \nthe issue of deficit reduction. In fact, the President's budget that \nwas enacted in the last Congress, which represented the largest tax \nincrease in the history of this country, only provided $88 billion \nworth of spending cuts over 5 years of a collective budget--over 5 \nyears of perhaps $6 trillion. The budget that the President put forward \nthis year actually only reduced Federal spending by $32 billion over 5 \nyears which, again, represents over 5 years of collective budget of $6 \nto $7 trillion. And he only recommended $32 billion in that period of \ntime.\n  One of the previous speakers said we have had 3 consecutive years of \ndeclining deficits. Yes, that was the good news. But the bad news is \nthat the deficit is going back up. That is the whole point. That is the \nmajor problem facing this country, because the President's budget and \nplan from the past, as well as the one he recommended to Congress this \nyear, add another $2 trillion worth of debt by the year 2002--another \n$2 trillion.\n  In fact, the deficit will be $100 billion larger in the year 2000 \nthan what the President had predicted in the budget that he submitted \nto Congress this year. It will be $100 billion larger. That is not even \ntaking into account, according to the Congressional Budget Office, high \ninflationary periods or a recession. That is assuming that everything \ngoes well economically between now and the year 2000. So, in fact, that \ncould be even a higher number, a higher number than the $100 billion \nmore than the President had projected for the year 2000. So those are \nsome of the facts that we are attempting to deal with.\n  I feel if people have constructive criticism, then they have to \nrecommend ways in which to balance this budget differently. But that is \nthe bottom line. If you believe the magnitude of the debt is going to \nseriously impair this country's ability to prosper and provide the kind \nof standard of living that the American people deserve, then you have \nto support this plan, because this is the only plan that is before the \nSenate.\n  I know some of the previous speakers also mentioned tax cuts, which \nis something that was in the House plan. Well, this is the Senate plan. \nWe do not have tax cuts in this plan. We hear about tax cuts and other \nthings that have no relationship to the plan that is before the Senate. \nAnd it is very, very important, I think, to make that distinction.\n  This plan before us today will balance the budget for the first time \nin 26 years in American history. The last time we had a balanced budget \nin this country is when America put a man on the Moon.\n  Our deficit and our debt have grown 1,250 percent since we last \nbalanced the budget back in 1969. That is what we are talking about. \nThere is no other way in which to face this problem other than to make \nsome of the tough choices now. I think everybody agrees \n[[Page S6999]] we have to make some of these difficult choices, \nprovided it is fair and is responsible.\n  First of all, I should say that our plan saves Medicare. We have \nheard an awful lot about Medicare today. It is a very, very important \nprogram. So important that I would think that everyone would be \nconcerned about the trustees' report which indicates without question \nthat the hospital insurance trust fund will be insolvent by the year \n2002.\n  It is the Medicare trustees--they are not Republicans--and it was not \nthe Budget Committee who have predicted the insolvency or the \nbankruptcy of the Medicare Program in 2002.\n  Understand one thing: If we do nothing, if we do nothing about the \nMedicare problem, there will be no Medicare benefits for any of the 36 \nmillion Americans it serves after the year 2002. None. It will not \nexist. By law, the Government is prevented from providing any benefits \nif there are no assets in the insurance trust fund.\n  I would like to quote the Medicare trustees themselves, who stated \nthe following:\n\n       With the magnitude of the projected actuarial and hospital \n     insurance program, the trustees urge Congress to take \n     additional action designed to control the hospital insurance \n     program costs. The trustees believe that prompt, effective \n     and decisive action is necessary.\n\n  That is exactly what we do in our document.\n  Amazingly, the minority has no proposals, no ideas, to remedy the \nMedicare crisis. This, despite the fact that three of the Medicare \ntrustees are actual Cabinet Secretaries, and they still refuse to admit \nthere is a crisis. They say it has been mentioned before.\n  Well, we have 7 years in which to address the problem. As several of \nthe trustees testified before the Senate Budget Committee recently, \nthey said we have to take some action because it is going to take some \ntime to have an impact on the revenues of the trust fund.\n  We cannot wait until the year 2002. We cannot wait until the year \n2000. We cannot even wait until 1997. It has to be done now, in order \nto have a positive impact.\n  I, personally, think that the 36 million Americans who depend on this \nprogram--and more in the future because we will have more people \nretiring--is that they should have a sustainable health care program.\n  Now, we have one of two choices. We either attempt to address it this \nyear or we ignore it. I, frankly, think we have a responsibility to \naddress this problem.\n  So this is not a manufactured number. It is not a manufactured \ncrisis. This is from a report that was done by the trustees of the \nMedicare system. This just came out. Three of the President's Cabinet \nSecretaries are on this board. They have said that there is a problem. \nI think that we do have an obligation.\n  Now, I think the President recognized that there has been a problem \nbecause in the past he has been quoted on several occasions, and I have \nthese quotes on the charts because I think it is important to remind \neveryone that the President spoke about these issues as well when it \ncame to Medicare and the growth and the problems we have in the future.\n  He said at one meeting, back in April 1994, ``Then we'll be able to \nlower the rate of inflation--keep in mind, we do not propose to cut \nMedicare and Medicaid, Ma'am,'' in answer to a question at a town \nmeeting. ``Medicare and Medicaid under our proposal would go up at \ntwice the rate of inflation, instead of three times the rate of \ninflation.''\n\n  Then, back in October 1993, in speaking to the AARP, a very important \norganization that represents senior citizens in this country, he said, \n``Today, Medicaid and Medicare are going up at three times the rate of \ninflation. We propose to let it go up at two times the rate of \ninflation.'' Now, that is less than what we have in our budget. We have \nmuch more. ``That is not a Medicare or Medicaid cut. Only in Washington \ndo people believe that no one can get by on twice the rate of \ninflation, so when you hear all this business about cuts, let me \ncaution you that is not what is going on. We are going to have \nincreases in Medicare and Medicaid.''\n  I think we owe it to the seniors of this country to begin to address \nthis problem. In this proposal, we are recommending that we establish a \nbipartisan commission to recommend ways in which to address the \ninsolvency of the program that will occur in the year 2002, according \nto the trustees, when they issue their report.\n  Now we heard many say it has to be done within the context of \ncomprehensive health care reform. I think we ought to have health care \nreform. I think it is an imperative. Hopefully, we will be able to \naddress that, as well, in this Congress.\n  We asked the trustees when they appeared before the committee as to \nwhether or not we should have comprehensive health care reform in order \nto address this problem, or should we do it on a separate, legislative \napproach.\n  Mr. Ross responded,\n\n       I, personally, believe there may well be a two-step process \n     that is necessary, doing those things that can be done now to \n     address things that can be affected in the short run, while \n     setting up a process to deal in a more long-range and fuller \n     basis with the problem in the context of broader health care \n     reform.\n\n  The other trustee was asked, What are the alternatives if we do not \naddress the problems? And Mr. Walker said, ``Delaying will only serve \nto increase the difficulty and the severity of any related changes. In \naddition, failure to address the financial imbalance in the Medicare \nprograms will likely have long-term adverse consensus on Social \nSecurity, since the Congress has had a history of redirection of funds \nfor the relatively better financed,'' because none of these programs is \nwell financed, ``the relatively better financed programs in the short-\nterm in order to shore up the troubled programs.''\n  What they were recommending is that we take action in the short term \nand, yes, then address some of the other issues in the context of \nhealth care reform for longer-term recommendations for the long-term \nstability of the program far beyond the year 2002.\n  The trustees also estimated that it would take an immediate 4-percent \nincrease in the payroll tax or an immediate reduction in Medicare \nspending by 30 percent to deal with the insolvency issue if Congress \ndoes not make the changes in the system.\n  Obviously, we do not want that to happen. That is why, I think, that \na commission on Medicare would be very, very, helpful. Our plan before \nthe Senate today actually increases Medicare spending and saves the \nMedicare Program from going bankrupt in 7 years, as the Medicare \ntrustees have predicted.\n  Our plan provides for overall cumulative spending for Medicare over 7 \nyears of $1.6 trillion. Medicare spending will climb from $178 billion \nthis year to an estimated $283 billion in the fiscal year 2002 under \nthis proposal, an increase of $105 billion, or almost 60 percent above \nthis year's outlays alone.\n  Moreover, per capita spending on Medicare under this measure will \nrise from $4,950 per Medicare beneficiary in 1995 to more than $6,400 \nper person in the year 2002, a 29-percent increase. That is an increase \nof over $1,500 in 7 years, or an extra $200 per person each year in \nMedicare spending.\n  Our plan also protects Social Security. That is why I am also amazed \nthat so many here have said in their previous speeches that somehow \nthis plan affects Social Security. They said that about the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, as well. But there is \nnothing more important to the Social Security trust fund than making \nsure that we get our house in order with respect to our Federal budget \ndeficits. The more we spend in the red, the more we borrow from the \ntrust fund.\n  It is paramount for Social Security recipients that we address the \ndeficit issue and make every attempt to restrain the growth of our \nnational debt. That is the real threat to the Social Security program. \nThe fact is that no less than 10 percent of our Federal debt, much of \nwhich has been added over the last 2 years, is already owed to the \nSocial Security trust fund.\n That is why it is so critical for us to balance the Federal budget. In \nfact, the former Commissioner, Robert Myers, of the Social Security \nAdministration--he was Deputy Commissioner in 1981 and 1982, and he \nalso, in 1982 and 1983, served as the Executive Director on Social \nSecurity reform--this is what he had to say:\n\n\n[[Page S7000]]\n\n       In my opinion, the most serious threat to Social Security \n     is the federal government's fiscal irresponsibility. If we \n     continue to run Federal deficits year after year, and if \n     interest payments continue to rise at an alarming rate, we \n     will face two dangerous possibilities. Either we will raid \n     the trust funds to pay for our current profligacy, or we will \n     print money, dishonestly inflating our way out of \n     indebtedness. Both cases would devastate the real value of \n     the Social Security trust funds.\n\n  Further quoting Mr. Myers:\n\n       Regaining control of our fiscal affairs is the most \n     important step that we can take to protect the soundness of \n     the Social Security trust funds. I urge Congress to make that \n     goal a reality.\n\n  So our plan preserves a secure legacy for future generations. We are \nnot embracing the status quo. We do not want to condemn future \ngenerations to impossible choices on spending, which is what the \nadministration's plan certainly offered, and certainly what the \nminority's plan has offered, which is no plan. So there are no choices \nhere. And that is why this proposal before us today is so critical. \nBecause this is the only plan that will address the indebtedness of \nthis country, and to put us on a more stable path. You might ask, if we \ndo nothing to end the rising tide of debts, what happens to the young \npeople of today and to future generations? It is interesting to note, \nthe National Taxpayers Union has estimated that a child born today will \nhave to pay over $100,000 in extra taxes over the course of his or her \nlifetime in order to pay just the interest on the debt which will \naccumulate in the next 18 years. And for every $200 billion in new \ndeficit spending, a child born today will need to pay an additional \n$5,000 in taxes, just to cover the interest charges.\n  Tax burdens are so enormous that projections are that a child born \ntoday will now have to pay between 90 and 100 percent--90 and 100 \npercent--of his or her income in order to pay for the expected \nspending. That is simply not a fair burden to place on future \ngenerations. It is morally reprehensible and financially disastrous.\n  On the contrary, our plan will relieve future generations from having \nto carry the yoke of debts and deficits by reaching a balanced budget \nby the year 2002. That is our gift to the next generation of Americans. \nAnd they deserve no less.\n  While much has been said recently about supposed tax reductions in \nour plan, I would like to make one thing clear once and for all. In our \nplan, deficit reduction and balancing the budget is our only priority. \nLest we forget, it was this very administration which took great pride \nand effort to preempt the new majority in Congress last November after \nthe election by issuing its own tax cut proposal to the American people \nof at least $69 billion.\n  As the majority of Americans in every income bracket have expressed \nin opinion poll after opinion poll, we understand that deficit \nreduction must be our first priority, our only priority in this budget \nplan and our first order of business. And that is exactly what you are \ngoing to find in this budget proposal. It is nothing more and nothing \nless.\n  Under our plan, the Federal Government spending will be slowed by \n$961 billion over the next 7 years, reducing Government outlays from a \ntotal of $12.8 trillion to $11.9 trillion. If we are going to lead by \nexample, we should in deficit cutting, and we have in our budget. In \nfact, we place a strict 7-year freeze on all pay for Members of \nCongress because we think it is important that we do all that we can to \nmake sure that we are contributing to deficit reduction. In fact, I \nthink we should do more.\n  In addition to reducing Federal spending, our plan reduces the \nalbatross of Federal bureaucracy. Our budget proposal reduces the size \nand scope of a Federal bureaucracy that has overtaxed, overregulated, \nand overextended itself over past years, hurting small businesses, \nmiddle-class families, and economic expansion.\n  Our plan eliminates dozens and dozens of Federal departments, \nagencies, and programs. It abolishes unnecessary bureaucracy, \neradicates Government waste, terminates duplication, and consolidates \nand streamlines Federal programs to improve efficiency and prioritizes \nour very limited Federal resources. In short, our budget plan puts the \nFederal Government on a much-needed low dollar diet, and applies some \nfiscal therapy to our governing institutions.\n  What did the administration attempt to do? I remind you, the \nPresident, back in June 1992, said that he was going to have a 5-year \nplan for the American people to balance the budget. Of course, he never \npresented that to the Congress. He has never developed such a plan. But \nin his budget for fiscal year 1996 he eliminates just one Federal \nprogram, the Interstate Commerce Commission. That was the \nadministrations's commitment to reducing the size of Government in \nWashington.\n  But I think it is important to look at the benefits of a plan to \nbalance the budget by the year 2002. A balanced budget plan prepares \nAmerica for future economic growth. It is right for America because the \nbalanced Federal budget is good economics, good accounting, it is good \nfor job creation, it is good for productivity, it is good for savings, \nit is good for reducing taxes, and it is very, very important in \nrestoring the faith and trust that is essential for America to have \nbetween government and the people.\n  According to the General Accounting Office, if we balance the budget \nby the year 2002, the average American will have a real growth in \nincome of 36 percent by the year 2020. Others predict that passage of a \nbalanced budget will result in a 2.5-percent drop in interest rates, \nwhile the Wharton School of Business predicts a 4-percent drop. With a \n2.5-percent drop in interest rates, our interest payments will be \nlowered by more than $600 billion between now and the year 2002.\n  Finally, it has been pointed out that when we do have a balanced \nbudget, in the year 2002, interest rates will stay around 3.5 percent. \nFor average homeowners this will mean a savings of $500 per month on \ntheir mortgage payments.\n  Another reason we must have a balanced budget set forth in our plan \nis because our Nation cannot continue to live in a fiscal condition \nwhere our standard of living is being continually challenged and \nlowered by the effects of annual deficits and increased debts. Without \na balanced budget, America will become a second-rate economy with a \nsecond-rate standard of living.\n  We can no longer afford a gross interest payment on the debt of $339 \nbillion this year and $372 billion next year. Within a few years--and \nthis is an amazing statistic--the interest on the debt will consume 50 \npercent of all discretionary spending. In fact, since 1980 interest on \nthe debt is the only area of the budget that has grown faster than \nentitlements, at a rate of 120 percent.\n  We can no longer afford a debt of $4.9 trillion, a debt so large that \neach person's share of the debt would have grown from $18,500 today to \n$23,700 per person, under the President's proposal, in 1999, a \nproposal, as I mentioned, we soundly rejected this morning by a vote of \n99 to zero. So who says bipartisanship is nonexistent when it comes to \nrecognizing a bad budget?\n  We can no longer afford to continue to allow the income of American \nfamilies to deteriorate because of the Federal Government's fiscal \nineptitude. According to the Concord Coalition, without the debt \nburdens imposed by recurring debts, the average family income would be \n$50,000 rather than $35,000.\n  The truth is, our plan for a balanced budget by the year 2002 is the \nright plan for America because, if it passes, it will be the very first \nbalanced budget in more than a quarter of a century. Today, 26 years \nand a generation later, we have a chance to restore some fiscal \nequilibrium in our country. So now is clearly the time. Judging the \ntrends, now is the time to act or we will quickly reach a dangerous and \nirresponsible point of no return.\n  In the 1960's, deficits in America averaged $6 billion per year. In \nthe 1970's, deficits averaged $38 billion per year. In the 1980's, they \naveraged $156 billion per year.\n  So far in the 1990's they have averaged almost $260 billion per year. \nClearly, signs are pointing to a worsening of economic conditions \nbefore we reach an improvement. That is why this is potentially our \nlast rendezvous with history. We have tried different paths before. We \nhave tried numerous legislative fixes, jump-starts, we have even tried \nstatutory attempts like Gramm-Rudman-Hollings and the Rudman Act and \nthe Byrd Act, and the [[Page S7001]] Humphrey-Hawkins Act. We tried \nrescissions and freezes and spending caps, and some, like the \nadministration, even resorted to onerous tax hikes to get the American \npeople to pay for the Federal Government's inaction.\n But the fact is that the problem remains, and it has only gotten \nworse.\n\n  I think, Mr. President, that we can do better, and we must do better. \nThis plan sets aside the gimmicks, and balances the budget and the old \nfashioned way with real budget priorities, spending reduction, and \nfiscal responsibility. It will allow us to start anew and to plan for a \nbrighter future for our children as they pursue their own American \ndream. Our children's legacy is too priceless to be squandered.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I do not know who is controlling time on \nthis side. But I yield myself such time as I may use at this particular \npoint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has to ask unanimous consent to \nuse time.\n  Mr. ROBB. I ask unanimous consent to use such time as may be \nrequired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, as we continue our debate on the budget resolution, \nlet us remember that this is the easy part. A budget resolution is not \na budget any more than a balanced budget amendment is a balanced \nbudget. It is easy to vote for a constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget, and it is relatively easy to vote for a nonspecific budget \nresolution. The hard part is actually producing a balanced budget.\n  Both a balanced budget amendment and a balanced budget resolution are \nin effect a commitment to make the really tough choices required to get \nto a balanced budget. The heavy lifting comes later. The pain will not \nreally be felt, and the magnitude of the sheer sacrifice required will \nnot truly become a reality until the authorizing, appropriating, and \nfinance committees finish their work, and specific programs are cut by \nspecific amounts and specific revenues are raised either by increasing \ntax rates or eliminating tax breaks. That formidable task still looms \nover the horizon even after this budget resolution is passed.\n  Those of us who voted for the balanced budget amendment and those who \nvoted against the balanced budget amendment, because they did not \nbelieve we needed to change the Constitution to provide the courage \nrequired to make the tough decisions, have a special responsibility to \nwork together to produce a balanced budget. The framework of this \ndebate is how to get to a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n  We ought to acknowledge up front, however, that even the current \nRepublican budget resolution does not actually get us to a true \nbalanced budget by 2002 because it still uses the Social Security \nsurpluses for the next 7 years to mask the size of the remaining \ndeficit as we have been doing for many years in the past. Therefore, we \ncannot deny that, even if we fulfill the promise of the current budget \nresolution in 2002, we will still be spending $113 billion more than we \ntake in.\n  Nonetheless, this resolution clearly moves us in the right direction, \nand the Republicans are to be commended.\n  President Clinton started us in the right direction in 1993 with a \nbold mix of spending cuts and income tax increases limited to the top \n1.2 percent of the wage earners that gave us the largest deficit \nreduction package in our Nation's history. I had hoped for similar \nboldness in the administration's budget for this year. The political \nconsiderations apparently dictated otherwise, as they obviously did for \nthe two previous administrations. Therefore, the Republicans get and \ndeserve credit for keeping the momentum going.\n  Now in control of the Congress, the Republicans are struggling to \nmake the tough choices. And it seems to me that it is critical that we \nwork together to reach the agreed-upon goal by the year 2002.\n  We should applaud Senator Domenici and Representative Kasich for \ndoing what they said they would do by developing budget resolutions \nthat create an outline for how our budget can, if we count in the \nSocial Security surplus, achieve balance by the year 2002. We do not \nhave to agree on every suggested cut. But I hope we can be constructive \nin our criticism.\n  In all fairness, it is difficult to attack Republicans for advancing \na faulty plan when we Democrats have not yet offered a better one. We \nshould take advantage of this historic opportunity to lay out our \ndifferent priorities for the Nation within the context of a balanced \nbudget. And I can assure you that nothing that we are planning, Mr. \nPresident, to propose in the way of a amendment lessen our chances of \nmeeting that goal in the year 2002.\n  Our parties have very different visions of government. We should \ndebate these differences honestly and constructively. I applaud the \nstrength of the convictions that drives my Democratic colleagues to \nfight for programs which help children, the elderly, and the \ndisadvantaged. Protecting the defenseless and aiding the less fortunate \nhave always been a hallmark of our great party. In my view, however, \nfailing to balance the budget as soon as possible will ultimately harm \nprecisely those we seek to protect.\n  We are on an unsustainable path that places our Nation's future at \nrisk. Every dollar we borrow to fund a program today will have to be \nrepaid with interest by our children tomorrow. And every dollar our \nchildren have to spend repaying interest on our debt is one less dollar \nfor them to use to build schools, improve highways, pride health care, \nor fund law enforcement. In truth, we are paying today for past \nfailures to address the upwardly spiraling national debt. This year, 15 \npercent of our annual budget is devoted to paying interest on the \nmassive debt we began accruing in earnest during the 1980's. In fact, \nif it were not for the interest we are paying on this whole debt, our \nbudget this year would be balanced.\n  In any event, we can no longer afford to use deficit reduction as a \npolitical hot potato. Now is the time for real leadership. We should \nbegin providing that leadership by educating the American people on a \nbipartisan basis about the sacrifice that reducing the deficit requires \nfrom us all. We have a higher calling than current political passion. \nThe temptation to tear down the other side is difficult to resist.\n  For the sake of the next generation, however, we should not allow \nourselves to do to Republicans what they did to us when we made the \ntough decisions to reduce the deficit in 1993. When we were in the \nmajority, we made the hard choices without a single Republican vote. \nRepublicans then in the minority decided to exploit those tough \ndecisions, and succeeded in the last election largely as a result. The \nmiddle class was led to believe their income taxes had been raised \nwhen, in fact, we increased the income tax rate only on wealthiest 1.2 \npercent of Americans who could best afford it, and actually reduced \ntaxes for the 16 percent least affluent working families who needed a \nbreak.\n  Likewise, people were led to believe that we did not cut spending. \nBut the fact is that we cut $255 billion in Federal spending. The \ntactics deployed to attack the 1993 plan, however, are what make \nbalancing the budget so difficult and which have kept us on the path to \nincomprehensible indebtedness.\n  If we seek revenge against the Republicans and resort to the scare \ntactics and distortions that so successfully ruined our efforts to \nachieve even greater deficit reduction in 1993, we will have abdicated \nour responsibility to protect future generations.\n  We need the courage to ignore the polls which suggest that, while a \nmajority of Americans believe we should balance the budget, and even \ngreater majority oppose cutting the programs that contribute the most \nto the deficit. And of course, no one wants a tax increase.\n  There are, however, only two ways to balance the budget. We either \ncut spending or raise revenues. And, in truth, we need to do both. We \nneed to focus our efforts on cutting all the Federal spending that we \ncan eliminate in good conscience.\n And we should not shy away from terminating departments, agencies or \nprograms that do not make sense, even though they have a strong \nconstituency. But, after we cancel all of the useless, inefficient, or \nunnecessary spending we can identify, [[Page S7002]] if we still cannot \nbalance the budget, we are going to have to have the political courage \nto raise taxes. Otherwise, we will be conceding that we are unwilling \nto live within our means.\n\n  Our job as leaders is to describe the choices, educate the people, \nand explain that we cannot get to balance merely by eliminating waste, \nfraud and abuse, cutting welfare, and stopping foreign aid. There is no \nline item for the former, and the latter each represent less than one \npercent of our current budget. And we cannot let the polls dictate our \nresponse. Our best judgment of what is right for America in the long \nrun should be our guide. In the oft-repeated words of Edmund Burke, \n``[y]our representative owes you, not his industry only, but his \njudgment; and he betrays instead of serving you if he sacrifices it to \nyour opinion.''\n  If, to gain political advantage, we pummel those who make the tough \ndecisions to reduce the deficit, we will poison the atmosphere and sow \nthe seeds of our own destruction. Balancing the budget will become \nimpossible. As a result, we will have succeeded in being the first \ngeneration to leave the country in worse condition than we inherited. \nBy arguing that painful cuts or tax increases are not necessary, we \nsend a dangerous message to the people we serve. We simply cannot \ncontinue to tell the American people that it is possible to have it all \nwithout paying for it.\n  The fear of partisan attack, however, has already made this process \nmore difficult. Knowing the power of various interest groups, both \nsides are afraid to recommend cutting sacred programs or raising needed \nrevenues. Social Security accounts for 22 percent of our annual current \nbudget, Medicare for 12 percent. If we do nothing, entitlements and \ninterest on the national debt will consume every dollar the Federal \nGovernment receives by 2013. No program can be placed off-limits if we \nseek to balance the budget in the most even-handed manner possible. If \nsacrifice is spread broadly and fairly, we can succeed. Otherwise, we \nwill fail.\n  Our guiding principle should be to provide Federal benefits only to \nthose who truly need the Federal Government. We can no longer afford to \ndo otherwise. Calls for limiting Federal benefits to those in need, \nhowever, should not be misconstrued as a battle cry for class warfare.\n  Democrats should be willing to admit that there is nothing wrong with \nwealth or economic success. Indeed, that is the rung on the economic \nladder that most Americans are trying to reach. Republicans, on the \nother hand, should acknowledge that a progressive income tax, which is \nbased on the fair notion that people should pay taxes according to \ntheir ability, and denying unneeded benefits to the well-off, is not \nclass warfare. It is merely a recognition that we do not have the money \nto pay $30 billion in entitlements each year to families who make over \n$100,000 annually. In short, Federal revenues should go only to those \nwho need and deserve our help.\n  Given this fiscal crisis, I believe it is sheer folly to even be \nconsidering a tax cut at this time. Indeed, we play a dangerous game \nwhen we pander to those who say ``it's our money, and we want it \nback.'' Tax revenues pay for governmental functions that benefit all of \nus, such as national defense, highways, schools, and law enforcement. \nWe are bound together as a community of individuals who support a \nsocial contract. We can support that social contract either out of \ncompassion, believing that we have a moral obligation to each other, or \nwe can support the social contract out of fear, knowing that if we fail \nto help those truly in need, a feeling of sheer hopelessness will \neventually lead them to believe that they have no choice but to take by \nforce what they believe they need to survive.\n  I support the bold efforts of those who seek to balance the budget by \n2002. The longer we wait, the more difficult the task becomes. If the \nevents of the last week are an indication, however, we are at risk once \nagain of making deficit reduction a pitched political battle. If we do \nso, the primary casualties will be the children of the next generation, \ndefenselessly caught in the crossfire. Madam President, I thank the \nChair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I join my distinguished colleague from \nVirginia in our endeavor to support a balanced budget.\n  I am not sure I fully understood his final comments about the \nchildren in the crossfire, but it is clear to me that children will \nshoulder this debt, which is growing constantly, unless we join \ntogether, as my colleague said, Republicans and Democrats, in resolving \nthis budget problem.\n  Madam President, I will have further detailed remarks on this issue \nearly next week; but I wanted at this time to close out the debate \ntoday with an appeal for all Senators to examine the impact of the \nSenate budget proposal on our national defense.\n  Both my junior colleague and I are privileged to serve on the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, and he knows full well that defense has been \ndeclining, Madam President, for every fiscal year for a decade; for a \nfull decade.\n  This morning, I say to my colleagues, this article appeared in the \nnewspapers in Virginia's Tidewater area, where we are privileged to \nhave the world's largest naval base, in Norfolk. It states: ``Naval \nReserve Jets Activated for Duty in Bosnia Combat.'' If I may ask my \ncolleagues to bear with me while I read one or two paragraphs.\n\n       ``Special reserves'' are being used during downsizing. For \n     the first time--\n\n  I repeat, for the first time.\n\n     since the Vietnam War, a squadron of Naval Reserve warplanes \n     is being activated and sent to the Mediterranean to join \n     military operations over Bosnia.\n       The deployment is part of the Pentagon's plan to rely more \n     on the ``select reserves'' during the military's downsizing, \n     officials said.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that, at the conclusion of my remarks, the \nentire article, together with another one, appear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  Now, there is clear documentation of these 10 consecutive years of \ndownsizing of the U.S. military--10 years. And the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, indeed the Republicans under the leadership of \nChairman Thurmond, have been addressing this issue. And under the \nleadership of the chairman and Senator McCain, there will be \nforthcoming proposals to address what I regard as a very serious \nproblem, namely that the House Budget Committee proposal for defense \nspending, which is $267.3 billion and adopted by the House just \nyesterday, falls in the area which I hope, and others hope, to achieve \nfor the Senate.\n  The Senate bill is the same as the President's submission and \nconsiderably less than the House bill. And therein lies the difference \nthat I, together with others, will ask the Senate to address next week. \nIt is a very serious problem.\n  Also appearing in the news today is a second article, from the \nWashington Post, that concerns me greatly, Madam President. And that is \nentitled, ``Clinton Administration Trades Military Modernization for \nReadiness.''\n  I ask my colleagues to indulge me in reading a paragraph or two:\n  ``In avoiding a short-term problem with military readiness, the \nClinton administration has created a long-term headache over \nmodernization of weapons and equipment.\n  ``It has cut procurement of weapons systems to the lowest level''--I \nrepeat, the low lowest level--``in nearly a half-century in order to \nsustain training, maintenance and other readiness spending at robust \nlevels.''\n  Madam President, I am not faulting the Secretary of Defense. He is \ngiven only so much money to deal with. He does the very best he can--\nindeed, Secretary Perry is one of the finest to have ever held that \noffice--the very best he can to project the Department's expenditures \nover each of the fiscal years. He comes from the research and \ndevelopment area of the private sector. He knows full well the danger \nof this course of action.\n  I have discussed this very problem with him, as have other Members of \nthis Chamber, and we realize he really has no alternative.\n  All of this to say, Madam President, that early next week I hope the \nmanagers of this bill provide the Armed Services Committee an \nopportunity to [[Page S7003]] address this issue in greater detail and \nto focus the attention of the entire Senate on the very significant \ndifference between the House approach and the current Senate proposal \nnow before us. It is my hope that the Senate will make some \nadjustments. But I leave the details as to how it is to be done until \nthe opening remarks by our chairman of the committee, together with \nSenator McCain, and I hope to join them in this effort.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         Naval Reserve Jets Activated for Duty in Bosnia Combat\n\n                            (By Jack Dorsey)\n\n       For the first time since the Vietnam War, a squadron of \n     Naval Reserve warplanes is being activated and sent to the \n     Mediterranean to join military operations over Bosnia.\n       The deployment is part of the Pentagon's plan to rely more \n     on the ``select reserves'' during the military's downsizing, \n     officials said.\n       Two EA-6B Prowler jets and about 30 personnel from Tactical \n     Electronic Warfare Squadron 209, based at Andrews Air Force \n     Base near Washington, left Thursday for the Norfolk-based \n     carrier Theodore Roosevelt.\n       The Roosevelt, currently in the Red Sea, is heading toward \n     the Adriatic Sea off the coast of the former Yugoslavia to \n     assist NATO and United Nations personnel taking part in \n     Operation Deny Flight.\n       In this instance, the jets will augment an active-duty \n     squadron of four or five Prowlers assigned to the carrier. \n     The reserves will rotate pilots and crews from the U.S. every \n     30 to 60 days for six months.\n       The deployment of reserves also is a result of the \n     military's ``right-sizing,'' said Capt. John Kistler, deputy \n     chief of staff for the Naval Reserve Command, headquartered \n     in New Orleans.\n       While some reserve units were called up during the Desert \n     Shield and Desert Storm operations, no reserve tactical jets \n     were needed aboard carriers, Kistler said. The military \n     refers to its ``tactical'' aircraft as those capable of \n     waging combat, such as fighters and bombers.\n       ``Until right-sizing started, we had an air wing for every \n     carrier,'' Kistler said. ``There was always plenty to go \n     around.\n       ``Now, when they need to make up a different configuration \n     for a better scenario like they did for this one, we believe \n     they will be increasing their reliance on reserves to finish \n     out a carrier (air wing) to whatever size they want it to \n     be.''\n       The next deployment may require more helicopters, for \n     example, he said. A Naval Reserve squadron of H-60 \n     helicopters out of Norfolk was ordered to Haiti last fall for \n     six weeks.\n       All of the reservists volunteered for the Haiti assignment, \n     Kistler said.\n       ``It is very exciting for them. They have always known they \n     could do the job well and this is another chance to prove it. \n     We didn't have to ask anyone to go. It was all volunteer.''\n       The Navy Prowlers are four-seat, twin-engine jets equipped \n     with anti-radar missiles that home in our enemy ground radar. \n     The jets also carry pods that contain high-powered electronic \n     jamming equipment that can be used against enemy air \n     defenses.\n       While the fighting forces in Bosnia have relatively few \n     aircraft: possibly two or more Soviet-built MiGs--land-based \n     mobile missile launchers on the backs of trucks.\n       The Prowlers can jam electronic signals, including \n     communications and missile commands.\n       Each jet has a pilot, navigator, electronic warfare \n     operator and missile operator.\n       A unit of Air Force EF-111 Ravens currently performing \n     similar duties out of Aviano Air Base in Northern Italy is \n     ready to rotate back to the United States.\n       The Navy Prowlers will take their place, operating \n     primarily from the carrier but out of Aviano during periods \n     of poor weather.\n                                                                    ____\n\n   Clinton Administration Trades Military Modernization for Readiness\n\n                          (By Bradley Graham)\n\n       In avoiding a short-term problem with military readiness, \n     the Clinton administration has created a long-term headache \n     over modernization of weapons and equipment.\n       It has cut procurement of weapons systems to the lowest in \n     nearly a half-century in order to sustain training, \n     maintenance and other readiness spending at robust levels.\n       So far, this trade-off has paid off politically and \n     operationally. Pentagon officials largely have silenced \n     earlier congressional allegations of a readiness crisis, \n     citing the able performance of U.S. forces in Haiti and the \n     Persian Gulf region. The military chiefs have supported \n     assertions by the Defense Department's civilian leaders that \n     no immediate readiness problem exists.\n       But Defense Secretary William J. Perry acknowledges his \n     spending plan is open to attack for shortchanging \n     modernization in the near term.\n       ``If you're looking at an area where this budget can be \n     criticized,'' Perry told members of the House Budget \n     Committee recently, ``I think that this is the area where it \n     is most vulnerable.''\n       Indeed, Perry is coming under fire from some in Congress \n     for the gross imbalance between readiness and modernization. \n     ``This shortsighted strategy puts at risk our future military \n     capability,'' Rep. Floyd Spence (R-S.C.), chairman of the \n     House National Security Committee, told the service \n     secretaries at a recent hearing.\n       For all their concern, however, congressional Republicans \n     have not put forward a formula for maintaining both readiness \n     and modernization giving existing budget constraints and \n     troop levels.\n       GOP leaders had hoped to bolster the procurement accounts \n     by boosting overall defense spending, but that objective has \n     become subordinate to the imperative of reducing the deficit. \n     Rather than attempt any major re-balancing of President \n     Clinton's program, Congress appears inclined to add little if \n     anything to the administration's plan.\n       Perry has been committed since taking charge of the \n     Pentagon early last year to keeping readiness high during the \n     draw-down of U.S. forces. He wants to avoid the deterioration \n     in performance and morale that marked defense cutbacks under \n     President Jimmy Carter. He also makes the point that the \n     numerous demands being placed on the military to respond to \n     hot spots around the world require a high state of \n     preparedness.\n       When anecdotal reports of eroding\n        readiness started emerging last autumn, followed by \n     official confirmation in November that the readiness \n     ratings of three Army divisions had fallen, congressional \n     Republicans accused the administration of military \n     mismanagement.\n       The administration blamed the problem instead on lack of \n     funding for unplanned operations in Somalia, Rwanda, Bosnia, \n     Haiti and elsewhere; to compensate, the services siphoned \n     money from readiness accounts. With a fresh infusion of \n     operational funds from two supplemental appropriations in the \n     past eight months, the Pentagon was able to raise its \n     flagging readiness indicators--and political controversy \n     shifted to the depressed state of military modernization.\n       A panel of retired four-star officers concluded in a recent \n     report to Congress that the administration was ``failing \n     utterly'' to invest adequately in the nation's military \n     future. ``Our legacy to the next generation is likely to be \n     45-year-old training aircraft, 35-year-old bombers and \n     airlifters, 25-year-old fighters, 35-year-old trucks and 40-\n     year-old medium lift helicopters,'' said the report by Air \n     Force Gen. Charles A. Gabriel, Marine Corps Gen. Alfred M. \n     Gray, Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost and Army Gen. Robert W. \n     RisCassi.\n       The administration has requested $39.4 billion in budget \n     authority for procurement in fiscal 1996, which adjusted for \n     inflation would be a decline of 71 percent from a peak in \n     1985 and the lowest level since 1950.\n       For the Army, this means no major equipment orders beyond \n     several dozen Black Hawk helicopters, only upgrades of Apache \n     helicopters, Bradley vehicles and Abrams tanks. For the Air \n     Force, which is pouring billions of dollars into development \n     of the new F-22 fighter to supplant the F-15, there is little \n     money left to replace aging squadrons of F-16s. And for the \n     Navy, orders for new ships are to dwindle to three next year; \n     naval planners also are concerned about possibly running out \n     of planes in the next few years to put aboard aircraft \n     carriers as A-6 aircraft are retired early.\n       The administration's five-year budget plan envisions a 47 \n     percent increase in modernization spending between 1996 and \n     2001, but much of\n      that is not projected to materialize until the turn of the \n     century--and depends on the uncertain realization of \n     substantial savings from military base closings and \n     acquisition reforms being instituted.\n       In the meantime, the administration is gambling that high-\n     tech upgrades can extend the useful lives of existing \n     military hardware. And it is betting that the nation's \n     military-industrial base still will be there when needed \n     again.\n       Further, the wholesale deferment of many modernization \n     projects risks creating a ``bow wave'' of future procurement \n     that some defense experts warn may prove too large and costly \n     to manage. Rather than cancel acquisition programs, the \n     Pentagon for the most part has opted for stretch-outs and \n     deferrals of such items as the Army's Comanche helicopter, \n     the Air Force's F-22 fighter, the Navy's DDG-51 destroyer and \n     New Attack Submarine and the Marine Corps' V-22 aircraft and \n     new amphibious vehicle. Other programs are slated for cuts in \n     planned production rates.\n       ``Generally, the most efficient way to achieve savings in \n     the procurement budget is to cancel outright a relatively \n     small number of programs, rather than to stretch out or defer \n     production of a large number of programs,'' noted a report by \n     the Defense Budget Project, an independent think tank. \n     ``Unfortunately, the administration appears to be taking the \n     latter approach.''\n\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I rise to discuss the issue of Medicare \nand Medicare reform.\n  The two Medicare public trustees, in the 1995 annual report, have \nstated: ``We feel strongly that comprehensive Medicare reforms should \nbe undertaken to make this program financially sound now and over the \nlong term.''\n  As a newcomer to this body, I see these words as a physician who has \ntaken care of thousands of Medicare [[Page S7004]] patients. I want to \nspeak for those patients and say that we have an obligation to respond.\n  I have seen the great advantages of the Medicare system which has \nserved millions, almost 38 million people currently, who are senior \ncitizens and individuals with disabilities. I have seen the very great \naspects of the program and I have seen the deficiencies. I have seen \nthe need for improving the Medicare system. And I can tell you that \nsuch improvements are required to guarantee the future of the program.\n  These very same trustees have stated that Medicare part A, the \nhospital part of Medicare, will be bankrupt in 7 years unless we act.\n  Our elderly population will continue to grow faster than other \nsegments of the population and they will continue to live longer. \nMedical innovations will continue--innovations that literally transform \nhealth care as we know it today. We need to deliver high-quality health \ncare at a lower aggregate cost. But that does not mean that maintaining \nthe current rate of spending growth or even adding more money to the \nMedicare system will get to the driving source of the problems, the \nchallenges we face today in Medicare.\n  My hope, in part, in coming to the Senate was to be able to share my \nexpertise and perspective, my experience as a physician, with my \ncolleagues. As the only physician in the Senate today, I want to share \nsome of the realities of the Medicare system that we have today--\nrealities that go far beyond the talk of billions of dollars or \npercentage of rates of growth, realities that will help put it in \nperspective.\n  Let us think for a moment of Medicare as a patient. Let us say \nMedicare is a man in his early sixties. He visits his doctor because of \nchest pain. The patient is 40 pounds overweight, smokes too much, \ndrinks too much, does not exercise. The doctor explains in very clear \nterms that the patient is at high risk of a heart attack.\n  The doctor tells him very clearly that he must change his diet, cut \nback on alcohol, cut back on smoking, exercise more. All of these \nthings will reduce the risk of a heart attack in the short run. \nMoreover, he will lose weight and improve his long-term health and life \nexpectancy. This will give his family greater security, as well.\n  ``But, Doctor,'' the patient asks, ``I don't care about my weight. \nJust tell me what I can do to fix my chest pain.'' The doctor again \nexplains to him that when he changes his behavior to save his heart, he \nwill also lose weight, feel better, achieve a better quality of life, \nand live longer. Weight reduction will result from the actions he will \ntake to protect his heart. It is not the reason he is engaging in this \nprogram of exercise and diet to lose weight, but by losing weight that \nis what will happen.\n  I hope the analogy is clear. The public trustees have told us that \nthe patient--Medicare--is at high risk of a heart attack. The diagnosis \nhas been made for us. It is crystal clear. They tell us if we do \nnothing, Medicare simply will not be with us in 7 years. We need to \nchange Medicare to preserve Medicare, to prevent bankruptcy. In the \nlong run, we will have to look at structural reforms to improve \nMedicare well into the 21st century. We are going to have to look at \nhow to improve Medicare so that it can live a long and prosperous life.\n  The program changes made in the short term to slow the rate of growth \nare very similar to the heart patient's exercise regime. No one wants \nto do it, but it has to be done. Some short-term pain, yes, but for \nsignificant long-term gain. It is hard enough to lose 40 pounds, let \nalone to put it off until all of a sudden you are up to 80 pounds. At \n80 pounds, it becomes next to impossible.\n  As we see in this proposed budget, when we save Medicare from a \nshort-term heart attack, the deficit will come down as a necessary \nbyproduct. We must change Medicare to save it. And when the deficit \ncomes down, we should look on all this as a good thing because it will \nproduce significant benefits for our entire economy in the same way \nthat our Medicare patient losing weight will benefit his health. But \nthe primary reason we are changing Medicare is to preserve and protect \nMedicare, just as the patient is losing weight to prevent that heart \nattack.\n  Earlier today my distinguished colleague from West Virginia said he \nhas not heard a single complaint or a single problem about Medicare \nlacking choices. I have lived within Medicare. I have heard the \ncomplaints, as well as experienced the benefits. There is much we can \ndo--much we can do--to improve Medicare, to save it.\n  My last heart transplant that I performed was on December 13, 1993, a \nwonderful fellow, Bob Meadows. Bob is doing well now. He has a new \nheart. He is feeling great. He is on top of the world. However, he \nwrote me a letter recently talking about a problem that very \nspecifically aims at Medicare.\n  He and I have been through a lot together. His problem is that he is \ngoing to be 65 years old on June 23, a month from now. At that point, \nhe will be eligible for Medicare. So what is the problem? Bob will give \nup his current insurance that he has, which is pretty good, and move \ninto the Government-run Medicare Program. He has no choice today. \nShould Bob not have a choice? He had a choice when he was 64 and 63 \nyears of age. He has no choice when he is 65 years of age. Should he be \nforced to leave his current plan just because of a birthday, because he \nis entering the Medicare program?\n  To improve Medicare we should allow choice, we should give him that \nopportunity to stay with his previous plan. We should have him direct \nMedicare, to direct his Medicare dollars and to use as he best \ndetermines for himself, given his own medical needs, rather than have \nMedicare direct him.\n  When we talk about reforming Medicare or improving Medicare, we must \nstress the importance of having choice in our Medicare system, choice \nwhich simply does not exist today, choice similar to the choice that I \nhad in coming to this body 5 months ago. I had a choice of a variety of \nhealth plans. Our seniors do not have that choice. I had a choice in \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. Seniors do not have that \ntype of choice, but we can give them a structure of similar choices to \nimprove the system.\n  Bob had a choice before I did his heart transplant. He will not have \na choice next month. Some of our colleagues have told us that people \nlike Bob, senior citizens, individuals with disabilities, do not \ndeserve a choice once they go into the Government-run Medicare system, \nor others say they do not know if these plans will be good for seniors, \nand others simply say that seniors are not capable of making the choice \nof what is best for them. I disagree.\n  Bob, because he is a heart transplant recipient, is discovering very \nquickly that Medicare is going to be so inflexible that it will not \nmeet his needs. Bob has enormous prescription drug costs because he is \nrequired to take medicines, drugs, immuno-suppressive agents on \nschedule everyday for the rest of his life. If he misses it, the heart \nthat I put in will stop, and he will die. His heart will be rejected. \nIt will result in longer hospitalizations, increased costs to the \ntaxpayers.\n  His prescription costs are high, almost $2,000 per month during this \nfirst year. Luckily his insurance has been covering these costs, but \nnext month, when Bob joins Medicare, he will not have access to a plan \nthat will give him affordable coverage for these drugs. His drug costs \nwill continue, continue very high, more than $10,000 each year.\n  Bob has been doing all the right things. He has been shopping around \nfor supplemental coverage. Almost 90 percent of patients getting \nMedicare today have some type of supplemental coverage, but the \nsupplemental medigap models, they are called, only provide for limited \nprescription drug coverage. Bob, even with medigap coverage, will have \nto pay more than $7,000 a year for his immuno-suppressive medicines. In \nMedicare today, unlike most private plans, there is no limit to out-of-\npocket expenditures. Yes, there are things we can do to improve \nMedicare today, to give choice to our senior citizens.\n  Bob will be joining Medicare. If he fails to do so promptly, he is \ngoing to be penalized if he tries to join at a later date. Bob will \nhave to find supplemental coverage and will ultimately look into having \nto be declared what is called medically needy by the State of Tennessee \nso that he can then access Medicaid funding to help pay these \n[[Page S7005]] bills. Again, there is room to reform and improve the \nMedicare system.\n  Bob and his wife planned for retirement, but his health status, which \nhe did not ask for, straddles him with enormous medical costs. Now \nMedicare is going to straddle him with extraordinary reliance on a \nprogram that is not flexible. We, together, would serve Bob better, far \nbetter, if we improved, reformed Medicare to give him the opportunity \nto choose from among a variety of health plans that would better serve \nhis individual needs.\n  The Republican balanced budget plan will allow Medicare's rate of \nspending to increase by more than twice the rate of inflation. At the \nsame time, we must update Medicare, bring it into 1995 and to the 21st \ncentury to allow people like Bob continuity of health care by \npermitting them to keep the same plan that they had when they were 64 \nyears of age. Our senior citizens deserve it. Our senior citizens must \nbe given the security that Medicare will be here 7 years from now, \nsecurity that they do not have unless we act.\n  Bob's new heart that I put in last year will be going strong in 7 \nyears, but will Medicare? Not unless we act. We must pass the balanced \nbudget plan. We must establish the bipartisan commission which is part \nof that plan to make recommendations on true Medicare improvements, \nMedicare reform, and we must ensure that Bob and other senior citizens \ntruly will have a Medicare system that will be preserved and of which \nthey can be proud over the next decade.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, as far as this Senator knows, we have no further \nspeakers for today. I have some remarks that I would like to make on \nthe matter at hand and then advise the Senate briefly what amendments \nwe intend to take up and what those amendments are about that we have \nscheduled on our side, recognizing that we will be going back and forth \non the amendments.\n  But first, Madam President, we will be talking more about this on \nMonday. What we are going to be talking more about Monday is to try and \nexplain to America the deep cuts that are being provided for in the \nRepublican budget with regard to Medicare.\n  I hear a lot of comment about the concern for America. I have heard a \nlot of talk about the Democrats that want to spend. I simply say to the \nSenate again that the Democrats, once again, have not offered an \namendment in committee, we have not offered an amendment on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate that raises the deficit, the violates the 2002 date \nsuggested in the Republican budget which this Senator and several \nDemocrats happen to agree with.\n  Once again, on this amendment, and others that we are going to be \noffering, we are simply going to be dipping into the reserve of $170 \nbillion that is specified eventually likely to be available for a tax \ncut, to alleviate the extraordinary hits--not eliminate them--but to \nrelieve the extraordinary hits on some programs that we just do not \nthink are capable of accepting those kinds of hits.\n  So let us make it clear once again, despite the theatrics that I have \nheard from those on the other side of the aisle today, that this is a \nterrible spending program that the Democrats are about, that the \nRepublicans are trying to save money, they are trying to balance the \nbudget and they are the only good guys because those bad Democrats on \nthe other side of the aisle, you see, want to take this money and throw \nit away, I guess.\n  In this particular case, and on other amendments we will be offering, \nwe are not throwing money away. We are not going out and saying, \n``Here, wind, take these hard earned tax dollars and let it blow into \nthe Potomac.''\n  No, what we are saying, Madam President, is that we just have \ndifferent priorities than our Republican brethren. We are simply saying \nthat we do not agree with the priorities that have been set on that \nside of the aisle.\n  We are not trying to eliminate the 2002 date for balancing the \nbudget. We are not trying to raise the deficit. We are certainly not \ntrying to raise the national debt. What we are talking about is whether \nor not we can move without violating the basic principles that have \nbeen laid down to reach a balanced budget that this Senator ascribes \nto, as evidenced by the fact that I voted in favor of the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. We are for these \nthings.\n  I emphasize once again, Madam President, that what we on this side of \nthe aisle are attempting to do is to say, let us get our heads screwed \non right with regard to priorities. And with regard to the devastating \nMedicare cuts, I would simply say--and I will be addressing this in a \nfew moments--as to how unfair these would be--not only unfair but \ndevastating to the rural health care delivery system in my State of \nNebraska. What I say about Nebraska and the facts that I will use to \nback that up can be said for many other States in the Union that have a \nsubstantial portion of rural population.\n  Madam President, the Medicare cuts in the Republican budget are \ngrossly unfair to the average senior citizen. But rural America will, \nonce again, bear the brunt of the storm of deficit reduction. What we \nare saying is we want to alleviate some of that by dipping into the \nmoney set aside for a tax cut in the Republican budget. And I remind \nall, once again, that not only is a $170 billion set aside, the $170 \nbillion is specifically set aside for one thing and one thing only--a \ntax cut. Now, we are for cutting taxes, too, if we can provide that tax \ncut in a form that does not primarily benefit the wealthiest people in \nthe United States of America, as clearly the plan offered and passed \nyesterday in the House of Representatives does. We are against that. We \nhappen to believe that, in the case of the amendment presently before \nthe Senate, to dip to the tune of $100 billion into the $170 billion \nkitty that is in the Republican Senate budget, to alleviate by that \namount of money, $100 billion, the unfair and tremendous hit in the \narea of $250 billion that is scheduled over the next several years by \nthe Republican budget.\n  It does not mean that it is not going to be cut. It simply says it \nwould be fair and probably acceptable to most of us on this side of the \naisle if we just did not hit those senior citizens on Medicare right \nbetween the eyes, as clearly the Republican budget does, \nnotwithstanding the protests of those on that side of the aisle. They \nare wrong. I think they are wrong on the numbers, I think they are very \nsincere. But I hope that possibly we can pick up enough Republican \nvotes on this very reasonable amendment to allow it to pass.\n  Madam President, cuts in Medicare and Medicaid could lay siege to \nsmall rural hospitals, which often serve a much greater share of the \nelderly and low-income patients. Nearly 10 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries--10 million, which is one-fourth of all beneficiaries--\nlive in rural America, where there is often one hospital per county. \nMany times, that one hospital serves many counties, more than just one. \nNebraska is a perfect example of rural America's health care crisis \nthat is going to be driven into a more serious crisis if eventually we \naccept anything close to the cuts suggested in the Republican budget \nfor Medicare.\n  Let me lay out a few of the statistics. Nearly one-third of Nebraska, \nor 1.6 million citizens, live in rural areas. More than 38 of our \nninety-three counties have elderly populations in excess of 20 percent. \nNineteen of Nebraska's 93 counties have no hospitals. Here is the \nkicker: Medicare patients account for 68 to 70 percent of hospital \nadministration admissions. Cuts in Medicare will cause many of our \nremaining rural hospitals simply to close. The downturn spiral has \nalready begun. Ten percent of all rural hospitals closed during the \n1980's. Medicare cuts will only accelerate that decline. Unlike urban \nand suburban hospitals, shifting costs to the private sector is not an \noption. It is not an option when the majority of rural patients are on \nMedicare and many others are uninsured.\n  Madam President, I ask at this time, because it is particularly \npertinent to the remarks that I am making, that at the conclusion of my \nremarks a letter that I introduced in the Record last night from the \nhead of the hospital association substantiating my figures be printed \nagain in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  [[Page S7006]]\n  \n  Mr. EXON. Big cuts in Medicare will cause many of these remaining \nhospitals no other option but to close. In 1993, Nebraska hospitals \nlost $383 per case caring for Medicare patients. Let me repeat that. In \n1993, Nebraska hospitals lost $383 per case caring for Medicare \npatients. Based on the Republican budget, they would lose an average of \n$1,370 per case in the year 2000. That is a pretty devastating figure. \nAnd that would be only if the hospitals are still open. How can our \nhospitals respond to cuts of this magnitude? Several hospitals in my \nState are teetering on the brink of insolvency, and these cuts may put \nthem over the edge. They are forced to slash wages, lay off employees, \ncut back on services, or simply close their doors. Once they close, \nMadam President, physicians leave our small rural communities and they \nnever, ever will come back. The hospitals are gone forever, and so are \nthe doctors.\n  Hospitals should not close simply because they serve a large \npopulation of Medicare patients. And that is what the Republican budget \ndoes. The No. 1 health priority for rural areas is increasing the \nsupply of primary care physicians for our 22 million rural Americans. \nThe Republican budget takes us in the direct opposite direction. More \nthan 75 percent of Nebraska's counties have been designated medically \nunderserved. Up to 25 percent of the rural doctors will retire or \nrelocate within the next 5 years. More than 2,000 practitioners are \nneeded to even begin to meet the rural needs of America.\n  Madam President, in recent years, a variety of Federal grants have \nbeen awarded to States with large rural-urban populations to help them \ndevelop new and innovative ways of delivering health care to our rural \nareas and we have appreciated that. Rural States like Nebraska have \nformed consortiums among their schools, churches and clinics, in order \nto pool resources and reach out to vulnerable residents. They have \nformed regional emergency care networks and organized training programs \nfor their emergency volunteers. They have used physician assistants and \nnurse practitioners, and they have been a Godsend. Telemedicine grants \nthat help connect rural and urban hospitals through the information \nhighway show real promise\n in improving quality and access to care for our rural elderly who \ncannot travel the long distance to urban hospitals.\n\n  Rural America got the short end of the stick in the Republican \nbudget. These and other programs critical to the health care of our \nrural communities were left to wither on the stalks.\n  I have heard time and time again today the phrase that has been used \nover and over again that the Republicans have worked so very, very hard \nto fashion a budget that is going to save America, that is going to \nbalance the budget by the year 2002, that will make these hard choices; \nthat those on the Democratic side of the aisle want to change all that, \nnot give a tax cut, and they want to increase spending.\n  Obviously, from all of the extensive polling that they have done with \nGOPAC and all of those other good organizations, they have found good \nbuzzwords. They know that ``spending'' is a good buzzword that catches \na lot of attention. So when we say the Democrats are trying to spend \nmore, it rings a bell that they hope will fool the people of America \ninto believing that we are--we as Democrats--offering this amendment \nthat I emphasize, once again, does not change the balanced budget by \n2002, and does not increase the deficit. It keeps it the same as \noutlined in the Republican budgets. It does not raise the national \ndebt.\n  The only way that we can interpret this as spending would be to say, \nsince we want to keep hospitals open in rural Nebraska and elsewhere, \nby not eliminating the cut, but softening the cut that has been \nsuggested in the Republican budget, somehow we are big spenders.\n  Well, if that is the definition of being a big, wild-eyed spender, \nthis conservative deficit hawk, as Governor of Nebraska for 8 years and \nhaving the privilege of representing them, this is my 17th year, with a \nrecord of trying to reduce spending, with that background, I say if I \nam going to be labeled as a big spender because I am trying to help out \nthe most fragile parts and sections and individuals in our country, \nthose senior citizens living in rural America, alleviating just a \nlittle bit the tremendous hit that they are going to be taking as a \nresult of the budget submitted by the Republican majority, then I stand \nconvicted. I stand convicted, Madam President, of being a big, wild-\neyed spender. I simply say that the record speaks for itself.\n  Madam President, I would like for the purpose of clarification to \nknow where we think we should be going on this side. For the \ninformation of my friend and colleague, the Senator from New Mexico, as \nwe bring this week's debate on the budget resolution to a close, I just \nwant to lay out the content of the amendments on this side of the aisle \nthat we will be pursuing after we vote Monday afternoon on the measure \nbefore the Senate.\n  At that time, I assume that we, therefore, will go to the other side \nof the aisle for the next amendment. As I stated earlier yesterday and \nthen again today, we on this side plan a series of deficit-neutral \namendments that seek changes in priorities in the Republican budget. \nEach and every one of the amendments that we will be offering fall \nexactly within the guidelines that I have just enunciated with regard \nto the amendment before the Senate.\n  All of these amendments, and any that I know of, maintain the Senate \npath as outlined in a Republican budget to a balanced budget, that is \nbasically the underlying principle of the budget resolution.\n  The first amendment that we offered that is pending now is referred \nto as the Rockefeller-Lautenberg amendment on Medicare. That amendment \nseeks to trim back--not eliminate, but trim back--the tax cut in the \nRepublican resolution and devote more of those savings to alleviating \nthe hits in the Medicare Program that we think are unreasonable.\n  The amendment following that, when we on this side have an \nopportunity to offer our next amendment, will be an amendment to offer \nto trim back the tax cuts just some, a little bit further, and debate \nthose savings, to reduce the cut and the hit on education.\n  Now, Madam President, we will be making the very similar case and \nfollowing generally the same roads of reasoning as to why we think the \nRepublican budget that came unanimously out of the Republican-\ncontrolled Budget Committee does the same thing to education as their \nfigures on Medicare do to Medicare recipients and hospitals that \nprimarily serve Medicare patients.\n  There will be a very similar amendment. I suspect that the debate \nwill be very similar, perhaps, to what we are having today. That is the \namendment that will follow.\n  Following that, the next amendment that we contemplate would trim \nback those Republican tax cuts just a little further, and devote those \nsavings once again to eliminating the tax increase in the Republican \nbudget on working families making less than $28,000 a year. Generally, \nthat is referred to as the earned income tax credit. It has come up on \nseveral occasions during the debate in the last several hours.\n  Taken together, those amendments that I have just offered constitute \na different vision for America. A different vision--again, not \nviolating the basic principles of the budget brought by the Republican \nmajority.\n  This Senator has commented previously--not only commented, but \ncomplimented especially Senator Domenici, who I know has worked very \nhard and very long on this proposition. I simply say to my good friend, \n``You have done an overall very good job.'' Just please reason with \nthis side and allow changes within the budget that has been submitted.\n  If we can come to that, we are going to have a much stronger \nbipartisan budget as it leaves the U.S. Senate than we would have had \notherwise.\n  Our vision puts a higher priority on seniors--not eliminating any \ncuts but reducing the cuts. It does the same for working families. It \ndoes the same for education.\n  Together, these amendments define the difference, I suggest, the \ndifference in the two parties with regard to priorities. As Harry \nTruman once said, ``With us as Democrats, the people come first.'' I \nwish we could do more, but we cannot. I believe the people of America \nare willing to join to make some very hard choices and to take some \nvery painful cuts. [[Page S7007]] \n  Once again, I emphasize in closing, Madam President, that all we are \ntrying to do is to do some surgery on the Republican budget.\n Not violating, obviously, the basic principle; not violating balancing \nthe budget by the year 2002; not violating the overall goals with \nregard to spending, the totals; not increasing the national debt. What \nwe are trying to do in all good faith is to be joint partners, as the \nminority party, in making some changes that will allow many of us, with \na lot of thought and consideration, to simply say to Senator Domenici \nand our friends on that side of the aisle: We will join with you in \nmaking these very painful choices, because we realize, we recognize, \nand we think it is a must to make some dramatic changes in what has \ntaken place with wild-eyed spending and very high deficits over the \nlast few years, starting back basically with the election of President \nRonald Reagan as President of the United States.\n\n  So I simply say that we recognize the fault for this is not all on \nthe Republicans, and it is certainly not all on the Democrats. We are \nin this boat together. I hope we can work in consort, in a bipartisan \nfashion, to begin to work our way out of it.\n  We do not believe any of the amendments we have offered thus far, or \nthe amendments we will be offering before we go to the final debate and \nvote on the resolution itself, are anything other than reasonable \npriorities that we would like to reset and make some changes in, as \nadvanced by the Republicans when they brought this budget to the floor \nof the U.S. Senate.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                           Nebraska Association of\n\n\n                                 Hospitals and Health Systems,\n\n                                                     May 10, 1995.\n     Hon. J. James Exon,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Exon: On behalf of the 94 acute care hospitals \n     in Nebraska, I wish to call your attention to a serious \n     potential problem.\n       Clearly, the United States must work its way out of debt. \n     To do that, Federal spending must be cut. It is my \n     understanding that the Senate Budget Committee Chairman's \n     mark is set an an overall reduction of $1.5 trillion by the \n     year 2002. I further understand that in order to achieve a \n     savings of that magnitude, Medicare is targeted for $256 \n     billion reduction in spending over the same seven-year \n     period.\n       Here's the problem. For fiscal year 1993 (FY '93) (the most \n     current completed year), Nebraska hospitals had a net \n     operating margin of -7.5 percent for care rendered to \n     Medicare recipients. Based upon the Chairman's mark for \n     Medicare spending, in the year 2000 Nebraska hospitals would \n     have a net operating margin of -23 percent for Medicare \n     patients. This figure is expected to improve by the year 2002 \n     to a net operating margin loss of only 14.5 percent, because \n     the reductions are ``front loaded.''\n       Putting this into financial terms, in FY '93 Nebraska \n     hospitals lost $383 per case caring for Medicare patients. \n     Based upon the Chairman's mark, in the year 2000 they would \n     lose on average $1,339 per case and in 2002 they would lose \n     $983 per case caring for Medicare patients. This is all \n     compounded by the fact that Nebraska is a state with a higher \n     proportion of elderly citizens in its population.\n       How can hospitals respond to the cuts of this magnitude? \n     Hospitals are caught in a catch-22. They can: (1) shift more \n     costs to the private sector--this is no longer a viable \n     option in today's managed care environment; (2) slash wages \n     and lay-off employees; (3) cut back on the scope of services \n     provided--all of which threatens the quality of care, will \n     close rural hospitals and restrict access. It is a lose-lose \n     situation for community hospitals. Reimbursement reductions \n     of this magnitude in a state with a disproportionate share of \n     the elderly population, a state in which Medicare patients \n     account for 60 to 70 percent of hospital admissions, clearly \n     threatens the health care system upon which all of us depend.\n       Medicare needs to be fixed. There is an opportunity for \n     Congress to change Medicare, but the change must be driven by \n     sound health care policy, not budgetary or political \n     imperatives. The Senate Budget Committee's proposed Medicare \n     reductions would crush Nebraska hospitals.\n       As always, Nebraska's hospitals look to your leadership.\n            Sincerely,\n                                                  Harlan M. Heald,\n                                                        President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, is the Chair personally on some \nserious time impediment at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, the Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will not take very much time. I have five or six \nunanimous-consent requests. I assume my colleague has cleared those?\n  Mr. EXON. I believe these requests have all been cleared.\n  I would like to ask, as long as we are in this, we are scheduled to \ncome in at 8:30, is it, Monday?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Right.\n  Mr. EXON. If I understand it right, when we close the business today \nthere has been a joint agreement that we would either have used or have \nagreed to use 10 hours, is that right, today?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. Ten yesterday and ten today--twenty.\n  Mr. EXON. So when we start debate Monday morning we will have 30 \nhours left on the budget resolution, is that correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Correct.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, let me just put in perspective where \nwe are. It is amazing. I am not saying this is Senator Exon, but let me \njust see if I can put in perspective that side of the aisle, and what \nwe have heard all day long and what we are going to hear for the next \ncouple of days, on this side of the aisle.\n  Frankly, any time you try to reduce spending in any major area which \nis bankrupting the Government, you hear that you surely should not do \nthat one because that is terribly important to everybody.\n  I am going to make an assumption for this Record, just to put in \nperspective where we are. First, we know Social Security is off this \nbudget. It is going to continue and get its cost of living.\n  Let me assume that since Medicare, which is growing at 10 percent--\nthere are many who say it should keep on growing at 10 percent, and I \nam sure in spite of the amendment that says we will take a little less \nthan that, which is the Democrat amendment, there is an overwhelming \nnumber of Democrats who would say leave it like it is. It is very \nimportant. You cannot touch it. It has to grow at 10 percent.\n  Let it grow at 10 percent.\n  And then there are those who say, welfare? You can reform welfare but \nyou are not going to save any money. OK, so we take that off. If we are \nnot going to save any money, there is no use talking about it in the \nbudget, right?\n  Then there is education. Even though we say wait until we debate it, \nPell grants have been on this floor with three different speakers \nsaying we abolish them. Madam President our assumption is that Pell \ngrants go up $6.6 billion during the 7 years. How much is enough when \nyou are bankrupt? How much is enough when you are $300 billion in debt \nhere, in just a few years? That is the issue. What can you afford? Not \nwhat you like. Not what would be wonderful. Not what would be \nsensational for our people. Not what you can go home and brag to people \nwe protected you.\n  Who protects the millions and millions of Americans and the young \npeople from this debt that keeps going up? So we take out welfare. We \ncannot save any money. That is kind of the theory from the other side.\n  Earned income tax credit? We are destroying, we are cutting --raising \npeople's taxes. Earned income tax credit, the fastest-growing program \nin the Tax Code, it is going to go up 40 percent in this budget. How \nmuch can we afford? Is 40 not enough? How much should it go up, 70? Why \nis that the case, when the country is borrowing the money to pay it \nback to people? Where do we stop? What is affordable?\n  And then, no offense but there are some who say we should not cut \nagriculture. Look, it is not a giant program and I am not saying \nSenator Exon said no cuts. But I am guaranteeing there is a very large \ncontingency on that side that would say you cannot touch agriculture.\n  I am just going to do, for the Senate, in rough numbers, and for the \npeople listening, I am going to take all those things off budget. OK? \nAnd I am going to try to get a balanced budget. So I am going to take \noff Medicare. I am going to take off Medicaid. We have heard an \nargument about Medicaid. Medicaid, 4 years ago, Madam President, \nbecause we changed the law and States found out rather quickly how to \nharvest the program--some say cheat, but some say harvest the program-- \nso they found out how to harvest the program. Guess how much it went \nup? [[Page S7008]] Twenty-seven percent. The following year we were \nstill at it out there in the States, 26-percent increase. And then it \ncame down to 8, and then it went back to 10 and there it is.\n  Frankly, we have to leave that there because many on that side see as \nruinous for America if you do not leave that program just like it is. \nBut nobody says who is paying for it, right? We just sit around here \nand say we really need that. So that is another one.\n  I have added them up as best I can and here is where we would be. You \nhave to pay the interest on the debt, I assume. OK? So we put that in.\n  I think we have, then, what is left on the table. I was almost going \nto say nothing, but I have to be honest. What is left on the table is \n$390 billion out of a $1.6 trillion deficit. So that is how this goes. \nWe take one off but we only take it off because we argue it is so \ngreat. We do not understand how do you stop borrowing the money from \nour kids, taxing them without representation. We do not figure out how \nwe do that. We just say we must keep this.\n  My staff has gone through and said, Senator, if there is $390 billion \nleft, to get to balance what might we have to do? If people are worried \nabout doing some draconian things, here is our best guess. Eliminate \nthe Department of Defense, for starters. Eliminate the Department of \nState, Department of Justice, Department of Transportation. NASA is \ncomplaining. We did not cut NASA as much as the House in our \nrecommendation, but they disappear under this scenario. Oh, actually, \nwe do not think there is even a Department of Veterans left under this.\n  So the point is, no matter what you try to eliminate, no matter what \nyou try to change, no matter what you try to reform, there are those \nwho want to keep it all and at the same time say we are for a balanced \nbudget.\n  You just cannot do it. And I have given an example today, rough as it \nis, do not hold me to it to the exact millions, but just hold me to it \nas a pretty good workmanlike approach to where we are. That is where we \nwould be.\n  Now, I forgot to mention something. After we did all that, senior \ncitizens, Medicare is on the road to bankruptcy, right? Because we just \nleft it like it is. And leaving it like it is we are doing all these \nnice things that nobody wants to change, but it is going bankrupt.\n  So that is even an additional one to add to what we have done. Shame \non us. Shame on us. As we say we are helping senior citizens, we want \nto leave it like it is. Many here want to leave it like it is because \nto try to find some way to reform it, manage it better, give seniors \nchoice, somehow or another we are going to harm them, we are going to \nhurt them. To tell you the truth, what is really going to harm and hurt \nAmericans is if we do not figure out some way to stop borrowing money. \nThat is what is going to hurt America.\n  Now, my last observation about all of this is also something that I \nwould like to quickly make. How many Americans are going to be harmed \nby our incessant borrowing of money? I believe the number is in the \nmillions, for I believe they have already been hurt. I believe the huge \ndebt we have today has already harmed the standard of living, the real \npaycheck of millions and millions and millions of Americans.\n  So one might say, who is really worried about the people? Is it those \nwho talk about Federal programs that are worried about the people? Or \nis it those who talk about Federal programs that we could not pay for \nso we borrowed money so all the people get hurt? Who is for the people? \nI believe I know where I am, and I am very comfortable with it. I \nbelieve this budget is for the people of this country.\n  Now, my last observation about all this is just let us take an \nanalysis of where our Democratic brothers are going to be Monday with \ntheir vote and in three successive votes after that. Let us just take a \nlook for a minute. The Republicans produce a balanced budget. Here it \nis. Here it is, the Republican balanced budget. No help from the \nPresident. We produce it. No help from the Democrats. We produce it. We \nsay to the American people we want to be leaders for making some hard \nchoice. They do not. We do.\n  Now, what happens when we get it finished? The Congressional Budget \nOffice says there is a high probability that when you get that done, \nyou get an economic dividend. Some people are choosing to call it on \nthis side the Domenici dividend, double D. I do not know what it is, \nwhose it is, but it is reality. There is a benefit from balancing the \nbudget. It is $170 billion more or less depending upon how it all turns \nout.\n  In a sense, it is looked at this way. After you balance the budget, \ninterest rates come down, and they are down over the whole 7 years and \nyou have a little dividend. Now, the entire package of Democratic \namendments which you heard about today and you are going to hear about \nnext week turns right around and says now that you have the dividend, \nspend it. That is the issue. Now that you have the dividend that may be \nthere, turn right around, after all this effort, and take this \ncontingency and start spending it again. And would that not be nice for \nthe seniors if we really made Medicare solvent in the process?\n  But we have not. But we have not. But we are going to spend it again \nwith no new plan for Medicare. Just put the issue off. Just put off the \nissue of rural hospitals, put off the issue of older hospital beds all \nacross this Nation that we are not going to have one way or another in \na few years because we have many hospitals at 50 percent occupancy, and \nwe are kidding ourselves that they are going to be here for 5, 10, or \n20 years.\n  So essentially, just so we put it all in perspective, these are the \namendments of the Democratic Party. Spend the dividend that you earned \nfor Americans, spend it, put it back in this ever-growing Federal \nbudget that got us in this jam.\n  Republicans say something very different. We say if that occurs, if \nthat benefit is forthcoming, that dividend, if it is forthcoming, we \nwould like to give it back to the American people by way of a tax cut. \nIt will be there only if we get a balance.\n  Frankly, I am convinced that at that point the American people earned \nit. They paid for all this budget. Middle-income Americans paid for \nmost of it. And we in our budget say give back middle-income Americans \na modest tax cut, perhaps the $500 per child tax credit. That may fit. \nNow, frankly, I believe that is a good game plan.\n  I want to just close. Again, there is nothing mean about this budget. \nThere is plenty, plenty mean about saying we do not care about our \nchildren. We want to tax them without representation. It does not \nmatter about the deficit because it is mean not to give the American \npeople programs that we cannot afford. That is mean. To say to \nAmericans we cannot afford the program, and therefore we must ask you \nto sacrifice, that is mean? I do not think so.\n  I think what is mean is not to ask that of our seniors, to not to ask \nthat of Americans and to then say somebody else pays for it all. We are \nnot quite sure who, but somebody else pays for it.\n  Frankly, the chairman of the Budget Committee in the House yesterday \nhad it right. His one and only closing prop was a nice big picture with \nabout 50 little children on it. That is what we ought to hold up here \nwhen we start voting on this and say, who is worried about them? Who is \nworried about them and their standard of living? And when they start \nworking, that $100,000 of their income that has to come back to America \nto pay interest on the debt during their lifetimes, who is worried \nabout that?\n  We welcome the debate. It will be a good debate next week. We will \nhave some good amendments, too. And we will have some disagreements on \nour side of the aisle. Republicans are not all out of one mold. We will \nhave some disagreements. But in the end, this is the year to make it \nright and we will do that.\n  Now, Madam President, I have a few unanimous-consent requests. First, \nI ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes consideration of \nthe concurrent resolution on Monday, May 22, there be 30 hours of \ndebate remaining under the statutory time limit.\n  Mr. EXON. No objection. We agree to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. But I will not object with this caveat, that the Senator \nfrom Nebraska, when we have finished the wrap-up procedures, would like \nto reserve 2 or 3 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator close the Senate down for us?\n  Mr. EXON. I will be happy to, Madam President.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate Concurrent \nResolution 13, the fiscal year 1996 congressional budget resolution, as \nreported by the Senate Budget Committee.\n  What does this budget resolution do? More importantly than anything \nelse, it provides for a balanced budget in 7 years.\n  This is the first-ever 7-year budget resolution, with the first-ever \n7-year reconciliation instructions. It will produce, when it occurs in \nfiscal year 2002, the first balanced budget in 33 years. The last two \nbalanced budgets were in 1969 and 1960.\n  In fiscal year 2002, under this budget, the accumulated national debt \nwill be almost $1 trillion lower than under current law--or, less than \n$6 trillion, instead of more than $7 trillion.\n  That last fact is sobering--it reminds us that this budget is a good \nstart, not the final victory, against the staggering debt load \ncrippling our economy and stealing our children's future.\n  What does this budget resolution do? It reduces the rate of growth in \nFederal spending. Under this budget, spending still grows an average of \n3-percent a year, down from the current 5.4 percent a year.\n  Only special interest groups and liberals inside the Capital Beltway \ncan say a 3-percent raise is really a draconian cut.\n  Under this budget, total Federal spending in fiscal year 2002 will be \n$382 billion more than this year--fiscal year 1995.\n  Only in Washington, DC, does anyone claim that a $382 billion \nincrease is really a $229 billion cut.\n  What does this budget resolution do? It delivers on the promise of \nthe balanced budget amendment and those of us who supported it.\n  Back in January and February, some opponents--and a few supporters--\nof the balanced budget amendment said they wanted to see a plan for \nexactly how to balance the budget.\n  Well, here's our plan: Some of my colleagues may have a different \nplan, and I invite them to bring it forward. This may not be everyone's \nfavorite plan, but it gets the job done in a fair, equitable way.\n  Now that those who demanded, ``Where's your plan?'' have been given a \nplan. I expect that 67th Senator should come forward and finally help \nus pass the balanced budget amendment.\n  What does balancing the budget mean in people terms? It means \nrestoring the American dream of economic opportunity, starting now and \nextending to the next generation.\n  We're going to hear moans and complaints about budget cuts, but the \ncruelest cut of all is the cut in every American's living standard that \nhas occurred because of Government's failure or refusal to balance the \nbudget.\n  The damage done by the borrow-and-spend status quo must be undone. \nThe Concord Coalition estimated that, without the Federal deficits and \ndebt run up to date, the average family's income would be $50,000, \ninstead of the current $35,000.\n  A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed that America \nlost 5-percent growth in GNP and 3.75 million jobs from 1978-89 because \nof deficits and debt.\n  Balancing the budget by fiscal year 2002 means a better future. The \neconometrics firm DRI/McGraw-Hill said it means: 4 to 5 percent more \nnonresidential investment; 2.5 million new jobs; a GDP that is 2.5 \npercent higher, and another $1,000 in the pocket of the average \nhousehold.\n  GAO's 1992 report estimated that balancing the budget would raise our \nchildren's standard of living between 7 and 36 percent by the year \n2020.\n  What does this budget resolution do? It fully protects Social \nSecurity. This budget makes absolutely no changes in the old age, \nsurvivors, and disability insurance [OASDI] trust funds, consistent \nwith a number of current law protections, and consistent with the Dole \nmotion passed during debate on the balanced budget amendment and the \nKempthorne amendment adopted as part of S.1--the Unfunded Mandates Act.\n  This budget in no way loots Social Security. It protects it by \nreducing the pressure of future debts, and it strengthens our ability \nto keep promises to seniors.\n  It takes us two-thirds of the way to balancing the non-Social \nSecurity budget by fiscal year 2002. The Committee budget produces \ndeficit reduction of $229 billion below current law in fiscal year \n2002; the OASDI trustees project a $112 billion Social Security surplus \nfor fiscal year 2002. Getting two-thirds of the way there is a lot \nbetter than the status quo.\n  If we just stay on the glide path established by this budget, we can \ngo on to balance the non-Social Security budget by about fiscal year \n2005. That's exactly the timing and the glide path suggested by Senator \nNunn and others back during debate on the balanced budget amendment.\n  What does this budget resolution do? It reforms and rescues Medicare. \nUnder this budget, Medicare increases an average of 7.1 percent a \nyear--more than twice the rate of inflation. It defies common sense to \ncall that a draconian cut.\n  Under this budget, Medicare spending will be $105 billion more in \nfiscal year 2002 than in 1995. Where are the slash and burn cuts?\n  Nothing here cuts services or drives up needy patients' costs. It \ncalls for Medicare reform--that more choice and market competition and \nconsumer information will slow down the runaway costs we see now. \nThat's an appropriate goal to put in a budget resolution.\n  A vote for this budget is a vote to rescue Medicare. Under the status \nquo, that system goes broke in fiscal year 2002. Who says so? The \nMedicare Board of Trustees that includes three of President Clinton's \nCabinet Secretaries, the Commissioner of Social Security, and two \npublic trustees.\n  The trustees also said, in their April 3, 1995, report:\n\n       The trust fund does not meet the trustees' short-range test \n     of financial adequacy * * * It fails to meet the trustees' \n     test of long-range close actuarial balance * * * by an \n     extremely wide margin * * * Congress must take timely action \n     to establish long-term financial stability for the program.\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise in strong opposition to the Lautenberg-\nRockefeller amendment that would raid Medicare. The amendment would \ntake $100 billion of the $170 billion economic dividend created by \nlower interest rates resulting from deficit reduction and add that back \nto Medicare spending.\n  Make no mistake, this amendment is the proposal that would raid \nMedicare. All it does is spend down the Medicare trust fund faster than \nthe committee's budget.\n  This amendment is another example of status quo tunnel vision. The \ncommittee's budget assumes that we fix Medicare, reform it. That means \nseniors who need Medicare won't be hurt, they'll participate in an \nimproved system.\n  This amendment assumes there is no alternative to the current \npolicies that are rapidly driving Medicare bankrupt. The House's \nmajority whip, Representative DeLay, said it well the other day: It's \nlike one side is talking about a cure for cancer and the other side \ncan't think about anything but chemotherapy.\n  We want Medicare to continue to be there and to start working better \nfor seniors today and tomorrow. If we do what's best for Medicare and \nfor our seniors, the numbers will come out the way the committee's \nbudget says.\n  We still need the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. The \nbudget resolution currently before us provides for a balanced budget in \n7 [[Page S7010]] years. That gives some Members of Congress and the \nspecial interest groups 6 years and three elections to try and knock us \noff track.\n  Can we balance the budget without the balanced budget amendment? The \nfirst Republican Congress in 40 years is proving we can, but ``can'' is \nno guarantee. If future Congresses continue on the path set out in this \nresolution, the result still will be only one balanced budget in 33 \nyears.\n  Hitting a target once in 33 years that we ought to hit in all but the \nmost extreme circumstances, is not an endorsement of life without the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/19/senate-section/article/S7009-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   IN MEMORY AND IN HONOR OF FALLEN ARIZONA LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this year's National Law Enforcement memorial \nservice had great meaning and was filled with sadness for the citizens \nof Arizona. Over the past year, four Arizona law enforcement officers \nwere killed in the line of duty. The seventh annual memorial service \nand candlelight vigil held here in Washington, DC, this week provided \nan opportunity to remember these dedicated officers and the \ncontributions they made to the people of Arizona.\n  I had the privilege of visiting with two of the families of these men \nthis week. The loss they have experienced is still very painful for \nthem. But, they know that the death of their loved ones was not in \nvain. They died to ensure that others could live--safely. These men \nprovide an example of the dedicated service that all other law \nenforcement officers in Arizona should strive to achieve.\n  Each of them made a unique contribution to Arizona. They all played a \nsignificant role in working toward a safer and stronger State and \nNation.\n  Mesa Police Officer Steven Paul Pollard died on November 27, 1994, \nwhen he was struck by a car and killed while conducting a DUI traffic \nstop in the emergency lane of U.S. 60 in Mesa. As Steve stood by the \ndriver's door of his vehicle, a motorist traveling eastbound apparently \nfell asleep and drove his vehicle off the roadway striking Steve and \nthe police vehicle. He died instantly.\n  Steve was born July 5, 1968, in Phoenix to Steven and Ida Garcia. He \nwent to Starlight Elementary, Estrella Junior High, and Trevor Brown \nHigh School. He graduated in 1986. Steve had worked for the department \nof corrections before joining the Mesa Police Department. That was the \ncareer he wanted all of his life, and he died doing the job he always \ndreamed of doing. Steve is remembered as man who would go beyond the \ncall of duty to help others. No job was ever too big or too small for \nSteve.\n  Steve is survived by his mother and father, Richard and Ida Pollard; \nis brother and sister, Ruben and Angie; and his wife and daughter, \nKimber and Celine.\n  Wildlife Manager Estevan Escobedo, who had been with the Arizona Game \nand Fish Department for 9 years, was killed in a fiery helicopter crash \nnear Coolidge Dam on January 4, 1994. He and three other officials, who \nsurvived the crash, were on a routine assignment to count javelina in a \nrugged canyon near Winkelman. The area was part of Estevan's district, \nbased in Globe. Estevan was the first law enforcement officer killed in \nthe line of duty in 1994. It was the first aircraft accident involving \na fatality for the department since 1980.\n  Estevan graduated from Westwood High School and Arizona State \nUniversity. Away from his duties as a wildlife manager, Estevan \nparticipated in rodeo events such as calf roping. He was a partner, \nconfidant, and adopted brother to his rodeo buddies.\n  Estevan is survived by his mother and a twin brother. He is \nremembered as a carefree, joyous bother, son, and friend, equipped with \na playful sense of humor and a sense of duty that led him to give \nlovingly of his time and energy. Those who knew him say that Estevan \nhad a smile that will last forever in the memories of those whose lives \nwere touched by him.\n  Sergeant Patrick (Pat) Riley died on March 11, 1994. He was struck by \na truck while directing traffic at a construction site. He died \napproximately 2 hours later.\n  Pat joined the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office as a detention \nofficer in 1983. A year later, he applied for and was accepted as a \ndeputy sheriff. He spent 4 years in various positions as a deputy, \nranging from a beat deputy to detective, culminating his assignment to \nmajor felonies as a homicide detective. During this period, he was \nnominated for the ``Deputy of the Year'' commendation in 1990. He \nreceived the B.P.O.E. ``Americanism Award'' in 1991, which was \npresented by Gov. Rose Mofford. Pat was promoted to sergeant in \nSeptember 1992 and served in assignments at the general investigations \ndivision, detectives, and in patrol. He also received the highly \ncoveted ``Distinguished Service Award'' in 1994.\n  Pat was one of the lead investigators in the Temple homicide case, in \nwhich eight Buddhist monks and two apprentices were murdered.\n  Pat married Laurie Davis in February 1987. After a courtship of love, \nhe leaves behind his wife and no children.\n  Sergeant Patrick Devon Thompson died on September 2, 1994. While on \nduty, Sergeant Thompson lost control of his police vehicle, collided \nwith an oncoming car, and died instantly.\n  Sergeant Thompson served with the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office \nsince 1978. He is remembered by colleagues as honest, loyal, reliable, \ncaring, and trustworthy. He was also very generous with his time, \nespecially with the youth of Santa Cruz County. They respected and \nadmired him. He was near death in 1991, but had a tremendous will to \nlive, and he survived. A second chance can be a wonderful gift, and Pat \nrealized this and approached his life with a new vigor, a new \ndetermination. His last 3 years were dedicated to undertaking new \nchallenges and to helping children, especially through the D.A.R.E. \nProgram. Pat encouraged the D.A.R.E. kids to live a clean and healthy \nlife.\n  Sergeant Thompson is survived by his mother, wife, sons, and \ndaughters.\n  Mr. President, it is an honor for me to remember Sergeants Thompson \nand Riley, Officer Pollard, and Wildlife Manager Escobedo. They served \ntheir organizations with distinction and with honor. We will never \nforget their sacrifice; we will always remember their spirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/19/senate-section/article/S7010-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, on the evening I learned I had been elected \nto the Senate in 1972, one of the commitments I made to myself was that \nI would never fail to see a young person or a group of young people who \nwanted to see me. It was certainly beneficial to me that I did because \nI have been inspired by the estimated 60,000 young people with whom I \nhave visited during the nearly 23 years I have been in the Senate.\n  Most of them have been concerned about the magnitude of the Federal \ndebt that Congress has run up for the coming generations to pay. The \nyoung people and I always discuss the fact that under the Constitution, \nno President can spend even a dime of Federal money that has not first \nbeen authorized and appropriated by both the House and Senate of the \nUnited States.\n  That is why I have been making these daily reports to the Senate \nsince February 22, 1992. I want to make it a matter of record precisely \nthe size of the Federal debt which as of Thursday, May 18, stood at \n$4,885,256,391,108.42 or $18,544.52 on a per capita basis.\n  What Congress has already done to future generations is immoral.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/19/senate-section/article/S7010-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/19/senate-section/article/S7010-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/19/senate-section/article/S7010-4", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S7011]]\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-919.

The government of Taiwan further acknowledges that two \n     equal and distinct political entities exist within the \n     divided China. United Nations General Assembly Resolution \n     2758, which in 1971 restored to the People's Republic of \n     China its seat in the United Nations while expelling the \n     Republic of China on Taiwan, does not provide a complete \n     solution to the issue of China's seat in the United Nations \n     that resulted from this division of China; and\n       ``Whereas, Taiwan's twenty-one million people enjoy a \n     multiparty, democratic form of government, the policies of \n     which conform to those of other democratic nations; and\n       ``Whereas, during the past decade, Taiwan has assumed \n     regional and global responsibilities in international \n     development programs and humanitarian relief operations. \n     Taiwan often has closely coordinated its efforts in \n     responding to international disasters and crises and in \n     undertaking programs of assistance for less-developed nations \n     with those of the United States. Taiwan clearly has shown its \n     willingness to assume a direct role in contributing to the \n     well-being of the global community; and\n       ``Whereas, Taiwan has joined several important multilateral \n     organizations in recent years, including Asia/Pacific \n     Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the Asian Development Bank. \n     The United States has supported the admission of Taiwan into \n     these organizations; and\n       ``Whereas, Taiwan is currently the fourteenth largest \n     trading nation in the world and its gross national product is \n     the world's twentieth largest.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe tax treatment of certain contributions made pursuant to veterans' \nreemployment; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             the veterans' reemployment rights act of 1995\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am today introducing, with \nthe cosponsorship of my good friend from Wyoming, Al Simpson, chairman \nof the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, legislation that involves \na matter related to the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment \nRights Act of 1994 [USERRA], Public Law 103-353. This landmark rewrite \nof a 1940's law, which provides employment protections to returning \nservicemembers, was derived from legislation reported by the House and \nSenate Veterans' Affairs Committees. There was one issue, however, \nrelated to USERRA which falls under the jurisdiction of the Finance \nCommittee, a committee on which Al Simpson and I also serve. It was not \npossible to get this issue resolved last year before final passage of \nthe USERRA legislation, and the bill we are introducing today would \naccomplish that goal.\n  Mr. President, the matter in question relates to provisions in USERRA \nwhich address a returning servicemember's rights to participate in the \nemployer's pension plan and, more specifically, to the relationship \nbetween USERRA and the Internal Revenue Code. Under USERRA, it is \npossible that a pension plan, by seeking to comply with USERRA, could \nhave to make payments on behalf of now returned servicemembers that \ncould cause the plan to go out of compliance with the Internal Revenue \nCode [IRC] because of the total amount of payments made by the plan in \na given year. Obviously, this is a result that is not intended and \nwhich should be avoided. The appropriate remedy--an amendment to the \nInternal Revenue Code--is in the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee, \nand thus the matter must be resolved in legislation developed by that \ncommittee.\n  Mr. President, so as to allow time for an amendment to the IRC to be \nconsidered, USERRA provides a 2-year period before compliance with the \npension provisions in the new law would be required. As I noted during \nSenate debate last September on the final compromise of the USERRA \nlegislation, it was my intention, which I communicated at the time to \nSenator Moynihan in his then-role as chairman of the Finance Committee, \nto take the lead in the Finance Committee in proposing the appropriate \namendment to the Internal Revenue Code as part of the first appropriate \ntax bill.

A bill to require the Prospective Payment Assessment \nCommission to develop separate applicable percentage increases to \nensure that Medicare beneficiaries who receive services from Medicare-\ndependent hospitals receive the same quality of care and access to \nservices as Medicare beneficiaries in other hospitals, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           the medicare dependent hospital relief act of 1995\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I introduce timely legislation that \naddresses the problems of a special class of institutions--\nMedicare-dependent hospitals--that have Medicare patient loads of 60 \npercent or more. These hospitals, both rural and urban, have \nsignificantly higher Medicare losses and lower overall margins than \nother hospitals. This problem, particularly in light of Medicare \npayment reductions in this year's forthcoming budget reconciliation \npackage, threatens the viability of these hospitals and the access to \nand quality of services to Medicare beneficiaries.\n  The legislation I am introducing in conjunction with my good friend, \nFlorida Congressman Clay Shaw, is called the Medicare Dependent \nHospital Relief Act of 1995. The bill would simply require that the \nProspective Payment Advisory Commission [ProPAC], in addition to its \nrecommendations on payment rate updates for all hospitals, makes a \nseparate recommendation on updates for Medicare-dependent hospitals. \nThis recommendation would be required to be budget neutral.\n  In addition, the bill would require ProPAC's annual report to \nCongress to include recommendations ensuring that beneficiaries served \nby Medicare-dependent hospitals retain the same access and quality of \ncare as Medicare beneficiaries nationwide.\n  The need for this legislation is rather simple. In 1992, ProPac \nestimates that Medicare payments were $11 billion below the level \nneeded to fully cover the cost of treating Medicare beneficiaries. For \nthe Nation's 1,400 Medicare-dependent hospitals, their high Medicare \npatient loads limits their ability to cost shift to other payors. In \nthose hospitals with 80 percent Medicare patients, this is particularly \ndifficult--if not impossible.\n  As the March 1995 ProPAC report notes:\n\n       The ability to use cost shifting to fill the revenue gap \n     where Medicare cost increases exceed payment increases varies \n     across hospitals. Facilities that treat larger shares of \n     Medicare, Medicaid and uninsured patients have a lesser \n     ability to cost shift to the private sector. In view of \n     growing price competition in the marketplace, these \n     facilities will face a greater risk of declining margins, \n     which eventually could threaten their financial viability and \n     their ability to care for Medicare beneficiaries.\n\n  According to 1992 cost reports, profit margins for hospitals ranged \nfrom positive margins as great as 12 percent to losses of 17 percent. \nMedicare-dependent hospitals, on average, have margins 3 percent below \nthe average Medicare margin. In effect, these hospitals would seem to \npay a penalty for their service to the elderly.\n  In fact, due to low margins, limited ability to cost shift and \npayments from all payors ratcheting down, Medicare-dependent hospitals \nwill have to either close or reduce services. In either case, the \nultimate losers will be the Medicare beneficiaries these hospitals \nserve.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and ask unanimous \nconsent to have the bill printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 832\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to more \naccurately codify the depreciable life of semiconductor manufacturing \nequipment; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 the semiconductor investment act of 1995\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Semiconductor \nInvestment Act of 1995. I am joined by Senators Baucus, Dole, Campbell, \nFeinstein, Cohen, Cochran, Kyl, Bennett, Craig, D'Amato, Burns, \nRockefeller, and Boxer. This bill is designed to help the American \nsemiconductor industry compete globally by shortening the depreciable \nlife of semiconductor manufacturing equipment from 5 years to 3. \nCongresswoman Nancy Johnson of Connecticut has introduced identical \nlegislation in the House of Representatives.\n\n[[Page S7016]]\n\n  The U.S. semiconductor industry employs more than 200,000 Americans, \nsells over $40 billion of products annually, and currently controls 40 \npercent of the world market. Its products form the foundation of \npractically every electronic device used today. The American \nsemiconductor industry is a success story because it has invested \nheavily in the most productive, cutting-edge technology available, and \ncurrently spends a full 25 percent of its revenues on capital \ninvestment. Unfortunately, Mr. President, our semiconductor industry is \nthreatened.\n  While the equipment used to manufacture semiconductors has a useful \nlife of only about 3 years, current tax depreciation rules require that \ncost of the equipment be written off over a full 5 years. The \nSemiconductor Investment Act would correct this flaw, Mr. President, by \nallowing equipment used in the manufacture of semiconductors to be \ndepreciated over a more appropriate 3-year period. Given the massive \nlevel of investment in the semiconductor industry, accurate \ndepreciation is critical to industry success.\n  The key reason for this 3-year depreciation period is that the \nequipment used to make semiconductors grows technologically obsolete \nmore quickly than does other manufacturing equipment. Mr. President, \nrecent research indicates that semiconductor manufacturing equipment \nalmost completely loses its ability to produce sellable products after \nonly 3 years. Today's 5-year period simply doesn't reflect reality. A \nquicker write-off period would help semiconductor manufacturers finance \nthe large investment in equipment they need for the next generation of \nproducts.\n  The National Advisory Committee on Semiconductors reinforced this \nconclusion. Congress founded the committee in 1988, and it consisted of \nPresidential appointees from both the public and private sectors. In \n1992, the committee recommended a 3-year depreciation period and stated \nthat the shift from a 5-year to a 3-year schedule would increase the \nindustry's annual capital investment rate by a full 11 percent.\n  By comparison, Japan, Taiwan, and Korea employ much more generous \ndepreciation schedules for similar equipment, and all three nations \nprovide stiff competition for America's semiconductor manufacturers. \nFor example, under Japanese law, a company can depreciate up to 88 \npercent of its semiconductor equipment cost in the first year, while \nUnited States law permits a mere 20-percent depreciation over the same \nperiod. When multinational semiconductor firms are deciding where to \ninvest, a depreciation gap this large can be decisive.\n  This legislation will help ensure that America's semiconductor \nindustry retains its hard-earned preeminence, a preeminence that yields \nabundant opportunities for high-wage, high-skill employment. Mr. \nPresident, my home State of Utah, provides an outstanding example of \nthe industry's job-creating capacity. Thousands of Utahns earn their \nliving in the State's flourishing semiconductor industry. Firms such as \nMicron Technology, National Semiconductor, and Varian have reinforced \nUtah's strong position in high-technology industries. With the fair tax \ntreatment this bill brings, all Utahns can look forward to a more \nsecure and prosperous future.\n  Mr. President, the Semiconductor Investment Act of 1995 will help \nlevel the playing field between U.S. and foreign semiconductor \nmanufacturers, and provides fair tax treatment to an industry that is \none of the Nation's greatest success stories of recent years. I hope \nthat my fellow Senators will join me in supporting this legislation. \nMr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 833\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to restore the American family, reduce illegitimacy, \nand reduce welfare dependence; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  the real welfare reform act of 1995\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, before coming to the Senate I spent 45 \nyears in the private sector meeting a payroll as a businessman and a \nfarmer. Every year I watched as the Congress went into session and \nadjourned, leaving it more difficult for working taxpayers to make ends \nmeet because of the out-of-control government spending programs that \nhave put our country on the path to a fiscal disaster.\n  Of all the spending programs implemented by the Federal Government, I \ndo not know of a group that has been a bigger failure than those \ncollectively known as welfare. President Johnson's War on Poverty, \nalthough launched with good intentions, has failed. And in many ways it \nhas made the plight of the poor worse instead of better.\n  The problem is not a lack of spending. Welfare spending has cost \ntaxpayers $5.3 trillion in constant 1993 dollars since 1965, when the \nWar on Poverty began. Currently, the Federal Government runs \napproximately 76 means-tested welfare programs, at a cost in 1994 of \n$350 billion. And this amount is projected to reach $538 billion by \n1999 if current trends continue.\n  A simple commonsense principle has gotten our Nation and the poor \ninto the present fix: You get more of what you pay for. And for the \npast 30 years we have subsidized and thus promoted self-destructive \nbehavior like illegitimacy and family disintegration.\n  This explosion in entitlement spending has fueled an entitlement \nmentality. Millions of Americans live day after day, month after month \nand year after year on paychecks from the government and give nothing \nin return--except their assurance that they will stay poor, and \ncontinue to fuel the government poverty machine.\n  What is needed is a dramatic change, a reversal of the trends of the \nlast 30 years.\n  Today, I intend to re-introduce a welfare reform bill similar to one \nwhich I introduced last year with Senator Grassley and Senator Brown. \nThe bill has three central purposes: to reduce illegitimacy, promote \nwork, and control the growth of welfare costs.\n  The bill will convert 67 means-tested welfare programs into a single \nblock grant to the States. Spending on this block grant, and several \nother Federal programs, will be subject to an aggregate cap of 3 \npercent per year.\n  This single block grant will give States the flexibility to design \nprograms which meet the specific needs of their poor citizens. If one \nState has had particular success with the Head Start Program, for \nexample, and the State wanted to double the Head Start budget or triple \nit, they could do so, as long as the aggregate cap held growth to 3 \npercent.\n  Welfare should no longer be a one-way handout which destroys the \ndesire of able-bodied people to work. Real reform would tansform \nwelfare into a system of mutual responsibility in which welfare \nrecipients who can work would be required to contribute something back \nto society in return for assistance given.\n  My proposal will require able-bodied welfare recipients to work in \nreturn for their benefits. By 1997, the second year after enactment, \nhalf of all welfare beneficiaries will be required to do \n[[Page S7017]] community service or to work in public or private sector \njobs in return for their benefits.\n  This bill would target work requirements first on the most employable \nwelfare recipients: single, able-bodied males, married couples \nreceiving benefits, and single mothers of older children. The last \ngroup effected would be the least employable recipients: single mothers \nof preschool children. This avoids the extremely high cost of child \ncare associated with putting these young mothers to work.\n  One of the most insidious aspects of the welfare system is its \ndestructive effect on the family. Our welfare system tells a young \nunwed mother, in effect, that she can collect up to $15,000 per year in \nbenefits as long as she does not work or marry an employed male. Under \nsuch conditions, it makes more sense to remain unmarried. Welfare has \ntransformed the low-income working husband from a necessary breadwinner \ninto a net financial handicap.\n  When the Great Society antipoverty programs were instituted in 1965, \nthe out-of-wedlock birth rate in the United States was 7 percent. \nThirty years later the rate has jumped to 30 percent. At this rate of \ngrowth it is projected to reach 50 percent by the year 2015, an \nalarming prospect by anyone's standards. Fifty percent, Mr. President. \nThat means that, within just 20 years, half of all American children \ncould be born to single women.\n  Real welfare reform must discourage destructive behavior and \nencourage constructive behavior. Starting prospectively 1 year after \nenactment, the bill would eliminate direct welfare subsidies--except \nmedical aid--to unmarried women under age 21 who have children out of \nwedlock. State governments may use Federal block grant funds to develop \nalternative strategies for assisting children born out of wedlock. The \nbill also encourages marriage by providing a tax credit to low-income \nmarried couples with children where at least one parent is employed.\n  We all recognize the need, and share the desire, to reverse the \ncorrupting incentives in our current welfare system. Welfare recipients \nmust work for their benefits, and must not have children that they \ncannot support. This is the foundation on which real welfare reform \nrests, and welfare legislation that does not address both of these \nissues does not represent true reform.\n  Finally, the Senate will soon take up welfare reform, and we must be \nwilling to make the kinds of tough decisions necessary to reduce \nillegitimacy and promote work, or we will condemn yet another \ngeneration to the crippling effects of welfare dependency. The current \nstate of our welfare system demands that we take immediate action, but \nwe must do so with a clear purpose, in mind.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n  S. 835. A bill to provide for the operation of laboratories to carry \nout certain public-health functions for the region along the \ninternational border with Mexico, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                    southwest public laboratory act\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that is \ncritically needed along our southern border. The Southwest Public \nHealth Laboratory Act was approved by the Senate last year as part of \nS. 1569, the Disadvantaged Minority Health Improvement Act. \nUnfortunately, Congress never completed action on S. 1569 and \nconsequently the grave health and environmental risks along the United \nStates-Mexico border continue to spread.\n  This legislation will allow for the establishment and operation of \nState health and environmental labs along the United States-Mexico \nborder. The grants made available by this act will support and leverage \nthe important laboratory work our border States are already providing. \nCurrently, all the border States suffer from a critical shortage of \nenvironmental and occupational health monitoring. The laboratory \nservices provided by this legislation will support both local and State \nhealth and environmental agencies. As population and commerce increases \nalong the border as a result of our commitment to hemispheric free \ntrade, the need for state-of-the-art laboratory capacity will only \nincrease.\n  We have all seen the media accounts from California to New Mexico to \nTexas spotlighting the deplorable environmental conditions along the \nborder. Beyond those television reports are millions of border \nresidents, primarily minority, who are subject to health risks \nincumbent to these conditions.\n  We are already aware of some of these risks, such as polluted water \nsources, untreated sewage, and pesticides, but there are others we may \nnot be aware of simply because there are not enough facilities to \nanalyze them.\n  Let me give you an example of this problem from my home State of \nTexas. In the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas, researchers obtained \nsamples of fish from nearby waterways, a regular staple of many local \ndiets, and it was determined that the edible tissue of the fish \ncontained an unacceptable amount of the highly toxic chemical PCB. \nAfter further analysis, the Texas Department of Health promptly issued \nan advisory strongly recommending that fish taken from the waterways \nand reservoirs in the area may not be eaten.\n  Of course, this discovery and analysis was given prompt attention. \nHowever, there are many potential risks along the border that are going \nunchecked. There simply is more work of that nature in the United \nStates-Mexico border area than there are facilities to do it. There is \nan intolerable potential cost--the health of the citizens in the border \narea. So Federal support will mean badly needed improvement in the \nborder States' abilities to respond to the health and environmental \nrisks facing all citizens.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation that is \ncritical to the health of citizens not only along the southern border \nbut also across the United States. The health and environmental \nproblems along the border do not check with customs or immigration \nbefore crossing the border. The Southwest Border Health Laboratory is \nan essential component in battling these risks before they have a \nchance to spread beyond the border.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. EXON:\n  S. 836. A bill to authorize appropriations for pipeline safety for \nfiscal years 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                    the pipeline safety act of 1995\n\n Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce by request \nthe administration's proposed pipeline safety bill.\n  This legislation builds on a continuing record of success that \nadministrations of both parties and the Congress have made in ensuring \nthe safe operation of America's vast network of natural gas, petroleum, \nwater, and other types of pipelines.\n  Pipeline safety is one of the lesser known, but more important \nresponsibilities of the Senate Commerce Committee. As a former chairman \nof the Senate Surface Transportation Subcommittee I am proud of the \nprogress we have made in advancing safety. With this legislation, the \nCongress can open a new chapter of safety.\n  This legislation gives the Secretary of Transportation authority to \nmake grants to States to encourage the adoption of effective \ncomprehensive one-call legislation. It also authorizes the Secretary to \nenter into cooperative agreements with the private sector to bring new \nefficiencies to pipeline safety research, risk assessment, and mapping.\n  In a time of tight budgets, the bill also introduces the concept of \nrisk management to pipeline safety activities. With fewer dollars \navailable the Congress must be certain that we get the most bang for \nthe buck or more appropriately, in the area of energy pipeline safety, \nwe need to get no bang for the buck.\n  Mr. President, as a member of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over \nthis important legislation, I want to mention some areas of concern \nwhich I would like our committee to address. In the area of mapping of \npipeline locations, the Congress must assure that public and private \nfunds are not wasted on duplicative efforts. The Government's mapping \nneeds must be better coordinated with the private sector and existing \nmapping operations within the U.S. Government. There is no need to \nreinvent the wheel when it comes to pipeline mapping.\n  I am also concerned about the way pipeline safety user fees are \ncalculated [[Page S7018]] for natural gas suppliers in rural areas. The \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission [FERC] maintains a fee schedule \nfor their activities which more fairly takes into account the risk, \nvolume, and economics of serving rural areas. I have urged the \nDepartment of Transportation to consider the FERC schedule and its \nappropriateness for their operations.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I am committed to enacting a meaningful \ncomprehensive one-call bill. Last year I was pleased to propose a \ncompromise and work with Senators Bradley and Lautenberg to enact \ncomprehensive one-call legislation. Meaningful call-before-you-dig \nprograms will save lives, dollars, and productivity. I would certainly \nsupport the addition of the Bradley-Exon bill to this legislation. That \nbill represents the one-call compromise worked out last year.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the swift enactment of pipeline \nsafety legislation this year and ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill and a section-by-section analysis prepared by the Department \nof Transportation be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 836\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pipeline Safety Act of \n     1995.''\n\n     SEC. 2. AMENDMENT OF TITLE 49, UNITED STATES CODE.\n\n       Except as otherwise expressly provided, whenever in this \n     Act an amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an \n     amendment to, or a repeal of, a section or other provision, \n     the reference shall be considered to be made to a section or \n     other provision of title 49, United States Code.\n\n                  TITLE I--PIPELINE SAFETY AMENDMENTS\n\n     SEC. 101. RISK MANAGEMENT.\n\n       Chapter 601 is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new section:\n\n     ``Sec. 60126.

Within 30 days after any \n     substantive change to the action plan, including the addition \n     or deletion of any subject or action in the plan, the \n     Secretary shall inform Congress in writing of the reasons for \n     the change.''.\n     SEC. 102. ONE CALL NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS.\n\n       Section 60114 (relating to one-call notification systems) \n     is amended by striking subsections (b) and (d), and \n     redesignating subsections (c) and (e) as (b) and (d), \n     respectively.\n\n     SEC. 103. INTERNATIONAL UNIFORMITY.\n\n       Section 60117 (relating to administration) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(k) International Uniformity of Standards.--\n       ``(1) Participation in international forums.--Subject to \n     guidance and direction from the Secretary of State, the \n     Secretary of Transportation may participate in international \n     forums that establish or recommend pipeline safety standards \n     for transporting natural gas and hazardous liquids.\n       ``(2) Consultation.--The Secretary of Transportation may \n     consult with interested authorities to ensure that, to the \n     extent practicable, regulations the Secretary prescribes \n     under this chapter are consistent with standards related to \n     pipeline safety transportation adopted by international \n     authorities.\n       ``(3) Differences with international standards and \n     requirements.--The section does not require the Secretary to \n     prescribe a standard identical to, less stringent than, or \n     more stringent than a standard adopted by an international \n     authority or otherwise limit the Secretary's discretion in \n     issuing standards.''.\n\n     SEC. 104. GENERAL AUTHORITY.\n\n       Section 60117 (relating to administration), as amended by \n     section 103, is further amended by adding at the end the \n     following new subsection:\n       ``(l) Funding Authority.--To carry out this chapter, the \n     Secretary may enter into grants, cooperative agreements, and \n     other transactions with any person, agency, or \n     instrumentality of the United States, any unit of State or \n     local government, any educational institution, and any other \n     entity to further the objectives of this chapter, including \n     the development, improvement, and promotion of one-call \n     damage prevention programs, research, risk assessment, and \n     mapping.''.\n\n     SEC. 105. ANNUAL REPORTS.\n\n       Section 60124 (relating to annual reports) is repealed.\n\n     SEC. 106. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       Section 60125 (relating to authorization of appropriations) \n     is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``gas:'' and all that follows in subsection \n     (a) and inserting ``gas, $16,450,000 for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 1996, and such sums as may be necessary \n     for fiscal years 1997, 1998, and 1999.'';\n       (2) by striking ``liquid:'' and all that follows in \n     subsection (b) and inserting ``liquid, $10,968,000 for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 1996, and such sums as may \n     be necessary for fiscal years 1997, 1998, and 1999.'';\n       (3)(A) by striking the heading of subsection (c) and \n     inserting in lieu thereof ``State Pipeline Safety Grants.--\n     '';\n       (B) by striking ``title:'' and all that follows in \n     subsection (c)(1) and inserting ``title, $15,000,000 for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 1996, and such sums as may \n     be necessary for fiscal years 1997, 1998, 1999.'';\n       (4) by striking subsection (d) and inserting the following:\n       (d) Other Transactions.--Not more than the following \n     amounts may be appropriated to the Secretary to carry out \n     section 60117(1) of this title: $5,000,000 for the fiscal \n     year ending September 30, 1996, and such sums as may be \n     necessary for fiscal years 1997, 1998, and 1999.''; and\n       (5) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(g) Special Projects.--For each of fiscal years 1996, \n     1997, 1998, and 1999, not more than $500,000 or 0.5 percent \n     of the amount appropriated annually to carry out chapter 601, \n     whichever is less, may be appropriated to the Secretary to \n     fund special projects undertaken jointly with other offices \n     within the Department to improve the administration of \n     transportation safety programs.''.\n\n     SEC. 107. TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS.\n\n       (a) Section 60105 is amended by inserting ``Pipeline Safety \n     Program'' after ``State'' in the heading.\n       (b) Section 60106 is amended by inserting ``Pipeline \n     Safety'' after ``State'' in the heading.\n       (c) Section 60107 is amended by inserting ``Pipeline \n     Safety'' after ``State'' in the heading.\n       (d) Section 60114(a)(9) is amended by striking ``, 60122, \n     and 60123'' and inserting ``and 60122''.\n\n                  TITLE II--AVIATION TARIFF AMENDMENT\n\n     SEC. 201. AVIATION TARIFF AMENDMENT.\n\n       Section 40114(b) (relating to reports and records), is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``The Secretary'' in the second sentence \n     and inserting ``With the exception of tariffs, the Secretary; \n     and''\n       (2) by inserting ``The Secretary shall ensure that tariff \n     records are available to the public on a permanent basis.'' \n     after the second sentence.\n\n               TITLE III--HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AMENDMENTS\n\n     SEC. 301. HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AMENDMENTS.\n\n       (a) Section 5107(j)(4)(A) (relating to employee training \n     requirements) is amended by striking ``section 5127(c)(3)'' \n     and inserting ``section 5127(b)(1)''.\n       (b) Section 5116(j)(4)(A) (relating to supplemental \n     training grants) is amended by striking ``subsection (g)'' \n     and inserting ``section 5115''.\n       (c) Section 5110(e) (relating to retention of shipping \n     papers) is amended--\n       (1) by striking the heading and inserting the following:\n       ``(e) Retention of Shipping Papers.--''; and\n       (2) by striking the first sentence and inserting ``A person \n     required to provide a shipping paper to a carrier and a \n     carrier to which a shipping paper is provided shall retain, \n     at or accessible through its principal place of business, a \n     paper or electronic image copy of each shipping paper for one \n     year from the date the shipping paper has been provided to \n     the carrier.''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n\n                  TITLE I. PIPELINE SAFETY AMENDMENTS\n\n       Sections 101 and 102. These sections contain the short \n     title for title I of the Act, and clarify that references in \n     title I to amendments of sections or other provisions are \n     [[Page S7019]] considered to be amendments to title 49, \n     United States Code.\n       Section 103. This section would incorporate in the pipeline \n     safety statute a framework for risk management that would \n     facilitate the introduction of risk-based decisionmaking into \n     the pipeline safety program. Basing pipeline safety and \n     environmental decisionmaking on risk management principles \n     assures that the safety investments of pipeline operators can \n     be directed to those risks that pose the greatest threat to \n     the public and the environment.\n       Both the Department and pipeline operators have been \n     working diligently to develop national standards for pipeline \n     system risk assessment (the tool) and risk management (the \n     safety program). In order to accommodate this new approach to \n     safety and environmental decisionmaking, the traditional \n     regulatory program framework, which focuses almost \n     exclusively on regulations to address every risk, would be \n     changed. This proposal has the benefit of facilitating a \n     determination before a rulemaking or other action is begun as \n     to what is the best risk-reduction action. In addition, the \n     proposal supplies the means for determining among identified \n     risks which ones should be addressed in what order and with \n     what resources.\n       Section 104. This section removes the provision authorizing \n     grants to States for development of one-call systems. The \n     grant authority would be consolidated in 49 U.S.C. 60117(1) \n     (discussed in section 106 of this bill).\n       Section 105. This section would allow the Secretary to \n     participate in international forums that establish pipeline \n     safety standards for transporting natural gas and hazardous \n     liquids. The Secretary would be authorized to consult with \n     international authorities to ensure that, to the extent \n     practicable, United States regulations are consistent with \n     international standards. The Secretary would not be required \n     to adopt identical standards and would not be prohibited from \n     adopting more, or less, stringent standards.\n       Section 106. This section provides the Secretary with \n     general authority to enter into grants, cooperative \n     agreements and other transactions with States, industry, non-\n     profit institutions, and other entities to support activities \n     that will achieve the objectives of the statute. These \n     activities include, but are not limited to, one-call \n     notification, research, risk assessment, and mapping.\n       This section would expand the Secretary's current authority \n     to make grants to state pipeline safety agencies, by allowing \n     the Secretary to make grants to other State agencies, \n     operators of one-call notification systems, and non-profit \n     organizations to actively promote the use of one-call \n     notification systems. Prevention of damage to underground \n     facilities such as pipelines, water and sewer lines, fiber \n     optic cables, and electric lines represents one of the \n     Nation's most important and relevant safety initiatives. \n     Damage to pipelines from excavation and other powered \n     equipment is the leading cause of pipeline failures. The best \n     opportunity to avoid damage to underground facilities is \n     through use of one-call systems whereby excavators can \n     receive information, before they dig, from a single source \n     about all underground facilities at risk from the excavation. \n     However, the effectiveness of state laws and programs and \n     one-call centers themselves varies widely throughout the \n     country, and the need for uniformity is great as many \n     underground facilities, and the excavators that threaten \n     them, operate in many states and localities.\n       Grants provided for in this provision could be used to \n     establish, modify, improve, and promote the use of one-call \n     systems, including publicizing the risks involved in pipeline \n     transportation and the benefits of one-call systems in \n     addressing those risks.\n       This authority is central to execution of the Department's \n     pipeline safety risk management program for it will enable \n     the agency to obtain the data it will need continually to \n     determine risks, quantify and rank those risks, adopt \n     strategies and solutions to meet those risks, and identify \n     available and new technologies necessary to keep pace with \n     safety needs. This authority resides in other Federal \n     agencies, and offers excellent opportunities to leverage \n     Federal resources with other entities who have a role to play \n     in risk management and accident prevention.\n       Section 107. This section would repeal the requirement that \n     the Secretary report annually on pipeline safety activities \n     conducted under 49 U.S.C. chapter 601. The information \n     required in this report, and more, is provided at least \n     annually to Congress during the appropriations process, as \n     well as to the authorizing committees on a periodic basis. In \n     addition, widespread dissemination of pipeline safety data is \n     made to our state partners, and is the subject of an \n     increasing number of requests under the Freedom of \n     Information Act. The time spent to compile the report has \n     resulted in the report being at least two years out of date \n     by the time it is issued. The Department's new data \n     capabilities enable it to provide up-to-date information on \n     an ``as requested'' basis in response to routine requests for \n     information. This capability meets the needs of our \n     stakeholders, while not requiring the resources to assemble \n     what, under the best of circumstances, is outdated \n     information for the annual report.\n       Section 108. This section would authorize appropriations \n     for the Department of Transportation to carry out the \n     pipeline safety provisions of 49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq. For \n     fiscal year 1996, this section would authorize $16,450,000 \n     for gas, $10,968,000 for hazardous liquid, and $15,000,000 \n     for State grants. This provision also authorizes $5,000,000 \n     in fiscal year 1996 to fund activities conducted under \n     section 60117(1) (see discussion under Section 106 of the \n     bill), and such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years \n     1997, 1998, and 1999. Finally, for fiscal years 1996 through \n     1999, this section authorizes not more than $500,000 or 0.5% \n     of the amount appropriated annually to carry out chapter 601, \n     whichever is less, to fund special projects. This provision \n     is intended to provide a small amount of funding for projects \n     undertaken jointly with other agencies within the Department \n     to improve the administration of transportation safety \n     programs.\n       Section 109. The first three subsections amend the titles \n     of three sections to clarify their applicability. Subsection \n     (d) corrects one of the requirements for qualified state one-\n     call programs by deleting the reference to state adoption of \n     Federal criminal sanctions. The reference was inadvertently \n     added to the list of requirements when the pipeline safety \n     laws were enacted into positive law in Pub. L. No. 103-272.\n\n\n                  TITLE II. AVIATION TARIFF AMENDMENT\n\n       Section 201. This section would amend section 40114 of \n     title 49, United States Code, which sets out the requirements \n     for maintaining as public records those materials filed with \n     the Department on aviation matters, including voluminous \n     international passenger fare tariff filings. Currently, \n     section 40114 requires the Department to maintain physical \n     custody of tariff filings.\n       In the spirit of reinventing government, the Department has \n     reexamined the manner in which it performs its tariff \n     custodianship function and found that the costs of the system \n     greatly outweigh the benefits. The Department has concluded \n     that the custodianship requirement, which was first enacted \n     in 1938, has outlived its usefulness to the public, the \n     airline industry, and the Government.\n       In 1989, the Department instituted a system by which air \n     carriers may file international passenger tariffs \n     electronically as an alternative to filing paper tariffs. To \n     be eligible for the benefits of automated filing, a carrier \n     is required to accept responsibility for maintaining a secure \n     and accessible on-line tariff database. The major air \n     carriers responded to this opportunity by contracting with \n     tariff publishing agents to manage these electronic filing \n     functions. Currently, the agents' on-line databases store \n     over 95 percent of all tariffs. The Department strictly \n     regulates these databases. Filers are required to keep the \n     databases available for public and departmental access at no \n     cost, secure against destruction, alteration, or tampering, \n     and open to inspection by the Department to ensure security \n     and integrity. The amended section would ensure continued \n     public access to historical tariff data contained in the \n     database currently used by the Department.\n       Although the Department has met its custodianship \n     requirement by mandating a daily tape from the on-line tariff \n     databases, it stores this data in a fashion that allows very \n     limited flexibility in retrieving it. In contrast, the \n     agents' databases are modern, flexible, and freely accessible \n     to Department officials. As a result, the departmental \n     archive serves no purpose except to comply with the \n     statutorily-mandated custodianship requirement. Removing the \n     statutory requirement that copies of the tariffs be preserved \n     in the physical custody of the Department would enable the \n     Department to cease its duplicative archival efforts and \n     realize a savings.\n\n\n               title iii. hazardous materials amendments\n\n       Section 301. This section amends 49 U.S.C. 5107(e) and \n     5116(j) to correct cross-references. This section also amends \n     49 U.S.C. 5110(e) to specify that the one-year retention \n     period for a shipping paper begins when the shipping paper is \n     provided to a carrier instead of when transportation is \n     completed, because it would be very difficult for the \n     originator of a shipment to determine when transportation of \n     that shipment has been completed.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself and Mr. Robb):\n  S. 837. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins \nin commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the birth of James \nMadison; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                the james madison commemorative coin act\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend, Senator \nRobb, to introduce legislation to establish an endowment to be a \npermanent source of support for Montpelier, the life-long home of James \nMadison, the fourth President of the United States and the Father of \nthe U.S. Constitution. President Madison was the third generation of \nhis family to live on this extensive estate located in the lush \nPiedmont of Virginia. Montpelier was settled by James Madison's \ngrandparents in 1723 and prospered under the ownership of his parents, \nJames (Sr.) and Nelly Conway Madison. In 1794, James Madison, a 43-\nyear-old bachelor, met and fell in love with Dolley Payne Todd, a 26-\nyear-old widow and mother. They were married later the same year. \n[[Page S7020]] After the completion of his second Presidential term in \n1817, the Madisons retired to Montpelier, where their legendary \nhospitality kept them in touch with world affairs. At his death in \n1836, Madison was buried on the estate. Dolley Madison later returned \nto Washington where she died in 1849.\n  Following Madison's death, the contents of the house were auctioned \noff. Montpelier then changed hands six times, until it was purchased in \n1900 by William and Anna Rogers duPont. The National Trust for Historic \nPreservation received the property in 1983, and opened it for public \ntours in 1987 as part of the celebration of the bicentennial of the \nU.S. Constitution. Today, under the stewardship of the National Trust, \nMontpelier is beginning a long-term research and preservation process. \nUnfurnished and as yet unrestored, Montpelier is the focus of a major \narchaeological and architectural research effort.\n  The legislation which I am introducing today would authorize the U.S. \nMint to produce a commemorative coin to honor the 250th birthday of \nJames Madison. After recovery of minting and production costs, the \nproceeds from the sale of the James Madison Commemorative Coin, \nconservatively estimated at $5 to $10 million, will be used as the core \nof a capital campaign to establish an endowment and preserve \nMontpelier. This campaign will assure the full preservation and \nrestoration of Montpelier and the development of all of the related \nprogrammatic activities.\n  Mr. President, an intensive effort must be mounted to achieve the \ngoal of securing the future of Montpelier. I am committed to making my \ncolleagues in the House and Senate aware of the benefits to be derived \nfrom the minting of a coin to honor James Madison, and I am confident \nthat this support can be secured. Our national legislature, indeed, our \nNation, owes a great debt to the vision of James Madison. Throughout \nhis life, Montpelier helped shape Madison's character and values. This \nlegislation is an important step toward bringing all Americans closer \nto this great man.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

This dedicated and thoughtful \nservant needs no formal introduction to those familiar with the \ncomplexities of our Nation's defense budget. I am of course speaking of \nAssistant Secretary of the Navy for Acquisition, Ms. Nora Slatkin.\n  In the years preceding her appointment to the Department of the Navy, \nMs. Slatkin served as a senior staff member and adviser to Les Aspin, \nthen chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. During her tenure \nwith the committee, Ms. Slatkin often staffed the most difficult of \nhearings involving not only current program acquisition, but research \nand development investments for the future. She is truly one of our \nNation's brightest stars in defense policy.\n  As Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Ms. Slatkin has presided over \nsome of the most difficult procurement decisions before the Department \nin recent decades. Her tenure has been marked by sound, articulate \njudgment and careful analysis. More importantly, she has further \nstrengthened her reputation for honesty, integrity, and fairness--\nqualities often desired but not always achieved.\n  Ms. Slatkin truly deserves our thanks for her service to the Nation \nand the Navy. I wish her well and much success in her new position at \nthe Central Intelligence Agency.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/19/senate-section/article/S7021-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7021-S7022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  NATIONAL DEFENSE TRANSPORTATION DAY\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today, as we celebrate National \nDefense Transportation Day, I rise to recognize the important \ncontributions that the people who serve in military transportation \nspecialties, as well as those who work in the U.S. civil transportation \nindustry, have made to the security of our Nation.\n  As our military increasingly becomes a U.S.-based, power projection \nforce, our transportation assets become an even more crucial element of \nthe national defense. Without possessing the ability to rapidly and \nefficiently move our service personnel and their equipment into an \noverseas theater of operations, all of the money we have spent and all \nof the effort we have put into building the strongest armed force in \nthe world would be for naught.\n  I am sure that we all can vividly recall the Herculean effort our \nmilitary and civilian transporters made during Operation Desert Shield \nin moving large numbers of people and massive amounts of materiel from \ntwo continents into the Persian Gulf region, in record time. As our \nmilitary leaders can attest, that transportation capability served as a \ncombat multiplier, and played a significant role in our decisive \nvictory.\n  Today, the many people involved in U.S. defense transportation \ncontinue the long tradition of excellence in service to the Nation. \nWhether military or civilian; manufacturers or operators; air \ntransporters, sea transporters, or ground transporters; these Americans \nrepresent the very best our Nation has to offer. I commend them for \ntheir hard work and their many contributions to national security.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to recognize the National \nDefense Transportation Association [NDTA], headquartered in Alexandria, \nVA. Within a membership of over 8,000 people, configured into 70 \nchapters within the United States and overseas, the NDTA has served as \na catalyst in building the critically important military-private sector \npartnership for defense transportation. In this, its 51st year, NDTA \ncontinues to play a vital role in keeping the American defense \ntransportation capability the best in the world. [[Page S7022]] \n  Mr. President, I trust my colleagues will join me today in saluting \nthe NDTA, and all Americans working in defense transportation, on \nNational Defense Transportation Day.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/19/senate-section/article/S7021-4", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            THREE CHEERS FOR THE RHODE ISLAND GEOGRAPHY BEE\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to commend all the \nstudents who participated in the Rhode Island finals of the 1995 \nNational Geography Bee that took place at Rhode Island College on April \n7.\n  The competition included eight preliminary rounds. The top 10 winners \nof the semifinals then competed in the final round. These students \nreceived a medallion from the Rhode Island Social Studies Association \nfor their performance.\n  The third place winner was Matthew Lawrence from Hugh B. Gain Junior \nHigh School. He received $50, a book from National Geographic, and an \ninflatable globe. Matthew Price of Riverside Junior High School was the \nsecond place winner. He received $75, a book from National Geographic, \nand an inflatable globe.\n  The first place winner was Mitchell Malachowski of Western Hills \nJunior High School. As well as receiving $100, an atlas, and an \ninflatable globe, he will compete in the national finals at National \nGeographic Headquarters here in Washington, DC. His teacher, Mr. \nWilliam Morris, will travel with him. Western Hills Junior High School \nwas presented with a plaque.\n  Even more important than the books and plaques that these students \nreceived, is the knowledge of geography they obtained during \npreparations for the competition. As our world grows smaller through \nthe advances in technology, communications, and transportation, the \nstudy of geography becomes increasingly significant.\n  This achievement is an exceptional feat. Geography is a very \nimportant subject. All the participants have demonstrated exceptional \nknowledge in the field.

KIDD\n\n Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Sergeant \nMajor of the Army [SMA] Richard A. Kidd, who will retire on June 30, \n1995. SMA Kidd's service to our Nation spanned more than 33 years \nduring which he distinguished himself as a soldier, leader, mentor, \nspokesman, and adviser to the Chief of Staff of the Army. Let me \nbriefly recount to you the career of this dedicated and professional \nsoldier.\n  A native of Morehead, KY, and product of a military family, SMA Kidd \nenlisted in the U.S. Army in March 1962. During his more than three \ndecades of loyal service to the Nation, he has held and served in every \ninfantry enlisted leadership position from squad leader to command \nsergeant major. He is a combat tested leader with two tours in Vietnam \nwhere he served with the 1st Cavalry Division (1966-67) and returned as \nan infantry adviser with the United States Military Assistance Command-\nVietnam (1970-71). SMA Kidd has also had multiple tours in Korea and \nEurope. Before becoming the ninth Sergeant Major of the Army, he was \ncommand sergeant major of I Corps, America's Corps, and Fort Lewis, WA. \nHe has served as command sergeant major of numerous organizations \nincluding the 9th Aviation Battalion, Fort Lewis, WA; 2d Battalion, 2d \nInfantry, South Korea; Commandant, 1st Armored Division NCO Academy, \nKatterbach, Germany. After his tour in Germany, he returned to Fort \nLewis where he served consecutively as command sergeant major of the \n4th Battalion, 23d Infantry Regiment; 3d Brigade, 9th Infantry Division \n[Motorized]; and 9th Infantry Division [Motorized].\n  When SMA Kidd was selected to become the Army's senior enlisted \nrepresentative in July 1991, the cheering Americans and victory parades \nwelcoming home the victors of the Persian Gulf war were but a faint \nmemory. Two short years earlier, the Berlin Wall had fallen, signaling \nAmerica's triumph in the 50-year-old cold war and the Army \n[[Page S7023]] was in the midst of a drawdown efforts to reduce its \nsize by a third. The biggest challenge facing SMA Kidd was \ncommunicating the Army's strategy to make cuts while, at the same time, \nmaintaining a quality trained and ready Army. He focused on providing \nsoldiers and their families with accurate and timely information so \nthat they could make educated and informed decisions about their future \nin a shrinking Army. That was achieved through regular interviews with \nboth internal and external communication print and electronic mediums. \nIn so doing, he established a reputation, trust, and rapport with \nsoldiers and their families as a caring leader who listened and truly \nrepresented soldiers.\n  SMA Kidd's distinguished 33-year career epitomizes the consummate \nprofessional soldier--one who loves being a soldier and being around \nother soldiers, is technically and tactically proficient, dedicated, \nmotivated, physically fit, mentally alert, and morally straight. But \nabove all, he is a loving and caring husband and father whose service \nwas enhanced by his wife, Sylvia, and their two children, Shelly and \nRyan. To them, too, the Nation owes its gratitude.\n  SMA Kidd, a professional and proud infantry soldier--on behalf of the \nCongress of the United States and the people we represent, I offer our \nsincere thanks for your service.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/19/senate-section/article/S7022-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            RIVER BEND NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION, DES MOINES\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, with the seemingly never-ending \nstories of urban decline, I thought it would be a welcome change to \ntell about a community that has bucked this downward trend. River Bend \nNeighborhood Association is a community on the north side of Des \nMoines, IA. River Bend is unique in that it has taken control of its \nown future. Of course, there have been helping hands along the way, but \nthe true reason behind their success is the desire and motivation of \nthe community members to attain a better life.\n  The background of River Bend will sound familiar to many. The \nneighborhood consists of approximately 4,000 residents and the average \nhousehold income is $11,880. Increasingly, River Bend was succumbing to \nthe problems of crime, drugs, disinvestment, and abandoned property. \nBusinesses were moving out, and corruption started to take over.\n  The key to halting this decline was the formation of the Designated \nNeighborhood Action Plan. The goal of the plan, which was started in \n1990, is to better meet the needs of Des Moines' communities, with the \nemphasis on housing and infrastructure. The logistics are the tricky \npart. The plan involved the Des Moines government, Polk County \ngovernment, and the financial services industry to invest in the \nNeighborhood Finance Corporation, the NFC for short. Due to this \ninvestment, the NFC is able to provide mortgage capital at low rates \nand planning services to keep private investment in local communities. \nThis allows for low income families, even families earning as low as 30 \npercent of median income, to own their own homes, a goal most Americans \nshare.\n  To date, over $35 million in private capital has been raised by the \nNFC--all from the local financial services industry. One notable figure \nis The Principal Financial Group, which has provided investments of \nover $3 million, continuing funding for operating costs, and leadership \nto keep the NFC in the right direction. Financial institutions like the \nPrincipal and others in Des Moines make it possible for communities \nsuch as River Bend to become productive and attractive.\n  Mr. President, I think the example of River Bend is an important one. \nThe successes of River Bend are tangible: the fact that 161 homes have \neither been constructed or salvaged and new families are moving into \nthese homes, the fact that crime has decreased, and the fact that over \n$4 million has been invested in the area. These successes are proof \nthat something like the Designated Neighborhood Action Plan can work if \nit is given a chance. The key is to make more urban communities aware \nof such possibilities, and show that these goals are indeed within \nreach. State and local governments need to support partnerships like \nthat of River Bend and the financial institutions of Des Moines. Having \ncleaner, safer, and more productive neighborhoods is beneficial to \neveryone in a large urban area, and this is the necessary common \ndenominator that makes these partnerships work.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/19/senate-section/article/S7023-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nSTATUTORY REFERENCES TO APPLICABLE COMMITTEE OR OFFICER OF THE HOUSE OF \n                            REPRESENTATIVES\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Madam President, I thank the Chair and I thank my friend \nand colleague, the chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  Just 2 or 3 minutes of closing remarks. I would agree.\n  I would agree with my friend and colleague from New Mexico that \nduring debate on the Senate floor there may have been some \noverstatements of the facts by Senators on this side of the aisle.\n  I was here today, though, and I heard several statements on the \nRepublican [[Page S7024]] side of the aisle that I interpreted also as \noverstatements. We do get carried away sometimes in debate.\n  This Senator, both in the Budget Committee and on the floor of the \nSenate, has tried to make a case as I saw it in a responsible, honest \nmanner.\n  I just want to say, once again, that I spoke a few moments ago about \none of the greatest overstatements that I keep hearing on the floor of \nthe Senate on this matter, despite the fact that the Democrats have not \noffered an amendment and as far as I know will not during this debate \nthat violates the very principles that the Senator from New Mexico \nemphasized was part and parcel of the budget, to protect the kids of \nthe future, to eliminate the ever skyrocketing deficit and grossly \nincreasing national debt.\n  But, once again, I feel, when somebody on this side of the aisle or \nsomebody on that side of the aisle gets up and says something about \noverstatements by someone on the other side, they better be careful \nthat they are not throwing rocks at their own glass houses.\n  My friend from New Mexico went right after one of the very basic \ntenets of the remarks that I made, I think in a reasonable fashion, \njust before we went into the closing procedures, and that was that I \nhave heard the statement, certainly an overstatement, once again, from \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee that the Democrats want to take \nthis money and spend it. Well, I think that is a good buzzword and I \nthink the Republicans have researched that well in their extensive \npolling.\n  I want it clearly understood that this deficit hawk, this \nconservative Democrat, is not for spending in the context that the \nRepublicans continue to use during this debate, accusing the Democrats \nof spending when we are not spending. We are reducing the hits. We are \nreducing the significant reductions in hits in a whole series of \nprograms that even the Republicans concede are very heavy and very \ndifficult.\n  I simply say, Madam President, once again, I hope that we can \ncontinue a legitimate debate on Monday, to debate the legitimate issues \nin proper form and with proper respect for all Members of the Senate \nthat I have great respect for, but I recognize that all of us, from \ntime to time, make some overstatements.\n  I just hope, because every time I hear the Republicans talking about \nspending, I wish that they would better define that word. We are not \nspending money. We are trying to alleviate what we think are more \nonerous cuts in budgets of the most needy of our citizens, especially \nour senior citizens, and especially our young people who were relying \non Government loans to get their education. We will continue the debate \non Monday next.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/19/senate-section/article/S7023-6", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECESS UNTIL 8:30 A.M., MONDAY, MAY 22, 1995\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
