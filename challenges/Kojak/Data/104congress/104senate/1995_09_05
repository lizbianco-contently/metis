Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 1026, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1026) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 1996 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \n     Forces, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Brown amendment No. 2125, to clarify restrictions on \n     assistance to Pakistan.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I want to advise all Senators that the \nSenate is on the Defense authorization bill, and the unanimous-consent \nagreement we propounded before adjourning on August 11 requires us to \nremain on this bill until all debate is completed and we have a final \nvote. This bill is essential to our national security and must be \npassed today.\n  Let me start the discussion by alerting everyone of today's plans.\n  First, from now until 5 p.m. we plan to debate those amendments that \nare in order under the unanimous-consent agreement of August 11.\n  Second, we plan to stack the votes on those amendments and dispose of \nthem immediately after the vote on the Defense appropriations bill \nscheduled for 5 p.m. today.\n  Third, after the stacked votes, we plan to proceed to consideration \nof the bipartisan missile defense amendments. This debate is scheduled \nfor 3 hours. When that debate concludes, we plan to vote on the \namendment and then vote on the bill itself.\n  This means all amendments that are in order under the unanimous-\nconsent agreement should be raised and debated prior to 5 p.m. today to \nensure \n\n[[Page S 12528]]\n\nthey are given appropriate consideration. If amendments are not offered \nearly, they may have to wait until after 9 p.m. this evening. Keep in \nmind that the unanimous-consent agreement we are operating under states \nthat we will not adjourn or recess until final vote is taken on the \nauthorization bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to come forward with their \namendments, limit debate, and work toward a timely vote on this bill.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Bingaman), for himself and \n     Mr. Domenici, proposes an amendment numbered 2427.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 570, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3168. APPLICABILITY OF ATOMIC ENERGY COMMUNITY ACT OF \n                   1955 TO LOS ALAMOS, NEW MEXICO.\n\n       (a) Date of Transfer of Utilities.--Section 72 of the \n     Atomic Energy Community Act of 1955 (42 U.S.C. 2372) is \n     amended by striking out ``not later than five years after the \n     date it is included within this Act'' and inserting in lieu \n     thereof ``not later than June 30, 1998''.\n       (b) Date of Transfer of Municipal Installations.--Section \n     83 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 2383) is amended by striking out \n     ``not later than five years after the date it is included \n     within this Act'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``not later \n     than June 30, 1998''.\n       (c) Recommendation for Further Assistance Payments.--\n     Section 91 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 2391) is amended--\n       (1) by striking out ``, and the Los Alamos School Board;'' \n     and all that follows through ``county of Los Alamos, New \n     Mexico'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``; or not later than \n     June 30, 1996, in the case of the Los Alamos School Board and \n     the county of Los Alamos, New Mexico''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new sentence: ``If \n     the recommendation under the preceding sentence regarding the \n     Los Alamos School Board or the county of Los Alamos, New \n     Mexico, indicates a need for further assistance for the \n     school board or the county, as the case may be, after June \n     30, 1997, the recommendation shall include a report and plan \n     describing the actions required to eliminate the need for \n     further assistance for the school board or the county, \n     including a proposal for legislative action to carry out the \n     plan.''.\n       (d) Contract To Make Payments.--Section 94 of such Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 2394) is amended--\n       (1) by striking out ``June 30, 1996'' each place it appears \n     in the proviso in the first sentence and inserting in lieu \n     thereof ``June 30, 1997''; and\n       (2) by striking out ``July 1, 1996'' in the second sentence \n     and inserting in lieu thereof ``July 1, 1997''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Domenici is a modification of the \namendment that we originally filed, amendment No. 2159. We have made \nseveral modifications in the original amendment to accommodate the \ndesires of the managers on both sides to speed the day that assistance \npayments to Los Alamos County and its school board can be brought to a \nmutually agreeable conclusion.\n  Mr. President, the amendment would extend assistance payments under \nthe Atomic Energy Community Act to Los Alamos County and the Los Alamos \nSchool Board for 1 year, until June 30, 1997. It would require a report \nfrom the Department of Energy by June 30, 1996 on how and whether a \nplan could be drawn up to end these payments at that time.\n  The original amendment would have had a 2-year extension. The pending \namendment would also require the utilities and municipal installations \nnow run by Department of Energy be transferred to the county by June \n30, 1998, instead of June 30, 2001, as in the original amendment.\n  Mr. President, the two Los Alamos governmental entities are the last \nremaining recipients of payments under the Atomic Energy Community Act \nof 1954. That law originally encompassed the Hanford area and the Oak \nRidge area in Tennessee as well. When those communities ceased to \nreceive payments under the act, substantial settlements were reached \nwith the communities to put them on a firm financial footing.\n  Senator Jackson and Senator Magnuson won approval of an amendment of \na settlement for the Hanford communities in the late 1970's. Senator \nHoward Baker, then the majority leader, spearheaded the Oak Ridge \nsettlement in the early 1980's during the Reagan defense buildup when \ndefense funds were plentiful.\n  Mr. President, unfortunately, the Los Alamos community and DOE did \nnot reach agreement at that time on a transition plan. The Department \nof Energy told Congress in a 1986 report that the existing arrangement \nshould be continued. So Senator Domenici and I in 1986 offered an \namendment extending the payment for 10 years to June 30, 1996.\n  Mr. President, we do not have the option today of making a \nsubstantial one-time payment to the Los Alamos entities. The Department \nof Energy has been discussing possible land transfers and other \narrangements with the county.\n  These arrangements will involve other Federal agencies and other \nlocal entities, and will require time and will probably require that \nlegislation be enacted.\n  The Department of Energy also must negotiate a new contract with the \nUniversity of California to run the laboratory in 1996, and there is a \npossibility that the Department of Energy will decide to compete that \ncontract. The details of that contract could also affect the county and \nthe school board significantly.\n  For those reasons, Senator Domenici and I are proposing to give these \nprocesses time to work and have the Congress revisit this issue late \nnext year, or more likely in 1997, with specific Department of Energy \nproposals in hand.\n  The provision that we are offering has been worked out between the \nDepartment of Energy and the community leaders and has the support of \nboth as an interim step toward a comprehensive solution within the next \n2 years.\n  Mr. President, I understand this is acceptable to both the majority \nand the Democratic sides, and I urge support of the amendment.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we have no opposition to this amendment \nand are willing to accept it. As I understand, the amendment is offered \nnot only by the distinguished Senator who is speaking, Senator \nBingaman, but also Senator Domenici. They are both in favor of the \namendment, and we are willing to accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, without objection the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2427) was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2157\n\n (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Defense to take such actions as \n    are necessary to reduce the cost of renovation of the Pentagon \n              Reservation to not more than $1,118,000,000)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \n\n\n[[Page S 12529]]\namendment 2125 be temporarily laid aside so that I can offer an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I call up for consideration amendment \nNo. 2157.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. Feingold, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. Lott, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2157:\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 515, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2864. RENOVATION OF THE PENTAGON RESERVATION.\n\n       The Secretary of Defense shall take such action as is \n     necessary to reduce the total cost of the renovation of the \n     Pentagon Reservation to not more than $1,118,000,000.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Feingold, Senator Wellstone, and Senator Lott. It is a \nvery simple amendment. The amendment sets a new target for the total \ncost of renovation of the Pentagon over a multiyear period. The target \nthat we set in here is $1.118 billion. That is $100 million less than \nthe level previously set.\n  Mr. President, in 1990, Congress took the Pentagon out of the hands \nof the General Services Administration and put it in the hands of the \nDepartment of Defense. The reason was that the GSA was doing nothing to \nrenovate the building, which was in disrepair, and was getting paid a \nlot more than maintenance costs. The 1990 law set the course for \nPentagon renovation. Such renovation is desperately needed. There is no \nquestion about that. The building is over 50 years old. Its utilities \nare totally outmoded. Power outages are routine. Rats roam the \nbasement. There is no question that we need to move ahead, and we are \nmoving ahead.\n  In recent years, the Appropriations Committee has required the \nSecretary of Defense to certify that the total cost of Pentagon \nrenovation will not exceed $1.218 billion. Secretary Perry sent the \nlast such certification to Senator Byrd on December 19, 1994.\n  In March of this year, Secretary Perry appointed a steering committee \nchaired by Dr. Kaminski to review plans for the Pentagon renovation and \nto make recommendations on options available for cost reductions, \ntransition of personnel, and ultimate tenancy of the building.\n  It is my understanding that Deputy Secretary White has now taken over \nthat committee. The March Pentagon news release says that--\n\n       This review will include a reexamination of all lower cost \n     options. At a time when the Secretary has initiated efforts \n     to improve housing for our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \n     marines, we need to do all we can to insure that dollars \n     being spent for other infrastructure projects are not being \n     taken away from the very high priority of improving the \n     lifestyle of our men and women in uniform. It is also prudent \n     at this stage in the project to take a new look to insure \n     that costs are being contained and that we won't end up with \n     more money being spent than initially estimated.\n\n  Mr. President, my cosponsors and I agree with that statement from the \nPentagon. We are spending $161 million this year for Pentagon \nrenovation. The Secretary is right that it is time to assess where we \nare. There is evidence that we can get a better price than the $1.218 \nbillion previously estimated for the renovation.\n  On page 33 of the annual status report on Pentagon renovation \nsubmitted March 1, 1995, it is noted that--\n\n       Favorable bids on the Basement Phase I renovation were \n     received on August 10 of 1994. The contract was awarded \n     August 30, 1994 to Hyman Construction Company for \n     $48,043,871. The original bid was about 36 percent below the \n     Government estimate.\n\n  The amendment we are offering today gives the Pentagon steering \ncommittee a target to aim for in their cost reduction efforts, and I \nfor one hope they can do even better than this target. When we are \nasking Americans in all walks of life to tighten their belts, the \nPentagon can do its fair share at the renovation of its headquarters. \nThat is what this amendment attempts to achieve.\n  Mr. President, as I understand the situation, the majority has agreed \nto this amendment, and on the Democratic side Senator Glenn has \nindicated opposition and a desire to speak to the amendment. \n Until he comes and has that opportunity, I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withhold his quorum call \nrequest?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I do withhold the quorum call request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Colorado?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I will yield such time as the Senator \nrequires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. President, I will shortly offer an amendment with regard to \nFitzsimons Army Hospital located just outside Denver, CO. I thought I \nwould take advantage of the lull here for a moment and just share a few \nthoughts about Fitzsimons.\n  It is with some sadness that I offer an amendment with regard to \nFitzsimons. This hospital is one that has played an important role in \nColorado and in the Rocky Mountain region for many, many years.\n  It is on the Base Closure Commission's list of facilities to be \nclosed. And thus the community has sought, on a rapid basis, to find \nanother use for this facility. That will be the subject of the \namendment that I will offer. But I wanted to share a few thoughts with \nthe Chamber also about Fitzsimons because it is an important faculty \nfor Colorado as well as the entire region.\n  It was built during World War I in response to a number of casualties \nthat came in from the fronts in Europe and provided treatment for our \nmilitary personnel. It is an area that I know well. The place where it \nis built is just east of the city of Denver and is an area where my \ngrandfather fed cattle prior to and during World War I. It is a \nhospital that has long served the people of the Rocky Mountain region. \nIt is where my great-grandfather passed away. He was a Civil War \nveteran and received treatment at that facility and then passed away \nprior to World War II, where my father took his enlistment physical \njust after Pearl Harbor in 1942. It is where I took my enlistment \nphysical when I entered the Navy in 1962.\n  It is sad that it is closing. And I say that because our delegation \nwas interested in saving money and has several times----\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. On the question of time, how does the Senator want his \ntime charged? Is he going to offer an amendment? Does he want time \ncharged to himself?\n  Mr. BROWN. Yes, Mr. President.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, is that clear now? The time he uses will \nbe charged to him when he offers this amendment and not to the present \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. What is the pending business of the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is amendment 2157 offered \nby the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so I may offer an amendment to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2428\n\n (Purpose: To urge the Secretary of the Army to move expeditiously to \nlease the Fitzsimons Army Medical Center, Colorado, slated for closure \n                                 1995)\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I offer an amendment and send it to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2428.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, add the following new \n     section:\n     \n[[Page S 12530]]\n\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING FITZSIMONS ARMY \n                   MEDICAL CENTER, COLORADO.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Fitzsimons Army Medical Center in Aurora, Colorado has \n     been recommended for closure in 1995 under the Defense Base \n     Closure and Realignment Act of 1990;\n       (2) The University of Colorado Health Sciences Center and \n     the University of Colorado Hospital Authority are in urgent \n     need of space to maintain their ability to deliver health \n     care to meet the growing demand for their services;\n       (3) Reuse of the Fitzsimons facility at the earliest \n     opportunity would provide significant benefit to the cities \n     of Aurora and Denver; and\n       (4) Reuse of the Fitzsimons facility by the local community \n     ensures that the property is fully utilized by providing a \n     benefit to the community.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--Therefore, it is the sense of \n     Congress that upon acceptance of the Base Closure list--\n       (1) The federal screening process for Fitzsimons Army \n     Medical Center should be accomplished at the earliest \n     opportunity;\n       (2) The Secretary of the Army should consider on an \n     expedited basis transferring Fitzsimons Army Medical Center \n     to the Local Redevelopment Authority while still operational \n     to ensure continuity of use to all parties concerned;\n       (3) The Secretary should not enter into a lease with the \n     Local Redevelopment Authority until he has established that \n     the lease falls within the categorical exclusions established \n     by the Department of the Army pursuant to the National \n     Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.);\n       (4) This section is in no way intended to circumvent the \n     decisions of the 1995 BRAC;\n       (c) Report.--180 days after the enactment of this Act the \n     Secretary of the Army shall provide a report to the \n     appropriate committees of the Congress on the Fitzsimons Army \n     Medical Center that covers--\n       (1) The results of the federal screening process for \n     Fitzsimons and any actions that have been taken to expedite \n     the review;\n       (2) Any impediments raised during the federal screening \n     process to the transfer or lease of Fitzsimons Army Medical \n     Center;\n       (3) Any actions taken by the Secretary of the Army to lease \n     the Fitzsimons Army Medical Center to the local redevelopment \n     authority;\n       (4) The results of any environmental reviews under the \n     National Environmental Policy Act in which such a lease would \n     fall into the categorical exclusions established by the \n     Secretary of the Army; and\n       (5) The results of the environmental baseline survey and a \n     finding of suitability or nonsuitability.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this amendment is one that we have worked \nwith members of the Armed Services Committee to tailor. It is only a \nsense of the Senate, but it expresses a strong hope that this country \nwill move quickly to develop another use for the Fitzsimons hospital.\n  Mr. President, I might point out that it was my wish we offer \nlegislation on this bill to transfer the hospital so it could be \nimmediately turned over to another beneficial use. Unfortunately, I am \nadvised that it is the wish of the committee that we not proceed in \nthat fashion. While that alternative use is desirable, both for the \nFederal Government and for the community, it is the wish of the \ncommittee to follow a procedure set forth in law.\n  The problem with doing so, Mr. President, is that a delay could cause \nthe loss of this alternative use. Fitzsimons Medical Center is a vital \nand important part of our economy. It will be shut down. It will be \nclosed. It is the thought of the community that it should be \nimmediately put to new use. And, fortunately, the University of \nColorado's Health Science Center happens at the moment to be looking \nfor an alternative facility. It is a serendipitous circumstance that \nthis reuse is available just at the time the facility is being shut \ndown.\n  So, what we had hoped to have is an immediate authorization for it to \nbe used by the University of Colorado Health Science Center. It could \nprovide significant savings because you would not have the long delay \nand expense of the shutdown and the closedown. It could provide \nimmediate and beneficial use of the facilities, saving not only the \nUniversity of Colorado money but the Federal Government money as well.\n  Mr. President, that is not what this amendment does. I wish it did. \nWhat this amendment does is simply express the sense of Congress that \nthis alternative has merit and ask for its prompt consideration. My \nhope is, though, that we will see the Pentagon act expeditiously in \ndeveloping this as the alternative use. It is of enormous benefit to \nthe community to have this facility reused as a medical center. It not \nonly makes the best use of the facility, but it also helps the \ncommunity by saving jobs, medical jobs, that had been at Fitzsimons. \nMany of them can be saved by this alternative use by the University of \nColorado.\n  Mr. President, last, let me close with this thought. The delegation \nfrom Colorado did not come in as others have in some areas and said, \n``No, do not look at our facility. Do not consider us in trying to save \nmoney.'' We said, if closing down Fitzsimons makes sense, it ought to \nbe done. But if it does not, if it is not the most cost-effective \nalternative to save money, then do not do it. And our delegation itself \nasked for studies to indicate whether or not it was economically \nfeasible to keep it open.\n  The objective studies done by the Pentagon independently indicated it \nwas cost effective to keep the facility open. It provides medical \nservices for the entire region.\n  After that objective study was done, questions were again raised. We \nagain asked for a second objective study. That second objective study \ncame back. Again, it identified that it was cost effective to keep this \nfacility open. Fitzsimons was one of those facilities kept open between \nWorld War I and World War II. It was kept open, I believe, because it \nservices an entire region of the country in terms of health care for \nour veterans and for our service men and women. It was kept open \nbetween World War I and between World War II and kept open after World \nWar II and before Korea and kept open after Korea and before Vietnam \nand kept open after Vietnam.\n  When it was put on the closure list, we asked one thing of the \nCommission: to review the independent studies, and if they disagreed \nwith those studies, tell us where they did disagree. Mr. President, \nthey did not do that. All the objective studies that looked at \nFitzsimons indicated it was responsible to keep it open and \nfunctioning. When the Base Closure Commission looked at it, they did \nnot address those studies.\n  Mr. President, this is a mistake. It is a mistake to close the \nfacility. It is not a cost-effective move on the part of the military. \nWhat is more, the Base Closure Commission has never addressed the \nindependent studies and findings that showed it was cost effective.\n  Mr. President, I support the Base Closure Commission. I will vote for \ntheir report. But, Mr. President, I do not agree with all of their \nsuggestions. It will be a sad day when this facility is closed. I am \nhappy, though, to see that there is a positive, significant, \nalternative use for it. It has the broad support of the full delegation \nof Colorado and the broad support of the entire community. But, Mr. \nPresident, I continue to feel it is a mistake for the U.S. military to \nclose a facility that is a most cost-effective alternative to health \ncare needs that they are committed to supply.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I first want to say, when I was in the House \nof Representatives, I supported the nuclear freeze. I also want to say \ninitially, I think the problem in the world today is not nuclear \ntesting, but nuclear weapons.\n  Having said that, I feel it is appropriate for me to comment on the \nmost \n\n[[Page S 12531]]\nrecent issue of the National Journal, the September 2 issue, wherein \nthere was a discussion of a recent debate that occurred on this floor. \nThe debate was on hydronuclear testing and the need for additional \nfunds to support the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons \nstockpile. Mr. President, the Senate ultimately voted to sustain those \nfunds, and I am a strong supporter of the decision that the Senate \nmade.\n  The National Journal noted that the proponents of a strong nuclear \ndeterrent stated that the JASON study team supported some of the \nexperiments that were at issue in the Senate debate.\n  The article also noted that some of my colleagues and the chairman of \nthe JASON study committee believe its findings had been misrepresented.\n  I am not a Ph.D. scientist and I may not be a weapons expert, but I \ncan read English, and I read it very well. If the JASON study findings \ndo not reflect the panel's intent, then the authors did not do a very \ngood job of making their views clear. As I said earlier, we need to get \non with treaty compliant experiments, not nuclear tests. The JASON \nstudy clearly endorsed treaty compliant experiments. I would not \ngenerally look to the JASON's for guidance on nuclear testing or \nstockpile stewardship issues. This is not their area of expertise, and \nthey have not had a credible track record in this area.\n  I do want to say, however, that since the proponents of hydronuclear \nexperiments or treaty compliant experiments have relied heavily on the \nJASON's to push their agenda, it seems appropriate to use their experts \nto challenge their position.\n  Since the debate, I have looked into this matter more deeply. I now \nunderstand the views of some of the experts on the committee and of the \nexperts who provided data to the committee more clearly than I did a \nmonth ago. I have found that the JASON report has been used to \nmisrepresent the views of some of the experts and some of the study \ngroup members. This is not surprising in a highly political report that \nis trying to reach consensus. Sometimes the only way to reach consensus \nis to be unclear, and that lack of clarity can then be used by both \nsides to press their interpretations.\n  I assure you that although there are some in the study group that \noppose hydronuclear experiments, there are also some who support \nhydronuclear experiments.\n  Many of the experts who provided input to the study would disagree \nwith some of its conclusions. I understand that. Nevertheless, the \nreport did clearly support the subcritical experiments with real \nnuclear material, experiments that some have characterized as \nhydronuclear experiments, experiments that fall within the range of \nexperiments being debated that day on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, for those who still question the issues, let me again \nquote from the report. I am reading directly verbatim from the report. \nThis is a quote:\n\n       Underground testing of nuclear weapons at any yield level \n     below that required to initiate boosting is of limited value \n     to the United States. However, experiments involving high \n     explosives and fissionable material that do not reach \n     criticality are useful in improving our understanding of the \n     behavior of weapons materials under relevant physical \n     conditions. They should be included among treaty consistent \n     activities that are discussed more fully in the text.\n\n  Mr. President, that is as clear as the English language can be. If \npeople on the committee want to disagree with the report as it is \nwritten, that is their privilege. But I read from the report a month \nago, and I am reading from it again. The language is very clear. In \nplain English, that clearly supports tests or experiments that \nopponents were trying to prohibit. More importantly, it should be \nunderstood that the JASON study report is a political report, not a \ntechnical report. It was created for political reasons, and its \nconclusions were generally preordained. Using the report as a so-called \nconsensus of nuclear weapons experts is a misrepresentation. There may \nhave been an expert or two on the committee, but that does not mean it \nrepresents the expert opinion on the issue.\n  On the technical level, there is still much for the Senate and the \npublic to evaluate. The technical issues are complex and do not lend \nthemselves easily to public debate. I will, though, Mr. President, do \nthe best I can to make the key issues clear to the Senate and to the \nAmerican public. Bits and pieces of the issue have been addressed in \nvarious studies, and the whole picture has not been laid before the \nCongress.\n  In particular, the loss of confidence that will come from the end of \ntesting has not been adequately reviewed. No one who even superficially \nunderstands the issue will claim that we can maintain the current level \nof confidence in our nuclear weapons system without testing. The \nquestion is how much confidence do we need.\n  When that issue is fully understood by the Congress and the American \npeople, we can then properly assess the value of testing and the need \nfor testing. My view is clear. We must have the utmost confidence in \nthe safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons, and anything we can \ndo to achieve that confidence should be done. Second-class confidence \nis irresponsible and unacceptable in a first-class nation.\n  In the best case, this means we should continue with nuclear testing. \nIn the case we debated last month, it meant getting on with whatever \nexperiments the President was prepared to allow. We must continue to \nexplore this issue. The debate on testing, stewardship, treaty \ncompliant experiments is not over and should not be over until all the \nfacts are out.\n  I look forward to the JASON report being finalized and published. \nThat should help us all understand the basis for the conclusions of the \nstudy group and perhaps clear up some of the controversy on this issue.\n  I also, Mr. President, look forward to the weapons laboratory report \ncalled for in section 3164 of the Senate version of the National \nDefense Authorization Act, the matter that is now before this body. I \nlook forward to it being completed and presented to the Congress. This \nreport promises to be a credible technical report, written by real \nnuclear weapons experts.\n  In the meantime, I urge the President to get on with the stockpile \nstewardship plan that he has developed, including the treaty compliant \nexperiments endorsed by the JASON's and called for in the current test \nban negotiating positions. The $50 million added by the Senate should \nallow these experiments to begin without further delay. It is time for \naction with respect to implementing all elements of our Nation's \nStockpile Stewardship Program.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate very much the managers of this bill \nallowing me to speak out of order, but certainly this is of relevance \nto the matter before this body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12530-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12531-S12532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNDERGROUND NUCLEAR TESTING\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this afternoon at 5 o'clock, the Senate \nwill vote on final passage of the Defense appropriations bill, which \nwill then go to conference. One of the provisions contained in that \nbill, which was added by amendment, I think is worthy of note and has \nnot received significant attention, either by Members of the Senate or \nby the public at large.\n  So I wanted to call it to the attention of both of my colleagues and \nof the public and indicate my strong support for it. It is an amendment \nthat Senator Akaka offered, amendment No. 2406 on behalf of himself and \nSenator Pell. The amendment was adopted by voice vote and puts the \nSenate clearly on record with regard to nuclear testing contemplated by \nthe Republic of France. Let me just read the amendment as it was \nadopted by the Senate before we went out of session earlier in August. \nIt says:\n\n       Sense of the Senate regarding underground nuclear testing.\n       Findings. The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The President of France stated on June 13, 1995, that \n     the Republic of France plans to conduct eight nuclear test \n     explosions over the next several months.\n       (2) The People's Republic of China continues to conduct \n     underground nuclear weapons tests. \n\n[[Page S 12532]]\n\n       (3) The United States, France, Russia, and Great Britain \n     have observed a moratorium on nuclear testing since 1992.\n       (4) A resumption of testing by the Republic of France could \n     result in the disintegration of the current testing \n     moratorium in the renewal of underground testing by other \n     nuclear weapon states.\n       (5) A resumption of nuclear testing by the Republic of \n     France raises serious environmental and health concerns.\n       (6) The United Nations Conference on Disarmament presently \n     is meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, for the purpose of \n     negotiating a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which \n     would halt permanently the practice of conducting nuclear \n     test explosions.\n       (7) Continued underground weapons testing by the Republic \n     of France and the People's Republic of China undermines the \n     efforts of the international community to conclude a CTBT by \n     1996, a goal endorsed by 175 nations at the recently \n     completed NPT Extension and Review Conference (the conference \n     for the extension and review of the Nuclear Nonproliferation \n     Treaty).\n\n  Therefore, ``It is the sense of the Senate that the Republic of \nFrance and the People's Republic of China should abide by the current \ninternational moratorium on nuclear test explosions and refrain from \nconducting underground nuclear tests in advance of the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty.''\n  That is the end of the resolution adopted here in the Senate before \nwe went out on recess, Mr. President. As I am sure my colleagues know, \nthe People's Republic of China has gone ahead during this last month \nand conducted one additional underground test in contravention of the \nsentiments expressed in this resolution. The Republic of France is now \ncontemplating and intending, as I understand it, to proceed with eight \nadditional nuclear test explosions over the next several months.\n  I believe it is very important that the Senate is on record as being \nopposed to these nuclear explosions. And I felt it was important to \ncall to the attention of Members of the Senate and the public that this \nwas unanimously agreed to by the Senate as part of this Defense \nappropriations bill, which will be finally voted by the Senate at 5 \nthis afternoon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to engage the distinguished Senator \nfrom Virginia, the chairman of the Subcommittee on AirLand Forces, in a \nbrief colloquy regarding the Army's Crusader program. Senator Warner, I \nnote that the committee has fully supported the Army's priority \ndevelopment of the Advanced Field Artillery System, Crusader program \nand I commend the committee for its action. However, I am concerned by \nthe actions of the House National Security Committee relative to the \nliquid propellant [LP] gun aspect of the Crusader program. I have been \nled to believe that the Army recognized the performance advantages of \nthe LP gun and that the Army in recognition of those performance \nenhancements accepted the risks associated with LP development. Am I \ncorrect in that understanding?\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct. The range and volume of fire \nadvantages of LP would greatly increase the performance and \ncapabilities of the Army's field artillery.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I am concerned that the House has written several pages \nof bill language which would legislate noncontractual performance goals \nwhich might add schedule risk and might jeopardize the schedule \nflexibility critical to the successful management of any development \neffort. I am also concerned that the House position appears to prejudge \nthe failure of the LP gun while not adequately considering the risk nor \nproviding comparable oversight for the Army's backup technology, \nunicharge.\n  Mr. WARNER. The committee staff has reviewed the Army's Crusader \nprogram and LP development in detail. LP development is receiving \nintensive management by both the contractor and the Army. I understand \nthe Senator's concern that the House position legislating performance \ngoals and decision schedules might exceed the oversight needs of this \nprogram. I do believe, however, that we should maintain adequate \ncongressional oversight over both LP and unicharge development as it \naffects this important Army program. I would point out that the Army is \njust completing the first year of an 8\\1/2\\ year development program \nfor the Crusader. We are pushing the limits of technology in an \nentirely new area with the research and development of liquid \npropellant for Crusader. I believe that the potential advantages of LP \njustify the risks associated with its development. We will continue to \nwatch this program carefully. We expect that the development of LP will \nbe successful and that the Crusader will be produced and fielded on \nschedule. If, on the other hand, the technology challenges are too \ndifficult, and LP simply doesn't work, then we won't buy it. However, \nin the meantime, I believe we should allow the Army's developmental \nefforts to proceed.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator would yield, I would point out that the \nNavy has a requirement to improve its naval surface fire support and \nhas a cooperative agreement with the Army to monitor and leverage off \nof the liquid propellant gun development. The successful development of \nLP offers great opportunities for the Navy in this important area and \nin as much as the House legislation serves as a detriment to that \neffort, I would be happy to work to resolve this issue in conference.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I want to thank the Senator from Virginia and the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts for their understanding of this matter and for their \ncommitment to work to resolve this in conference.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise now to urge Senators who have \namendments to the Defense authorization bill to come to the floor and \ntake up their amendments. We are supposed to pass this bill today. If \nthey wait until this afternoon, then they are all stacked in at the \nlast minute and it is going to be very difficult to handle.\n  I urge them to come on out. We have been here all morning starting at \n10 o'clock, and we have approved a few things. But there is a lot more \nto be done. I want them to come and take up the amendments and let us \nget them acted on one way or the other.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I would like to say we are making good \nprogress, working back and forth on both sides. I think with a little \ncooperation here and a little cooperation there, this whole proposition \nmight move much more expeditiously than we had earlier anticipated.\n  I thank my friend and colleague from South Carolina for his usual \ngood cooperation, and we are going to be working very hard the rest of \nthe day to try to eliminate any and all barriers to cut down the time \ndramatically and probably come to a resolution, hopefully, on the \nauthorization and the appropriations bills early this evening, and I \n\n[[Page S 12533]]\nemphasize the word ``early'' this evening, which I think would be good \nnews for all.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2429\n\n       (Purpose: To amend the hydronuclear provisions of S. 1026)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], for himself and Mr. \n     Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered 2429.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of the Act, the \n     provision dealing with hydronuclear experiments is qualified \n     in the following respect:\n       (c) Limitations.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed as \n     an authorization to conduct hydronuclear tests. Furthermore, \n     nothing in this Act shall be construed as amending or \n     repealing the requirements of Section 507 of Public Law 102-\n     377.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the preceding amendments \nare set aside.\n  The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, this is a matter that myself, Senator \nHatfield, and many other Senators have put in a great deal of time and \neffort on. I think this is a compromise amendment that has a chance of \nbeing accepted on both sides. Therefore, we have set aside the hour and \na half, if I remember the figures correctly, that we agreed to in the \nunanimous-consent request. In any event, at the present time I yield \nsuch time as is assigned to me in the unanimous-consent agreement for \nthe following remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, before the August recess, a number of \namendments to the Defense authorization bill were debated at length. \nOne of these was an amendment proposed by myself, Senator Hatfield, and \nnine other Senators to delete the $50 million add-on to the bill for \nhydronuclear weapons testing. While that amendment failed, I strongly \nfeel that the Senate should revisit the issue in a different form so \nthat it may be clarified in light of President Clinton's recent \ndecision to forgo such tests.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I would emphasize that the amendment that I \nhave just offered and has just been read by the clerk is an amendment \nthat I believe goes a long way in clarifying the situation for all \nconcerned. And I firmly believe that it is simply a restatement, a \npunctuation mark, if you will, with the wording that was agreed to on \nmatters in this regard in the Defense authorization bill as it came out \nof the Armed Services Committee.\n  The Defense authorization in its present form contains section 3135, \na provision authorizing $50 million for preparation for the \ncommencement of hydronuclear tests. As my colleagues may know, the \nUnited States has been negotiating a comprehensive test ban treaty with \nthe world's nuclear powers for the past 2 years. President Clinton's \nAugust 11 announcement to push for an international agreement by 1996 \nthat would prohibit these types of nuclear detonations was an important \ndevelopment toward the goal of halting the spread of nuclear weapons \naround the world.\n  I was particularly encouraged yet this morning to learn that the \nFrench President has now indicated a signal to cut dramatically short \nthe full-scale underground nuclear testing that the French Government \nhad proposed in the South Pacific. Things are coming together perhaps \nso that we can have a meeting of the minds.\n  After over 1,100--and I emphasize 1,100--nuclear tests conducted by \nthe United States over 50 years, the U.S. nuclear stockpile is the \nsafest and most reliable on Earth. Computer simulation backed up with \nthe data from these tests, not additional detonations, can maintain \nthis high degree of confidence in the future. But a nonnuclear nation \nlooking to obtain superpower status in the form of a nuclear bomb is \nunlikely to develop such a capability without the means to test these \nunproven weapons. A truly comprehensive and verifiable test ban treaty \nwill be an effective tool at closing membership in the nuclear club.\n  My amendment simply clarifies that the language in section 3135 is \nfor test preparation--that is how it reads now, preparation--and not \nauthority to violate the existing U.S. testing moratorium policy. My \namendment reaffirms the congressional review process for new tests \nrequired by the 1992 Energy and Water Appropriations Act by adding the \nfollowing simple and straightforward paragraph to the bill:\n  I quote:\n\n       Nothing in this act shall be construed as an authorization \n     to conduct hydronuclear tests. Furthermore, nothing in this \n     act shall be construed as amending or repealing the \n     requirements of section 507 of Public Law 102-377.\n\n  Unlike my previous amendment on hydronuclear testing, this amendment \ndoes not affect--I emphasize--does not affect the $50 million \nauthorization in the bill presently. The Department of Energy would be \nallowed to spend the funds but only for the purpose stated in the bill, \nthat being test preparation. The intent of the bill language would be \nmade clearer by my amendment and brought into line with the \nadministration's stated policy. The funds can be spent on Department of \nEnergy stockpile stewardship activities but the authorization of funds \nin no way should be construed as a congressional authorization to \nconduct a test. That prerogative, as I mentioned earlier, is reserved \nunder a reporting requirement contained in the original Hatfield-Exon-\nMitchell provision to the 1992 energy and water appropriations bill, \nwherein the President must report to Congress and seek its approval for \nany new tests and provide the safety or reliability justification for \nsuch tests.\n\n  There is no reason why the United States should restart nuclear \nweapons testing. To do so would be expensive, end up scuttling the \ncomprehensive test ban negotiations, and, in a self-defeating turn, \nencourage other nations to pursue obtaining a nuclear capability. The \npreeminent nuclear weapons experts in America--if not the world--issued \non August 3 of this year a study on whether we should continue nuclear \nweapons testing. The study, called the JASON study, was headed by \nSidney Drell of Stanford and was written by 14 top scientists, \nincluding representatives from each of the national laboratories \nresponsible for the stewardship and maintenance of these weapons. Their \nconclusion was unequivocal: There is no need to resume testing, \nincluding the hydronuclear tests discussed in this bill.\n  Among the JASON report findings:\n\n       The United States can, today, have high confidence in the \n     safety, reliability, and performance margins of the nuclear \n     weapons that are designated to remain in the enduring \n     stockpile:\n\n  A further quote from that report:\n\n       A pervasive case has not been made for the utility of \n     hydronuclear tests for detecting small changes in the \n     performance margins for current U.S. weapons.\n\n  Further quote:\n\n       Underground testing of nuclear weapons at any yield below \n     that required to initiate boosting is of limited value to the \n     United States.\n\n  Further quote:\n\n       [Our] findings . . . are consistent with U.S. agreement to \n     enter into a comprehensive test ban [CTBT] of unending \n     duration, that includes a standard ``supreme national \n     interest clause.''\n\n  Mr. President, these are findings of the JASON report authors--the \nforemost nuclear experts in the United States. They are saying, they \nare telling and they are advising two things of primary importance: \nFirst, that the United States does not need to test this year or the \nnext or into the foreseeable future in order to maintain a safe and \nreliable nuclear arsenal. Second, they are saying that a comprehensive \ntest ban is in our national security interests.\n  I find it ironic that proponents of the fast-tracked national missile \ndefense system try to justify the estimated $48 billion project by \nsaying we can never be sure what rogue nation may develop nuclear \nwarheads in the next century and, therefore, we must protect ourselves. \nA comprehensive test ban is an effective way of stemming this \nproliferation tide. It is a means by which to limit the have-nots from \ntrying to find superpower status in the form of a nuclear warhead. A \nnation is unlikely to develop a nuclear capability with any degree of \nconfidence if it cannot test the weapons. By the United States showing \nleadership and announcing \n\n[[Page S 12534]]\nthat all tests should be banned under a comprehensive test ban treaty, \nthe goal of nuclear nonproliferation has been greatly enhanced. Let us \nkeep it that way.\n  There is another reason why a comprehensive test ban treaty is \nbeneficial for the United States. No nation has tested more than the \nUnited States and has more advanced computer technology than we do. A \ncomprehensive test ban will lock in the technological advantages that \nwe possess over the rest of the world.\n  But this discussion about a comprehensive test ban treaty is all \nprospective. The negotiations are ongoing and no agreement has been \nreached as of yet. All the more reason for the Congress not to \ninterject itself capriciously into the question of mandating weapons \ntesting of any kind.\n  The issue at hand is my amendment and whether the words in section \n3135 of the bill mean what they say. My amendment does not touch the \n$50 million add-on in the bill for test preparation. It simply \nreiterates that ``preparation'' is different than an actual decision to \ntest.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. I will revisit \nthis issue at a later time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Bingaman and \nSenator Lieberman be added as original cosponsors of the Exon \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Pursuant to a previous discussion I had with my distinguished friend \nand colleague from South Carolina, the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, I think at this time we may be in a position to proceed with \nthe adoption of a series of amendments that I understand have been \ncleared on both sides.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, on this particular amendment, I want to \nsay we are looking at the amendment. I ask unanimous consent that it be \nlaid aside until we can go to other things and then reconsider it at a \nlater time during the day. I am pleased to go the matters that have \nbeen agreed upon.\n  Mr. EXON. I agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. May I inquire of my colleague from South Carolina if he is \nprepared, as a manager of the bill, to proceed with the 20-odd \namendments that I understand have been offered and have been cleared on \nboth sides. We are prepared to take those matters up now, if it is the \nwill of the chairman.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, of those that have been cleared, it is \nagreeable for us to take those up at this time. I would like for us to \nget the staff here to see about that.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\nSection 551 of S. 1026--The Determination of Whereabouts and Status of \n                            Missing Persons\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the fiscal year 1995 National Defense \nAuthorization Act directed the Secretary of Defense to review current \nlaw related to missing service personnel and report to Congress on \nrecommended changes. In addition to the recommendations made in the \nmandated report, the Department of Defense accommodated the committee's \nconcerns by agreeing to several additional provisions, which are \nincluded in this bill, that went considerably beyond the scope of the \ninitial recommendations.\n  In the provisions of this bill, the committee has gone as far as the \nCongress should on this issue. I believe the committee and the \nDepartment of Defense have agreed on a course of action that will \nimprove current procedures without imposing a new and cumbersome \nbureaucracy on the Department, the Services, and commanders in the \nfield.\n  However, the report language accompanying the bill does not \naccurately reflect the intention of the bill language in one key \naspect. The recommended provision would not prohibit the Department of \nDefense from declaring a serviceman dead when there are obvious \nindications that he is indeed dead, including the passage of time. \nContrary to the report language, the bill language does not confer \nimmortality on MIA's. Further, I do not share the editorial \ncharacterization of the current accounting system as insensitive and \nunresponsive. Whereas this may have been true many years ago, the \nDepartment of Defense and the Services have since taken extensive \nmeasures to make the system sensitive, responsive, and most important, \nworkable.\n  When the bill before us goes to conference, I will steadfastly \nsupport the Senate position and oppose the provisions in the House bill \nwhich, in my view, are unwise and unworkable. I encourage my colleagues \nin the strongest possible terms to do likewise.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my colleague, the distinguished senior \nSenator from Nebraska, will take up an amendment by Senator Harkin.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2430\n\n (Purpose: To increase the amount provided for the Civil Air Patrol by \n                              $5,000,000)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Harkin, I offer an \namendment which will reduce and refocus the reduction of the bill to \nthe Civil Air Patrol budget from a $5 million reduction to a $2.9 \nmillion reduction. This amendment would effectively speed up the \nongoing reorganization of the Civil Air Patrol so that the savings plan \nfor 1997 would be achieved by 1996.\n  I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection the pending amendments will \nbe set aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], for Mr. Harkin, for \n     himself, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Robb, Mr. Heflin, and \n     Mr. Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered 2430.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 72, between lines 18 and 19, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 305. INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR THE CIVIL AIR PATROL.\n\n       (a) Increase.--(1) The amount of funds authorized to be \n     appropriated by this Act for operation and maintenance of the \n     Air Force for the Civil Air Patrol Corporation is hereby \n     increased by $5,000,000.\n       (2) The amount authorized to be appropriated for operation \n     and maintenance for the Civil Air Patrol Corporation under \n     paragraph (1) is in addition to any other funds authorized to \n     be appropriated under this Act for that purpose.\n       (b) Offsetting Reduction.--The amount authorized to be \n     appropriated under this Act for Air Force support of the \n     Civil Air Patrol is hereby reduced by $2,900,000. The amount \n     of the reduction shall be allocated among funds authorized to \n     be appropriated for Air Force personnel supporting the Civil \n     Air Patrol and for Air Force operation and maintenance \n     support for the Civil Air Patrol.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on behalf of my esteemed colleagues \nSenators Shelby, Campbell, Robb, Heflin, Bingaman, and myself, I offer \nan amendment to restore the cuts in the Civil Air Patrol budget. The \nSenate defense authorization bill S. 1026 cuts the Civil Air Patrol \n[CAP] operations and maintenance by $5 million, from $14.7 million to \n$9.7 million, a 34 percent reduction. This heavy cut would severely \nlimit the CAP's capability to carry out its search and rescue missions, \nemergency air transport, counterdrug surveillance, and other important \nfunctions.\n  The Harkin-Shelby-Campbell-Robb-Heflin-Bingaman bipartisan amendment \nto the fiscal year 1996 defense authorization bill restores the CAP \nbudget to the amount approved by the House, the original $14.7 million.\n  The Civil Air Patrol is a nonprofit corporation designated as an \nauxiliary of the Air Force by public law in 1948. It is mostly made up \nof over 50,000 volunteers who are mainly ex-Air Force personnel, and \nwho often must fly over large areas of country in their missions of \nmercy. It is to the credit of the CAP that their volunteers relieve the \nGovernment of expense such that only 10 percent of the CAP budget need \nbe used to reimburse the volunteers. Furthermore, the CAP is undergoing \na reorganization to replace active duty Air \n\n[[Page S 12535]]\nForce personnel with retired fliers who receive only one-half their \nformer pay. This will save taxpayers about $3 million. Additionally, \nthe Air Force active duty personnel are being replaced by civilians at \nthe CAP headquarters, so the CAP budget reflects an increase equivalent \nto the decrease in the Air Force budget used to pay for headquarters \npersonnel. These reorganizational changes were misinterpreted in a \nGeneral Accounting Office report to justify cutting the CAP. The \nHarkin-Shelby-Campbell-Robb-Heflin-Bingaman amendment corrects the \nwell-intentioned but misguided cuts in the CAP. The CAP is invaluable \nto our country, and performs its missions much more inexpensively than \ncould be done by Government.\n  Because the Air Force personnel are being replaced by retirees and \nother civilians, the active duty Air Force personnel and operations and \nmaintenance budget should be reduced by $2.9 million. This reflects the \nsavings to the taxpayer that the recent reorganization attains.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I support this amendment to cut the level \nof support for the Civil Air Patrol in the Air Force operations and \nmaintenance and personnel accounts by $2.9 million and restore $5 \nmillion to the Civil Air Patrol Corporation budget. The $2.9 million \ncut from the administration's request for this program will reduce the \namount of military resources unnecessarily dedicated to its overhead \nand administration.\n  Furthermore, although I believe that this program is noble, its \nmilitary benefits are negligible. The primary mission of this program, \nsearch and rescue of downed civilian pilots, would more appropriately \nbe funded through the budget of the Department of Transportation or \nanother civilian agency. I urge the administration and the Congress to \nexplore alternative funding for this program in the future to ensure \nits decreased reliance upon the Department of Defense.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I believe this amendment has been cleared by \nthe other side.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. We support the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2430) was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask to have my personal view reflected in the Record. I \nhad occasion to visit Civil Air Patrol installations in several places \nin my State and elsewhere. I also had a brief service with them during \nthe early stages of World War II. I think it is a highly useful and \nproductive organization, helping many of our young people in their \nfirst introduction to aviation.\n  I strongly support the Civil Air Patrol.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2431\n\n(Purpose: To increase the authorization of appropriations for operation \nand maintenance for the Air Force Reserve by $10,000,000, and to offset \n   that increase by reducing the authorization of appropriations for \n operation and maintenance for Defense-wide activities by $10,000,000)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, Mr. Thurmond, I offer an amendment which would \nadjust funding for civilian personnel in the Air Force Reserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] for Mr. Thurmond, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2431.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 69, line 25, decrease the amount by $10,000,000.\n       On page 70, line 5, strike out ``$1,472,947,000'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``$1,482,947,000''.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, this amendment would adjust the funding \nfor civilian personnel under strength in the Air Force Reserve.\n  The Department of Defense made an error in verifying the degree to \nwhich various accounts were overfunded. In response to my inquiry, the \nDepartment reconsidered its report and determined the figure for the \nAir Force Reserve should be $3 million in reductions, not $13 million \nas previously reported. This amendment would restore $10 million of the \n$13 million to the Air Force Reserve and reduce DOD funding by $10 \nmillion.\n  I thank the Chair, and yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. This amendment has been cleared by both sides.\n  Mr. EXON. The amendment has been cleared on both sides.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2431) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2432\n\n   (Purpose: To provide $9,500,000 for the Joint Seismic Program and \n                        Global Seismic Network)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Glenn, I offer an \namendment to authorize $9.5 million for seismic monitoring to detect \nnuclear explosions. These funds would be used to continue the operation \nof global seismographic network operated by the consortium of American \nUniversity.\n  I believe this amendment has been cleared on the other side of the \naisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], for Mr. Glenn, for \n     himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Pell, and Mr. Moynihan, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 2432.\n\n  Mr. EXON. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 49, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 224. JOINT SEISMIC PROGRAM AND GLOBAL SEISMIC NETWORK.\n\n       To the extent provided in appropriations Acts, $9,500,000 \n     of the unobligated balance of funds available to the Air \n     Force for research, development, test, and evaluation for \n     fiscal year 1995 shall be available for continuation of the \n     Joint Seismic Program and Global Seismic Network.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, the proliferation of nuclear weapons \ncontinues to be one of the most serious threats to national security, \nwhich underscores the need for the United States to maintain an \neffective capability to detect and identify clandestine nuclear tests. \nThe challenge for seismic monitoring is the detection and \nidentification of events of small magnitude. To meet this challenge it \nis necessary to acquire regional data not less than 1,000 kilometers \nfrom a test.\n  For many years, a consortium of universities has operated a multiple-\nuse, global seismographic network that has been supported with funds \nfrom the Department of Defense and the National Science Foundation. \nThese facilities represent a small but significant investment by the \nU.S. Government, offer effective and needed nuclear test monitoring \ncapabilities worldwide, and enhance regional coverage in areas not \nadequately covered by National Technical Means [NTM].\n  Data provided by this global seismographic network can be used to \nlocate seismic events, discriminate natural versus explosive sources, \nand estimate magnitude and/or yield--all of which are critical in \ndetection and identification of clandestine nuclear tests. Enhancing \naccuracy of event location is particularly important in greatly \nreducing the area which must be investigated through costly on-site \ninspections or the use of NTM. The data obtained from this network thus \ncomplement, rather than compete with, data obtained from NTM.\n  This type of information will be invaluable in helping our Government \nto verify a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. We are already well \ninto the evolution of the post-cold-war world, and one unpleasant fact \nof life about such a world is that professional test ban monitors no \nlonger have the \n\n[[Page S 12536]]\nluxury of simply gathering data about activities at certain fixed, \nwell-characterized sites. Now the problem has gotten more complex: we \nare increasingly concerned about small, low-yield test explosions, and \nwe are facing a verification challenge that is truly global in scope. \nGiven the global distribution of significant nongovernmental seismic \nmonitoring capabilities, it is only prudent for us to exploit whatever \nresources are available and appropriate to get the job done.\n  The network is administered by a consortium which today consists of \nover 80 research institutions and affiliates around the globe. The \nNational Science and Technology Council [NSTC] is developing a long-\nterm funding plan for the GSN and JSP. Because of delays in the NSTC \nprocess funding recommendations were not included in the \nadministration's fiscal year 1996 budget request, but are being \nincorporated in the fiscal year 1997 budget request. In the meantime, \nthis action is needed to ensure continuation of these important \nprograms.\n  My amendment specifies that $9,500,000 of prior year funds from the \nDefense Support Program which are available as a result of the omnibus \nreprogramming shall be available for continuation of the Global \nSeismographic Network [GSN] and Joint Seismic Program [JSP]. This is \nmaintained by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research [AFOSR] in PE \n601102F, project 2309.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this technical amendment is to fix an \nincorrect authorization level for construction of a mission essential \nSpecial Operations Forces Group Headquarters at Fort Bragg, NC.\n  This project was authorized by the Senate Armed Services Committee at \nthe original, incorrect estimate of $2,600,000.\n  As background, the U.S. Special Operations Command--or USSOCOM, as it \nis called--requested in its fiscal year 1996 milcon budget a Group HQ \noriginally estimated to cost $2,600,000.\n  Based upon that erroneous estimate, the administration requested and \nthe House Appropriations Committee appropriated that amount.\n  The correct project estimate is $3,900,000. The cost increase is \nattributable to two key factors; a failure to account for the area cost \nfactor for construction in the Fort Bragg area and the realization that \nspecial construction requirements are necessary.\n  Equipped with the new, accurate estimate, the Senate Military \nConstruction Subcommittee, approved $3,900,000 for the project.\n  My amendment will fix the discrepancy between the Senate Military \nConstruction Subcommittee's appropriation and the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee's authorization.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this is a technical correction to the \nfunding level of a project included in the President's budget request. \nI believe this amendment has been cleared.\n  Mr. EXON.

Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering would \nauthorize $5 million from within the Army research, development, test \nand evaluation account to continue development of the depressed \naltitude guided gun round [DAGGR] system.\n  DAGGR is a surface-to-air weapon that could provide an effective \ndefense against low-altitude threats, both in rear areas and for \nmaneuver forces in forward areas. It has an all-weather capability, and \ncould be mounted on either standard trucks or an armored \n\n[[Page S 12537]]\nchassis such as the AGS or M113A. DAGGR would integrate an existing \nradar guided 60 millimeter gun round, developed by the Navy, with an \ninterferometric radar, developed by the Army.\n  As currently envisioned, DAGGR could address mortars, short range \nrockets, unmanned aerial vehicles, cruise missiles, and helicopter \ndelivered air-to-ground missiles. The Army currently has little or no \ndirect capability against these threats\n  Mr. President, this program is not part of the Army budget. However, \nthe committee was contacted by the Army after markup and apprised of \ntheir strong interest in the program.

Let me be clear, this amendment \ndoes not increase funding for JPATS procurement--it simply allows the \nAir Force to procure this new trainer at a more efficient rate. \nAdditionally, my colleagues should know that this change has been \ncoordinated with the Air Force.\n  Again, I thank Senator Thurmond and my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle for their assistance in clearing this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER.

If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2437) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2438\n\n(Purpose: To provide $15,000,000 (under the line item for the M1 Abrams \ntank series (MYP)) for procurement of direct support electronic system \ntest sets (DSESTS) test program sets for the M1 Abrams series tanks and \n                 the Bradley infantry fighting vehicle)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Heflin and Senator \nShelby, I offer an amendment which would shift some funds within the \nArmy's budget to buy more software for direct support electronic system \ntests.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], for Mr. Heflin, for \n     himself and Mr. Shelby, proposes an amendment numbered 2438.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 16, line 20, strike out ``$1,532,964,000'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``$1,547,964,000''.\n       On page 69, line 25, strike out ``$10,060,162,000'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``$10,045,162,000.''\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, this amendment will provide funds for test \nequipment for the U.S. Army.\n  The Army plans to field a number of modernized combat vehicles in the \nyears ahead including the M1A2, the upgraded Bradley, the new breacher, \nand the new light tank. Unfortunately, the Army budget has been reduced \nto the point where the Army is unable to \n\n[[Page S 12538]]\nfund the development of the test equipment required to support these \nnew vehicles. However, it makes no sense to field new vehicles without \nsimultaneously fielding the required support equipment.\n  The Army's acquisition decision memorandum dated March 30, 1995, \ndirects the continued use of DSESTS for the ASM fleet. Furthermore, \nthere is a standing Army requirement for new test program sets to \nsupport these vehicles. I therefore ask the support of my colleagues in \nadding $15 million to the ASM budget for the acquisition of DSESTS test \nprogram sets needed to support our modern combat systems.\n  Let me say now that I am not pleased by the source of the funds used \nto pay for this amendment. I stand firmly against raiding the readiness \naccounts to fund procurement programs. In fact, I would not offer this \namendment if it were not for the fact that not purchasing the equipment \nwill cost the readiness accounts even more. If we do not buy this \nequipment, the combat units will be forced to send broken equipment \nback to the depot rather than repairing it in the field. This will add \nmillions in additional maintenance costs each year. Purchasing this \nequipment will save much needed readiness dollars.\n  That being said, I hope that in conference the committee will be able \nto provide an alternative source of funding for this important test \nequipment.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the Army believes this additional software \nwould help save operation and maintenance funds, since testing will be \navoided, and shipping equipment to depots, when the action is not \nnecessary.\n  I believe this is a very worthy amendment. I understand it has been \ncleared on the other side.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2438) was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2439\n\n    (Purpose: To amend the effective date for the authority to pay \ntransitional compensation for dependents of members of the Armed Forces \n                     separated for dependent abuse)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment on behalf \nof the Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] entitled ``Spousal \nAbuse.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for Mr. Domenici, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2439.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 277, after line 25, insert the following:\n       (b) Effective Date for Program Authority.--Section \n     554(b)(1) of the National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 1994 (107 Stat. 1666; 10 U.S.C. 1059 note) is \n     amended by striking out ``the date of the enactment of this \n     Act--'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``April 1, 1994--''.\n       On page 277, beginning on line 21, strike out ``: \n     Clarification of entitlement''.\n       On page 277, line 23, insert ``(a) Clarification of \n     Entitlement.--before ``Section''.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I offer a technical correction to \nsection 1059 of title X, United States Code, which provides the \nauthority to the Secretary of Defense to provide transitional benefits \nfor abused military spouses and their children. I understand that my \namendment has been accepted on both sides, and I want to thank the \nchairman and ranking member for their support.\n  I would like to take just a few brief moments to refresh my \ncolleagues memories about this issue. Members will recall that in the \nfiscal year 1993 Defense authorization bill I offered an amendment to \nprovide up to 50 percent of the retirement pay of a military member to \nhis spouse and children if that member were dishonorably discharged \nfrom the service for spouse or child abuse. That amendment was accepted \nby this committee and it had the full support of both the chairman and \nranking member. I am very proud of that amendment, Mr. President. Today \nabused military spouses and their children have a way out.\n  There was such a recognized need for that amendment that the fiscal \nyear 1994 Defense authorization bill included language that provided \nthe Secretary of Defense with this authority to make \ntransitional benefits for up to 3 years payable on a force-wide basis \nto any military spouse or child whose member was dishonorably \ndischarged from the service for spouse or child abuse.\n\n  By the fiscal year 1995 Defense authorization bill, the Department of \nDefense had not implemented the language from the fiscal year 1994 \nbill. When the bill came to the floor, I offered an amendment to make \nthe fiscal year 1994 language mandatory and to provide commissary and \nother benefits that were not included in the fiscal year 1994 language.\n  On July 1, 1994, during the consideration of the Defense \nauthorization bill, in a colloquy with Senator Nunn I informed \nSenators, ``Frankly, I was going to try to make this mandatory in the \noriginal amendment, but I am not doing that because I have assurance of \nthe Chairman that he is going to join me here on the floor urging that \nthe military take care of this responsibility.'' Senator Nunn did that.\n  On July 7, 1994, Assistant Secretary of Defense Dorn, sent a letter \nto Chairman Nunn stating that the DOD ``intends to implement \ntransitional compensation, authorized by the fiscal year 1994 Defense \nAuthorization Act, on October 1, 1994, with coverage retroactive to \nApril 1, 1994.''\n  Despite Secretary Dorn's letter, DOD did not implement the fiscal \nyear 1994 language until January 25, 1995, and they only made benefit \npayments retroactive to October 1994, not April 1994 as they committed.\n  I wrote to Assistant Secretary Dorn on February 9, 1995, expressing \nmy extreme displeasure and informing him that the only reason we \nwithdrew our amendment to the fiscal year 1995 DOD authorization bill \nwas because the DOD gave the staff of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee assurance that the transitional benefits would be retroactive \nto April 1994.\n  Assistant Secretary Dorn responded on March 6, 1995. Most \nimportantly, he said, ``As you correctly stated in your letter, the DOD \nmade a commitment, and we do plan to take the appropriate actions to \nrectify the situation. My staff is preparing the request to Congress \nasking for a technical change in the language that will allow us to \nmake retroactive payments to April 1, 1994.''\n  Assistant Secretary Dorn submitted the request to both the House \nNational Security Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee for \ninclusion in the fiscal year 1996 Defense authorization bill. The House \nNational Security Committee included the technical correction in \nsection 556 of their bill. My amendment achieves the same objective.\n  Mr. President, I have been working on this issue for 4 years. Every \nyear it seems that there is always something else standing in the way. \nIt took a few years to convince the DOD to acknowledge the problems \nthey face in this area, and they were very reluctant to follow the \nCongress' leadership and direction.\n  Last year, I was informed that the DOD was poised to implement the \nprogram. A letter was sent to then Chairman Nunn on July 7, 1994, \nstating the program would be implemented and that it would be \nretroactive to April 1, 1994. It took the DOD a half year to implement \nthe program after I withdrew my amendment, and that was already after a \n1-year delay. When they did implement the program, it was only \nretroactive until October 1, 1994; a full half-year later than the date \ncommitted on me and to the Senate Armed Services Committee in the July \n7, 1994 letter from Assistant Secretary Dorn to then Chairman Nunn.\n  For whatever reason, the DOD did not honor their commitment to the \ncommittee, and my amendment makes sure that the commitment is honored. \nI appreciate the support of my colleagues. Mr. President, I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this amendment establishes the effective \n\n[[Page S 12539]]\n  date of the transitional spouse abuse payments as April 1, 1994. This \namendment, it is my understanding, has been accepted on both sides.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I think this is a very worthy amendment \noffered by Senator Domenici. We have accepted this on this side and I \nurge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The \n     report shall include recommendations of the Secretary on \n     methods for ensuring the expeditious and cost-effective \n     transfer or lease of facilities referred to in paragraph (1) \n     of subsection (a) to communities referred to in paragraph (1) \n     for reuse by such communities.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, as you know, several communities have been \naffected by the recent base closures and base realignments. I have been \nworking with these communities in my State, trying to assist them to \nmake these transitions as smooth as possible.\n  For nearly 50 years the Pueblo Depot Activity [PDA] in Pueblo, CO, \nwas an integral part of the U.S. Army's system of supply and storage \ndepots. In 1988, however, the Pueblo Depot Activity was designated for \nrealignment. Since this base currently stores chemical weapons, the \nArmy does not plan to transfer ownership of any of the unused lands or \nbuildings at the Pueblo Depot Activity until the destruction of \nchemical weapons is complete. According to the Army, this would occur \nat the earliest in 9 years, fully 16 years after it wad designated for \nrealignment and eventual closure.\n  Despite the fact that the PDA was slated under the law for \nrealignment, it was not planned for closure. Consequently, many \nprograms available to other communities whose bases are to be closed \nare not available to communities like Pueblo. Under the study required \nby the amendment, the Secretary of Defense must study the assistance \navailable to communities in the vicinity of Department of Defense \nfacilities co-located with continuing chemical stockpile and chemical \ndemilitarization operations where the facility is subject to closure, \nrealignment or reutilization. My hope is that this study will continue \nthe efforts of the Army and the city of Pueblo to work together to find \nthe best possible solutions for reuse of the Pueblo Depot Activity.\n  Current plans call for new incineration plants to be built at each \nchemical weapons storage site at a cost of billions of dollars to U.S. \ntaxpayers. In my view, it makes sense to study first the cost \neffectiveness of the transportation of neutralized and unneutralized \nchemical weapons to a few centrally located chemical weapons \ndestruction facilities. The amendment I offer today directs the \nSecretary of Defense to conduct a study to assess the risk associated \nwith transportation of the unitary stockpile, both neutralized and \nunneutralized, within the continental United States.\n  I especially would like to recognize the work of Mel Takaki and Chuck \nFinley of the Pueblo Depot Activity \n\n[[Page S 12540]]\nDevelopment Authority. They have worked hard for the community of \nPueblo during this realignment process.\n  Mr. President, the study proposed in this amendment offered by \nSenator Campbell and myself will make an important contribution to the \nresolution of a number of problems faced by communities in the vicinity \nof Defense Department facilities co-located with continuing chemical \nstockpile and chemical demilitarization operations.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I would like to thank my Colorado \ncolleague, Senator Brown, for proposing this amendment of which I am a \ncosponsor.\n  The city of Pueblo faces a dual burden from the chemical weapons \nstockpile at the Pueblo Depot. First, Pueblo's citizens must cope with \na controversial and complicated chemical demilitarization effort. \nSecond, as the depot was realigned in 1988, Pueblo must deal with \nfinding ways to profitably reuse excess facilities.\n  Unfortunately, despite years of effort by the depot's reuse \ncommission, the reuse process is still blocked. People like Mel Takaki, \nChuck Finley, and many others worked hard to find users who would be \nwilling to pay for space at the depot's buildings, and they have some \ntakers. They still cannot come to a satisfactory agreement with the \nArmy on leasing the depot's facilities--it seems mostly because of \nuncertainty about the needs of the demilitarization process.\n  There are not many communities that face this type of situation. \nThere are only eight chemical weapons stockpile sties in the United \nStates. All this amendment does is require the Defense Secretary to let \nus know that he understands the unique problems faced by Pueblo and \nother communities in the vicinity of chemical weapons stockpile sites. \nFor those sites that, like Pueblo, also involve closed or realigned \nmilitary installations, the Secretary would also give citizens in those \ncommunities some ideas on how to move forward with reusing those \nfacilities.\n  This is a simple amendment, and it should not require much work at \nthe Defense Department, but it will go a long way toward addressing \nissues that concern citizens living near stockpile facilities. I hope \nthat the Senate and the conferees will accept this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the amendment would require the Department \nof Defense to conduct a study on the risks of transporting the unitary \nchemical stockpile within the United States, and assistance that would \nbe available to the communities surrounding the chemical weapons \nstockpiles that will be closed when destruction of the stockpile is \ncompleted.\n  I understand this amendment has been cleared.\n  Mr. EXON. It has been cleared on this side of the aisle, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. WARNER. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2441) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. EXON.

DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL MARITIME CENTER.\n\n       (a) Designation of National Maritime Center.--The NAUTICUS \n     building, located at one Waterside Drive, Norfolk, Virginia, \n     shall be known and designated as the ``National Maritime \n     Center''.\n       (b) Reference to National Maritime Center.--Any reference \n     in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record \n     of the United States to the building referred to in \n     subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the \n     ``National Maritime Center''.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the amendment designates a building in \nNorfolk, VA, as the ``National Maritime Center.'' It is a name change.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the designation of the \nNAUTICUS building in Norfolk, VA, as the ``National Maritime Center.''\n  Designation as the ``National Maritime Center'' is indeed a special \nhonor and should only be bestowed upon a center of the highest caliber \nin an area with a rich history of maritime excellence. I believe that \nNAUTICUS, located in the city of Norfolk, VA, more than qualifies for \nthis honor and deserves to receive this special recognition. NAUTICUS \nis a comprehensive maritime center that includes an interactive aegis \nand ship design theater, exhibits, and presentations on a variety of \nsubjects including marine environmental issues, marine research, and \nocean exploration. Additionally, the Hampton Roads areas is where our \nworld trade began hundreds of years ago. The area is home to the \nworld's most powerful Navy, the world's largest natural harbor, the \ncountry's largest and oldest shipyard, and a center of marine \nengineering unequaled anywhere in the world.\n  A national maritime center in this region could aid immeasurably in \neducating the public about maritime issues and the importance of the \nmaritime industry in our Nation's history. Indeed, in the era of our \nAll Volunteer Military, this center will help to maintain the ties \nbetween our naval forces and the public through education and \nunderstanding.\n  Designation as a ``National Maritime Center'' need not be exclusively \nreserved to NAUTICUS but could also be granted to other institutions of \nsimilar statute and function upon nomination and consideration by \nCongress. Also, the designation carries with it no operational support \nfunds nor any positive prejudice for future support of operational \ndeficits by any Federal agency.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, this matter has been cleared on this side. \nThis amendment as written would be under the Commerce Committee. But it \nhas been cleared by the Commerce Committee. We have no objection on \nthis side. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am thankful for the personal \nconsideration of my colleague, who serves on the Commerce Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Virginia.\n  The amendment (No. 2443) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2444\n\n (Purpose: To require a report on the disposal of certain property at \n               the former Ford Ord Military Complex, CA)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk in behalf of \nSenator Boxer and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], for Mrs. Boxer, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2444.\n\n  Mr. EXON.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 487, after line 24, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 2838. REPORT ON DISPOSAL OF PROPERTY, FORT ORD MILITARY \n                   COMPLEX, CALIFORNIA.\n\n       Not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a \n     report describing the plans of the Secretary for the disposal \n     of a parcel of real property consisting of approximately 477 \n     acres at the former Fort Ord Military Complex, California, \n     including the Black Horse Golf Course, the Bayonet Golf \n     Course, and a portion of the Hayes Housing Facility.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as passed by the House of Representatives, \nthe fiscal year 1996 Department of Defense authorization bill included \na provision authorizing the Secretary of Defense to sell at fair market \nvalue to the city of Seaside, CA, two golf courses and neighboring \nproperty at Fort Ord. It was my hope to offer an amendment adding a \nsimilar provision during Senate consideration of the bill.\n  We had made significant progress toward agreement on such an \namendment. Unfortunately, several important issues still remain \nunresolved. Because of the managers' strong desire to complete action \non the bill, I have agreed not to offer my original proposal at this \ntime. Instead, I have offered this amendment, which requires the \nSecretary of the Defense to submit a report to the Congress describing \nhis plans for disposal of the property.\n  Final resolution of this issue now falls to the conference committee. \nIt is my hope that the conferees will seriously consider adopting the \nHouse provision, or will modify it in a way that results in the prompt \nconveyance of this property.\n  Mr. NUNN. I can assure the Senator from California that the conferees \nwill look very closely at the House provision. I understand the \nimportance of this issue to the people of Monterey County and thank the \nSenator for her amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, this amendment that I have offered on behalf \nof Senator Boxer is an amendment which requires the Secretary of \nDefense to report to the Congress on the disposal plans of 477 acres of \nreal property located at Fort Ord, CA.\n  Mr. President, I believe this is a noncontroversial amendment also \nthat has been cleared on the other side of the aisle.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The amendment (No. 2444) was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 331, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n       (3) If the total amount reported in accordance with \n     paragraph (2) is less than $1,080,000,000, an additional \n     separate listing described in paragraph (2) in a total amount \n     equal to $1,080,000,000.\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to fix, in \npart, a longstanding procedural contest between the executive and \nlegislative branches. Each year, the administration sends over a budget \nrequest for the Department of Defense which includes funding for the \nNational Guard and Reserves. Typically this budget includes a robust \nrequest for reserve personnel and O funding. But two accounts are \ninvariably unfunded, or underfunded. They are the procurement account, \nwhich ensures our reserve forces have modern weaponry and equipment, \nand military construction, which provides the buildings and other \ninfrastructure needed by the Reserves.\n  With one exception in the last 10 years, the administration's request \nhas failed to include any funding for National Guard and Reserve \nweapons or equipment. In the last 5 years, Reserve construction has \nbeen underfunded in the request, typically by several hundred million \ndollars each year. The result is that the Congress must add the \nnecessary funding and this leads to several complications., First, the \nCongress must add back funding that must be taken out of other \nrequested defense programs, or increase the total defense authorization \nlevel above the request to accommodate the Reserves. Second, the \nCongress must determine specifically what the Reserves need in terms of \nequipment and construction, and how much these additions will cost. In \nthe last several years, the Congress has in fact not specified exactly \nwhat equipment should be procured, but rather authorized a generic pot \nof money for each of the Reserve components and left the decision on \nhow specifically to spend the money to the Department of Defense and \nthe Guard and Reserves. This begs the question as to how the Congress \ncame up with its reserve equipment dollar allocations.\n  This year, the Armed Services Committee decided to specify what \nequipment to procure, rather than leaving it up to the Department of \nDefense. Although this process involved extensive collaboration with \nthe Guard and Reserves and the Department of Defense, it makes little \nsense that the Congress must initiate this process absent an \nadministration recommendation. Without initial Department of Defense \nguidance, the Congress becomes vulnerable to catering to Member-\ninterest items. More fundamentally, it is imprudent for the Department \nof Defense to ignore all Reserve equipment and many Reserve \nconstruction requirements during its regular budget preparations. How \ncan our military be optimally structured if the Guard and Reserves are \ntreated as mere afterthoughts in the budgeting process?\n  Since the Congress cannot require the executive to submit a Reserve \nbudget recommendation at a set level, the bill before us has a useful \nprovision requiring the Secretary of Defense to submit a report, \nconcurrently with the fiscal year 1997 defense authorization request, \nthat details actions taken by the Department of Defense to enhance the \nGuard and Reserves during the previous fiscal year. The provision also \nrequires the Secretary to submit a details listing on how the \ndepartment will spend its fiscal year 1997 Reserve equipment and \nconstruction requests. Because the administration can still choose to \nmake a request of zero--or one that is far too low--this provision \nstill will not necessarily fix the problem.\n  The amendment I offer today will do much to alleviate this problem, \nMr. President. It requires the Secretary of Defense to include a \nlisting or report, in addition to the one already required in the bill, \nthat assumes a serious equipment and construction request level. In my \namendment, the fiscal year 1996 Armed Services Committee authorization \nrequest level for Reserve equipment and construction of $1,080,000,000 \nis used, but any comparable sum will do the job. In other words, if the \nfiscal year 1997 Reserve equipment and construction requests are lower \nthan $1,080,000,000, the Secretary of Defense must provide the Congress \nwith a report detailing how it specifically would allocate funding for \nequipment and construction assuming that it would have this amount to \nspend.\n  The amendment accomplishes several things. It gives the Congress a \nfoundation to work from in determining a rational topline for the \nReserves. The Congress could decide on a significantly lower or higher \namount, but at least it would have guidance from the Department of \nDefense on the Department's Reserve priorities should the Department \nagain decide to deliberately underfund the Guard and Reserve. It forces \nthe Department of Defense to fully address Guard and Reserve funding \nwhile Active Force budgets are under preparation. It reduces \ntemptations by Congress to distort Reserve accounts with Member-\ninterest items. Finally, it helps put the Reserves on equal footing \nwith the Active Forces, rather than giving them the leftovers from \nbudgeting for the active components.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that this amendment is \nacceptable on both sides, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, this amendment would modify section 1007 to \nrequire DOD to provide Congress with a prioritized list of \nmodernization and investment priorities, at least for large amounts, \namounts that will be funded by Congress this year. This will ensure \nthat the Congress gets DOD's best advice on priorities for reasonably \nsized funding packages.\n  Mr. President, I believe this amendment has been agreed to by those \non the other side of the aisle.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. EXON. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Virginia.\n  The amendment (No. 2446) was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2447\n\n (Purpose: Relating to interim leases of property approved for closure \n                            or realignment)\n\n  Mr. EXON.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 468, after line 24, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 2825. INTERIM LEASES OF PROPERTY APPROVED FOR CLOSURE OR \n                   REALIGNMENT.\n\n       Section 2667(f) of title 10, United States Code, is amended \n     by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4)(A) Notwithstanding the National Environmental Policy \n     Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), the scope of any \n     environmental impact analysis necessary to support an interim \n     lease of property under this subsection shall be limited to \n     the environmental consequences of activities authorized under \n     the proposed lease and the cumulative impacts of other past, \n     present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions during the \n     period of the proposed lease.\n       ``(B) Interim leases entered into under this subsection \n     shall be deemed not to prejudice the final property disposal \n     decision, even if final property disposal may be delayed \n     until completion of the interim lease term. An interim lease \n     under this subsection shall not be entered into without prior \n     consultation with the redevelopment authority concerned.\n       ``(C) The provisions of subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not \n     apply to an interim lease under this subsection if authorized \n     activities under the lease would--\n       ``(i) significantly effect the quality of the human \n     environment; or\n       ``(ii) irreversibly alter the environment in a way that \n     would preclude any reasonable disposal alternative of the \n     property concerned.''.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to help \neliminate a current obstacle to the quick redevelopment of closing \nmilitary bases.\n  My amendment will give the military service greater flexibility to \nnegotiate longer interim leases for the reuse of base property where \nthe military is preparing for its departure. It will do so in a \nresponsible way that does not eliminate vital environmental safeguards.\n  This amendment will hopefully solve many interim leasing problems \nthat are occurring at closing bases nationwise.\n  At Eaker Air Force Base in Blytheville, AR, Cotton Growers, Inc., \napproached the local redevelopment authority about storing cotton in an \nold B-52 hanger until cotton prices improved. Upon learning from the \nAir Force that they could receive only a 1 year lease with a 30 day \ncancellation clause, Cotton Growers Inc. decided not to locate at \nEaker.\n  At Alameda naval base in Alameda, CA, AEG Transportation is seeking a \n10-year lease to obtain use of base property to refurbish rail cars for \nthe San Francisco-based BART public transit company. The BART contract \nis for 10 years, and AEG desires a 10 year commitment before spending \nmillions of dollars on capital improvements to Alameda property. \nUnfortunately, the Department of the Navy is thus far unwilling to \nenter into a lease agreement longer than 5 years. This stalemate could \nresult in the loss of an attractive tenant for Alameda.\n  The military services have informed my office that the inability to \noffer longer interim leases is due primarily to their fear of a lawsuit \nover requirements from the National Environmental Protection Act of \n1969, the so-called NEPA. This amendment attempts to address this \nproblem without degrading the environment or fully exempting interim \nleases from NEPA.\n  In recent years, Congress and the Clinton administration have made \nsubstantial progress in removing the obstacles that have blocked past \nefforts to redevelop bases. This amendment will help remove yet another \nbarrier.\n  It will give the military services greater flexibility to negotiate \nwith interested tenants. It also ensures that our effort to create jobs \nand economic activity on base does not come at the expense of the \nenvironment.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman and the ranking member for \naccepting this amendment.\n  I also thank the Department of Defense, the Departments of Army, \nNavy, and Air Force, the Council on Environmental Quality, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, Senators Chafee, Baucus, Lautenberg, \nand Boxer from the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and \nSenators Nunn and Thurmond from the Senate Armed Services Committee who \ncontributed greatly to the passage of this amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, this amendment provides the military \nservices greater flexibility to negotiate longer interim leases for the \nreuse of property at a closing of a military installation. This \namendment allows for flexibility without eliminating important \nenvironmental protections.\n  Mr. President, I believe this amendment has been agreed to on the \nother side.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. EXON. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to thank the chairman of \n\n[[Page S 12544]]\n  the committee, Senator Thurmond, and the ranking minority member, \nSenator Nunn, for their assistance and cooperation in developing this \ncompromise agreement on the operational support airlift [OSA] aircraft \nissue.\n  This amendment deals with the 600 executive aircraft and VIP \nhelicopters operated by the Department of Defense [DOD]. These are \ncalled OSA aircraft.\n  I think we have succeeded in working out a reasonable compromise on \nthe OSA issue.\n  When I first began discussing the issue, I was recommending a 50-\npercent cut in the OSA fleet.\n  But from day 1, I never claimed to have the magic solution. The 50 \npercent figure was nothing more than a starting point.\n  I just wanted to see us take a significant first step down the road \ntoward downsizing the OSA fleet.\n  Mr. President, the idea of downsizing the OSA fleet was not dreamed \nup by Chuck Grassley.\n  My thinking on this issue is based on a mountain of studies and \nanalyses--all prepared by the DOD.\n  All the studies point in one direction: cut the OSA fleet.\n  In February 1993, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. \nColin Powell, recommended that the OSA fleet be cut.\n  In September 1994, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General \nMcPeak, recommended that the OSA fleet be cut.\n  Then in May 1995, the DOD Commission on Roles and Missions \nrecommended that the OSA fleet be cut.\n  Well, the Roles and Missions Commission was chaired by Mr. John P. \nWhite.\n  Right after Mr. White made those recommendations, he became the \nDeputy Secretary of Defense.\n  So cutting the OSA fleet is not Chuck Grassley's idea.\n  The idea of cutting the OSA fleet is coming directly from the top at \nthe Pentagon.\n  Chuck Grassley is just trying to do what these top DOD officials say \nmust be done. That's it.\n  Mr. President, this issue has been studied to death.\n  It's time to make some cuts.\n  This is where the rubber meets the road.\n  The only question is this: How do we do it?\n  How should the cuts be made?\n  The compromise agreement embodied in this amendment starts us down \nthe road toward downsizing the OSA fleet.\n  It gets us headed in the right direction.\n  It directs DOD to develop a plan to carry out the recommendations of \nthe Commission on Roles and Missions.\n  It directs DOD to identify excess OSA aircraft and to develop a plan \nfor disposing of those aircraft.\n  It directs DOD to prescribe regulations that would require the use of \ncommercial airlines for routine official travel.\n  And those regulations must not require the use of OSA aircraft by any \nparticular class of personnel.\n  The compromise agreement would curtail OSA flight operations by 15 \npercent in fiscal year 1996.\n  The reduction in operations would also apply to helicopter flights in \nthe National Capital region.\n  The amendment contains a device to encourage DOD to submit its plan \nfor downsizing the OSA fleet in a timely manner.\n  Fifty percent of all OSA funds in the bill are fenced until the plan \nis submitted to Congress.\n  Again, Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking minority \nmember for their help in crafting this compromise agreement.\n  I would also like to thank a member of the committee staff, Mr. Steve \nMadey, for his persistence and determination. His efforts were \ninstrumental in shaping the final agreement.\n  We can revisit the issue next year after we have had an opportunity \nto assess how well the DOD plan is working.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this amendment would reduce the Flying \nHour Program for operational support aircraft and require a review of \nregulations and a study. I understand it has been accepted on both \nsides.\n  Mr. EXON. This represents the responsible role for the operation of \nsupport aircraft and responds to the recommendations by management of \nthese aircraft by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Commission \non Rules and Missions of the armed services.\n  We strongly support the amendment and urge its adoption.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). If there is no further debate, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Iowa.\n  The amendment (No. 2448) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2449\n\n(Purpose: To transfer funds for procurement of communications equipment \n                     for Army echelons above corps)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of the senior Senator from New \nMexico, [Mr. Domenici], and the Senator from Hawaii, [Mr. Inouye], I \nsend an amendment to the desk and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for Mr. Domenici, \n     for himself and Mr. Inouye, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2449.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 49, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . ARMY ECHELON ABOVE CORPS COMMUNICATIONS.\n\n       Of the amount authorized to be appropriated under section \n     201(3), $40,000,000 is hereby transferred to the \n     authorization of appropriations under section 101(5) for \n     procurement of communications equipment for Army echelons \n     above corps.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand that my amendment on the \nArmy's EAC communications system has been accepted on both sides. I \nwant to thank the Senators Thurmond, Warner, and Nunn for their \ncooperation in this effort. My amendment will fund modernization of the \nArmy's vital command, control, and communication systems. It will allow \nthe Army to move more of its communications equipment, including \nswitches, multiplexer assemblies, message controllers, network \nassemblies, and other equipment, into combat areas quickly during \ncombat and contingency operations.\n  This program has allowed the Army to downsize its combat \ncommunications equipment to the point that it can now transport more \ncritical combat information systems into a fire zone in less time and \nat significantly less cost than before.\n  For example, the benefits of this program save $1 million in air \ntransportation costs every time the Army move a single communications \nbattalion from Fort Gordon, GA to a major center in the Middle or Far \nEast. Consequently, if the Army moves a minimum of 25 communications \nbattalions this year during exercises, it will save $25 million in \noperational costs.\n  Furthermore, this new equipment permits the Army combat personnel to \ncommunicate more frequently, under severely adverse conditions, with \ngreater success than ever before. The new systems are faster, more \nsecure, vastly more dependable, and of significantly smaller size than \ntheir predecessors. They also provide more interoperability than has \never been possible.\n  The new downsized configurations of this equipment fit neatly into \nthe Army's latest heavy HMMWV. Sizeable numbers of these vehicles can \nbe transported into combat zones on C-141 and C-5 aircraft, providing \nsignificantly more communications capability in world hot spots sooner \nthan was previously possible.\n  Maj. Gen. Edward Anderson, Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations and \nPlanning for Force Development, strongly support this program. \nNevertheless, the Army has been limited in its budget submissions due \nto modernization and weapons systems requests. I believe this amendment \naddresses the critical communications needs of the Army, and I thank \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee for its support.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this amendment adds $40 million for the \n\n[[Page S 12545]]\n  procurement of certain communications programs for the Army.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, this amendment would allow the Army to \ncontinue its program to make theater-level communications units more \ncapable, lighter and more easily deployable in emergencies.\n  We think it is a very good amendment. We urge its adoption.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, and I \nurge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The amendment (No. 2449) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2450\n\n   (Purpose: To authorize the conveyance of certain parcels of real \n                     property at Fort Sheridan, IL)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk in behalf of \nSenator Simon, and I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], for Mr. Simon, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2450.\n\n  Mr. EXON.

These \nproperty changes are at fair market value.\n  Mr. President, I believe this amendment has been cleared on both \nsides.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it has been cleared. I wish to thank my \ndistinguished colleague. This is an issue that has been before the \ncommittee on which the Senator from Nebraska and I serve. We would note \nthat Senator Dixon tried to lay foundations for this many years ago. It \nhas been considered by the committee through the years, and I strongly \nsupport the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  So the amendment (No. 2450) was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                       missing service personnel\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, before we conclude consideration of the \nfiscal year 1996 Defense authorization bill, I would like to make a few \ncomments regarding section 551, which addresses the determination of \nwhereabouts and the status of missing persons. Section 551 is the \ndirect result of S. 256, the Missing Service Personnel Act of 1995, \nwhich I introduced on January 20 of this year. I want to thank Senator \nCoats, the Personnel Subcommittee chairman, for his efforts to include \nas much of the original bill in the Defense authorization bill as was \npossible. It wasn't easy. DOD had its objections, as did a number of \nour colleagues.\n  The original intent of S. 256 was to reform the Department of \nDefense's procedures for determining the status and location of missing \npersonnel of the Armed Forces. Legislation concerning those missing in \naction has not changed in the past 50 years. Since the Vietnam war, the \nDepartment of Defense and the United States Government have been \ncriticized for their handling of the POW/MIA issue. Some of that \ncriticism is justified. The Government's own actions--or inaction--has \nprovoked legitimate criticism. S. 256 was an attempt to correct these \nproblems and establish a fair and equitable procedure for determining \nthe exact status of missing personnel. At the same time, it was my hope \nthat we might restore some of the Department's credibility on this \nissue and renew the trust between the public and the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I realize that some who supported S. 256 are concerned that section \n551 is not identical. I agree, it is not everything we had hoped to \nachieve. However, I do believe that section 551 represents the best \nlanguage we could pass in the Senate. There are reforms we had hoped to \nachieve but which are not reflected in the Defense authorization bill. \nBut our colleagues in the House have included this matter in their \nversion of the Defense authorization bill. In my view, some of the \nHouse language better reflects our original bill. When the Senate goes \nto conference, it is my hope that all of the essential provisions of \nthe original bill will be included in the conference report.\n  So, again, I would like to thank Senator Coats for his efforts. \nSection 551 centralizes oversight and responsibility for accounting for \nmissing persons, it establishes new procedures for reviewing cases of \nmissing persons, and it protects the missing service member from being \ndeclared dead solely based on the passage of time. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to ensure that the conference report \nincludes all of the necessary reforms outlined in S. 256.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Mr. Thurmond, again has asked that I urge Senators to come \nforward with their amendments. We are making some steady progress this \nmorning. I believe we are about to receive instructions from the \nmajority leader that the Senate will stand in recess.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, just before we recess, if I may make a brief \nstatement, I thank once again the chairman of the committee for his \ncooperation.\n  I thank my friend from Virginia. For the last few minutes we have \nworked together to pass a whole series of amendments that were not \ncontroversial. I simply say that we are making remarkable progress, and \nI understand that when we reconvene at 2:15, following the statement \nthe Senator from Virginia is about to make, we will be moving forward \nand tentatively have unanimous consent on an agreement that is going to \ncollapse about an hour and a half of time which would otherwise be \nrequired, followed by another amendment the Senator from Nebraska had \nintended to offer if this amendment does not pass, which I understand \nwill now.\n  So I am overjoyed to announce to Senators that we are making \nremarkable progress under the bipartisan cooperation of both sides. It \nwould appear to me that if we can continue this remarkable speed, we \ncould have a chance of passing both the defense authorization and \nappropriations bills at a very fair and early hour this evening. I \nthank my friend from Virginia and those on that side of the aisle for \ntheir cooperation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend and \ncolleague. It is always a pleasure to work with him as we have now \n17\\1/2\\-plus years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12532-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

The question occurs on the Exon amendment No. \n2429.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to clarify the intent of section \n3135 of the Senate's 1996 National Defense Authorization Act which \nprovides $50 million for the preparation of hydronuclear experiments \nbelow a 4 pound TNT explosive equivalent at the Nevada test site. This \nprovision does \n\n[[Page S 12547]]\nnot authorize hydronuclear experiments. So there is no problem with \nthis part of Senator Exon's amendment.\n  Furthermore, this provision does not amend or repeal the requirements \nof section 507 of Public Law 102-377, which is also known as the \nHatfield-Exon-Mitchell amendment on nuclear weapon testing.\n  The amendment proposed by Senator Exon basically invokes the \nrestrictions of the 1992 Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell amendment on U.S. \nnuclear weapons testing. It is my understanding that the Hatfield \namendment was not meant to encompass hydronuclear experiments under 4 \npounds.\n  Therefore, as long as the proposed Exon amendment is not construed to \nmake low yield hydronuclear experiments subject to the Hatfield \namendment's ban on all nuclear weapons testing after September 30, \n1996, I would have no problem with the second portion of Senator Exon's \namendment.\n  I would like to make some further remarks pertaining to section 3135. \nThe Senate passed this provision as an element of the Thurmond-Domenici \namendment to the 1996 National Defense Authorization Act on August 4, \n1995. On that same day, after vigorous debate, the Senate rejected an \nattempt to remove this provision from the bill by a vote of 56 to 44. I \nmaintained then, and I maintain now, that this was a prudent decision. \nI do so in spite of the fact that 1 week after the Senate vote on this \nsubject, the President called for a zero yield comprehensive test ban \ntreaty. I say this because hydronuclear experiments are the single \nremaining tool available to the United States that is relevant to \nassessing potential safety problems which may arise in the fission \ntrigger, or primary stage, of our nuclear weapons as they approach and \nexceed their original design lifetimes. These are not tests of nuclear \nweapons output. These are not tests aimed at development of new \nweapons. They are experiments aimed at primarily assessing the safety \nof he unboosted implosion of the fissle core assembly from a nuclear \nweapon.\n  Now, during our debate on this subject, the executive summary of a \nreport of hydronuclear experiments by the JASON committee came up and \nwas reported into the Record. This report has been represented to be a \npurely scientific study, but a careful reading shows that its \nconclusions are based on preconceived politics and policy. The report \nconcludes that we don't need to do hydronuclear experiments under 4 \npounds. Although the JASON report says that low yield hydronuclears \nwere useful for safety assessments, it concludes that we don't need to \ndo hydronuclears because the JASON's don't anticipate safety problems \nwith the current stockpile. This is simply an unsupported assertion.\n  We found out some other interesting things about the JASON report \nafter the debate. First, we asked DOE for the full classified JASON \nreport. We were told that it was not finished and that it would be \navailable in 3 or 4 weeks. Evidently, the nuclear weapons laboratory \nofficials with the ultimate responsibility for the stockpile were not \ngiven an opportunity to review the JASON report before the President's \nannouncement on a zero yield comprehensive test ban treaty. Second, we \nfound out that the individuals selected for this JASON committee were \nnot experts in nuclear weapons and that they called on the services of \nfour current and former nuclear weapons laboratory experts to serve as \nconsultants to the JASON members. Why did DOE not go to its own experts \nto begin with? So we talked to the two lab experts who dealt with the \nJASON's. They both agreed that tests in the 500 ton range would be of \ngreatest value to the U.S. nuclear weapons program. On hydronuclear \nexperiments below 4 pounds, these two had a genuine technical \ndisagreement. The expert who found hydronuclear experiments to be of \nvalue told us that his material was dropped from the report by the \nJASON's chairman. He told us that his material ``wound up on the \ncutting room floor.''\n  Upon further inquiry we found that the chairman of this particular \nJASON committee is an expert in high energy physics. His resume also \nsays that he is an arms control specialist. In fact, he has been a \nDirector of the Arms Control Association in Washington, DC. He is a \nclose adviser to Secretary O'Leary. Why should the nuclear weapons \nexperts from our Government-owned laboratories have to have their work \nfiltered through individuals with a clear track record in the arms \ncontrol arena? This has not been the case in the 50-year history of the \nU.S. nuclear weapons program. Last year I alerted this body to my \nconcerns about the fact that the Secretary of Energy had surrounded \nherself with many career anti- nuclear advocates. Nothing seems to have \nchanged.\n  Mr. President, this Senator does not believe that this is an \nobjective way to form a committee nor to elucidate expert opinions on a \nsubject of such import to national security.\n  We then asked DOE for the results of the DOE stockpile confidence \nmeeting that took place at STRATCOM in Omaha from the 1st to the 3d of \nJune of this year with the nuclear weapons laboratories participating. \nIt turns out that the position of the nuclear weapons laboratories at \nthis meeting concluded that good confidence in the safety and \nreliability of the enduring stockpile could be maintained with a \ncombination of 500-ton tests and the science based stockpile \nstewardship and management program. If 500-ton tests were excluded, \nthen we could retain good confidence in weapon safety with hydronuclear \nexperiments and the science based stockpile stewardship and management \nprogram. Without 500-ton tests and hydronuclears, the laboratories \nconcluded that there would be a period of vulnerability in our \nstockpile confidence between the end of testing and the realization of \nthe goals of the science based stewardship and management program . You \nwill not see these conclusions discussed publicly by the \nadministration.\n  I caution my colleagues to watch this situation closely and not to \nallow the administration to trade real declines in stockpile confidence \nfor potential gains on the arms control area. This concludes my \nremarks.\n  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that this amendment be \nadopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2429) was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suspend for a moment? Was the \nSenator referring to Exon amendment No. 2429?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, what is the item before the Senate at this \npoint? What is the business of the Senate at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The business before the Senate now is Brown \namendment No. 2428.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2428, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I have been in conversation with both \nMembers of our side of the aisle and the Democratic side of the aisle. \nSenator Glenn has had some positive suggestions for my amendment.\n  At this point, I send a modification of my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nso modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2428), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, add the following new \n     section:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING FITZSIMONS ARMY \n                   MEDICAL CENTER, COLORADO.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Fitzsimons Army Medical Center in Aurora, Colorado has \n     been recommended for closure in 1995 under the Defense Base \n     Closure and Realignment Act of 1990;\n       (2) The University of Colorado Health Sciences Center and \n     the University of Colorado Hospital Authority are in urgent \n     need of space to maintain their ability to deliver health \n     care to meet the growing demand for their services;\n       (3) Reuse of the Fitzsimons facility at the earliest \n     opportunity would provide significant benefit to the cities \n     of Aurora and Denver; and\n\n[[Page S 12548]]\n\n       (4) Reuse of the Fitzsimons facility by the local community \n     ensures that the property is fully utilized by providing a \n     benefit to the community.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--Therefore, it is the sense of \n     Congress that upon acceptance of the Base Closure list--\n       (1) The federal screening process for all military \n     installations, including Fitzsimons Army Medical Center \n     should be accomplished at the earliest opportunity;\n       (2) To the extent possible, the Secretary of the military \n     departments should consider on an expedited basis \n     transferring appropriate facilities to Local Redevelopment \n     Authorities while still operational to ensure continuity of \n     use to all parties concerned, in particular, the Secretary of \n     the Army should consider an expedited transfer of Fitzsimons \n     Army Medical Center because of significant preparations \n     underway by the Local Redevelopment Authority;\n       (3) The Secretaries should not enter into leases with Local \n     Redevelopment Authorities until the Secretary concerned has \n     established that the lease falls within the categorical \n     exclusions established by the Military Departments pursuant \n     to the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 et \n     seq.);\n       (4) This section is in no way intended to circumvent the \n     decisions of the 1995 BRAC or other applicable laws;\n       (c) Report.--180 days after the enactment of this Act the \n     Secretary of the Army shall provide a report to the \n     appropriate committees of the Congress on the Fitzsimons Army \n     Medical Center that covers--\n       (1) The results of the federal screening process for \n     Fitzsimons and any actions that have been taken to expedite \n     the review;\n       (2) Any impediments raised during the federal screening \n     process to the transfer or lease of Fitzsimons Army Medical \n     Center;\n       (3) Any actions taken by the Secretary of the Army to lease \n     the Fitzsimons Army Medical Center to the local redevelopment \n     authority;\n       (4) The results of any environmental reviews under the \n     National Environmental Policy Act in which such a lease would \n     fall into the categorical exclusions established by the \n     Secretary of the Army; and\n       (5) The results of the environmental baseline survey and a \n     finding of suitability or nonsuitability.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this modification incorporates the \nsuggestions of the distinguished Senator from Ohio, Senator Glenn. It \nclarifies some of the aspects of the sense of the Congress relating to \nFitzsimons and broadens some of the sense of the Congress measures \nincluded therein, including a wish that the procedures involved in \ndisposing of facilities be expedited for not just Fitzsimons, but other \nfacilities as well, when it is appropriate.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that this amendment has the \napproval of both sides. I ask at this time for its adoption.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I understand it is acceptable on both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2428), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BROWN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, again, I urge all Senators who have \namendments to the defense authorization bill to come to the floor and \noffer those amendments. We want to finish this bill today. We do not \nwant to stay here until 12, 1, or 2 o'clock tonight. I urge all \nSenators--and I hope the staffs will tell them if they are here, and I \nhope the offices will listen and let the Senators know--to come and \noffer their amendments, if they have any.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I compliment the work of Senator Thurmond. \nI have great respect for him, as well as the work of Senator Nunn, the \nranking member. I agree with much of what they do in their work in the \nSenate. I think both of them have a good grasp of defense issues.\n  Therefore, it is with reluctance I take the floor today to say I am \ngoing to be voting against both the Defense authorization bill and the \nDefense appropriations bill.\n  Again, let me say that I think much of the work they do is work that \nis extraordinarily important for our country and for the defense of our \ncountry, but there are some things in this legislation that give me \nsome real pause, one of which I simply cannot overcome. That is the \nissue of star wars. I call it star wars; I know others will call it the \nantiballistic missile system or other names.\n  No matter what you call it--an ABM system; star wars; or SDI, space \ndefense initiative--it is in this legislation, an initiative at this \ntime when we are up to our neck in debt in this country, when we have \nvery serious fiscal policy problems, and when we are tightening our \nbelt and cutting back on job training, saying we will make it more \nexpensive for people to send their kids to college because we will cut \nback on student loans, we will make deep cuts in Medicare and Medicaid. \nWe are told we do not have the money. At that very moment we now say, \nby the way, all of that concern about spending, do not pay much \nattention to what we were saying there. In this legislation, the \nauthorization and appropriations for defense, we say we want to spend \nmore. We want to spend more money than the Secretary of Defense asks \nfor. In fact, this legislation says we say we want to buy more trucks \nthan the Secretary of Defense says he needs. We want to buy more jet \nfighters than the Secretary of Defense says he wants. We want to buy \nmore submarines than the Secretary of Defense says are necessary--more \nthan are necessary for the defense of this country. This bill says we \nwant to spend $7 billion more than the Secretary of Defense has asked \nfor. It also says we want to commit ourselves to a star wars program, \nor ABM program, that, according to the Congressional Budget Office, \nwill cost between $40 and $48 billion.\n  So this legislation says let us initiate a star wars program and \nspend $300 million more just this year for this program to require an \nearly deployment--an initial deployment by 1999 and full deployment by \nthe year 2003 of a multiple-site national missile defense program.\n  This, after the Soviet Union has largely vanished. There is no Soviet \nUnion. This, at a time when Russia and others are now destroying \nwarheads and missiles as part of our arms control agreement. In fact, \nSTART I and START II, which, when fully ratified, will mean there will \nbe 6,000 fewer warheads in the Russian arsenal, warheads that used to \nbe aimed at America--American cities, American population centers--\n6,000 fewer warheads because they will be destroyed under START I and \nSTART II.\n  However, this legislation says, even while all this is going on, let \nus begin a new weapons program. Let us begin a new arms race. Let us \nspend $48 billion we do not have on something this country does not \nneed.\n  The so-called bipartisan agreement is an agreement that changes a few \nwords that create, for me, a distinction without any difference at all. \nIt says in this agreement,\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to deploy, as soon as \n     possible, affordable and operationally effective theater \n     missile defenses capable of countering existing and emerging \n     theater ballistic missiles and developing for deployment a \n     multiple site national missile defense system.\n  Then it says, ``initiate negotiations with the Russian Federation as \nnecessary to provide for this national missile defense system,'' \nbecause they acknowledge the so-called star wars program would violate \nthe ABM Treaty so they would have to negotiate with the Russians to \nchange the treaty so we can build a multiple-site system, ``and to \nconsider,'' they say, ``if these negotiations with Russia fail, the \noption of withdrawing from the ABM Treaty.''\n  The ABM Treaty is the foundation on which all of the arms control \nagreements we have are based. We sat for years with a policy in which \nwe had a nuclear triad with nuclear warheads aimed at our adversary--in \nthis case the Soviet Union--and they with their nuclear triad with \nnuclear weapons aimed at us. The beginning of the end \n\n[[Page S 12549]]\nof the cold war was the agreements by which, with ABM and START I and \nSTART II, we now have circumstances where missiles and warheads are \nbeing dismantled and destroyed, warheads and missiles that previously \nwere in silos aimed at the United States are now being destroyed and \ndismantled.\n  This legislation says that the very agreement upon which those \nreductions in missiles and warheads is based will be renegotiated and \nchanged and destroyed, effectively, because we say we are not \nsatisfied. We now want to build a national missile defense system. \nAgainst whom are we going to deploy a national missile defense system? \nAnd for what?\n  As always seems to be the case when you debate defense spending \nissues on the Senate floor--when you are talking, on the one hand, \nabout spending for a hot lunch program, for a feeding program, for a \nnutrition program, for college education help, for financial aid, for \nMedicare, for Medicaid--what we have is a bunch of arm wavers in this \nChamber who shout and wave their arms and say that those on this side \nof the Chamber are a bunch of big spenders, wild-eyed big spenders on \nsome drunken spending spree; every day in every way all they want to do \nis spend the taxpayers' money.\n  Now things have changed. This is not about milk. It is not about \nnutrition for kids. This is not about health care. This is about \nbuilding a brand new star wars program. Now the big spenders are on the \nother side of the room. They say: We do not care what the Secretary of \nDefense says, we want to build it. We do not care what the Department \nof Defense says, we need it. We do not care what the intelligence \nexperts claim, we think it is necessary. So they say: Let us build a \nbrand new, gold-plated boondoggle called the star wars program at the \nvery time that we have spent months trying to figure out how to balance \nthe Federal budget.\n  I do not know all the answers on how you balance the Federal budget. \nBut I do know this. You do not start by continuing digging. You know \nthe old southern expression, when you find yourself in a hole, stop \ndigging. Apparently, some in this Chamber think the solution is you \nstart passing out shovels. You do not solve the deficit problems by \ndeciding to embark on these kinds of weapons programs. If I felt the \nsecurity needs of the country required this be built, it would not \nmatter to me what it cost, then we ought to build it. If it were \nessential to the security of this country that the star wars program be \nbuilt in order to defend America, then there is not any logical \nquestion left; this country would have to proceed. But there is no \ncredible evidence, not a shred of evidence anywhere that I have seen \nthat justifies this project.\n  People say, ``It is Saddam Hussein. It is North Korea. It is some \nayatollah in Iran.'' Does anybody seriously believe that the risk from \nSaddam Hussein, or a terrorist country, is a risk that they will get \nhold of an intercontinental ballistic missile with which they will \nlaunch a nuclear warhead against the United States? Does not everyone \nhere, in a thoughtful moment, at least, understand the far more \ncredible threat is with a truck bomb, as was evidenced by a couple of \nnut cases who built a bomb, put it in a rental truck, and parked it in \nfront of a Federal building?\n  Is it not more likely that we will see nuclear terrorism by a \nsuitcase nuclear bomb, by a nuclear bomb placed in the trunk of a rusty \ncar parked by a dock in New York City? Is that not the far more likely \nthreat of nuclear terrorism? Everyone understands that. It is even more \nunlikely that you would see a terrorist nation, if it were inclined to \nlaunch a nuclear attack against the United States, as ill-advised as \nthat would be to do, to do so with an intercontinental ballistic \nmissile. It would be with a cruise missile, which would be easier to \nobtain; certainly easier to build. This star wars program is not a \ndefense against cruise missiles. No one here, I think, would stand and \nclaim it is.\n  No, this is, unclothed, a jobs program. It is like every single other \nweapons program I have ever seen here in Congress. It gets life because \nsomebody believes it is important to their State and it will create \njobs.\n  The fact is, the first site under this will be built in North Dakota, \nlikely, although I think there is also a potential that those who want \nmultiple sites, probably, down the road foresee changing the ABM system \nso they will not have to build a site in North Dakota. But the fact is, \nwhether it is built in North Dakota or not, I do not think we ought to \nhave it, I do not think the country needs it. I do not think the \ncountry can afford it. I think it is preposterous for us, at this \npoint, to be debating, in a defense authorization bill, whether we \nought to build a $48 billion star wars program.\n  The time has passed. This was a 1983 proposal by President Reagan at \nthe height of the cold war when the Soviet Union represented our arch \nenemy. The cold war is over. The Soviet Union does not exist. Russia \nnow, by agreement with us, is reducing its nuclear arsenal by the \nthousands, destroying and dismantling. Now we have this proposal? It is \ncompletely out of step with reality, in my judgment. But it is not \nalone. It is simply the biggest and, I think, the most serious problem \nin this bill.\n  As I said, this bill builds trucks which the Defense Department did \nnot ask for. It builds planes which the Defense Department does not \nneed. It builds submarines which the Defense Department does not want. \nIn fact, the authorization bill on page 125 says the committee \nrecommends $60 million to begin the development of an airship and \nmissions system that is militarily significant in scope which is \noperationally capable of developing a counter-cruise-missile \ncapability. What this does not quite say--because legislative language \nis always artfully drafted so you cannot understand exactly what they \nare talking about--is on page 125, the $60 million is actually intended \nto buy blimps. Yes, blimps.\n  So there is more than one focus of hot air in Washington. Some say it \nis only in the Chamber of the U.S. Senate. It is on page 125. Lighter-\nthan-air air service--$60 million for blimps. With no hearings, no \ndiscussion, let us just spend $60 million on blimps. It is, in my \njudgment, the hood ornament on bad judgment: star wars, blimps, trucks, \nplanes, and ships that were not asked for and were not needed.\n  I would be happy to vote for the bulk of this legislation to provide \nfor the defense needs of this country, to provide the kind of equipment \nand to provide for the salaries and benefits of the men and women in \nthe Armed Forces that we need to make sure America is strong and free. \nBut I will not be part of an effort to decide we should write another \n$7 billion in to buy equipment the Secretary of Defense says he does \nnot need. And I certainly will not be a part of those who now decide \nthey want to abrogate the ABM Treaty and they reach a compromise in \nlanguage that is a distinction without a difference in which they talk \nabout developing for deployment.\n  You see, the bill's original language said we are going to deploy \nstar wars. So we have a bunch of meetings and people exhaust \nthemselves. And after hours and days and weeks, they come up with their \nmaster compromise. Do you know what the master compromise is? They say, \n``Well, instead of saying we are going to deploy a multiple-site \nnational missile system,'' they say, ``We are going to develop for \ndeployment a national multiple-site missile system.''\n  I am sorry, I went to a school that was small. I graduated from a \nhigh school class in which I was in the top five. But, you know, it was \na small school. I guess I have never quite understood with that \neducation the niceties or the subtleties of legislative language that \nallows someone to believe after they have negotiated an agreement to \nsay, ``Well, it used to say we are deploying it now,'' and in which \nthey simply have said, ``We are developing for deployment.'' And there \nis a difference. There is no difference. They are still talking about \ninitial development in 1999. They are still talking about full \ndeployment in the year 2003 and still requiring that the ABM Treaty be \nrenegotiated with the Russians. There is no difference here. A \ndistinction maybe. Yes. But a distinction, in my judgment, without a \ndifference.\n  So I regret to, in a longer fashion than I had intended, say again \ntoday that I will not be voting for the appropriations or the \nauthorization bill. I hope that one of these days when we have another \ndiscussion about who the wild-eyed spenders are, who the big \n\n[[Page S 12550]]\nspenders are in the Congress, that we can discuss who really wants to \nspend billions that were not asked for, who wants to spend billions \nwriting in special projects, who wants to start a star wars program.\n  I also hope maybe we can ask them, ``Where are you going to get the \nmoney? Who are you going to ask to pay for these, or is this going to \nbe charged to the taxpayers' credit card like so much of the spending \nis?\n  Mr. President, I, if no one else is seeking the floor, ask to be \nallowed to speak for 5 minutes in morning business on a subject \nunrelated to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12546-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE TRADE DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. In 5 minutes, Mr. President--because I suspect at the end \nof that time some others will want to move on some additional defense \nissues--I wanted to comment on something that happened during the \nSenate's recess. About two weeks ago we received notice about America's \ntrade deficit for the first 6 months of this year, and the report was \nmet with a giant yawn because nobody cares much about the trade \ndeficit. Nobody writes about it. The major press does not treat it \nseriously in this country.\n  The trade deficit is largely a function of the trade policy that \nallows big American corporations to profit for their stockholders by \naccessing cheap labor in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Malaysia, or Indonesia, \nand selling the products of that cheap labor in Pittsburgh and Fargo \nand Devils Lake and Denver. All of that might make sense for \nstockholders and profits, but it means a wholesale exodus of jobs out \nof this country.\n  The trade figures showed that in the first 6 months of this year, we \nhave the largest trade deficit in America's history, and that by the \nend of this year we will have a merchandise trade deficit approaching \n$200 billion. Let me say that again. By the end of this year, our \nmerchandise trade deficit will approach $200 billion. By contrast, the \nFederal budget deficit will be $160 billion in this year.\n  Let me give you some examples of where we are. Japan: At a time when \nwe have a weak dollar, you would expect our trade situation with Japan \nwould be improving. It is not. Japan has a $65 billion annual trade \nsurplus with the United States; China, over $30 billion.\n  We just entered into NAFTA with Mexico and Canada in January of 1994. \nPrior to that, we had a surplus with Mexico, a $2 billion trade \nsurplus. Guess what? It is going to be an $18 billion deficit this \nyear.\n  I would like just one of those folks, one of those apostles for \nchange, that came here and preached the virtues of the free trade \nagreement with Mexico, to come and stand in this Chamber and tell me \nhow this makes sense for America, how it makes sense for American \nworkers, how it makes sense for the people who want good jobs and good \nincome in this country.\n  We went from a $2 billion trade surplus with Mexico before NAFTA to \nan $18 billion trade deficit projected for 1995. Mexico, China, Japan--\nour trade strategy is a disaster, one that requires, in my judgment, \nemergency action in this country to stop the hemorrhaging.\n  You can make the point--I do not, but you could make the point--on \nfiscal deficits in this country, that the deficit is money we owe to \nourselves, and even though it probably is disproportionately owed you \ncan make the point that it is not a significant deficit. However, the \ntrade deficit must be and will be repaid eventually in this country \nwith a lower standard of living in America.\n  We have to take emergency action to stop this hemorrhaging. The \nhemorrhaging is the loss of good jobs moving outside of our country \nwith the enormous trade imbalances.\n  Some people say, ``Well, but the trade deficits relate to the fiscal \ndeficits. If we did not have a fiscal deficit, we would not have trade \ndeficits.'' The fiscal deficit came down $280 billion to $160 billion. \nThe trade policy deficit is going up sharply at exactly the same time.\n  I would like the company economists to answer that. The fact is, this \nis a disconnected reality. International corporations, many of them \nAmericans, have devised a strategy by which they say, ``We have a plan. \nOur plan is to maximize profits.'' We want to maximize profits by \nproducing overseas and selling here. The dilemma with that is it means \nyou are losing good manufacturing jobs, which is the genesis of good \njobs and good income and good security in our country, all for the sake \nof profits. Profits are fine for stockholders. But the fact is, jobs \nare important for the American wage earner.\n  We must somehow in some way decide that there is something called \nfree trade, but there is something more important called fair trade. \nShould we continue to allow producers to decide to produce in countries \nwhere they can hire 12-year-old kids to work 12 hours a day and pay \nthem 12 cents an hour and then ship the product to be sold in North \nDakota or Wyoming or New York? Should we allow producers to produce in \ncountries where there is no worker safety standard, no child labor \nstandards, no minimum living wage standard, and then ship the product \nto be sold in Pittsburgh or Wyoming or North Dakota? I do not think so. \nI think it hurts our country, and I am not a protectionist. I am not \nsomeone who believes we ought to build walls around our country. But I \nbelieve this country ought to stand up and insist on fair trade and \nstop the hemorrhaging of trade deficits that injure and weaken \nAmerica's economic system.\n  I very much would like one day in some way to see the press and the \ncorporate structures and others in our country, especially Congress, \ntake seriously what I think is an emergency in this country; and that \nis a failed trade strategy that is a bipartisan failure. It has been a \nfailure for 20 years.\n  Our trade policies have not essentially changed since the end of the \nSecond World War. During the first 25 years after World War II it was \nalmost totally a foreign policy, foreign aid strategy. In those first \n25 years it did not matter because we were so big and so strong that we \njust won the world economic race by waking up in the morning.\n  However, in the last 25 years that same trade policy has been a \ndisaster. Sixty percent of the American families now have less income \nthan they did 20 years ago, and less jobs and less opportunities.\n  That is why this is an important issue that this country must begin \nto address and begin to address on a bipartisan basis and do it soon.\n  Mr. President, thank you for the time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12550-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12550-S12556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2157\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the amendment \noffered this morning by the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend for a moment, \ntechnically the Senator will have to have someone yield him time at \nthis point.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator may \nneed.\n  Mr. GLENN. I am opposing the amendment. I guess I am ranking on the \nbill, so I will yield myself time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, to reduce by \n$100 million the $1.2 billion cap on the costs of renovating the \nPentagon.\n  Mr. President, I do not plan to seek a rollcall vote on the \namendment, but I do ask that when the vote on this amendment occurs, I \nbe recorded as being opposed to this amendment.\n  My principal objection to the amendment is its timing.\n  Mr. President, I support every attempt to make prudent cuts to the \ncost of this enormous 15-year renovation project, but I believe that \nlowering the \n\n[[Page S 12551]]\ncap right now is premature. I do not believe it is the intent of the \nSenator from New Mexico to put in question the need for renovation of \nthe Pentagon. As anyone who has visited the Pentagon recently can \nattest, the building is in desperate need of renovation.\n  The Pentagon is over 50 years old. It was built in 1943, and \nfundamental structural work is necessary. In fact, that portion of the \nPentagon closest to the Potomac River has sunk close to 11 inches \nbecause the original pilings on which it was constructed were \ninadequate.\n  In addition to being old, the Pentagon has received minimal \nmaintenance over the years and its heating, ventilation, electrical, \nand plumbing systems are breaking down. I am told that the Pentagon \naverages 30 power outages a day due to the poor condition of the \nelectrical systems.\n  Moreover, the Pentagon simply was not constructed with the kind of \nelectrical system needed to accommodate the sophisticated electronic \nand communication systems required today.\n  Rather, when the Pentagon was built in 1943, at a cost of $83 \nmillion, the Pentagon's office of automation systems today consisted of \nplain old manual typewriters and telephones. Today, however, the \nPentagon relies on 11 major computer centers that form the network of \ncommunications, command centers, and administrative support systems on \nwhich the Pentagon must rely for day-to-day operations.\n  As I have indicated, I do not believe there is much doubt that we \nneed to renovate the Pentagon. The question at hand turns on just how \nmuch the renovation will cost and what is the best approach to keep \nthose costs down.\n  We are in the 5th year of renovation. Secretary Perry certified to \nthe Defense Appropriations Committee last year that the remaining 10 \nyears of renovation will not exceed a congressionally imposed cap of \n$1.2 billion. That is the effective cap right now.\n  Moreover, the senior leadership at the Pentagon recognizes that this \nhuge and complex 15-year project needs to be examined to validate the \nbasic requirements of a post-cold-war Pentagon which now houses a much \nsmaller work force.\n  Secretary Perry established a Pentagon renovation steering committee \nin March of this year to do exactly that. The steering committee is \nchaired by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and \nTechnology. Its other members include the comptroller, the Assistant \nSecretaries of Defense for Force Management Policy, Economic Security, \nand C ``cubed'' I, the Under Secretaries of the military services and \nrepresentatives from the Joint Staff. An essential part of the steering \ncommittee's charter is to consider cost reduction options for the \nrenovation project.\n  Let there be no mistake about it. I support every effort to keep the \ncosts of Pentagon renovation as low as possible. I understand that the \namendment of the Senator from New Mexico is designed in part to force a \nserious and thorough examination of the costs involved in renovation.\n  I simply disagree with the approach and believe it is premature to \nimpose what is, with all due respect, an arbitrary cut of $100 million \nbefore we have the benefit of the steering committee's recommendations. \nI discussed this issue with the Deputy Secretary of Defense this \nmorning. He indicated that DOD is opposed to the Bingaman amendment \nbecause the steering committee's work is still underway and there is no \nbasis to support a $100 million cut at this time.\n  So to the extent that the steering committee's recommendations do not \nresult in at least $100 million in savings, the effect of the amendment \nof my colleague will be that necessary renovations will go uncompleted.\n  Without sounding melodramatic, it is important to remember that the \nPentagon is not your average office building. It is our central \nmilitary command center. Forcing an arbitrary cut of close to 10 \npercent of current cost estimates could have an unintended disruptive \nimpact on the Pentagon's ability to carry out critical military \nfunctions.\n  We need to ask ourselves some questions: Was the original estimate \nwrong? We do not know that it was. Was the original cap of $1.2 billion \ntoo high? No, we do not know that it was too high. If so, in what areas \nwas it too high? What programs were overfunded? How much should be cut \nout? These are things the steering committee should determine. In other \nwords, if this amendment is adopted, what is proposed to be cut in \norder to achieve $100 million savings? We have no basis right now on \nwhich to say that the $100 million savings is excess. In fact, I doubt \nwhether this whole project can be completed for the remaining amount \nthat the Secretary of Defense has pledged he will adhere to.\n  So, Mr. President, I will not seek a rollcall vote on this amendment, \nbut I do wish to be recorded in opposition to the amendment for the \nreasons I have just outlined.\n  Mr. President, in December 1994, the Secretary certified to the \nDefense Appropriations Committee that the 10-year renovation will not \nexceed $1.218 billion. I know of no reason now to cut the $100 million \nto comply with that requirement of law if this amendment is passed. \nTherefore, I wish to be recorded in opposition to the Bingaman \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as I understand, the Senator does not \nwant a vote?\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, what I said was I do not require a rollcall \nvote. If there is a voice vote on this, I wish to be recorded against \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. THURMOND. The Senator just wants to be recorded.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? Is \nall time yielded back?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we will yield back our time. I \nunderstand the other side is willing to yield back its time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Ohio \nwished to be recorded on the amendment, and I believe the Senator from \nOhio is not in favor of the amendment, if the Chair will put that \nquestion again.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that the Chair put the question \nagain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. Without objection, the Chair will put the question again.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  So the amendment (No. 2157) was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                   national defense features program\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I rise to describe for my colleagues an \nimportant element of the bill that will help preserve our shipbuilding \nsector and the jobs of skilled mariners. At my urging, the committee \nauthorized $50 million for the national defense features [NDF] program. \nI am gratified to report that the Appropriations Committee has since \nagreed to appropriate $50 million to jump-start this worthy program. \nGiven its importance to our national security, I thought it would be \nhelpful to expand on the committee's report.\n  At my urging, the Secretary of Defense earlier this year provided to \nCongress a study of the costs and benefits of an active Ready Reserve \nForce [RRF] program employing privately owned commercial ships equipped \nwith national defense features as an alternative to government-owned \nstrategic sealift. Although submitted 14 months late, the report was \nwelcomed by the committee because it confirmed that the program offered \nimportant benefits to the Nation. \n\n[[Page S 12552]]\n\n  Unfortunately, the Pentagon's fiscal year 1996 budget request \ncontained $70 million to purchase existing, foreign-built RO/RO ships \nfor the RRF, but nothing to fund the NDF program. The committee \nbelieved the $70 million requested to purchase these foreign-built and \n-owned RO/RO ships is not in the national security interest, is not \ncost-effective, and would weaken our national defense shipbuilding \nindustrial base. Accordingly, the Committee recommended authorizing $50 \nmillion to procure and install national defense features on vessels \nbuilt in, and documented under the laws of, the United States. This \nprogram will provide substantially superior ships, help preserve \nrapidly dwindling seafaring manpower and skills, save or create a \nsignificant number of jobs in the shipbuilding and supplier industrial \nbase, and assist U.S. shipyards in reentering the commercial \nshipbuilding market.\n  The DOD report demonstrates that an active RRF program, comprised of \nnewly U.S.-built commercial vehicle carriers equipped with national \ndefense features, would have important benefits. The report finds \nthat procuring these vessels would be a cost-effective means of \nrecapitalizing the aging, lower readiness RRF fleet at the end of the \ndecade. The DOD report noted, however, that securing entry into the \ncommercial market will be a critical element for the success of the \nprogram.\n\n  As my colleagues may know, the principal car carrying trade is with \nJapan. Remarkably, only 3 of the 50 vessels operating in it today fly \nthe American flag. In my view, the entry of new U.S.-built commercial \ncar carriers equipped with national defense features in this trade \nwould be in the national interest. Under one proposal now on the \ndrawing board, for example, a fleet of ten refrigerated car carriers \nwould be constructed in the United States to carry vehicles from Japan \nto the United States and produce and other refrigerated products to \nJapan at commercially competitive rates. Equipped with hoistable \nstrengthened decks, these vessels would be well-adapted for carrying \nboth heavy equipment and ammunition. Designed to move at speeds and \nwith loading and unloading capabilities that far exceed those of used, \nforeign-built vessels, a fleet of this size would appear to be large \nenough to ensure vessels would be available for loading at designated \nports of embarkation within the time demands contemplated in an \nemergency.\n  I am particularly interested in this type of proposal because it \nwould lead to the construction of new ships in U.S. shipyards. As my \ncolleagues no doubt appreciate, we must do something to help our \nshipyards supplement their military work with commercial orders. the \nPresident of the American Shipbuilding Association, for example, \nrecently pointed out in a letter to members of Congress that \n``[c]onstruction of military sealift ships is critical to the Nation's \ndefense, to sustaining the Navy's shipbuilding base, and to our \nindustry's efforts to supplement declining orders with commercial \nwork.'' By encouraging the entry of new U.S.-built vessels equipped \nwith national defense features in this trade, Congress and the \nAdministration can advance the national interest.\n  I, therefore, would again urge the Department of Defense and our \ntrade negotiators to emphasize to the Government of Japan the \nimportance of augmenting American participation in this trade as a \nmeans of advancing the mutual defense and security interests of our two \nnations. And I would urge my colleagues not only to support this \nprovision of the bill, but also to support the provision of the fiscal \nyear 1996 appropriations measure that would allocate $50 million to get \nthis program underway.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is S. 1026, the pending \nbill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it open to amendment at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can call up an amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2451\n\n (Purpose: To encourage swift ratification of the START II Treaty and \n                      Chemical Weapons Convention)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I now send to the desk an amendment which is listed and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2451.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, add the following \n     section:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION \n                   AND START II TREATY RATIFICATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Proliferation of chemical or nuclear weapons materials \n     poses a danger to United States national security, and the \n     threat or use of such materials by terrorists would directly \n     threaten U.S. citizens at home and abroad.\n       (2) The Chemical Weapons Convention negotiated and signed \n     by President Bush would make it more difficult for would-be \n     proliferators, including terrorists, to acquire or use \n     chemical weapons.\n       (3) The START II Treaty negotiated and signed by President \n     Bush would help reduce the danger of potential proliferators, \n     including terrorists, acquiring nuclear warheads and \n     materials, and would contribute to U.S.-Russian bilateral \n     efforts to secure and dismantle nuclear warheads.\n       (4) It is in the national security interest of the United \n     States to take effective steps to make it harder for \n     proliferators or would-be terrorists to obtain chemical or \n     nuclear materials for use in weapons.\n       (5) The President has urged prompt Senate action on, and \n     advice and consent to ratification of, the START II Treaty \n     and the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n       (6) The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has testified \n     to Congress that ratification of both treaties is in the U.S. \n     national interest, and has strongly urged prompt Senate \n     advice and consent to their ratification.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Senate should promptly consider giving its advice \n     and consent to ratification of the START II Treaty and the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair, and I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, the amendment is a simple and straightforward sense-\nof-the-Senate amendment. The operative language in the sense of the \nSenate is that it should promptly consider giving its advice and \nconsent to the ratification of the START II treaty and the Chemical \nWeapons Convention.\n  Now, these treaties have been before us for some time. There have \nbeen lengthy hearings on these treaties, and it is important that they \ncome to the Senate for our consideration.\n  These treaties are, just very simply, in our national security \ninterest. It will make Americans safer and the world a less dangerous \nplace. They are going to help reduce the threat, not just of attack \nfrom another country on the United States and our citizens, but of \nterrorist attack involving weapons of mass destruction.\n  First, the START II treaty, the second strategic arms reduction \ntreaty known as START II, was signed by President Bush and Russian \nPresident Yeltsin in January 1993. This treaty is a follow on to the \nSTART I agreement, which has already been ratified and is being \nimplemented. The START I agreement has led to significant reductions in \nthe number of nuclear warheads that Russia has deployed, warheads that \nwere targeted on the United States but which are now moving to storage \nand dismantlement as the START I agreement forces retirement of the \ndelivery systems that they were on.\n  By ratifying START II, we would continue that process and achieve \nfurther reductions in the thousands of remaining Russian nuclear \nwarheads. We would further reduce the threat of nuclear war and advance \nthe nonproliferation interest of the United States. By ratifying START \nII promptly, we could help encourage the Russian federation to also \ncomplete ratification.\n  If START II is ratified, it can be fully implemented, as originally \nscheduled, by the year 2003, after which the United States will still \nmaintain a robust deterrent of about 3,500 nuclear warheads and the \nRussians will have about 3,000 nuclear warheads.\n  START II builds on the progress of START I by restructuring nuclear \narsenals away from instability. START II eliminates all land-based \nmissiles with MIRV's, multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles, \nas well as the last of the land-based heavy ICBM's, the Russian SS-18. \n\n[[Page S 12553]]\n\n  As General Shalikashvili testified for the Joint Chiefs of Staff--and \nhere I am quoting the Chairman:\n\n       Eliminating these systems makes both of our nuclear forces \n     more stable deterrents . . . . This, beyond even the \n     considerable reductions to our nuclear forces, is the \n     beneficial hallmark of this treaty--a security gain that is \n     as positive for the Russians as it is for the Americans. The \n     other members of the joint chiefs of staff and I have no \n     reservations towards this treaty, about the strategic force \n     reductions it entails, or about our ability to properly \n     verify that the Russians are complying with its provisions. I \n     thus encourage you [General Shalikashvili said] to promptly \n     give your advice and consent to the ratification of the START \n     II Treaty.\n\n  Now, that is the advice of our highest military adviser. Promptly \nratify the START II Treaty. Mr. President, because START II will get \nmore Russian warheads off of missiles and off of submarines and move \nthem into secure storage and eventual dismantlement, it will greatly \nconsolidate, control and improve the security of those warheads and \nreduce opportunities for unauthorized access or theft. That is clearly \nin the national security interest of the United States to have \nthousands more Russian missiles and warheads retired and dismantled.\n  Getting that significant reduction in the nuclear forces of both \ncountries will also produce real cost savings for our military over \ntime. The military's enthusiastic support for the START II treaty in \ntestimony before the Congress was underscored by Secretary of Defense \nPerry, who noted that:\n\n       . . . it's very important to lock in the gains that have \n     been made since the ending of the Cold War with formal \n     arrangements, of which START II is a primary example.\n\n  Now, relative to chemical weapons, Mr. President, the convention on \nthe prohibition of the development, production, stockpiling and use of \nchemical weapons and on their destruction known as the Chemical Weapons \nConvention, or the CWC, was signed in January 1993 by President Bush \nand President Yeltsin after years of negotiations. And there is also \nstrong bipartisan congressional support for this agreement as well.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention would establish a comprehensive ban \non chemical weapons, prohibiting their development, production, \npossession, acquisition, retention, and transfer. It would require \nparticipating states to destroy their chemical arsenals and production \nfacilities under international supervision, an important step toward \nactual disarmament of chemical weapons stockpiles in those states which \npossess them. States that refuse to join the convention will be \nautomatically penalized, prohibited from gaining access to dual-use \nchemicals.\n  The CWC will make it possible to monitor illegal diversions of \nmaterials used to make chemical weapons.\n  While 159 countries have signed the CWC, 65 must ratify the agreement \nfor it to enter into force, but only 27 have done so. Most countries \nare waiting to see what the United States is going to do. Russia has \nsigned the convention but has not yet ratified it, and there have been \nsome reports of continued Russian testing and production of chemical \nweapons, which is permitted until it is ratified.\n  If the CWC were in place, it would impose a legally binding \nobligation on Russia, and other nations that possess chemical weapons, \nto seize offensive chemical weapons activities and to destroy their \nchemical weapons stockpiles and production facilities.\n  Over a year ago, in August 1994, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, \nGeneral Shalikashvili, testified as follows:\n\n       From a military perspective, the chemical weapons \n     convention is clearly in our national interest. The \n     nonproliferation aspects of the convention will retard the \n     spread of chemical weapons and, in so doing, reduce the \n     probability that U.S. forces may encounter chemical weapons \n     in a regional conflict. Finally--\n\n  General Shalikashvili said:\n\n     while forgoing the ability to retaliate in kind, the U.S. \n     military retains the wherewithal to deter and defend against \n     a chemical weapons attack.\n\n  And he concluded:\n\n       I strongly support this convention and respectfully request \n     your consent to ratification.\n\n  That is our top-level military official over a year ago urging us to \nconsent to the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  The U.S. intelligence agencies have testified that the Chemical \nWeapons Convention will provide new and important sources of \ninformation to assess the status of chemical weapons stockpiles and \nproduction in countries of concern through regular data exchanges in \nboth routine and challenged inspections. The CWC requires declaration \nby a state of existing chemical weapons, production facilities, \ndevelopment laboratories, test sites and other related facilities, as \nwell as declaration of transfers of chemical weapons and production \nequipment to others. The CWC is going to improve the ability of the \nUnited States to know the nature of the chemical weapons threat so that \nwe can defend against it.\n  The CWC has a historic verification protocol, and it was, in fact, \ncrafted with the direct help of the chemical industry of the United \nStates, which views the protocol as effective and which testified in \nsupport of the convention's ratification.\n  Mr. President, the Foreign Relations and the Armed Services \nCommittees have both done thorough work on these two treaties since \nthey were submitted a couple of years ago for ratification. Between the \ncommittees, there have been no fewer than 18 hearings over the past 2 \nyears, with officials of the State Department, Defense Department, \nJoint Chiefs, CIA, and other intelligence agencies, Arms Control and \nDisarmament Agency, chemical manufacturers and outside experts. So the \nissues----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Michigan \nhis 10 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair and yield myself 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The issues, Mr. President, have been fully explored by our \ncommittees, and it is time now for the full Senate to consider these \ntreaties and to debate a resolution of ratification. We should not be \nseen as being the ones to drag our feet, especially if we want Russia \nand other nations to ratify and begin implementing these important \nsecurity measures.\n  We talked a great deal about the threats of proliferation and \nterrorism which are growing as the cold war thaws and we build a \nproductive, cooperative relationship with our former superpower \nadversary. But now we have an opportunity through these two treaties to \ndo something to stem proliferation of nuclear and chemical materials, \nnot just to talk about it but to do something to make it harder for \nterrorists to get their hands on these weapons of mass destruction or \nthe means of their production. And that is why in May of this year \nGeneral Shalikashvili said that START II would contribute to our \ncounterterrorism efforts and that the chemicals convention would make \nit more difficult for nonsignatories or terrorists to obtain or create \nchemical weapons.\n  I hope that this sense-of-the-Senate resolution will be adopted by \nvoice vote, or otherwise. It simply urges as a sense of the Senate \nprompt consideration by the Senate of these two agreements.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2451, As Modified\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nso modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2451), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, add the following \n     section:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION \n                   AND START II TREATY RATIFICATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Proliferation of chemical nuclear weapons materials \n     poses a danger to United \n\n[[Page S 12554]]\n     States national security, and the threat or use of such materials by \n     terrorists would directly threaten U.S. citizens at home and \n     abroad.\n       (2) The Chemical Weapons Convention negotiated and signed \n     by President Bush would make it more difficult for would-be \n     proliferators, including terrorists, to acquire or use \n     chemical weapons, if ratified and fully implemented as \n     signed, by all signatories.\n       (3) The START II Treaty negotiated and signed by President \n     Bush would help reduce the danger of potential proliferators, \n     including terrorists, acquiring nuclear warheads and \n     materials, and would contribute to U.S.-Russian bilateral \n     efforts to secure and dismantle nuclear warheads, if ratified \n     and fully implemented as signed by both parties.\n       (4) It is in the national security interest of the United \n     States to take effective steps to make it harder for \n     proliferators or would-be terrorists to obtain chemical or \n     nuclear materials for use in weapons.\n       (5) The President has urged prompt Senate action on, and \n     advice and consent to ratification of, the STATE II Treaty \n     and the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n       (6) The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has testified \n     to Congress that ratification and full implementation of both \n     treaties by all parties is in the U.S. national interest, and \n     has strongly urged prompt Senate advice and consent to their \n     ratification.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the United States and all other parties to the START II \n     and Chemical Weapons Convention should promptly ratify and \n     fully implement, as negotiated, both treaties.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we accept the amendment as modified, and \nurge the Senate to adopt this amendment.\n  I state for the Record that this amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Michigan has been modified, and in accepting the amendment as \nmodified, it is not the intention of the committee to predetermine the \noutcome of the Senate debate that will take place on advice and consent \nto ratification of these two treaties. The committee is merely stating \nthat overall, if the treaties were to be ratified by all parties and \nfully implemented by all parties, it would be in the national security \ninterests of all the signatories.\n  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has not yet reported either \nthe START II nor the Chemical Weapons Convention to the Senate. As a \nresult, a full debate and examination of the treaties on the floor has \nnot taken place. A number of concerns need to be fully aired with \nregard to ratification and implementation of these treaties when the \nSenate determines that it is time to provide its advice and consent to \nratification.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his support of \nthis amendment. It is important that the Senate promptly take up these \ntreaties. The world is waiting for us to act, and that is the thrust of \nthis amendment. I am glad it has been accepted by the majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes, we yield our time.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Yes, we also yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2451), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2440\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I have submitted an amendment No. 2440 to \nthe DOD authorization bill which has been accepted as part of the \nmanagers' package. I want to thank the managers, and in particular, my \ndistinguished senior colleague from Virginia, Senator Warner, for his \neffort in clearing that on his side of the aisle.\n  I will take just a moment, if I may, during the time that no other \namendments are pending or about to be offered, to describe the \namendment.\n  I believe that this amendment can play an important role in reshaping \nand improving the efficiency of our military infrastructure.\n  We all agree that Congress must continue to maintain the highest \ndegree of military readiness in order to fulfill the constitutional \ndirection to provide for our national security.\n  But, Mr. President, we need to be much smarter in the way in which we \nfund the establishment that supports our national defense.\n  This year's Defense authorization process has shown us, once again, \nthat the forces and weapons we require are rapidly becoming \nunaffordable.\n  We have to seek new and innovative ways to conduct our defense \nbusiness.\n  We must give visionary and far-reaching tools to the military and \ncivilian leaders in DOD to let them continue to transform and remake a \nmilitary for the next century.\n  The recently completed BRAC Commission, the White Commission and \nnumerous GAO and other studies have consistently shown that our \nmilitary infrastructure is simply too large.\n  We have completed three exhausting BRAC rounds and have accomplished \nmuch--but our work is not yet complete.\n  Both the 1995 BRAC Report to the President and the recently completed \nWhite Commission on Roles and Missions in the Military concluded that \nfurther efforts in privatization can achieve significant savings and \nshould be aggressively pursued.\n  Mr. President, I strongly agree with these conclusions and am firmly \nconvinced that a key element in reshaping our military establishment \nmust be the active exploration of further privatization opportunities \nfor appropriate defense functions.\n  In the near future, I intend to introduce legislation which will \nprovide the Department of Defense with the tools it will require to \nimplement the proposals made by the White Commission.\n  In the meantime, my amendment will give us an opportunity to move \nforward in exploring privatization opportunities now.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that a detailed examination of the \noperation of our various, non-combat military air fleets offers the \nquickest and most efficient way to begin the exploration of using \nprivate sources to reduce unnecessary infrastructure and associated \ncosts.\n  We maintain a variety of military aircraft for diverse functions, \nincluding: VIP airlift, transport, logistics, aerial refueling, target \nservices, and scientific research.\n  Several recent studies have reported that, in many cases, these air \ncapabilities exist well above and beyond that required to meet \nrealistic ``wartime needs.''\n  In the gulf war, for example, the existing size of the operational \nsupport aircraft fleet was 10 times the amount actually used.\n  My amendment directs the Secretary of Defense to conduct a \ncomprehensive and detailed study to examine ``privatizing options'' \nwith respect to the specialized, non-combat military air fleets.\n  I want the DOD to focus on the feasibility of using private sources \nto replace many of the administrative or support functions now being \nperformed, mostly within the continental United States, by military \nversions of commercial aircraft models.\n  The distinguished Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley, has \nhighlighted the tremendous potential for the foolish and unnecessary \nuse of OSA aircraft for purposes which could and should have been \naccomplished, at a much lower cost, using commercial means.\n  I support his efforts to reduce unneeded capability in this area of \nmilitary aircraft.\n  Mr. President, the OSA fleet represents only part of the many \nfunctions now being performed by ``military'' aircraft.\n  I believe many of these functions can be done cheaper, through \nprivate means, while at the same time increasing overall military \nefficiency.\n  Paying for air services on a ``per flight hour'' basis (only when \nrequirements exist that cannot be met by commercial airlines) gives us \nan opportunity to capture tremendous savings by cutting the personnel, \nmaintenance, and infrastructure required to support these specialized \nfleets.\n  Additionally, I believe that the privatization of these functions, \n(especially with respect to VIP aircraft) will dramatically reduce \ninstances of abuse of the system.\n  Naturally, we must ensure that we do not inadvertently cut a \ncapability which could adversely affect our ability to conduct wartime \nor other emergent operations.\n  We must also maintain the ability to retain training opportunities \nfor the \n\n[[Page S 12555]]\naircrews who will be required to provide support in ``combat \noperations.''\n  On the other hand, we will never know exactly how much we can cut \nuntil we conduct an in-depth study of the ``non combat air operations'' \npresently conducted by the military.\n  My amendment will require examination of the realistic wartime \nrequirements economic assumptions in conducting a cost benefit \nanalysis, and the impact on force structure and personnel which \n``privatization'' would produce.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, I intend to introduce \nlegislation which would form a Privatization and Cross-Servicing \nCommission which will look at options for using private sources in \nseveral areas of existing military operations.\n  This legislation will also examine improving efficiencies by \ncombining like functions within the individual services.\n  By aggressively pursuing the recommendations made in recent studies, \nwe can save billions in defense dollars without the massive \nunemployment that creates economic hardship for loyal Federal employees \nand service personnel.\n  My amendment can give us many of the answers we in Congress need to \ncraft the tools to further improve efficiency in the military services.\n  Mr. President, I again thank the managers of this particular bill for \naccepting this amendment on both sides. I look forward to working with \nthem on this and other amendments as we continue to try to provide ways \nto meet our defense needs and defense obligations in ways that respect \nthe limited resources of the taxpayers.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, prior to the recess I agreed with the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee on an amendment relative to \nresidual value. This is not listed in the unanimous consent because it \nwas an amendment that was cleared on both sides. I will send the \namendment to the desk in a moment.\n  This requires that the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget, submit to the \ncongressional defense committees status reports on the results of \nresidual value negotiations between the United States and Germany.\n  This is a very important issue. It is an important issue for our \nbudget because we are turning over to Germany properties that have \ngreat value. There are values that are attributed to these properties \non our books. We should get at least that value when we turn over \nproperties that we have approved to Germany.\n  What this amendment provides is that the reports that it refers to \nwill include the following information:\n\n       (1) The estimated residual value of U.S. capital value and \n     improvements to facilities in Germany that the U.S. has \n     turned over to Germany;\n       (2) The actual value obtained by the U.S. for each facility \n     or installation turned over to the government of Germany;\n       (3) The reason(s) for any difference between the estimated \n     and actual value obtained.\n\n  A number of us on the committee on both sides of the aisle have been \nvery actively engaged in the residual value issue because of the amount \nof money that has been invested in these properties in Germany, and \nthis amendment will help us track very carefully what we are agreeing \nto when we turn over those properties to the Government of Germany.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2216\n\n     (Purpose: To require the Defense Department to report to the \ncongressional defense committees on residual value negotiations between \n                     the United States and Germany)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I believe this amendment has been cleared \non the other side and I therefore call up amendment No. 2216.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2216.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . RESIDUAL VALUE REPORT.\n\n       The Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Director \n     of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), shall submit to \n     the Congressional defense committees status reports on the \n     results of residual value negotiations between the United \n     States and Germany, within 30 days of the receipt of such \n     reports to the OMB.\n       The reports shall include the following information:\n       (1) The estimated residual value of U.S. capital value and \n     improvements to facilities in Germany that the U.S. has \n     turned over to Germany.\n       (2) The actual value obtained by the U.S. for each facility \n     or installation turned over to the government of Germany.\n       (3) The reason(s) for any difference between the estimated \n     and actual value obtained.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Congress in recent years has attempted to \nexercise responsible oversight over negotiations between the U.S. \nmilitary and foreign governments, primarily Germany, on how much \ncompensation our government will receive for the residual value of \nimprovements we made to military bases we are closing and returning to \nthose governments. In some cases, there are very valuable facilities we \nbuilt on those bases, paid for by U.S. taxpayers, that still have some \nreuse value to the governments to which they are being returned.\n  For each facility, the Defense Department has determined the \nremaining value of those improvements, and negotiations ensue with the \nhost government over how much compensation we will actually receive. \nThe vast majority of these facilities are in Germany, which was the \nfront line of efforts to deter Soviet expansion during the cold war.\n  To show the Germans that we were serious about being fairly \ncompensated for the improvements we made at military facilities on \ntheir soil, and to give our own negotiators maximum leverage, Congress \nhas passed a series of measures over the last few years. One of these \nwas section 1432 of Public Law 103-160, which prevented the United \nStates from spending funds to move our embassy from Bonn to Berlin, a \nhigh priority for the German Government, until we had recovered at \nleast 50 percent of the remaining residual value from these \nnegotiations. According to State and Defense Department officials, that \nprovision has helped to provide some leverage for our negotiators, \nalthough talks have not yet been completed on most of the facilities.\n  But now that the United States has negotiated a favorable land deal \nfor an embassy in Berlin, the administration argues that section 1432 \npresents a potential liability that would delay construction of that \nnew embassy and force us to incur costs from that delay. So the \nadministration has requested repeal of section 1432 and the committee \nhas concurred with the repeal provision in this bill.\n  Mr. President, we need to keep the pressure on the governments we are \nnegotiating with, especially Germany, and also on our own negotiators \nto recover as much value as possible. Congress needs to continue to \noversee that process if we are to maximize the amount we recover.\n  My amendment continues that oversight by requiring reports from the \nSecretary of Defense and Office of Management and Budget, explaining \nthe reason for any difference between the estimated residual value of \nU.S. capital improvements to facilities, and the actual value being \nobtained in negotiations. If a settlement is providing the United \nStates with less than the full value we invested, we need to know why.\n  We need at least that level of congressional scrutiny. Our \nnegotiators and the German negotiators should know going into a \nnegotiation that a settlement will be seen and reviewed by Congress.\n  Mr. President, of course the greatest payoff for our investment in \nimprovements to installations abroad, especially in Europe, has been \nthe peace they helped keep during years of high \n\n[[Page S 12556]]\nEast-West tension. But where those improvements that still have value \nare being returned to the host government, we are entitled to \ncompensation in the form of direct payments or in-kind payments. This \namendment should help improve the chances of success in that effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we have no objections to this amendment. \nWe believe the American people should have a full accounting of the \nproperty that our Armed Forces turn over to Germany and should receive \na fair return on 50 years of improvements made to these properties. I \ncongratulate Senator Levin on his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. THURMOND. We yield our time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2216) was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLautenberg of New Jersey be added as an original cosponsor to the \nresidual value amendment which we just agreed to, No. 2216.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      disposal of bonaire housing\n\n  Mr. COHEN. I would like to bring to the manager's attention a problem \nwith the disposal of surplus property in Presque Isle, ME, from the \nformer Loring Air Force Base. The designated local reuse authority is \nhaving difficulty with the Department of Interior in the disposal of \nthe Federal property known as the BonAire Housing Complex. I understand \nthat it is the intention of the chairman to assist the Maine delegation \nin resolving this matter.\n  Mr. THURMOND. The Senator from Maine is correct. I will be pleased to \nwork to address this issue in an appropriate manner.\n  Mr. COHEN. I thank the distinguished Chairman for his assistance on \nthis matter.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, per the arrangement that I have made with \nthe manager of the bill, Senator Strom Thurmond, I would like to ask \nunanimous consent at this time that the Senator from Rhode Island be \nallowed to continue as if in morning business for as much time as he \nmay need, and that following the conclusion of his remarks we return to \nthe regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12550-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ANNOUNCEMENT OF RETIREMENT\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I wish to state that this morning in \nProvidence I announced my decision not to seek reelection to the Senate \nnext year.\n  This afternoon, I wanted to formally make that decision known to my \ncolleagues, and to share with you all the thoughts I conveyed to my \nRhode Island constituents.\n  This was not an easy decision for me. I regret that it is fashionable \ntoday to malign the Congress, to malign the Federal Government, and to \nmalign those of us who serve the public in elective office.\n  I, however, consider this U.S. Senate a marvelous institution full of \ntalented and committed men and women who, contrary to public belief, \nare dedicated to serving our constituents and to improving the quality \nof our national life.\n  And I continue to believe that government--and the Federal Government \nin particular--can, should, and does make a positive impact on the \nlives of most Americans. Federal programs and agencies do not always \nwork perfectly, and many need reform. But they were conceived to help \npeople, and I believe most continue to do so.\n  When you believe as strongly as I do in the value of good government \nand see some of its virtues under attack, there is a great temptation \nto continue to serve and to fight for those values and those programs \nthat we consider vital.\n  As to my health, I have been assured that there is no medical barrier \nto my seeking reelection and serving another 6-year term. I feel strong \nand healthy and continue my 2-mile runs.\n  However, I decided not to be a candidate for reelection.\n  There is a natural time for all life's adventures to come to an end, \nand this period of 36 years would seem to me about the right time for \nmy service in the Senate to end.\n  I know I will miss more than anything else the people of Rhode Island \nwhich it has been my pleasure to serve these years. They are fine, \ncaring people who put their trust in me all these years, tolerated my \neccentricities, and gave me great affection. And I only pray that I \nrepaid their trust and served them faithfully.\n  And I will particularly miss this wonderful Senate and you, the men \nand women who serve here. Let me say again, almost without exception, \neach of us believes he or she can make a positive difference to our \nNation's well-being.\n  This Senate seat from my State has been held for six decades by a \nforward-thinking Democrat, first by Theodore Francis Green, and then by \nme. And I want to make it clear today that I am intent on doing all I \ncan to ensure that another progressive Democrat is elected to fill this \nseat.\n  And I also plan to do what I can to assist in the reelection of \nPresident Clinton, whom I consider a sadly underrated and really quite \nsuccessful President. He has served our country with intelligence and \nvision and passion, and I firmly believe he deserves another term.\n  Beyond that, I have no concrete plans. I will stay active, stay \nengaged in some kind of public service and will continue to cherish my \nassociation with Rhode Island and its wonderful people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that morning \nbusiness be continued for whatever time is necessary for any Senator \nwho wishes to make remarks with regard to the announcement that we have \njust heard from the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12556-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12556-S12579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RETIREMENT OF SENATOR CLAIBORNE PELL\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we have just heard the announcement in the \ntypical style of the great Senator from the State of Rhode Island. \nCertainly, he has left his mark. I will not be here to miss him at the \nconclusion of his term but others will miss him. The institution of the \nSenate will miss him because I can say that I know of no one who has \nbeen more forthright in demonstrating to his colleagues in the Senate \nand the folks that he has so ably represented back home in Rhode Island \nwhat a U.S. Senator should be, what a U.S. Senator is all about.\n  Claiborne Pell has been a man of outstanding character, a very hard-\nworking, dedicated soldier for the Senate and for the United States of \nAmerica and, of course, for Rhode Island.\n  Certainly, he has distinguished himself in many areas during his term \nof service. Most distinguished, I suspect, has been the steady hand he \nhas provided as a very senior member of the \n\n[[Page S 12557]]\nForeign Relations Committee. He is the former chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee. The people of the world will miss the steady hand \nthat Claiborne Pell has always provided.\n  During my terms in the Senate, I have considered him a model of \nconsistency, thoughtfulness, a true gentleman of the Senate, the likes \nof which we may never have seen before, probably the likes of which we \nwill never see again.\n  Claiborne, congratulations on your outstanding statement. I wish you \nwell. The most exciting part of your speech to me was you indicated you \nstill would be active, you still would be around, you still would be \nfighting the principles that have been your hallmark all during the \ntime you have been a Member of this body. Thank you so much for your \ncontribution of a personal nature. Thank you so very much for your \nfriendship over the years.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we just heard the announcement by the \nSenator from Rhode Island [Mr. Pell], that he is not going to run \nagain. Senator Pell is a man of integrity. He is a man of ability. He \nis a man of dedication. We have all enjoyed serving with him. He served \nably as the Foreign Relations Committee chairman some years ago and did \na good job. We are going to feel a void in the Senate when Senator Pell \nleaves.\n  I wish to say to you that your colleagues here in the Senate feel \nmost kindly toward you. They think highly of you. They wish you well. \nWe hope you enjoy good health. Good luck. God bless you and God bless \nall you have stood for while you were here.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the announcement that Senator Pell has \nmade today that he will retire from the Senate at the end of this term \nobviously in one sense fills us with sadness because we will no longer \nhave the benefit of his service and the pleasure of his company. In \nanother sense, I would say it is not just sadness; it is a time to \ncelebrate and express respect for an extraordinary career of service in \nthe Senate. Claiborne Pell has run the race well and has an awful lot \nto be proud of. He leaves a legacy of great accomplishment.\n  I think we will not only think first but quite significantly of the \nPell grants. I do not know how many recipients of those Pell grants, \nwhose lives have been changed by the opportunity Senator Pell's \nlegislative leadership gave them as poor people to receive an \neducation, know exactly who Claiborne Pell is, but they ought to know.\n  He is a man who came to the Senate with a proud tradition of service \nin his family which he carried forward. He is a man who has measured \nhimself by his accomplishments and by the principles which his service \nhas reflected. The Pell grants may be the most visible of them because \nof the extent to which his name is attached to them, but that is only \nthe beginning of his service.\n  I think also of not only the other work he has done to support public \neducation and broadening opportunity in this country but the pioneering \nwork--and often the lonely work--he has done on behalf of the rule of \nlaw in international relations. He carries around in his pocket the \ncharter of the United Nations. I do not know of another Member of \nCongress--there it is--who does that.\n  Claiborne Pell was there when the charter was put together and \nratified, and his service in this Chamber has been a service that \nrespected and attempted to give meaning and life to the great hopes and \nprinciples for international law expressed in that charter. He has \npursued individually and as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee ratification of treaties that would have sat dormant, \ntreaties that expressed hopes, offered the opportunity to realize and \ncreate some rule of law and morality in international affairs where \nthey might not otherwise exist.\n  This is an extraordinary legacy, a legacy of substantial \naccomplishment. But I wish to say at this time--and it is not all that \none wants to say, but I do want to say in the midst of a time in our \npolitics when people have become all too vicious and partisan, where \npeople strive too often for political advantage as opposed to public \nservice, Claiborne Pell has established a very high standard of public \nservice and public civility.\n  Earlier this year, the Speaker of the House, Mr. Gingrich, talked \nabout the need to renew American civilization--a worthy goal.\n  But it strikes me that we will not ever get to renewing American \ncivilization unless we can renew American civility in our public and \nprivate lives. And by private lives I mean in the life of our community \nand in the basic interaction that we bring to our families, to our \nneighborhoods, to our communities and that Claiborne Pell has brought \nto service in this body. This is as a fellow New Englander, neighbor in \nConnecticut. I am very proud to think that Claiborne represents the \nbest of our long history in his steadfast and deep commitment to the \nbest interests of our country, in his wider vision of service to the \nbest interests of our world, of humankind, and in the extremely decent, \nthoughtful way he has gone about arguing for principles and causes \nwithout ever being contentious or disagreeable.\n  He has a wonderful family. His wife and children and grandchildren \nbring him the greatest pleasures I have seen when I have been with him.\n  As to this question of his physical condition, I can offer this \npersonal testimony. My wife and I often jog on a small track at \nGeorgetown University right across the street from Georgetown Hospital. \nAnd many a morning as we have jogged, we have seen, usually ahead of \nus, a solitary figure out there, sometimes uniquely wearing a tweed \ncoat while jogging--we do not see this often on the track--none other \nthan our beloved Senator Claiborne Pell.\n  So at this moment I consider myself fortunate that by a twist of fate \nI should be on the floor to express my great admiration for Senator \nPell, my thanks to him for the model, the standard he set up for so \nmany of the rest of us who serve here and my best wishes to him that he \nand his wonderful family have good luck and all of God's blessings in \nthe many years that I know he has ahead.\n  [Applause, Senators rising.]\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                    Honoring Senator Claiborne Pell\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I wish to make a few comments about my colleague from \nRhode Island, Senator Pell, who today announced that after 36 years in \nthis Chamber he will be retiring.\n  This decision obviously cannot escape the reflection of the Senate \nwhose Chamber has been given such dignity, such courtesy, such \nstatesmanship through the dedicated service of Claiborne Pell. Nor can \nthis announcement be taken lightly by our State, our joint State of \nRhode Island. Our small State, as you can expect, makes big demands on \nits Senate delegation. We all know that the Senate was created in the \nConstitution in order to protect the smaller States from the will of \nthe larger, more powerful, more prosperous States over the smaller \nones. And over the years, different events have created special needs \nin our State that only the Federal Government has been able to \nadequately address.\n  Now, there is no doubt, Mr. President, that the Senate and the State \nof Rhode Island will miss Senator Pell. Over 35 years--and 36 when he \nfinishes--he has served our Nation and his State with great \ndistinction. He not only lived up to the demands of his office, but, \nindeed, he left his handiwork on some of the most important areas and \npolicy that our Nation has encountered. Let us just briefly take a look \nat them.\n  First, I believe Senator Pell will be most remembered for his work in \neducation, particularly providing for education for lower- and middle-\nincome families in this Nation of ours. Now, many of the younger people \ntoday, even the younger Members of the Senate refer kind of casually to \nPell grants, as though they have always been there. But they have not. \nThe principle behind that program was not as widely accepted as today \nwhen they were started by Senator Pell.\n  In recognition for the great accomplishment as the primary sponsor of \nthe legislation creating these grants, as I recall, it was a \nRepublican, Senator Javits, who proposed they be \n\n[[Page S 12558]]\nnamed the Pell grants. It was that, I think, that was a reflection of \nthe bipartisanship that existed in the Foreign Relations Committee and \nin the Labor Committee among Senator Pell and his colleagues. And, \nindeed, it seems to me, as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, \none of the things that Senator Pell had always strived for was \nbipartisanship, to reach a consensus, to have matters reported out \nunilaterally. That has been one of his goals. He certainly has achieved \nit.\n  Now, another example has been Senator Pell's longstanding commitment \nto protection of the oceans and the coastal resources of our country. \nHe has been a champion, originator of the Sea Grant Program, which is \npart of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. And he has \nbeen the leading Federal sponsor of the University of Rhode Island's \nSchool of Oceanography, which is the crown jewel of one of our State's \nfine institutions of higher education.\n  Senator Pell has demonstrated his expertise in foreign affairs. He \nhas been chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations for several \nyears. He distinguished himself as a man of peace. His active work to \nachieve agreements with other nations to limit chemical weapons, for \nexample, and nuclear weapons nonproliferation are matters that he has \nworked on constantly ever since he has been in this Chamber.\n  In addition, Senator Pell has been the leading advocate, the leading \nadvocate in the Senate, for the betterment of our Nation's cultural \nlife, primarily through his sponsorship and initiation of the National \nEndowment for the Arts. And I think he will long be remembered for that \nlikewise. No question about it.\n  Beyond these overarching policy concerns, Senator Pell has been a \nstrong advocate for our State. And it is a pleasure that I have had in \nworking with him since the years that I have been here on things like \nthe preservation of historic Cliff Walk in Newport and the South East \nLight on Block Island or retaining the submarine construction industry \nin our State.\n  And when one out of every three Rhode Islanders found themselves \nwithout access to deposits through failed credit unions--one out of \nevery three Rhode Islanders, 33 percent of our State, had some money \ntied up in credit unions when they failed--Senator Pell greatly helped \nin crafting Federal assistance for that.\n  Above all, I wish to emphasize those personal qualities that Senator \nPell has brought to this Chamber as an example for all of us. At some \npoint we have all been tired and contentious in debate with the sense \nthat we will never finish some of this complicated legislation. But \nSenator Pell has never lost his pleasant disposition, his calmness, his \nsense of objectivity, his striving to achieve a consensus that I \nmentioned before. This is particularly important, his honesty coming \nthrough.\n  And that is important in our State where we have had a series of \nmismanagement and scandals and outright failures. And, indeed, many \npeople of our State have gotten very, very cynical about their elected \nofficials, but not about Senator Pell, who has stayed on the high road \never since he came into public life.\n\n  So, Senator Pell will leave the Senate a better place for his having \nbeen here. My father used to say, ``Try to leave, wherever you have \nbeen, your work station a better place than when you got there.'' And \ncertainly Senator Pell has followed that admonition. His work station, \nthis work station, the Senate of the United States, is a better place \nfor his having been here.\n  He has left an example for all of us to aspire to. So it is with \nregret and affection that I wish him well in the years to come and that \nhe may enjoy the best of health and the pleasantries and good times \nthat come with his family and with good health that I so hope that he \nwill enjoy.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from New York for letting me \nproceed.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                    Honoring Senator Claiborne Pell\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this Chamber has been graced with many a \nfine and wondrous person. Rarely has a State sent two such. In the \nremarks of the junior Senator from Rhode Island concerning his senior \ncolleague, we have an example the Republic would do well to consider.\n  I would think, sir, of two moments. The first--and I see the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts on the floor--first would be in 1960, \nNovember, the Presidential election of that year. They were in a store \nfront on Salina Street in Syracuse, NY. And my wife Elizabeth had \npersuaded Robert F. Kennedy that if his brother, then Senator Kennedy, \ncould carry Syracuse, carry Onondaga County and carry New York, and \naccordingly become President of the United States, not the worst \ncalculation, as a properly Democratic city had not voted Democratic \nsince 1936. At 9:12 that evening, a phone call came from the compound, \nas I believe it was called, and it was Robert F. Kennedy calling for my \nwife, and the exchange went very quickly. It said: ``Did we?'' ``Yes.'' \nClick, and we had done it.\n  Then President Kennedy had come to office, or would do, and within \nabout 5 or 10 minutes, young Robin Pell, who had been working with the \nKennedy campaign in upstate New York, came in, was there and put down \nthe phone and said, ``Cousin Claiborne has been elected as well.''\n  That is the beginning of a third of a century in this Senate, but a \ncareer already well begun because I said, Mr. President, I would speak \nof two moments. The other took place in San Francisco not hours ago, if \nyou would like. President Clinton was speaking in that city on the \noccasion of the 50th anniversary of the agreement to the U.N. Charter. \nIt was in a great hall, the music, the opera where the ratification had \ntaken place, and the delegates in what would have been, I dare not ask \nthe Senator, I believe 56 countries. The President looked up into the \nboxes and said: ``And Claiborne Pell was present.''\n  Indeed, he was on assignment from the military, the Coast Guard, his \nbeloved Coast Guard in which he served valiantly in the Second World \nWar. He carries that charter with him today, reminding a Senate and \ncertainly an administration that sometimes seems to have forgot that we \nmade promises in those days in the aftermath, not yet finished, of that \nextraordinary world conflagration.\n  He carried that forward as chairman of the Senate Committee on \nForeign Relations, by all understanding, the senior committee of the \nSenate, with its solemn responsibilities in peace and war. He has done \nso with a civility, a civility of which the Senator from Connecticut \nspoke, that could only come from someone so deeply committed to peace, \nhaving known war and having known the effort in the aftermath to create \npeace.\n  He served behind the Iron Curtain in the Department of State. No \nother Member of this Chamber has ever done that. He did in what is now \nSlovakia in times that were difficult, tenuous and, in the case of his \nmission, dangerous.\n  He brought to the Senate floor two of the most important treaties for \nthe control of nuclear weapons in our history. And if we may think that \nat last we may have achieved a measure of control, Claiborne Pell will \nbe remembered as the person who brought them forth as a common \nunderstanding of this body, not a contentious, not a ragged, not a \nnarrow, but a firm commitment that the other nation involved could \naccept because of that unanimity.\n  Other Senators wish to speak. I will only say, and I hope I can \nclaim, I hope the junior Senator will not be amiss, that by rights, he \nis a New Yorker. His father represented Manhattan, a district in \nManhattan, in the House of Representatives. His father was chairman of \nthe New York County Democratic Committee, a most honored and, at times, \nadvantage not of which some of us still admire and respect and hope to \ndo.\n  It is typical, as the junior Senator said, that when the Pell Grants, \nthat great beneficence, came to the moment when it was to be enacted, \nit was the Senator from New York, my revered former colleague, Senator \nJacob K. Javits, who said they ought to be named for the Senator who \nhas made them possible--Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island.\n  It is much too early to say we will miss him. He is still very much \namong \n\n[[Page S 12559]]\nus. He will not for a moment leave public service. In this time to \nspeak to the extraordinary achievement of this Senator, I would not be \namiss, I hope, and I am sure I will not, to mention Nuala, without whom \nit could not possibly have taken place.\n  Mr. President, with great respect to my colleague who sits right \nbefore me now, I thank him for all those things, and yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                      Honored to Serve the People\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just a few hours ago, in his very typical \nmanner, Claiborne Pell addressed the people of the State that he has \nserved so nobly and so well to announce his decision not to seek \nfurther election opportunity to represent the people of Rhode Island. \nAnd then just a few moments ago, he talked to this institution and its \nrepresentatives and to the people of the country about his sense of the \nmeaning of the institution of the U.S. Senate and about how he has been \nhonored to serve the people of Rhode Island for these past years in \nadvancing not just their causes but the causes of our Nation.\n  It is a powerful example, Mr. President. All of us should take just a \nfew moments to reflect on the career of this extraordinary Senator and \nhis life of public service in a world where very often the idea of \nserving the public is dismissed or disdained or ridiculed or condemned.\n  We marvel at this extraordinary man and the totality of his lifetime, \nhis service in wartime in the Coast Guard, his years in the Foreign \nService with great distinction, which have been commented on so well by \nour friend and colleague from New York and others, and his \nextraordinary service in the U.S. Senate.\n  As one who has shared his party label, I would be quick to join with \nthose on the other side of the aisle who always found Claiborne Pell \nwas committed to advancing the causes of the people he represented in \nRhode Island and all Americans, and did it in a way that brought us \ntogether and achieved the greatest support.\n  Mr. President, today we honor the people of his State as well, the \npeople of Rhode Island, because for these many years, they have sent \nthis extraordinary man to the U.S. Senate. His service is a powerful \nreflection of their values, of the causes which they hold dear, of the \nhigh ideals by which they are motivated and what this institution is \nreally about. We honor the people of Rhode Island for the man they have \nselected to serve them so well in the U.S. Senate.\n\n  I join with others who commend Senator Pell for his extraordinary \ncontributions and his innovations in so many different areas of public \npolicy. I think if I asked the Senator right now on this important day \nif he had in his pocket a small notebook that would indicate the number \nof days that the children of America spend in school versus the number \nof days that the children of Japan spend in school versus the number of \ndays that the people of Germany spend in school, he would have it. I \ntake note now, as I am looking over at my very good, valued, and dear \nfriend, that I think he has just pulled that notebook out of his \npocket.\n  Does the Senator care to respond so that we can put into the Record \none more time just what those figures are? I think it is useful \ninformation, and there is nobody who displays it with such commitment \nas the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, in the United States, we have 180 days a \nyear school; in Sweden, there are 200; in the Soviet Union, 210; in \nCanada, 200; in Thailand, 220; in Japan, 240; in Italy, 213. We are way \ndown the list.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I do not have to recite the Senator's \ncommitment in the area of the education of the young people of this \ncountry. I think all of us can see here, all of us who have been \nhonored to serve on the Education Subcommittee which he has championed \nand led over these many years, that this is not just a public policy \nissue for him. This is a commitment, a deep commitment, one that \ncontinues with him every single hour of every single day.\n  I will just address the Senate for a moment about the value the \nSenator has placed on education, and about some of the innovative \ninitiatives he has taken over his extraordinary life.\n  Mr. President, today in Rhode Island, in my State, and in all of our \nStates represented here, there are millions of young people whose hopes \nand dreams will be achieved because of the work in education by Senator \nPell as chairman of the Education Subcommittee for so many years, \nbecause of his dedication and his commitment, and because of his \ntenacity and his willingness to bring various groups together, from the \nyoungest of children in the early Head Start programs, to pupils in the \nhigh schools of this country, to students in the colleges throughout \nthis land. Millions of Americans perhaps do not know the name of \nClaiborne Pell, but their lives have been forever changed because of \nhis service and commitment in the field of education.\n  So I think I speak for all the parents of Massachusetts when I say: \nThank you, Senator Pell, for the work that you have done in education.\n  I also had the good fortune to serve on the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee when Senator Pell--again, in a bipartisan way with Senator \nJavits--began the initiative that has continued on and enhanced and \nenriched the lives of so many of our citizens through the creation of \nthe National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities. He understood \nthat the greatest days of any civilization are recognized over history \nby respect and support for the arts and humanities, more than through \nthe use of force and weaponry.\n  He has made that case so well and so eloquently and provided such \nleadership in those areas. I can remember being here as a young Member \nof the Senate when the Senate took up the Seabed Treaty, to try to \nprevent nuclear weapon from being planted in the ocean bottoms. Even \nthough the Soviet Union and United States had not done so, we were \nmoving technologically to the point where each nation could have done \nso. The Senator was ahead of his time. Even in the height of the cold \nwar, he was able to achieve accomplishments and agreements in \nanticipation of new types of technology. What a difference that has \nmade.\n  Mr. President, reference has been made here about Nuala Pell, and I \nwant to join in saying that I know that Claiborne and Nuala are such a \nstrong team for Rhode Island and such wonderful, loving, caring friends \nto President Kennedy, to my brother Bob, and to all the members of our \nfamily. I commend their four children--Herbert, Christopher, Dallas, \nand Julia--and their five grandchildren, who have brought so much joy \nto their family, and who will always be proud of Senator Pell's \nextraordinary service to the country. He has been the kind of Senator \nthat all of us hope to be able to be compared to.\n  So, Claiborne, we admire your service. We know that you will continue \nto be involved in public life in the years ahead, and we are grateful \nfor all that you have done--not just for your State but for the Nation, \nwhich I know you have loved and continue to love, and that you have \nserved so well.\n\n\n                   Tribute To Senator Claiborne Pell\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I want to join the others who are paying \ntribute to our colleague, who has announced today that he will not seek \nreelection. I heard Senator Chafee say the Senate today is a better \nplace because of Senator Pell. I do not know that the Senate is a \nbetter place than the day Claiborne Pell arrived, but it is true that \nhe has improved the quality of life around here by his conduct. And \nwhat is unquestionably true is that the Nation is a better place \nbecause of Claiborne Pell's service.\n  We use the term ``public servant'' rather freely around here, more \nfreely than sometimes we should. We apply it to anyone who holds public \noffice. A man who died just a few weeks ago, who succeeded Averell \nHarriman as head of the Marshall plan in Western Europe, Milton Katz, \ntold me one time that there are two kinds of politicians: Those who \nseek office because they want to be whatever it is--Senator, Governor, \nPresident, whatever the office--and those who seek office because of \nwhat the office can do. There is a little bit of both in all of us. But \nClaiborne Pell is there because he wants to serve the public. It is \nevident in everything he does. \n\n[[Page S 12560]]\n\n  Someone--I forget who--used the word ``civility.'' We hear that a \ngreat deal these days. But we do not hear much genuine civility. There \nis excessive partisanship. I think one of the changes that I have \nseen--and I am sure Senator Pell would agree--in the 21 years that I \nhave served in either the House or the Senate, is that we have become \nmore partisan. I think, frankly, we serve the Nation less well when we \nbecome excessively partisan. That has not been Clay Pell's style. As \nhas already been referred to, because of his contributions and what he \nhas done in the field of education, millions of Americans are better \noff.\n  The National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for \nthe Humanities are somewhat controversial today, but some day we are \ngoing to be remembered not for the aircraft carriers we build or the \nhighways we build, but we are going to be remembered for our \nsymphonies, for our works of art, for other things like that.\n  In the international field, the Arms Control Disarmament Agency, Clay \nPell is one of the authors. The United Nations, he was one of the \nalternate delegates to San Francisco. He has been a strong supporter of \nthe theory that we have to work collectively with a community of \nnations. If we do not want to be the policemen of the world, to use the \noverworked phrase, we have to work with other countries. Clay Pell has \nrecognized that. There is a whole host of things.\n  The great tribute we can pay to Clay Pell is not these words that we \nuse on the floor here, inadequate as they are. It is by seeing that we \nreally do in the field of education what we ought to do, that we get \nthe communities of nations to work together, whether it is Bosnia or \nthe Middle East, or wherever it is, that we work together. I hope we \nwill pay the real tribute to Clay Pell that he would like, and that is \nto see that educational opportunity is here and that the communities of \nnations work together.\n  Mr. President, before I yield the floor, my colleague from Iowa, \nSenator Harkin, handed me a note, indicating he would like me to yield \n1 minute to him so he can lay down an amendment before 5 o'clock. I \nyield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President----\n  Mr. SIMON. I do not yield the floor. I yield 1 minute to the Senator \nfrom Iowa, then I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator needs to obtain unanimous consent \nif he wishes to hold the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield the floor \nfor 1 minute to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object. I would \nlike to hear what the amendment is. I understand it is irrelevant and \ndoes not concern what we are doing here and is not germane and should \nnot be considered on this bill. I would like to hear what the amendment \nis.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just want to lay it down before 5 o'clock. I will do it \nafter 5 o'clock, if that is the case. I had a position under the \nunanimous-consent agreement to offer an amendment to the DOD bill. I \nwas going to offer the amendment. I will do it after.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the amendment has to be relevant. If it \nis on welfare, which I understand, it is not relevant.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I did not mean to interrupt the \nproceedings. I thank the Senator from Illinois. I did not know there \nwould be an objection. I will offer the amendment later.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I do not know anything about the amendment. \nI was just trying to accommodate a colleague. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                        Praise for Senator Pell\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to join those who are here today \nto speak their praises and feelings for the senior Senator from Rhode \nIsland. Many eloquent speakers have preceded me. I do not intend to try \nto compete with them or make remarks of that nature.\n  I have served some 24 years and perhaps the only one that served with \nthe Senator across the table from the other side during this period of \ntime. There is no person that I have come more to admire, respect, or \nfeel affection for.\n  There are many who have admiration for many others and there are \nthose we have great respect for. There are some, sometimes too few, for \nwhom we feel true friendship and compassion as an individual, someone \nwho we know is in love with life and in love with his job and in love \nwith the people that are around him. Senator Pell has all those \ncharacteristics. I know he has moved all Members in some way or another \nin that respect.\n  In the House, he served with the senior Senator from Vermont, Senator \nStafford. He and Senator Pell were a remarkable combination. I had the \nability for a time to be able to serve, too brief a time, in this \nSenate with him. During that period of time, I again took the \nadmiration and respect and affection that Senator Stafford held for him \nand carried it on in my own feelings.\n  What he and I and others have done in the many areas that are \ncritical to myself as well as to him, whether it be in education or the \nEndowment for the Arts, but most poignantly I will remember our recent \ntrip to Africa where he and his wife Nuala and I and my wife went to \nnations far away from here. The love and affection that the people of \nthose countries have for them demonstrates that his knowledge and his \nwork is not only appreciated here in this country but throughout the \nworld.\n  It is with some sadness I am here to speak in this kind of praise in \na way, but I will miss him and will miss his service. I wish him all \npossible good health in the days ahead and look forward to working with \nhim as our monitor from afar.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                        Praise for Senator Pell\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I realize the hour is getting late and the \nhour of 5 o'clock will quickly come. We have unanimous-consent \nrequests, so I ask that at a later time I will be able to extend my \nremarks about our colleague from Rhode Island and his decision today to \nnot seek a seventh term in the U.S. Senate.\n  Let me in 1 minute or so, because others are seeking recognition \nbefore 5 o'clock I presume, join the voices of others who have already \nexpressed what I described to my colleague the bittersweet sentiments I \nfeel at this moment.\n  On the one hand, joy for my colleague and friend who is looking \nforward to new opportunities and new horizons after the term ends in \nJanuary 1997, but also, just as quickly, the sadness that we will not \nhave the pleasure of his company here in this body.\n  Let me just say, Mr. President, I know a lot is talked about --his \nbackground and record--and I will get into that at a later time. I \ncommend my colleague from Rhode Island for what he said on the floor of \nthe Senate. It has become almost predictable as people announce \nretirement, to somehow simultaneously renounce the political process \none way or another.\n  I commend our colleague from Rhode Island for talking positively \nabout this process. This institution struggles every day to improve the \nquality of lives of people in this country, and I certainly do not have \nany quarrel with the people who make a decision to do something else \nwith their lives, but I wish many times they might think about doing so \nnot at the expense of the very institution that they spent years \nserving.\n  My colleague from Rhode Island has made that point in his remarks \ntoday about his pride of service in this institution, about his pride \nof service in the public sector, trying to help people out.\n  Mr. President, I will extend these remarks later. To my friend and \ncolleague for many years from Rhode Island, I congratulate him, wish \nhim well, and look forward to many years of close association with him.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as the manager of the bill, the vote is \nscheduled for 5 o'clock. I want to say that I have come to speak about \nmy friend from Rhode Island. I ask unanimous consent that we postpone \nthat vote until 5:30. We have a period for the conducting of routine \nmorning business so we all might make our expressions while our friend \nis on the floor. I have cleared this with the leadership on our side. I \nassume there is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator from Connecticut wishes to continue.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alaska. I wish I \nhad \n\n[[Page S 12561]]\nknown this yesterday. I might have delayed coming back a little bit \nlater. I still would have had some remarks about my colleague from \nRhode Island.\n  I will not take a great deal of time because others want to speak, \nand I will reserve more detailed remarks until later. It was noted by \nour colleague from Illinois, about our friend from Rhode Island, that \nhe has conducted his public career and life in a way that many would \nlike to see more people in public life serve, and that is with a note \nof civility.\n  I think it is of record that the Senator from Rhode Island, in seven \nelections to the U.S. Senate, has never once--never once--attacked a \npolitical opponent that he has run against in an ad or a speech.\n  I suspect that may be a record in this place, at least by today's \nstandards where many of us spend half of our budgets going after our \nopponents. It is a worthwhile to note that he never lost an election, \nthe Senator from Rhode Island, but always won them by talking about \nhimself, what he believed in, his vision for his State and the country. \nMy hope is maybe that time will return again in this Nation, where \npolitics may be conducted on a more civil basis.\n  Mr. President, any one of four or five accomplishments of the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island could be tantamount to a career for any single \nMember. As has been noted already, the Senator from Rhode Island, of \ncourse, is responsible for the Pell grant program. If you did nothing \nelse in your service but establish the Pell grant program, you could \ncall your career a success. Thousands, hundreds of thousands of young \npeople in this country who never would have ever been able to have had \na higher education have done so because of the Pell grant program.\n  Had you merely been responsible for the establishment of the National \nEndowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for Humanities, that in \nitself would have been, I think, a significant contribution to this \ncountry.\n  Had you done nothing else but establish the Northeast corridor, had \nyou done nothing else but develop the ban on the testing of nuclear \nweapons on the sea beds, that could have been a significant \naccomplishment and a record of tremendous achievement. But our \ncolleague from Rhode Island has done all of those things and much more.\n  On environmental issues he was way ahead of his time. On the first \nenvironmental conference ever held internationally, only one U.S. \nSenator showed up at it. That was the Senator from Rhode Island. That \nwas years and years ago. Before anybody was even talking about these \nissues, the Senator from Rhode Island understood the value and \nimportance of protecting our natural resources.\n  So, Mr. President, on a host of issues, Claiborne Pell of Rhode \nIsland has fulfilled, I think, the description of what a U.S. Senator \nought to be--a person who not only represents his State and \nconstituents but also represents the national interest and the \ninterests of mankind. In over 36 years he has done that with great \ndistinction and with a degree of calm, never raising his voice, a \nperson who always sought out the better nature of people in debate and \ndiscussion. It is a role of U.S. Senator that ought to be a model for \nall who serve in this body, to bring to this Chamber a degree of \nelegance and sophistication, a degree of great concern for his fellow \nman.\n  My relationship with Claiborne Pell goes back two generations. He \nserved with my father, as the distinguished Senator from South Carolina \nand a few others who remain in this body have done. That is more than \nsome people should have to tolerate, is two generations of my family, I \nsuppose one might say. But not only that, I also point out my brother-\nin-law was the finance chairman in the last campaign of the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island, Bernard Buonanno, from Providence, RI. So our family \nrelationships go back not just to service in this Chamber but also \nthrough a political relationship as well.\n  I am quite confident, Mr. President, Claiborne Pell will serve this \ncountry in many different ways in the years to come. I know I could ask \nhim at this very moment whether he is carrying the U.N. Charter with \nhim, and I suspect he can reach in his pocket and produce that U.N. \nCharter. I am watching and, as I see him, he is reaching in his pocket \nand there it is. I know I can ask him to do that any day of the week, \nany day of the year. Claiborne Pell carries the U.N. Charter with him \nevery single day because of his deep affection and understanding of the \nvalue of an international body to try to bring people together to \nresolve their difficulties.\n  So I am confident we will hear more from Claiborne Pell in the years \nto come. Sadly, it will not be in this Chamber once this term has \nended. But I join with others in commending him for more than three \ndecades of remarkable service and to thank the people of Rhode Island, \nour neighboring State, fellow New England State, for having the good \nsense and wisdom to send him back to the Senate over and over again \nover the years, and to wish him and his lovely wife Luala well in the \ncoming years. I look forward to a longstanding relationship with him.\n  I congratulate him. He is truly a Senate man.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                             Claiborne Pell\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I join with those paying tribute to our \nesteemed colleague and friend, Claiborne Pell. I do not think there is \na stronger argument against term limits than the personage of Claiborne \nPell. I know it is fashionable to talk about term limits these days, \nlimits to the amount of time people can spend here. I have always been \nopposed to that, and I think, looking at the contributions that \nClaiborne Pell has made to this country and to the Senate over the last \n35 years, it is once again a reminder of why the people of the United \nStates ought to have the right to return people to office if they so \ndesire and not to have some artificial kind of time limit put upon \nservice to our country and to this institution.\n  Certainly Claiborne Pell's first 12 years were marked by successes \nhere, but so were his second 12 years and his third 12 years. Much has \nbeen said about Claiborne Pell's contributions to education: The \nNational Endowment of the Arts, the National Endowment for the \nHumanities, so many other things he has sponsored, promoted, pushed \nthrough the Congress, got signed into law, which have in so many ways \nadvanced the concept of American civilization.\n  It has been my privilege to have served for the last 11 years with \nClaiborne Pell here in the Senate, 9 of those years on the Human \nResources Committee. To watch Senator Pell work is, indeed, I think a \nreal lesson, as I think the Senator from Connecticut just alluded to, a \nreal lesson in gentility, civility, refinement, and purpose.\n  We can have purpose here in the Senate. We can advance our concepts \nand our causes resolutely and forthrightly. But we can do it with the \ngreatest degree of civility and respect for the views and the opinions \nof others. No one exemplifies that kind of procedure and process in \ndebate more than Claiborne Pell. Resolute he has been, all his life, in \nadvancing those issues so dear to him--in education, in the arts, \nhumanities, foreign relations. He has been resolute. And, if he did not \nwin the first time, he came back the second time. If he did not win, \nthen he came back the third and the fourth time. But never with any \ndegree of rancor or bitterness, never with any degree of pity or trying \nto second guess what might have been. Claiborne Pell picked up the \nball, and if he did not win he moved it forward until the next time.\n  It is that kind of resoluteness that I admire so much in the \npersonage of Claiborne Pell. He is truly one of the giants in the \nhistory of the U.S. Senate and one of the giants in the history of the \ndevelopment, as I said earlier, of our concept of American \ncivilization.\n  Much has been said about Claiborne's promotion of education in this \ncountry. How many people in this country have been educated who came \nfrom meager circumstances, whose parents may have been impoverished, \nborn on the wrong side of the tracks, had everything going against \nthem, but because of a Pell grant were able to get an education and to \ngo on and make something of their lives? We run into \n\n[[Page S 12562]]\nthem every day. I daresay, probably they all know about Pell grants. \nMaybe not too many of them know who Pell was.\n  I think the best legacy we can leave to our friend and our colleague \nis to make sure that our country never forgets the contributions of \nthis very quiet, distinguished, resolute, compassionate, and concerned \nAmerican citizen, Claiborne Pell, to make sure that, as we commit \nourselves to the remainder of this century, this millennium, and as we \nmove into the next millennium, that education in this country takes its \nplace first and foremost in our deliberations here in this body and \nthat we continue to ensure that education in this country follows the \nleadership and the guidance set down by Claiborne Pell.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, I also have been privileged to work with \nSenator Pell on something other than education. And I will make note of \nit here because I think it is vitally important. It is an issue of \nwhether or not we will open up our medical system and medical research \nto new concepts and new ideas, perhaps even to go back in time and \nrecapture some of the practices in medical arts that we have forgotten.\n  Claiborne Pell has been a leader in what maybe now has become known \nas complementary medicine, alternative medicine, but new approaches in \ntrying to discern or fathom the illnesses that beset mankind. I have \nspent many times and many hours talking with Senator Pell about this \nissue. I have learned a lot from him about it. He has given me reams of \nmaterial to read about it, and for which I thank him. And he has \nadvanced my whole thinking on this issue of perhaps looking at medicine \nin a different light, thinking about it in different ways. And only \nnow, today, are we seeing the fruits of his years of involvement in \nthat endeavor.\n  When new approaches are being talked about, when new forms of \nmedicine, new approaches in holistic medicine, when the conjunction \nbetween mind and body health are now being thought of as a legitimate \napproach to the healing process, Claiborne Pell was way ahead of his \ntime. But now he can take solace and a measure of pride in what he has \ndone in education.\n  In some other fields, I must say, Mr. President, Claiborne Pell can \nnow take a great measure of pride in what he has done to move the \nconcepts of healing and the healing process in medicine forward in this \ncountry. It is something that not too many people recognize Claiborne \nPell for. I would not want this moment to pass on the Senate floor or \nthis time to pass without making note of that for the record.\n  I just want to assure Senator Pell that those of us who have been \ninvolved with him in this endeavor will do all we can to continue that \nlegacy that he started so many years ago in the field of healing in \nthis country.\n  I guess I would just sum it up by saying that really has been his \nwhole life's work here, and that has been one of healing, of bringing \npeople together, of understanding. Whether it has been the League of \nNations or the United Nations, which he was an alternate delegate to, \nor education, humanities, arts, it has been a healing process, bringing \npeople together, understanding, advancing the concept of American \ncivilization.\n  Mr. President, when you talk about a civilized America, you can sum \nit up by just saying two words, ``Claiborne Pell.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, thank you, I thank Senator Pell, for \naffording us a few moments to be able to speak about our colleague.\n  Mr. President, what a pleasure and what a privilege it has been to \nserve with Claiborne Pell. About 2 months ago, after one of our late-\nnight sessions, I had a chance to give him a lift home. And in the \ncourse of that we had a chat about the incipient decision that he was \nfacing. And I was struck as he sort of chatted through the options and \nthe choices available to him how totally compelled he was by the notion \nthat there was work left undone and this incredible sense of \nresponsibility that he felt to the country, to Rhode Island. That is \nwhat weighed on him in the decision, not a lot of the other \nconsiderations that many people tally up on a yellow legal pad and \nweigh. But it is characteristic of Claiborne Pell that it was, above \nall, his sense of duty, the sense of personal responsibility that \ncompelled him to enter public life in the first place and that has \nguided these remarkable 36 years that he has served as a U.S. Senator.\n  I daresay to my colleagues that if there were 59 other Claiborne \nPells in the Senate, and perhaps even 99, as a wishful thought, we \nwould not have half the conflict, a quarter of the conflict, maybe any \nconflict. We would certainly not be looking toward confrontation in the \ndays ahead, perhaps even the train wreck everybody talks about, because \nabove all Claiborne Pell is guided by a sense of decency and by common \nsense, by good old New England common sense, that says you can work it \nout. And I think that example I hope is something that will rub off on \nthe Senate in the days ahead.\n  Others have spoken about his many accomplishments, and there are many \na lot of the people do not know that much about because, again, \nuncharacteristically, compared to the norms of modern American \npolitics, he is self-effacing beyond anybody else's capacity in the \nSenate. He is somebody who believes simply in doing what is right and \ndoing it in the sense of responsibility and decency that guides him.\n  Senator Harkin wondered out loud about those who have been educated \nby Senator Pell. Millions of Americans have been educated on Pell \ngrants. One-fifth of the population of this country has gone to school \nbecause of this U.S. Senator. Sixty-three billion dollars has been \ninvested in the future of the country in educating people and helping \nto churn the engine of our economy and create the remarkable \ntechnological and research and development capacity of this great \nNation. Most people, if they thought of the engine of America, probably \nwill not immediately associate it with the Pell grant or with his \nefforts. But that is, in and of itself, an extraordinary \naccomplishment.\n  In addition to that, he has been the principal Senate sponsor of the \nNational Endowment for the Arts and Humanities, recognizing the \nextraordinary linkage between a nation and a civilization in its \nsupport for the arts and its literacy. He was the author of the \nNational Sea Grant College Program, and a founding member who served \nfor years as the Senate cochairman of the Helsinki Commission. He has \nbeen one of the strongest proponents of arms control in the U.S. \nSenate, and as a member of the Senate observer group and as chairman of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, has played a principal role in helping \nto move this country to a reasonable arms control policy.\n  He can take credit, though he personally never does, for bringing to \nthe Senate for approval the INF Treaty, the CFE Treaty, the Threshold \nTest Ban Treaty, and he took the lead in Senate action in favor of the \nSea Ban Armaments Control Treaty and Environmental Modification \nConvention. He also authored legislation in 1994 that revitalized and \nstrengthened that, and he has been the principal author of legislation \nimposing sanctions against the development and use of chemical and \nbiological weapons.\n  In 1994, he authored legislation to place tough sanctions on \ncountries and individuals involved in nuclear weapons proliferation.\n  Mr. President, I have been privileged in the 11 years that I have \nserved here to serve with Senator Pell both as ranking member and as \nchairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Interestingly enough, my relationship with Senator Pell did not begin \nwith my entry as a freshman on the Foreign Relations Committee. Twenty-\nfour years ago when I first came back from Vietnam, Senator Fulbright \ninvited me to testify before the committee. And it was Senator Pell who \nwas among those on the committee and in the Senate most prepared to \nlisten and to take the position of courage with respect to the \ndifficult choices America faced at that period of time.\n  I will personally never forget his warm welcome to me as a young \nreturning naval officer and his then brave and perhaps ill-advised \nsuggestion that I might someday consider \n\n[[Page S 12563]]\nrunning for the U.S. Senate and that he even hoped I might serve with \nhim on the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  I am confident it was one of those comments that neither he nor I \nthought might come true or had a sense of reality. But it has been a \ngreat privilege that in fact it did and that we have served together.\n  Let me just close by saying a word about his leadership on that \ncommittee. Senator Pell led quietly. He led with grace. He led with \nremarkable integrity and with a sense of everybody's place. Unlike some \nhere who are very quick to resort to parliamentary rules rather than \nlet the power of reason or of dialog work its will and somehow quash \nthat capacity, Senator Pell always permitted every voice on the \ncommittee to be heard to the point of exhaustion--usually ours, not \nhis. He showed patience where patience had been tested, and he was \nalways, always civil, even in the most trying moments.\n  There is no one on the Foreign Relations Committee on either side of \nthe aisle who would ever question the full measure of this man's \ndecency or of his commitment to the public dialog. He has shown an \nextraordinary public integrity, an extraordinary commitment to the best \nideals of public service, an extraordinary commitment and sense of duty \nand public responsibility. I think that all of us, Rhode Island \nparticularly, will understand that with his departure from the Senate, \nthe Senate and the country lose a voice for peace, a voice for \nreasonableness, a voice for the environment, a voice for human rights, \na voice for civil rights, a voice for women, and above all a voice for \neducation and for the future.\n  We will miss his service and the quality of his character enormously. \nI yield the floor.\n  (At the request of Mr. Dole, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n\n                  retirement of senator claiborne pell\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. I rise today to join my colleagues in paying \ntribute to our friend from Rhode Island, Senator Claiborne Pell, who \ntoday announced his plans to retire from the Senate. I would like to \ncommend Senator Pell for his years of service in the Senate and to wish \nhim much happiness in retirement.\n  I had the pleasure of serving on the Foreign Relations Committee \nduring Senator Pell's chairmanship. I know that it comes as no surprise \nto my colleagues that he was a fair and cordial chairman who treated \nRepublicans and Democrats alike with great respect. He was a reliable \nally on issues on which we agreed and an equally reliable adversary on \nthose issues on which we disagreed. But whether we agreed or disagreed, \nhe never deviated from his standards of decency and character. I have \nthe utmost respect for how he conducted himself throughout his \ndistinguished career.\n  My colleagues have spoken of the many accomplishments of the Senator \nover his 36-year career. I will only highlight the fact that he was a \nforeign policy pillar throughout his career--from being a witness to \nthe signing of the original United Nations Charter to guiding through \nratification of landmark fishery treaties. The Senate's institutional \nknowledge and expertise in these matters will be greatly depleted when \nSenator Pell departs. He will be missed.\n\n\n                      best wishes to senator pell\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to offer my best wishes to our \ncolleague, Senator Claiborne Pell. I know that many of my colleagues \nhave already spoken eloquently about Senator Pell and his \naccomplishments. But, I wanted to express my gratitude for what Senator \nPell has meant to me, to foreign policy and to the creation of an \nopportunity structure for the students of this country.\n  For me, Senator Pell serves as a model for commitment and conviction. \nHe's been committed to the people of Rhode Island for 36 years. That \nkind of commitment is hard to find. The contributions he's made over \nthat time are enormous and should empower all Americans to work hard \nfor what they believe in.\n  Mr. President, Senator Pell has been actively involved in foreign \naffairs. As the senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee since 1981, he helped create the international institutions \nthat helped us to win the cold war.\n  And he's been a leader in the effort to adapt these institutions to \nmeet the challenges of the post-cold-war effort. He was instrumental in \ncrafting arms control treaties and has been one of the Senate's \nstrongest and most consistent voices for human rights throughout the \nworld.\n  But, I probably know him best for his work as a member of the Labor \nCommittee. He's been a pioneer for education and has made an enormous \ncontribution to create an opportunity ladder for all Americans through \nPell grants.\n  Fifty-four million people have been educated through Pell grants. \nThat's a lot of people. That's a lot of young minds and a lot of \nMaryland students who can now have access to the American dream.\n  Students and their parents are always worried about how they will pay \nfor education. Senator Pell made it possible. He's been there to make \nsure our education needs were being met and that this Nation's students \nknew they had a friend in the U.S. Senate.\n  He's been a voice for students who would have been left out and left \nbehind. And he's been a voice for those who had no voice.\n  This kind of contribution cannot be truly appreciated on a resume or \non a list of legislative accomplishments. It can only be seen in the \nopportunity that others now have to create a better life for themselves \nand their families; and in turn, they will contribute to their \ncommunities and their country.\n  I want to thank Senator Pell for what he has meant to the Nation, to \nforeign policy, and to the students of this country. We are blessed to \nhave his legacy.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, when I arrived in the Senate in 1972, \nthe Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Pell, had already achieved a record \nwhich made him known as one of the best and brightest, one of the most \naccomplished Senators. In the ensuing 23 years, he has built that \nreputation into a legend.\n  Mr. President, we have heard detailed here by my colleagues these \nlast few moments the details of that record--Pell grants, foreign \nrelations. I will not repeat that record except to say it is historic \nin proportions and outstanding in its quality and its merit.\n  The remarkable thing to me, Mr. President, is the character of the \nman who has achieved the record. And I would like to take note today, \nas Senator Pell announces his retirement, of the kind of person and the \nkind of civility which he brought not only to this Chamber but to \npolitics in general.\n  Mr. President, at this difficult time in American political history, \nat a time when a former Governor of New Jersey announced that he would \nnot run for the Senate in large part because of the lack of civility in \nthis body, because of the lack of civility in politics, I think it is \nimportant and appropriate we take note of the career of Senator Pell \nand what he was able to bring to this body in terms of civility.\n  In all those terms of running for office, always very successful, \nusually by huge margins, it is just absolutely astonishing and \nremarkable that he never said anything bad or negative about his \nopponents. It shows, Mr. President, that you need not be negative in \norder to be successful. In all these years serving with Senator Pell in \nthis body, there has never been the slightest deviation from those \nstandards of friendship, respect, courtesy, and warmth of character \nwhich was unfailing in even the most difficult of circumstances.\n  You do not amass a record like Senator Pell has amassed without \nmixing it up on very difficult and very controversial issues, and yet \nhe was able to do that while at the same time having the love and \nrespect and the warmth and the feelings from all of his colleagues.\n  This will unquestionably be a lesser place when Senator Pell is gone. \nNuala Pell, his wonderful, wonderful wife will certainly make it a \nlesser place in the pantheon of Senate wives because she in her way \nadds the same thing to the Senate wives that Senator Pell does to the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, I just hope that we can take example from his service, \nnot \n\n[[Page S 12564]]\nonly in what he has accomplished in terms of things for the Nation, \nwhich have been very well detailed and, as I say, which constitute a \nlegend in itself, but the quality of his character and the quality of \nhis service and his relationship with his colleagues. If we could just \nsomehow take that and bottle it and keep it and profit by it and \nemulate it, we would have a much better and different country and \nSenate.\n  I salute Senator Pell on his outstanding record of service to the \nNation.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I sought the floor a half hour ago in \norder to make some remarks about my friend, and I am delighted to have \na chance to do so. I am reminded of a friend of mine who asked me once \nwhy we made these speeches in the Chamber when people make \nannouncements, and he told me that I should be careful because ``he \nain't gone yet.''\n  In terms of this announcement today, I share a lot of the remarks and \nfeelings that have been expressed today. My experience goes back a long \nways with Senator Pell. He will recall when we flew down to Caracas for \nthe Law of the Sea Conference, with his bride Nuala sitting between us, \nand how we talked about a lot of things.\n  That is more years than either one of us can say, but I do remember \nthat discussion. We talked about Social Security, Mr. President. And we \nwere on our way to the Law of the Sea Conference. I remember talking to \nSenator Pell about other things--the National Endowment for the Arts--\nas we went to meetings of the Arms Control Observer Group in Geneva and \nhow Senator Pell's great stature in the foreign relations area had led \nto so many successes in dealing with the Russians, the Soviets really \nat that time, with regard to arms control.\n  As we continue to deal with our friend here in these months ahead--\nand I do recognize the fact that the Senator from Rhode Island will be \nwith us for well over a year--I want the Senate to know that many of us \nwho came here as youngsters from the far west and me from the far north \nremember so well the great grace with which the Senator from Rhode \nIsland and his wife from Rhode Island welcomed us here, how they have \nhelped our wives and invited us to their home and made us feel part of \nthe Senate family.\n  Notwithstanding all of the other accomplishments that have been \nmentioned on the floor today about Senator Pell, I think he will be \nremembered as a man who had great respect for the Senate, who wanted \nthe Senate family to have a quality of life and make being in the \nSenate a different experience for those of us who come here with our \nwives from great distances. I congratulate him for making his statement \ntoday so far in advance so that we can all cherish the time we will \nhave with him in the months to come.\n  Mr. President, I think it is now time for the vote on my bill.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Will the \nSenator yield for 2 minutes?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I might say to Senators, I have already \nextended time for a vote on the defense bill by a half hour in order \nfor these proceedings, and I have agreed that we would not extend it \nfurther. It is time now for a vote on the defense appropriations bill. \nI call for a vote.\n\n\n             DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport S. 1087. The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1087) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1996, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resume consideration of the bill.\n\n\n              THE B-1 BOMBER--A COST EFFECTIVE INVESTMENT\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today the Senate will pass S. 1087, the \nfiscal year 1996 Department of Defense [DOD] appropriations bill, and \nsoon will pass S. 1026, the fiscal year 1996 DOD authorization bill. I \nam pleased to support both pieces of legislation. Both bills call for a \nfull investment in the B-1 bomber in the coming fiscal year--a clear \nreflection of the Senate's wise and strong support for the bomber. As a \nstrong supporter of this important component of our long-range bomber \nforce, I believe this is great news for those who support both a strong \nnational defense and a sound fiscal policy.\n  One of the critical military force structure issues that the U.S. \nSenate has considered in recent years is the funding level needed to \nsustain an effective heavy bomber force. In my view, the continued \neffectiveness of our long-range bomber fleet rests on a full investment \nin the Conventional Mission Upgrade Program [CMUP] for the B-1 bomber \n[B-1B]--the Lancer. The B-1B is critical to our Nation's bomber force \nstructure.\n  As my colleagues know, the B-1B originally was designed as a \nmultirole bomber during the cold war, with its primary mission being \nits capability to deliver a nuclear payload. Today, in response to \nthese dramatic changes and new demands on our post-cold-war national \nsecurity goals, the United States must commit fewer resources to \nnuclear deterrence in favor of advancing conventional capabilities. Our \nbomber force now must fill a dual role. First, it must continue its \ncommitment to nuclear deterrence missions. Second, our bombers must \nadapt to serve conventional needs.\n  Of the three heavy bombers--the B-52, the B-1B, and the B-2-the B-1B \nhas the greatest potential to serve both nuclear and conventional \nmissions. I have been a strong supporter of the B--1B throughout the \nyears because it is one of the most versatile aircraft ever \nconstructed. This was the view of the Department of Defense when, as \npart of its 1993 Bottom-Up Review, it concluded that the B-1B \nrepresented the backbone of the heavy bomber force. Further, the \nPentagon believed that a full investment in the B-1B's conventional \ncapabilities was the most cost-effective method to maintaining a bomber \nforce structure capable of meeting our national security goals.\n  Over the years, I have talked to many associated with the B-1B--its \ndesigners, Pentagon strategists, and the dedicated men and women who \nfly and maintain this extraordinary aircraft. All believe in the B-1B \nand its place in our force structure. Yet, despite these glowing \nreviews, a skeptical Congress over the last several years has subjected \nthe B-1B to a series of performance evaluations and studies. The B-1B \nhas met each and every challenge.\n  The first congressionally mandated test was the Operational Readiness \nAssessment [ORA]. The purpose of this test--code-named the Dakota \nChallenge--was to determine if one B-1B wing, when provided fully with \nthe necessary spare parts, maintenance equipment, support crews, and \nlogistics equipment, could meet the Air Force mission availability rate \ngoal of 75 percent. Tasked to take on the Dakota Challenge was the 28th \nBomber Wing stationed at Ellsworth Air Force Base in Rapid City, SD. \nThe 28th Bomber Wing more than met the goal of the Dakota Challenge, \nachieving an extraordinary 84-percent mission capable rate.\n  Additionally, improvements were seen in other readiness indicators, \nincluding the 12-hour fix rate--a measure of how often a malfunctioning \naircraft can be repaired and returned to the air within one-half day. \nThe enormous success of the Dakota Challenge prompted Gen. John Michael \nLoh, commander of the Air Combat Command to state that the B-1B has \nestablished its title as ``a solid investment in our Nation's \ncapability to project power on a global scale.''\n  A second congressionally mandated study released this year was done \nby the Institute for Defense Analyses [IDA]. The IDA study represents \nperhaps the most in-depth, comprehensive analysis of the entire bomber \nfleet. This report examined the deployment options of our long-range \nheavy bomber forces--in association with additional tactical forces--\nunder the circumstances of two hypothetical, nearly simultaneous world \nconflicts. Under these circumstances, the IDA study found that the B-1B \nis not just mission-effective but cost-effective as well. The study \nconcluded that the B-1B could serve successfully as the centerpiece of \nAmerican airpower projection, while producing the highest return on our \ndefense investment. \n\n[[Page S 12565]]\n\n  The Dakota Challenge and the IDA study together made clear that an \ninvestment in the B-1B's conventional capabilities was the best \ninvestment in fiscal and national security terms. These congressionally \nmandated tests have changed the congressional view of the B-1B from one \nof skepticism to support. The DOD authorization and appropriations \nbills before us today reflect this wise shift. Specifically, the DOD \nappropriations bill would provide $407 million for the B-1B. This \nfunding includes support for research and development, modification \nprograms and of course, the Conventional Mission Upgrade Program.\n  What would all this funding do? It would enhance the B-1B in three \nkey ways. First of all, the B-1B would be outfitted with new precision \nweapons to bring added conventional lethality to the bomber. Second, \ncomputer upgrades would enable the B-1B to be ultimately capable of \ncarrying the new generation of smart weapons. Third, the B-1B would be \nequipped with state-of-the-art jam-resistant radio to allow the \naircraft to communicate with fighters and other support aircraft. In \naddition, upgrades would be provided to improve the B-1B's \nsurvivability in medium-high threat areas.\n  The end of the cold war has brought a world environment of \nunpredictability. New regional threats could occur with very little \nwarning. In this environment, we must look to our bomber force to \nquickly respond to conventional threats. By fully funding the CMUP for \nfiscal year 1996 and providing additional enhancements to make up for \nprior year delays, we can provide our bomber force better prepared to \nrespond to this dynamic world environment.\n  Mr. President, the people of Rapid City, SD, know well of the \neffectiveness and the importance of the B-1B to our national security. \nMany civilians in Rapid City have a family member, a friend, or a \nneighbor who serves in the 28th Bomber Wing--the men and women who \ncollectively are the backbone of our bomber fleet's backbone. They do \nmore than just keep the B-1B's flying. They firmly believe that the B-\n1B is a high quality aircraft, capable of being the centerpiece of the \nbomber fleet in the years to come. They were willing to put their \nbeliefs in their bomber to the test. Through the Dakota Challenge, they \nproved what they believed. And today, the 28th Bomber Wing's success is \nbeing recognized by the U.S. Senate, which will show its strongest \nsupport yet for the future conventional success of the B-1 bomber.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I intend to vote against the fiscal \nyear 1996 Department of Defense appropriations bill.\n  When most people talk about the budget, they talk about the cuts it \ncontains--cuts in programs that will hurt middle- and lower-income \nAmericans, cuts in taxes which will benefit the richest among us, cuts \nin education programs that will hinder our children's ability to carry \nAmerica into the 21st century.\n  While most areas of spending have been cut in the budget for next \nyear, the defense budget will receive a huge increase. President \nClinton recommended a budget which increased defense spending by \nroughly $25 billion over what we were told we needed just 1 year ago.\n  Apparently it was not enough. Even though the cold ear has ended, the \nUnited States is the only superpower left in the world, and democracy \nis flourishing where communism once prevailed, the House version of the \nbudget resolution boosted defense spending by another $7 billion for \nnext year. During conference, the House number survived. No \n``compromise by splitting the difference,'' just a total victory for \nthe House position. And so, in line with the budget resolution, this \nappropriations bill spends nearly $7 billion more on the defense budget \nthan the President requested.\n  This bill, Mr. President, underscores the misguided direction in \nwhich the new congressional leadership wants to take our Nation. It is \na direction which places a higher value on buying weapons we do not \nneed than on books for our children's education. It is a direction \nwhich says that buying more aircraft and helicopters than the Pentagon \nhas requested is more important for the American people than cleaning \nthe environment or preserving Medicare benefits.\n  We do need a strong national defense, but we can have one without the \nexcessive $7 billion increase in spending included in this bill.\n  The strength of our Nation, Mr. President, depends on more than the \nnumber of missiles we build and the aircraft we procure. It depends on \nhaving a well-educated work force, a clean environment, safe streets, a \nsound and strong economy.\n  We cannot afford to starve domestic needs so we can spend a billion-\nplus on an amphibious assault ship that isn't budgeted until the turn \nof the century, spend hundreds of millions more than the administration \nrequested for a national missile defense system, and spend billions of \ntax dollars for unrequested helicopters, aircraft, and other military \nequipment.\n  Where is our sense of priorities? What happened to our common sense?\n  The American people deserve better. And we need to make better \nchoices with their tax dollars.\n  We can and should start by opposing this bill.\n\n\n                  electronic commerce resource centers\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, if the chairman will allow me, I would like \nto engage him in a brief colloquy concerning the Electronic Commerce \nResource Center Program.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would be happy to engage in a colloquy \nwith the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I would say to the chairman that it has come \nto my attention that the House report accompanying the fiscal year 1996 \nDefense appropriations bill includes language which directs the \nSecretary of Defense to enter into a 5-year sole-source contract for \nthe establishment of a single, consolidated National Electronic \nCommerce Resource Center. Under the current program structure, two \nnonprofit organizations act as system integrators to coordinate \nactivities at the various Electronic Commerce Resource Centers located \nacross the country.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am familiar with the program and the \nHouse language has been brought to my attention as well.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I would say to the chairman that, as he \nknows, the current ECRC program is working well and has enabled the \ndevelopment of successful programs to transfer electronic commerce [EC] \nand electronic data interchange [EDI] technologies and processes to \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises. In the first quarter of 1995, for \nexample, the network trained over 4,000 business personnel and 1,300 \ngovernment personnel and provided services to approximately 1,800 \nbusiness and Department of Defense clients. Based on industry standards \nfor training and consulting services, it is estimated that this program \nhas saved U.S. businesses over $6 million during the first quarter of \n1995 alone.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned about the House effort, on a sole-\nsource basis, to alter the management and reporting relations that have \nsuccessfully served this program. While a single, consolidated National \nElectronic Commerce Resource Center is needed to coordinate the \nprogram's activities, such a center should be established on a \ncompetitive basis, not sole-sourced. Competition will ensure that the \ninterests of both the Department of Defense and the American taxpayer \nare best served.\n  As the chairman knows, I have an amendment I was planning to offer \nthat would require full and open competition in the establishment of a \nNational Electronic Commerce Resource Center. I will not offer that \namendment on this bill, but I would like to seek some assurances from \nthe chairman that this issue will be revisited when the Defense \nappropriations bill goes to conference.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia has raised a \nvalid concern. I am familiar with the program and am aware that many of \nthe Electronic Commerce Resource Centers around the country were \nestablished through full and open competition. Furthermore, I recognize \nyour valid arguments about the importance of full and open competition \nin the establishment of a national ECRC. I assure the Senator that this \nwill be an issue we raise during our conference with the House. \nFurthermore, I will ask my staff to arrange a briefing on \n\n[[Page S 12566]]\nthis program from the Department of Defense and to seek assurances from \nthe Department that they intend to use full and open competition if a \nsingle, consolidated National ECRC is established.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I appreciate those assurances from the \nchairman and thank him for his consideration.\n\n\n        Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nmanager of the bill in a brief colloquy regarding the Strategic \nEnvironmental Research and Development Program (SERDP). As he knows, \nthese funds have been and continue to be used for investigating and \ndemonstrating innovative environmental clean-up technologies. He may \nalso know that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Research Laboratory \n[USACERL] has been a very active component of DOD's efforts in this \narea. Through USACERL's work, many of these private/public sector \ntechnologies are now available for commercialization, stimulating small \ncompany creation, economic development, and environmental protection.\n  I would urge that the Committee support continuation of USACERL's \nexcellent work, particularly remediation activities at the Army \nproduction plants.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am aware of the application of innovative remediation \ntechnologies at numerous DOD sites throughout the country. I appreciate \nthe thoughtful comments of the Senator from Michigan on the Army Corps' \nwork and bringing it to my attention.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Very briefly, I would like to provide the Senator from \nAlaska with two specific examples that demonstrate just how effective \nUSACERL has been.\n  The first example is an innovative air control technology being \nimplemented at the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in Independence, MO. \nA full-scale demonstration biofilter is being installed that will \nreduce air emissions by more than 80 percent. This will allow the plant \nto double production and continue to emit less than its current air \nquality control requirements.\n  The second example is a manufactured wastewater treatment project at \nthe Radford Army Ammunitions Plant in Radford, VA. This is a full-scale \ndemonstration of granular activated carbon-fluidized bed technology for \ntreating DNT by-products in wastewater. This type of wastewater has \nproven resistant to any other type of treatment technology available \ntoday.\n  I hope the committee will continue to support the development of \ncost-effective technologies, such as these, for treating DOD wastes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The technologies the Senator has mentioned sound \npromising. I commend DOD and USACERL for their work in this area and \nencourage the Department to continue such innovative work.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I see the chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee for Defense, my friend from Alaska, on the floor, and I \nwanted to be sure he is aware of concerns brought to my attention by \nthe South Dakota National Guard. The concerns involve a funding \ndifference for multiple launch rocket systems [MLRS] between S. 1087, \nthe fiscal year [FY] 1996 Department of Defense [DOD] appropriations \nbill and S. 1026, the fiscal year 1996 DOD authorization bill.\n  Any addition of MLRS batteries to National Guard units would be an \nimportant contribution. Over the next several decades, our national \nsecurity increasingly will need to respond rapidly and decisively to \nregional security threats. The post-cold-war defense drawdown will \nresult in an increased reliance on the National Guard and the reserve \nforces to meet our national security needs. The opportunity for the \nSouth Dakota National Guard to be fielded an MLRS battery would improve \ngreatly its readiness and capability to respond rapidly to time \ncritical targets.\n  I urge the chairman and the appointed conferees to consider going to \nthe authorized funding level for MLRS launchers, as S. 1087 proceeds to \nconference. I believe doing so would ensure the successful \nreconditioning and fielding of 29 MLRS launchers important to our \nreserve forces.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I appreciate the senior Senator from \nSouth Dakota bringing this matter to my attention. As he knows, we \nfaced a number of difficult funding decisions in this bill. A number of \nprograms were not funded at the proposed authorized level. I would \nbring to the Senator's attention that S. 1087 provides $100 million for \nthe Army National Guard to allocate to meet its foremost modernization \npriorities. I am confident that the MLRS needs of the South Dakota \nNational Guard will be carefully considered this year.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Alaska. I \nappreciate his consideration of my request and look forward to working \nwith him on this matter of importance to the South Dakota National \nGuard.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I intend to oppose S. 1087, the Department \nof Defense appropriations for fiscal year 1996.\n  Although I recognize the need to provide for a strong national \ndefense, I cannot support this legislation because it spends too much \nmoney. The cold war is over, the Soviet Union has collapsed, and we \nalready spend more money than the next nine biggest military spenders \ncombined. If we are serious about balancing the budget without \nunnecessary cuts in programs that benefit average American families, it \nsimply does not make sense to spend more money than the administration \nrequested for defense.\n  Earlier this year, when we debated the budget in the Senate there was \nbroad bipartisan agreement that we should freeze defense spending at \nthe administration's request. On most issues, I disagreed with the \npriorities in the budget put forward by the Republican majority, and I \noffered an alternative that was both fairer and more ambitious than the \nRepublican proposal. But on defense my fair share plan contained a hard \nfreeze at the administration's fiscal year 1996 request just like the \nRepublican proposal.\n  Unfortunately, the budget that came back from conference increased \ndefense spending by more than $7 billion in fiscal year 1996 alone over \nthe level in my fair share plan and the Senate-passed budget. This \nincrease in defense spending comes at the expense of greater cuts in \nother areas important to hard working American families, such as \nagriculture, Medicare, and student loans.\n  Where does the extra $7 billion added to the fiscal year 1996 defense \nappropriations act go? Does it go to fund the priorities of our \nmilitary leaders, such as ongoing operations in Iraq, Bosnia, and Haiti \nwhere we know we will have added expenses this year? Does it go to \nimproving readiness through increased operations and maintenance \nfunding? Or does it go toward closing the bomber gap between the number \nof bombers the military estimates it will need to fight one major \nregional conflict and the bombers actually funded in the President's \nbudget? No, no, and again no.\n\n  The extra funding above the amounts our military leadership requested \ngoes largely to fund major new weapons procurement of questionable \nvalue to our immediate national security. The appropriators have added \n$1.4 billion for two extra DDG-51 Aegis destroyers, an extra $1.3 \nbillion for one LHD-7 amphibious ship, $600 million for ballistic \nmissile defenses, and $575 million for F-18 fighters. These weapons are \nnot needed this year, and this wave of new procurement sets the stage \nfor future increases to the defense budget because this pace will be \nunsustainable in the outyears unless we dramatically cut funding for \nreadiness.\n  I am especially concerned that, despite this added funding for \nprocuring new weapons, the bill does nothing to close the bomber gap. \nThis bill funds only 93 deployable bombers, but the Pentagon's Bottom-\nUp Review concluded that 100 deployable bombers are needed to fight \njust one major regional conflict, let alone a second nearly \nsimultaneous conflict. The Air Force estimates that a mere $130 million \nwould be sufficient to maintain a fourth combat coded squadron of B-52 \nbombers, six additional trainers and all remaining B-52's in attrition \nreserve. Although the Senate defense authorization bill contains \nlanguage prohibiting the retirement of B-52 bombers--the most capable \nbombers in our inventory and a vital element in our strategy to win two \nnearly simultaneous conflicts--the appropriations bill fails to \n\n[[Page S 12567]]\nfund additional B-52 operations and maintenance.\n  Although I cannot support the bill as a whole, I do want to note the \nprovision in the bill maintaining the size of Air National Guard \nfighter wings at 15 aircraft. In view of the increasing importance of \nair power in our warfighting capabilities and the enhanced role for the \nGuard in light of overall military downsizing, I believe it is very \nimportant to maintain our ANG assets. I congratulate the chairman and \nranking member for their attention to this issue.\n  But when I look at the bill as a whole, the bottom line is that it \nspend too much money. I cannot support it.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise this evening to speak against final \npassage of the 1996 Defense appropriations bill. And let me tell my \ncolleagues, I do so with a very heavy heart.\n  In the 15 years that I have served here in the U.S. Senate, I have \nnever once voted against final passage of a Defense appropriations \nbill. Regrettably, it will no longer be possible for me to make that \nclaim.\n  The bill before us is truly unique. In an era of wholesale budget \nreductions, this bill contains an overall spending increase of nearly \n$7 billion above what the President and the Pentagon requested. That is \na significant increase for any agency budget, however, it is \nparticularly troublesome because of the tremendous cuts that other \nagencies have suffered. It is an injustice that is too great to ignore.\n  For example, the 1996 Department of Labor and Health and Human \nServices appropriations bill was reduced by almost $4 billion for the \nDepartment of Labor, and another $3.5 billion for other related \nagencies. Simply put, that directly affects the hard working men and \nwomen of Connecticut who rely on important programs in time of need.\n  Since the mid-1980's almost 200,000 Defense-related jobs have been \nlost in my home State. The current reductions in the Department of \nLabor's job retraining programs directly cuts into the very heart of \njob training programs that are essential for the survival of more than \n500,000 displaced working Americans. That simply is not fair.\n  The 1996 Department of Defense appropriations bill provides almost \n$3.0 billion as a so called investment for advanced missile defenses. \nThat unrequested increase comes at the expense of medical care for the \nelderly, Goals 2000, and early childhood education programs. If ever \nthere was a need for an increase in a national investment program, we \nshould be focusing our eyes on the youth of our Nation and programs \nsuch as Headstart.\n  Let me restate for the Record, this bill contains spending increases \nthat were neither requested by the Pentagon, nor budgeted for by the \nPresident. However, vital future programs such as the F-22 fighter \naircraft and the Seawolf submarine were fully funded in the President's \ninitial budget submission. Let me remind my colleagues, those programs \nwere requested by the leadership or our armed services and deserve and \nrequested funding. I fully support those programs.\n  However, it seems fundamentally wrong in an era of severe fiscal \nconstraint to increase defense spending in areas not specifically \nrequested by the Joint Chiefs of Staff or their respective services. \nWith so much at stake in so many other critical programs in our \nnational infrastructure, I cannot in good conscience support this bill.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass? The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown).

SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING UNDERGROUND NUCLEAR \n                   TESTING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The President of France stated on June 13, 1995, that \n     the Republic of France plans to conduct eight nuclear test \n     explosions over the next several months.\n       (2) The People's Republic of China continues to conduct \n     underground nuclear weapons tests.\n       (3) The United States, France, Russia, and Great Britain \n     have observed a moratorium on nuclear testing since 1992.\n       (4) A resumption of testing by the Republic of France could \n     result in the disintegration of the current testing \n     moratorium and a renewal of underground testing by other \n     nuclear weapon states.\n       (5) A resumption of nuclear testing by the Republic of \n     France raises serious environmental and health concerns.\n       (6) The United Nations Conference on Disarmament presently \n     is meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, for the purpose of \n     negotiating a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), \n     which would halt permanently the practice of conducting \n     nuclear test explosions.\n       (7) Continued underground weapons testing by the Republic \n     of France and the People's Republic of China undermines the \n     efforts of the international community to conclude a CTBT by \n     1996, a goal endorsed by 175 nations, at the recently \n     completed NPT Extension and Review Conference (the conference \n     for the extension and review of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty).\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Republic of France and the People's Republic of \n     China should abide by the current international moratorium on \n     nuclear test explosions and refrain from conducting \n     underground nuclear tests in advance of a Comprehensive Test \n     Ban Treaty.\n\n     SEC. 8101. TESTING OF THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE INTERCEPTORS.\n\n       (a) Approval Beyond Low-Rate Initial Production.--The \n     Secretary of Defense may not approve a theater missile \n     defense interceptor program beyond the low-rate initial \n     production acquisition stage until the Secretary certifies to \n     the congressional defense committees that the program--\n       (1) has successfully completed initial operational test and \n     evaluation; and\n       (2) involves a suitable and effective system.\n       (b) Certification Requirements.--(1) In order to be \n     certified under subsection (a), the initial operational test \n     and evaluation conducted with respect to a program shall \n     include flight tests--\n       (A) that were conducted with multiple interceptors and \n     multiple targets in the presence of realistic \n     countermeasures; and\n       (B) the results of which demonstrate the achievement of \n     baseline performance thresholds by such interceptors.\n       (2) The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation shall \n     specify the number of flight tests required with respect to a \n     program under paragraph (1) in order to make a certification \n     referred to in subsection (a).\n       (3) The Secretary may utilize modeling and simulation \n     validated by ground and flight testing in order to augment \n     flight testing to demonstrate weapons system performance \n\n[[Page S 12579]]\n     for purposes of a certification under subsection (a).\n       (c) Reports.--(1) The Director of Operational Test and \n     Evaluation and the head of the Ballistic Missile Defense \n     Organization shall include in the annual reports to Congress \n     of such officials plans to test adequately theater missile \n     defense interceptor programs throughout the acquisition \n     process.\n       (2) As each theater missile defense system progresses \n     through the acquisition process, the officials referred to in \n     paragraph (1) shall include in the annual reports to Congress \n     of such officials an assessment of the extent to which such \n     programs satisfy the planned test objectives for such \n     programs.\n       (d) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the baseline \n     performance thresholds for a program are the weapon system \n     performance thresholds specified in the baseline description \n     for the weapon system established pursuant to section \n     2435(a)(1) of title 10, United States Code, before the \n     program entered into the engineering and manufacturing \n     development stage.\n\n     SEC. 8102. ELIGIBILITY FOR DEFENSE DUAL-USE ASSISTANCE \n                   EXTENSION PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 2524(e) of title 10, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (3), by striking out ``at least 25 percent \n     of the value of the borrower's sales during the preceding \n     year'' in the matter preceding subparagraph (A) and inserting \n     in lieu thereof ``at least 25 percent of the amount equal to \n     the average value of the borrower's sales during the \n     preceding 5 fiscal years'';\n       (2) by redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph (5); and\n       (3) by inserting after paragraph (3) the following new \n     paragraph (4):\n       ``(4) A borrower that meets the selection criteria set \n     forth in paragraph (2) and subsection (f) is also eligible \n     for a loan guarantee under subsection (b)(3) if the borrower \n     is a former defense worker whose employment as such a worker \n     was terminated as a result of a reduction in expenditures by \n     the United States for defense, the termination or \n     cancellation of a defense contract, the failure to proceed \n     with an approved major weapon system, the merger or \n     consolidation of the operations of a defense contractor, or \n     the closure or realignment of a military installation.''.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Defense \n     Appropriations Act, 1996''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12556-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I say to the Democratic leader, I thought I \nwould announce what I intend to propose. Maybe it is not doable. I \nwould like to propose that the only amendments remaining in order to S. \n1026 be those cleared by the two managers of the bill and the missile \ndefense amendment, and that the vote occur on or in relation to the \nmissile defense amendment begin at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, immediately to \nbe followed by a vote on passage of the Defense authorization bill, \npursuant to consent agreement of August 11.\n  So what I am suggesting is that there is going to be a period of \ndebate of two, maybe 3 hours, and there will be a number of Members \ninvolved in that debate. In the meantime, unless there is some \nobjection, if we could have that vote on that amendment and final \npassage at 9:30 tomorrow morning, other Members would be free to leave.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the majority leader will yield, I had an amendment left \non the list which I do not believe has yet been cleared. We are still \nhoping to clear that amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. I will make it subject to that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. DOLE. I have an amendment on welfare that probably will not be \nrelevant, but it will be tomorrow when we take up welfare.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the majority leader will yield, I know that we have a \nlist of amendments that may require rollcall votes. Does this \nanticipate then that other amendments, which would be offered either \ntonight or tomorrow morning, would still be in order and would be \nsubject to a vote following disposition of the amendment?\n  Mr. DOLE. It is my understanding that there--I did not know about the \namendment of the Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin]. I have been told \nthat, otherwise, everything had been dealt with. What we might do is \nsuggest the absence of a quorum for a few minutes and see if we can \nwork it out.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12579-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 1026\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think we have an agreement. It is cleared \nwith the Democratic leader and also the two managers, so I will make \nthe request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the only amendments remaining in order \nto S. 1026 be those amendments cleared by the two managers of the bill \nand one amendment to be offered by Senator Thurmond, relevant, and one \namendment to be offered by Senator Nunn, relevant; and if a vote is \nrequired on or in relation to the Levin amendment, it occur first in \nthe voting sequence beginning at 9:30 Wednesday, a.m.; further, that \nthe vote occur on or in relation to the missile defense amendment \nsecond in the voting sequence, to immediately be followed by a vote on \nthe passage of the Defense authorization bill, H.R. 1530, pursuant to \nthe agreement of August 11.\n  So there could be as many as five votes; the votes could be as few as \ntwo votes. If the Senator from Georgia offers a relevant amendment, or \nthe Senator from South Carolina, or the amendment of the Senator from \nMichigan or anything in relation--a motion to table--if that requires a \nvote, that could be three votes and then on the amendment itself and \nfinal passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. So I announce to my colleagues there will be no more votes \nthis evening but there will be debate. There are a number of Members on \neach side interested in this issue, so I assume the debate will \nprobably take at least 2 hours, maybe 3 hours.\n  So, I ask unanimous consent the vote at 9:30 Wednesday be 15 minutes \nin length, with second and subsequent votes being limited to 10 minutes \nin length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Missile Defense Act of \n     1995''.\n\n     SEC. 232. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The threat that is posed to the national security of \n     the United States by the proliferation of ballistic and \n     cruise missiles is significant and growing, both \n     quantitatively and qualitatively.\n       (2) The deployment of effective Theater Missile Defense \n     systems can deny potential adversaries the option of \n     escalating a conflict by threatening or attacking United \n\n[[Page S 12580]]\n     States forces, coalition partners of the United States, or allies of \n     the United States with ballistic missiles armed with weapons \n     of mass destruction to offset the operational and technical \n     advantages of the United States and its coalition partners \n     and allies.\n       (3) The intelligence community of the United States has \n     estimated that (A) the missile proliferation trend is toward \n     longer range and more sophisticated ballistic missiles, (B) \n     North Korea may deploy an intercontinental ballistic missile \n     capable of reaching Alaska or beyond within 5 years, and (C) \n     although a new indigenously developed ballistic missile \n     threat to the continental United States is not forecast \n     within the next 10 years there is a danger that determined \n     countries will acquire intercontinental ballistic missiles in \n     the near future and with little warning by means other than \n     indigenous development.\n       (4) The deployment by the United States and its allies of \n     effective defenses against ballistic missiles of all ranges, \n     as well as against cruise missiles, can reduce the incentives \n     for countries to acquire such missiles or to augment existing \n     missile capabilities.\n       (5) The Cold War distinction between strategic ballistic \n     missiles and nonstrategic ballistic missiles and, therefore, \n     the ABM Treaty's distinction between strategic defense and \n     nonstrategic defense, has changed because of technological \n     advancements and should be reviewed.\n       (6) The concept of mutual assured destruction, which was \n     one of the major philosophical rationales for the ABM Treaty, \n     is now questionable as a basis for stability in a multipolar \n     world in which the United States and the states of the former \n     Soviet Union are seeking to normalize relations and eliminate \n     Cold War attitudes and arrangements.\n       (7) Theater and national missile defenses can contribute to \n     the maintenance of stability as missile threats proliferate \n     and as the United States and the former Soviet Union \n     significantly reduce the number of strategic nuclear forces \n     in their respective inventories.\n       (8) Although technology control regimes and other forms of \n     international arms control can contribute to \n     nonproliferation, such measures alone are inadequate for \n     dealing with missile proliferation, and should not be viewed \n     as alternatives to missile defenses and other active and \n     passive defenses.\n       (9) Due to limitations in the ABM Treaty which preclude \n     deployment of more than 100 ground-based ABM interceptors at \n     a single site, the United States is currently prohibited from \n     deploying a national missile defense system capable of \n     defending the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii \n     against even the most limited ballistic missile attacks.\n\n     SEC. 233. MISSILE DEFENSE POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to--\n       (1) deploy as soon as possible affordable and operationally \n     effective theater missile defenses capable of countering \n     existing and emerging theater ballistic missiles;\n       (2)(A) develop for deployment a multiple-site national \n     missile defense system that: (i) is affordable and \n     operationally effective against limited, accidental, and \n     unauthorized ballistic missile attacks on the territory of \n     the United States, and (ii) can be augmented over time as the \n     threat changes to provide a layered defense against limited, \n     accidental, or unauthorized ballistic missile threats;\n       (B) initiate negotiations with the Russian Federation as \n     necessary to provide for the national missile defense systems \n     specified in section 235; and\n       (C) consider, if those negotiations fail, the option of \n     withdrawing from the ABM Treaty in accordance with the \n     provisions of Article XV of the Treaty, subject to \n     consultations between the President and the Senate;\n       (3) ensure congressional review, prior to a decision to \n     deploy the system developed for deployment under paragraph \n     (2), of: (A) the affordability and operational effectiveness \n     of such a system; (B) the threat to be countered by such a \n     system; and (C) ABM Treaty considerations with respect to \n     such a system;\n       (4) improve existing cruise missile defenses and deploy as \n     soon as practical defenses that are affordable and \n     operationally effective against advanced cruise missiles;\n       (5) pursue a focused research and development program to \n     provide follow-on ballistic missile defense options;\n       (6) employ streamlined acquisition procedures to lower the \n     cost and accelerate the pace of developing and deploying \n     theater missile defenses, cruise missile defenses, and \n     national missile defenses;\n       (7) seek a cooperative transition to a regime that does not \n     feature mutual assured destruction and an offense-only form \n     of deterrence as the basis for strategic stability; and\n       (8) carry out the policies, programs, and requirements of \n     subtitle C of title II of this Act through processes \n     specified within, or consistent with, the ABM Treaty, which \n     anticipates the need and provides the means for amendment to \n     the Treaty.\n\n     SEC. 234. THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE ARCHITECTURE.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Core Program.--To implement the policy \n     established in section 233, the Secretary of Defense shall \n     establish a top priority core theater missile defense program \n     consisting of the following systems:\n       (1) The Patriot PAC-3 system, with a first unit equipped \n     (FUE) in fiscal year 1998.\n       (2) The Navy Lower Tier (Area) system, with a user \n     operational evaluation system (UOES) capability in fiscal \n     year 1997 and an initial operational capability (IOC) in \n     fiscal year 1999.\n       (3) The Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, \n     with a user operational evaluation system (UOES) capability \n     in fiscal year 1997 and an initial operational capability \n     (IOC) no later than fiscal year 2002.\n       (4) The Navy Upper Tier (Theater Wide) system, with a user \n     operational evaluation system (UOES) capability in fiscal \n     year 1999 and an initial operational capability (IOC) in \n     fiscal year 2001.\n       (b) Interoperability and Support of Core Systems.--To \n     maximize effectiveness and flexibility, the Secretary of \n     Defense shall ensure that core theater missile defense \n     systems are interoperable and fully capable of exploiting \n     external sensor and battle management support from systems \n     such as the Navy's Cooperative Engagement Capability \n     (CEC), the Army's Battlefield Integration Center (BIC), \n     air and space-based sensors including, in particular, the \n     Space and Missile Tracking System (SMTS).\n       (c) Termination of Programs.--The Secretary of Defense \n     shall terminate the Boost Phase Interceptor (BPI) program.\n       (d) Follow-On Systems.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall \n     develop an affordable development plan for follow-on theater \n     missile defense systems which leverages existing systems, \n     technologies, and programs, and focuses investments to \n     satisfy military requirements not met by the core program.\n       (2) Before adding new theater missile defense systems to \n     the core program from among the follow-on activities, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional \n     defense committees a report describing--\n       (A) the requirements for the program and the specific \n     threats to be countered;\n       (B) how the new program will relate to, support, and \n     leverage off existing core programs;\n       (C) the planned acquisition strategy; and\n       (D) a preliminary estimate of total program cost and \n     budgetary impact.\n       (e) Report.--(1) Not later than the date on which the \n     President submits the budget for fiscal year 1997 under \n     section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, the Secretary \n     of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense \n     committees a report detailing the Secretary's plans for \n     implementing the guidance specified in this section.\n       (2) For each deployment date for each system described in \n     subsection (a), the report required by paragraph (1) of this \n     subsection shall include the funding required for research, \n     development, testing, evaluation, and deployment for each \n     fiscal year beginning with fiscal year 1997 through the end \n     of the fiscal year in which deployment is projected under \n     subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 235. NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE.\n\n       (a) In General.--To implement the policy established in \n     section 233, the Secretary of Defense shall develop an \n     affordable and operationally effective national missile \n     defense system to counter a limited, accidental, or \n     unauthorized ballistic missile attack, and which is capable \n     of attaining initial operational capability (IOC) by the end \n     of 2003. Such system shall include the following:\n       (1) Ground-based interceptors capable of being deployed at \n     multiple sites, the locations and numbers of which are to be \n     determined so as to optimize the defensive coverage of the \n     continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii against \n     limited, accidental or unauthorized ballistic missile \n     attacks.\n       (2) Fixed ground-based radars and space-based sensors, \n     including the Space and Missile Tracking system, the mix, \n     siting and numbers of which are to be determined so as to \n     optimize sensor support and minimize total system cost.\n       (3) Battle management, command, control, and communications \n     (BM/C3).\n       (b) Interim Operational Capability.--To provide a hedge \n     against the emergence of near-term ballistic missile threats \n     against the United States and to support the development and \n     deployment of the objective system specified in subsection \n     (a), the Secretary of Defense shall develop an interim \n     national missile defense plan that would give the United \n     States the ability to field a limited operational capability \n     by the end of 1999 if required by the threat. In developing \n     this plan the Secretary shall make use of--\n       (1) developmental, or user operational evaluation system \n     (UOES) interceptors, radars, and battle management, command, \n     control, and communications (BM/C3), to the extent that such \n     use directly supports, and does not significantly increase \n     the cost of, the objective system specified in subsection \n     (a);\n       (2) one or more of the sites that will be used as \n     deployment locations for the objective system specified in \n     subsection (a);\n       (3) upgraded early warning radars; and\n       (4) space-based sensors.\n       (c) Use of Streamlined Acquisition Procedures.--The \n     Secretary of Defense shall prescribe and use streamlined \n     acquisition procedures to--\n       (1) reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of \n     developing the national missile defense system specified in \n     subsection (a); and\n       (2) ensure that any interim national missile defense \n     capabilities developed pursuant to subsection (b) are \n     operationally effective and on a path to fulfill the \n     technical requirements and schedule of the objective system.\n\n[[Page S 12581]]\n\n       (d) Additional Cost Saving Measures.--In addition to the \n     procedures prescribed pursuant to subsection (c), the \n     Secretary of Defense shall employ cost saving measures that \n     do not decrease the operational effectiveness of the systems \n     specified in subsections (a) and (b), and which do not pose \n     unacceptable technical risk. The cost saving measures should \n     include the following:\n       (1) The use of existing facilities and infrastructure.\n       (2) The use, where appropriate, of existing or upgraded \n     systems and technologies, except that Minuteman boosters may \n     not be used as part of a National Missile Defense \n     architecture.\n       (3) Development of systems and components that do not rely \n     on a large and permanent infrastructure and are easily \n     transported, emplaced, and moved.\n       (e) Report on Plan for Deployment.--Not later than the date \n     on which the President submits the budget for fiscal year \n     1997 under section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional \n     defense committees a report containing the following matters:\n       (1) The Secretary's plan for carrying out this section.\n       (2) For each deployment date in subsections (a) and (b), \n     the report shall include the funding required for research, \n     development, testing, evaluation, and deployment for each \n     fiscal year beginning with fiscal year 1997 through the end \n     of the fiscal year in which deployment is projected under \n     subsection (a) or (b). The report shall also describe the \n     specific threat to be countered and provide the Secretary's \n     assessment as to whether deployment is affordable and \n     operationally effective.\n       (3) An analysis of options for supplementing or modifying \n     the national missile defense architecture specified in \n     subsection (a) before attaining initial operational \n     capability, or evolving such architecture in a building block \n     manner after attaining initial operational capability, to \n     improve the cost-effectiveness or the operational \n     effectiveness of such system by adding one or a combination \n     of the following:\n       (A) Additional ground-based interceptors at existing or new \n     sites.\n       (B) Sea-based missile defense systems.\n       (C) Space-based kinetic energy interceptors.\n       (D) Space-based directed energy systems.\n\n     SEC. 236. CRUISE MISSILE DEFENSE INITIATIVE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Defense shall undertake \n     an initiative to coordinate and strengthen the cruise missile \n     defense programs, projects, and activities of the military \n     departments, the Advanced Research Projects Agency and the \n     Ballistic Missile Defense Organization to ensure that the \n     United States develops and deploys affordable and \n     operationally effective defenses against existing and future \n     cruise missile threats.\n       (b) Actions of the Secretary of Defense.--In carrying out \n     subsection (a), the Secretary of Defense shall ensure that--\n       (1) to the extent practicable, the ballistic missile \n     defense and cruise missile defense efforts of the Department \n     of Defense are coordinated and mutually reinforcing;\n       (2) existing air defense systems are adequately upgraded to \n     provide an affordable and operationally effective defense \n     against existing and near-term cruise missile threats; and\n       (3) the Department of Defense undertakes a high priority \n     and well coordinated technology development program to \n     support the future deployment of systems that are affordable \n     and operationally effective against advanced cruise missiles, \n     including cruise missiles with low observable features.\n       (c) Implementation Plan.--Not later than the date on which \n     the President submits the budget for fiscal year 1997 under \n     section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, the Secretary \n     of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense \n     committees a detailed plan, in unclassified and classified \n     forms, as necessary, for carrying out this section. The plan \n     shall include an assessment of--\n       (1) the systems that currently have cruise missile defense \n     capabilities, and existing programs to improve these \n     capabilities;\n       (2) the technologies that could be deployed in the near- to \n     mid-term to provide significant advances over existing cruise \n     missile defense capabilities, and the investments that would \n     be required to ready the technologies for deployment;\n       (3) the cost and operational tradeoffs, if any, between \n     upgrading existing air and missile defense systems and \n     accelerating follow-on systems with significantly improved \n     capabilities against advanced cruise missiles; and\n       (4) the organizational and management changes that would \n     strengthen and further coordinate the cruise missile defense \n     efforts of the Department of Defense, including the \n     disadvantages, if any, of implementing such changes.\n\n     SEC. 237. POLICY REGARDING THE ABM TREATY.\n\n       (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Article XIII of the ABM Treaty envisions ``possible \n     changes in the strategic situation which have a bearing on \n     the provisions of this treaty''.\n       (2) Articles XIII and XIV of the ABM Treaty establish means \n     for the Parties to amend the Treaty, and the Parties have \n     employed these means to amend the Treaty.\n       (3) Article XV of the ABM Treaty establishes the means for \n     a party to withdraw from the Treaty, upon 6 months notice, \n     ``if it decides that extraordinary events related to the \n     subject matter of this treaty have jeopardized its supreme \n     interests.''\n       (4) The policies, programs, and requirements of subtitle C \n     of title II of this Act can be accomplished through processes \n     specified within, or consistent with, the ABM Treaty, which \n     anticipates the need and provides the means for amendment to \n     the Treaty.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--In light of the findings and \n     policies provided in this subtitle, it is the sense of \n     Congress that--\n       (1) given the fundamental responsibility of the Government \n     of the United States to protect the security of the United \n     States, the increasingly serious threat posed to the United \n     States by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \n     and ballistic missile technology, and the effect this threat \n     could have on the options of the United States to act in a \n     time of crisis--\n       (A) it is in the vital national security interest of the \n     United States to defend itself from the threat of a limited, \n     accidental, or unauthorized ballistic missile attack, \n     whatever its source; and\n       (B) the deployment of a national missile defense system, in \n     accord with section 233, to protect the territory of the \n     United States against a limited, accidental, or unauthorized \n     missile attack can strengthen strategic stability and \n     deterrence; and\n       (2)(A) the Senate should undertake a comprehensive review \n     of the continuing value and validity of the ABM Treaty with \n     the intent of provided additional policy guidance on the \n     future of the ABM Treaty during the second session of the \n     104th Congress; and\n       (B) upon completion of the review, the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations, in consultation with the Committee on Armed \n     Services and other appropriate committees, should report its \n     findings to the Senate.\n\n     SEC. 238. PROHIBITION ON FUNDS TO IMPLEMENT AN INTERNATIONAL \n                   AGREEMENT CONCERNING THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE \n                   SYSTEMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Section 234 of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1994 provides that the ABM Treaty does not \n     apply to or limit research, development, testing, or \n     deployment of missile defense systems, system upgrades, or \n     system components that are designed to counter modern theater \n     ballistic missiles, regardless of the capabilities of such \n     missiles, unless those systems, system upgrades, or system \n     components are tested against or have demonstrated \n     capabilities to counter modern strategic ballistic missiles.\n       (2) Section 232 of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1995 provides that the United States shall \n     not be bound by any international agreement that would \n     substantially modify the ABM Treaty unless the agreement is \n     entered into pursuant to the treaty making power of the \n     President under the Constitution.\n       (3) The demarcation standard described in subsection (b)(1) \n     is based upon current technology.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) unless a missile defense system, system upgrade, or \n     system component, including one that exploits data from \n     space-based or other external sensors, is flight tested \n     against a ballistic missile target that exceeds a range of \n     3,500 kilometers or a velocity of 5 kilometers per second, \n     such missile defense system, system upgrade, or system \n     component has not been tested in an ABM mode nor deemed to \n     have been given capabilities to counter strategic ballistic \n     missiles, and\n       (2) any international agreement that would limit the \n     research, development, testing, or deployment of \n     missile defense systems, system upgrades, or system \n     components that are designed to counter modern theater \n     ballistic missiles in a manner that would be more \n     restrictive than the criteria in paragraph (1) should be \n     entered into only pursuant to the treaty making powers of \n     the President under the Constitution.\n       (c) Prohibition on Funding.--Funds appropriated or \n     otherwise made available to the Department of Defense for \n     fiscal year 1996 may not be obligated or expended to \n     implement an agreement with any of the independent states of \n     the former Soviet Union entered into after January 1, 1995 \n     that would establish a demarcation between theater missile \n     defense systems and anti-ballistic missile systems for \n     purposes of the ABM Treaty or that would restrict the \n     performance, operation, or deployment of United States \n     theater missile defense systems except: (1) to the extent \n     provided in an act enacted subsequent to this Act; (2) to \n     implement that portion of any such agreement that implements \n     the criteria in subsection (b)(1); or (3) to implement any \n     such agreement that is entered into pursuant to the treaty \n     making power of the President under the Constitution.\n\n     SEC. 239.

There are 3 hours of debate scheduled on this \namendment, 2 for the Senator from Georgia, 1 for the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may need at \nthis point, and I do not intend to make long remarks at this point to \ngive each of my colleagues a chance to lay down their views and to make \ntheir remarks on this amendment, which is a very important amendment. \nThen I will conclude with other remarks as we proceed through this \ndebate.\n  Mr. President, at the request of the majority and minority leaders, \nSenators Cohen, Levin, Warner, and I spent the better part of the week \npreceding the August recess meeting intensively addressing issues \nraised by the proposed Missile Defense Act of 1995, as set forth in S. \n1026, the pending Defense authorization bill.\n  The goal of our effort was to develop an amendment establishing a \nmissile defense policy that could be supported by a broad bipartisan \ngroup of Senators. On Friday, August 11, we filed a bipartisan \nsubstitute amendment reflecting our best efforts to meet the objective, \nand I hope that all Members have had an opportunity during the recess \nto review this bipartisan amendment.\n  I want to express my thanks to my three colleagues, Senator Warner, \nSenator Cohen, and Senator Levin, for the diligence, tolerance, and \ngood will each of them showed throughout the long and at times very \ndifficult negotiations that occurred over a very intensive period of \nabout a week that led to the agreement embodied in the substitute \namendment that is now reported and pending.\n  I believe the amendment is a significant improvement to the version \nin the bill, and I support its adoption.\n  Mr. President, the revised version of the Missile Defense Act of \n1995, if passed in this amendment as set forth in this substitute, \nserves three very important functions. First, it clarifies the intent \nof the United States with respect to decisions about future missile \ndefenses. Second, it diffuses a potential constitutional contest and \nconfrontation between the executive and legislative branches. And, \nthird, it makes clear to the international community our policy toward \nthe ABM Treaty.\n  Under the bipartisan substitute, the policy is no longer stated as a \nbinding commitment to deploy a missile defense system. That is a \ndecision that will be made in the future. Instead, the national missile \ndefense policy, and section 232 of this substitute, is to ``develop for \ndeployment.'' The substitute adds several important qualifiers such as \nthe system must be ``affordable and operationally effective.'' This \nrequirement appears in section 232 and is reemphasized throughout the \namendment. And the system is limited to addressing only ``accidental, \nunauthorized or limited attacks.'' That qualification, which is set \nforth in section 232, is repeated throughout the amendment.\n  One of the most important qualifications under the substitute is the \nrequirement in section 2333 for ``congressional review, prior to a \ndecision to deploy the system, of development or deployment of (a) the \naffordability and operational effectiveness of such a system, (b) the \nthreat to be countered by such a system, and (c) ABM Treaty \nconsiderations with respect to such a system.''\n  These vital issues will all be considered before we take a step in \nthe future to authorize and appropriate funds for deployment of a \nnational missile defense system.\n  Mr. President, perhaps the most important qualification, both in \nterms of arms control and the separation of powers, is section 2338, \nwhich requires the Secretary of Defense to carry out the policies, \nprograms, and requirements of the entire Missile Defense Act ``through \nprocesses specified within or consistent with the ABM Treaty which \nanticipates the need and provides the means for amendment to the \ntreaty.''\n  Mr. President, finally, let me address the theater missile \ndemarcation provision briefly. Section 238 of the bill as reported \nwould have established in permanent law a specific demarcation between \ntheater and strategic missile defenses and would have prohibited the \nPresident from negotiations or other actions concerning the \nclarification or interpretation of the ABM Treaty and the line between \ntheater and strategic missile defenses. The bipartisan substitute \namendment strikes all of section 238 and provides in the bipartisan \nsubstitute a limited funding restriction with the following provisions \nconcerning the demarcation or the definitional distinction between \ntheater and national missile defenses.\n  First, the funding restriction applies only to fiscal year 1996.\n  Second, this substitute restriction applies only to the \nimplementation of agreement with the successor states in the Soviet \nUnion, should one be reached, concerning a demarcation between theater \nand strategic defenses for the purposes of the ABM Treaty and \nadditional restrictions on theater missile defenses going beyond those \nin the demarcation.\n  In addition to being limited to 1 year, the substitute funding \nlimitation in section 238 has three exceptions. The limitation does not \napply ``to the extent provided in a subsequent act'' to implement that \nportion of any such agreement that implements specific terms of the \ndemarcation set forth in the amendment, to implement an agreement that \nis entered into pursuant to the treaty-making power of the President \nunder the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, there are many other changes that improve the overall \nthrust of this subject matter in the bipartisan substitute. I believe \nthat the bipartisan substitute amendment provides a useful statement of \ncongressional policy and is intended to be presented in a framework \nthat makes clear that we seek a negotiated set of changes with the \nRussian Federation \n\n[[Page S 12583]]\nto allow for more effective defenses against limited missile attacks \nthan either side is permitted today.\n  I believe the bipartisan substitute amendment is not, and should not \nbe seen by Russia as, a threat by the United States either to abandon \nthe ABM Treaty or to reinterpret a treaty unilaterally to our \nadvantage. Both we and Russia face the threat of ballistic missile \nattacks. It is not simply the United States; it is also Russia. The \nthreats may be somewhat different, but the need for defenses should be \nclear to both sides.\n  What we have to do is arrange for both sides to be able to deploy \nmore effective defenses than in use today against accidental, \nunauthorized, and limited attacks while maintaining overall strategic \nstability and while making it plain that neither side seeks to combine \noffensive capability with defensive capability thereby giving either \nside what has for years been feared as a first-strike capability. Some \npeople use that term in connection and synonymously with the term \n``strategic stability.'' Some people use the term ``strategic \nstability'' in a broader context.\n  But, nevertheless, it is my view that, if we are going to proceed to \nenjoy the benefits of 20 years of work and negotiations to reduce \nnuclear weapons under the treaties that have been entered into, like \nthe START I Treaty or treaties now pending like the START II Treaty, it \nis very important that both sides understand that strategic stability \nis being maintained, that neither side is intending to combine \noffensive striking power with defensive abilities so that either side \nwould be tempted at any point in the future--whatever developed--to \ndevelop anything resembling a first-strike capability.\n  That is the scenario that the ABM Treaty was originally designed to \nprevent. It has some relevance today. But it needs changing in some \nvery important but modest aspects.\n  Mr. President, it is important that whatever we do with defenses--and \nI favor going forward with both the theater missile system and also a \nnational missile system against limited and unauthorized attacks and \nthird-country attack--whatever we do we should make sure that we \ncontinue to carry out the reductions of the armaments that have been \nmost threatening against the United States for the last 20 years, the \nheavy missiles. And those missiles are part of both START I and START \nII reductions.\n  It is enormously important that we not send signals to the Russian \nParliament, the Russian leadership, to the Russian people that they in \nany way should fear for their own security and that they, therefore, \nshould not go forward with the reductions of the missiles that they \nhave either agreed to or that are pending in the START II agreement.\n  Mr. President, that is what this is all about. I know there will be \nsome who will agree with the changes. There will be some who may not \nagree with the changes. But this does represent the best effort that \nSenator Levin and I on the Democratic side, together with Senator \nWarner and Senator Cohen on the Republican side, were able to put \ntogether in an effort to achieve these goals that I have enumerated.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NUNN. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will later address this pending amendment. But I would \nlike to ask a question of my distinguished colleague. I think we \nconcur, the four of us, Senator Thurmond, Senator Cohen, myself, and \nSenator Levin and also our distinguished ranking member. It would be my \nhope that the Senator from Georgia would have an opportunity to make \nsome assessment as to how the administration views this amendment. I \nwondered if the Senator would share with the Senate what he has.\n  Mr. NUNN. I say to my friend from Virginia that I talked to Secretary \nof Defense Perry about this amendment, and I think it is fair to say \nthat he believes it is a dramatic improvement over the original \nversion.\n  I would not be able to portray to the Senator from Virginia that I \nconveyed this or that I have discussed it in any kind of detail with \nthe White House. And I cannot give any message about how they view \neither this authorization bill or the appropriations bill which was \npassed. There are a number of other areas that do not concern this that \nhave been of concern to the White House and the Secretary of Defense, \nincluding, in the bill we just passed, the appropriation bill, the \nelimination of some very important funding that the Secretary of \nDefense had undertaken under the Nunn-Lugar program for working to \nreduce the Russian military establishment.\n  That is a concern to Secretary Perry; it also is a concern to me, \nthat funding was eliminated both in the appropriations bill in the \nHouse and Senate. But as far as this particular provision is concerned, \nI have no doubt that Secretary Perry feels it is a great improvement, \nand I would assume, without having directly talked with the President \nabout it, that he would also view it in that way.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague, but I \nhope the administration would view this as an effort to reconcile \nimportant differences and that it is a work product worthy of support \nby the Senate and by the administration.\n  Mr. NUNN. It is also my hope that would be their view. I would say to \nmy friend, I know there are other provisions in this bill and the \nappropriations bill that concern both the White House and the Secretary \nof Defense. So I can make no statement here that indicates their \nfeeling on the overall product we now have. I am sure they will be \nheard from as we move into conference.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. Thurmond addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to support the bipartisan missile \ndefense amendment which was worked out prior to the August recess.\n  While I continue to believe that the missile defense provisions in \nthe bill reported to the Senate by the Armed Services Committee are \nsound and reasonable, I also agree that the compromise is a positive \nstep away from the status quo.\n  The compromise amendment does not include everything that I wanted, \nbut it does not fundamentally undermine any of the policies or \ninitiatives that I viewed as critical. In my view, it is an adequate \nposition to take to conference. The House defense authorization bill \ndiffers in several ways from the Senate compromise missile defense \namendment. Obviously, there will be considerable discussion before a \nconsensus is reached between the two Chambers.\n  Let me again thank all those who worked so hard prior to the August \nrecess. And I especially wish to thank Senator Warner, Senator Cohen, \nSenator Nunn, and Senator Levin. Also, let me thank the leaders for \ntheir cooperation.\n  Finally, I would like to draw to the attention of the Senate an \narticle by the Republican leader, Senator Dole, in today's Washington \nTimes which addresses the subject of missile defense. This is an \nexcellent piece for which I commend the Republican leader. I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of the article be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. THURMOND. In closing, Mr. President, let me once again urge my \ncolleagues to support the bipartisan compromise on missile defense. It \nis a positive step that all Members should be able to endorse.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                      A Timely Reminder From Iraq\n\n                            (By Robert Dole)\n\n       When Saddam Hussein's son-in-law and former chief of mass \n     destruction bolted, apparently threatening to tell all, the \n     Iraqi director preempted and sent us the loudest wake-up call \n     we are likely to get on the growing threat of weapons of mass \n     destruction. As we finish up the Department of Defense \n     Authorization Bill, it's time to heed that call.\n       According to their belated admission, the Iraqis filled \n     nearly 200 bombs and warheads for ballistic missiles with \n     botulinum toxin, anthrax spores and aflatoxin. In addition to \n     the shockingly advanced nuclear weapons program already \n     revealed, Iraq now says it ran a second program to develop a \n     nuclear weapon by April 1991 with material diverted from \n     nuclear power reactors.\n\n[[Page S 12584]]\n\n       The latest revelations from Baghdad underscore four points.\n       First, arms control treaties and export controls did not \n     prevent Iraq from pursuing its deadly aims. Don't get me \n     wrong--diplomatic efforts increase the cost, time and \n     technical challenge required to acquire weapons to mass \n     destruction. We should press on with them. The point is \n     simply that diplomacy does not prevent malevolent countries \n     like Iraq from acquiring these weapons and there are a number \n     of countries of Iraq's ilk out there.\n       Second, Iraq managed to conceal a good part of its \n     activities from the rest of the world, even after post-Gulf \n     War U.N. sanctions made it the most inspected country on \n     earth. Clearly, absence of evidence is not evidence of \n     absence. The lesson is that we no longer have the luxury of \n     waiting for our intelligence bureaucracy to gather reams of \n     evidence before ``validating'' a threat. Our own defense \n     programs need to start anticipating emerging threats.\n       Third, what makes these weapons truly menacing is the \n     prospect of their delivery with ballistic missiles, which \n     allow countries that never before wielded such power to vault \n     themselves onto the world stage. Imagine trying to put \n     together the coalition for Desert Storm if Cairo, Ankara, \n     Rome or London had believed they were vulnerable to missiles \n     loaded with anthrax. And let's not forget that the United \n     States and its key allies may soon be a target. In just three \n     to five years, the North Korean Taepo-Dong II \n     intercontinental ballistic missile could reach American soil. \n     Those lacking in imagination about what that implies \n     should recall the words of Saddam Hussein: ``Our missiles \n     cannot reach Washington. If they could reach Washington, \n     we would strike it if the need rose.''\n       Fourth, the Clinton administration and its allies hobble \n     America's missile defense efforts by clinging to the 1972 ABM \n     Treaty with the now defunct Soviet Union. They have even \n     tried to drag our theater missile defense programs, never \n     covered by the ABM Treaty, under new limits that the \n     administration has hatched from ever-burgeoning \n     interpretations of that treaty.\n       It's time to defend ourselves in the multipolar world of \n     the 21st century. It's time to change the regime established \n     by the 1972 ABM Treaty, which currently leaves the American \n     people vulnerable to missile attack from any country capable \n     of developing or buying a long-range missile, I think there \n     are ways we can cooperate with Russia on missile defenses, \n     but that is partly up to them. Our job on the defense bill is \n     to lay out what is necessary for America's defense. We now \n     have a defense bill which takes important steps in that \n     direction.\n       First, it establishes a Cruise Missile Defense Initiative, \n     the need for which was just underscored by Iraq's admission \n     that it was experimenting with unmanned aerial vehicles, \n     cousins of the cruise missile, to deliver biological agents.\n       Second, it establishes a theater missile defense ``core \n     program'' to ensure that we stay focused and move toward \n     deployment of those systems that are clearly needed as soon \n     as possible, adding the crucial Navy Upper Tier system to the \n     core. This system will allow our Navy to take missile \n     defenses wherever in the world American interests are \n     threatened.\n       Third, it precludes arms control zealots from dragging \n     theater missile defense systems which are not covered by the \n     ABM Treaty into a web of new limitations. It calls for a year \n     of careful consideration on how to proceed with the ABM \n     Treaty in the longer term. During that time, the president \n     should seek to negotiate with Russia a mutually beneficial \n     agreement that will allow the United States to proceed with \n     its multiple-site deployments.\n       Most important, it establishes U.S. policy to develop for \n     deployment by 2003 ground-based interceptors at multiple \n     sites, fixed ground-based radars and space-based sensors for \n     a defense of the United States of America.\n       Mr. President, it's time to defend America.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. COHEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield 10 minutes to the able Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. COHEN. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. President, let me thank Senator Thurmond for his confidence in \nasking Senator Warner and me to represent the Republican side in the \nnegotiations with Senator Nunn and also Senator Levin.\n  The four of us have enjoyed working together over our years of \nservice on the Armed Services Committee, and it was a special privilege \nfor me to be able to sit down for hours and hours, well into the night, \nin fact, on several occasions, working from at least 5 in the afternoon \nuntil midnight on at least two occasions, but the issues that were \ninvolved were serious. They required that kind of attention to detail.\n  Notwithstanding some of the comments that were made earlier today by \nsome of our colleagues, words do make a difference. Poets are not the \nonly individuals who pinch words until they hurt. Arms controllers do \nas well.\n  Words within the field of arms control carry specific meaning, and it \nwas very important that we took great care as we tried to hammer out a \ncompromise between our respective positions, in making sure that we \nwould not do damage to longstanding precedents and longstanding \ninterpretations. Notwithstanding the fact there has been some criticism \nleveled at this bipartisan proposal, we believe the care which we have \ntaken to describe in some detail, with some great sensitivity, I might \nadd, the meaning of the words that were used, carries significant \nimplications for arms control and national security.\n  We have to remind our colleagues again and again we are not seeking \nto rekindle the debate over star wars, some sort of astrodomic system \nthat is going to hover over the United States and protect this county \nfrom an all-out assault from the former Soviet Union or any major power \nthat may emerge in the future. We could not do that. We do not envision \nthat. We agree, in light of the proliferation of missile technology \nthat we are agreed upon, that there is a grave danger of missile \ntechnology proliferating at an ever and ever faster rate that poses a \nthreat to the United States, also to the former Soviet Union. They also \nshould have great concern about the proliferation of this kind of \ntechnology.\n  How do we quantify it? How great is that threat? I do not think any \nof us are in a position to make a judgment. But we do not want to be in \nthe position 3 or 4 or 5 years down the road of having some accidental \nlaunch, an unauthorized launch, or a limited attack against the United \nStates and all the President of the United States could do would be to \ntell the people targeted: ``Sorry, we will do the best to clean up the \nthousands if not millions of dead after the missile hits. We have no \nmeans of protecting you. And, yes, we understand what 5 o'clock traffic \nis in Washington, New York, and every major city and the chances are \nyou will not be able to get out of the city on 30 minutes' notice, and \nso all we can do is hope to minimize the slaughter that will take place \nby sending in our rescue teams, assuming they survive the blast.''\n  That is an untenable position, and so we have to have some means of \ndefending against these types of limited, accidental, or unauthorized \nlaunches, and there should be no dissent on that. This is not a matter \nof partisanship. There is no dissent that we need to have that \ncapability.\n  In June, when the Armed Services Committee marked up the Defense \nauthorization bill, the committee voted to put the United States on the \npath to deployment of a highly effective system to defend the American \npeople against limited missile attacks.\n  Because we want to and must defend all Americans, not just those in a \nparticular region of the country, we called for a multiple-site \ndefense. And, because we can expect the threat to evolve to become ever \nmore sophisticated, we called for a defensive system that would also \nevolve and a research-and-development program to provide options for \nthe future. Since the National Missile Defense Program approved by the \ncommittee goes beyond that being pursued by the administration, we \nadded $300 million above the $371 million requested.\n  We also called for deployment of highly effective systems to defend \nour forward deployed forces and key allies and, to ensure this result, \nreorganized the administration's theater missile defense effort. A \nrelated matter involved negotiations being conducted with Moscow to \ndefine the line distinguishing TMD from ABM systems.\n  Over the last year and a half, the Clinton administration has drifted \ntoward accepting Russian proposals to limit TMD systems in unacceptable \nways--in effect, to subject TMD systems to the ABM Treaty, which was \nnever intended to cover theater defenses. The committee addressed this \ntroubling situation with two steps. First, we voted to write into law \nthe Clinton administration's initial negotiating position on what \nconstitutes an ABM system. And second, we adopted \n\n[[Page S 12585]]\nbill language to prevent the administration from implementing any \nagreement that would have the effect of applying ABM Treaty \nrestrictions to TMD systems.\n  Last month, when the Defense authorization act came to the floor, the \ncommittee's judgment was challenged. One amendment was offered to \ndelete the additional $300 million provided for national missile \ndefense. And another amendment was offered eliminate the policy to \ndeploy a multiple-site national defense system, eliminate the statutory \ndemarcation between TMD and ABM systems, and eliminate the ban on \napplying the ABM Treaty to TMD systems.\n  As was the case during the committee's mark-up, these efforts failed \nin relatively close votes.\n  Mr. President, I have been on the Armed Services Committee since 1979 \nand have spent some of that time in the majority. It has not been our \npractice for the majority to use its position to impose its views on \nthe minority. Instead, we have usually sought to develop as broad a \nconsensus as possible on important issues of national security.\n  In this spirit, Members of the majority also offered amendments on \nthe floor to move beyond close, partisan votes toward a broader \nconsensus.\n  Senator Kyl offered an amendment expressing ``the sense of the Senate \nthat all Americans should be protected from accidental, intentional, or \nlimited ballistic missile attack.'' His amendment setting forth this \nbasic principle, which was the basis for the Armed Services Committee's \naction, was approved overwhelming, 94-5.\n  And to address the concerns of some Senators that the committee was \nadvocating abrogation of the ABM Treaty, I offered an amendment \naffirming that the multiple-site defense we endorsed can be deployed in \naccordance with mechanisms provided for in the ABM Treaty--such as \nnegotiating an amendment--and urging the President to negotiate with \nMoscow to obtain the necessary treaty amendment. My amendment was also \napproved by a very large margin, 69-26.\n  I highlight that vote margin because the bipartisan amendment we have \nnegotiated would change even the language of the Cohen amendment, which \nwas adopted overwhelmingly by the full Senate. I think this is a clear \nindication of how far the majority has been willing to go in \naccommodating the minority in order to build a broader consensus.\n\n\n                        the bipartisan amendment\n\n  The result of the negotiations that have occurred is the bipartisan \namendment, which is being cosponsored by the four Senators designated \nby the two leaders to attempt to resolve this issue. In order to reach \nagreement on this amendment, both sides made concessions, although it \nshould be noted that many of the agreed upon changes are less \nconcessions than clarifications of the Armed Services Committee's \nintent.\n  Senators interested in this matter can read the bipartisan amendment \nand compare it to current text of the bill. Our negotiations involved \ndebate over almost every single word in subtitle C. For reasons of \ntime, I will merely try to summarize the most important issues.\n\n\n                         missile defense policy\n\n  In section 233, which addresses missile defense policy, we have made \na number of changes to clarify the intent of the committee's language.\n  The bipartisan text states that ``it is the policy of the United \nStates to develop for deployment a multiple-site national missile \ndefense system.'' The difference with the original text is that it \nsubstitutes the words ``develop for deployment'' for the word \n``deploy.''\n  This change is consistent with the fact that what we are funding in \nthis bill is research and development on national missile defense, not \nprocurement. There will be a number of authorization and appropriations \nbills to be acted upon before we begin to fund the actual deployment of \nthe system. I would note that the words ``develop for deployment'' were \nin the committee-approved bill, in the NMD architecture section, and so \nthis clarification is consistent with the committee's intent.\n  Moreover, I would emphasize that the policy section clearly states--\nas did the committee bill--that the system we are pursuing is a \nmultiple-site system. As the findings make clear, a multiple-site \nsystem is essential if we are to defend all of the United States and \nnot just part of the country. This is also made clear in the NMD \narchitecture section, which states that the system must be optimized to \ndefend all 50 States against limited, accidental, or unauthorized \nballistic missile attacks.\n  This is further bolstered by the new language inserted by the \ncompromise at various places that the system must be ``affordable and \noperationally effective.'' An NMD system confined to a single ground-\nbased site would not be operationally effective, as noted in the ninth \nfinding.\n  The bipartisan text also states in the policy section that the NMD \nsystem will be one that ``can be augmented over time as the threat \nchanges to provide a layered defense against limited, accidental, or \nunauthorized ballistic missile threats.'' This passage was of great \nimportance to many Members on this side who are concerned about the \nability of the system to remain effective in the face of an evolving \nthreat.\n  The committee-approved language stated that the NMD system ``will be \naugmented over time to provide a layered defense.'' There were strong \nfeelings on our side about the words ``will be augmented.'' In the end, \nwe agreed to change this to ``can be augmented.'' Again, while the \ncommittee's language had much to commend it, funding for deployment of \nother defensive layers will not be appropriated for several years.\n  The other changes to this passage, such as the inclusion of the words \n``limited, accidental, or unauthorized'' clarify the ballistic missile \nthreat for which a layered defense would be required, reflect the \nintent of the committee's bill.\n  At the suggestion of the other side, a new paragraph was added to the \npolicy calling for congressional review, prior to a decision to deploy \nthe NMD system. This is fully consistent with the committee's intent \nand the realities of the congressional budget process. Funds to begin \ndeployment of the NMD system are not in the bill before the Senate. \nThus, when such funds are requested, that request will pass through the \nregular process of committee hearings and mark-ups, floor \nconsideration, and conference action.\n  Another change to the policy section was the inclusion of several \nportions of the amendment that I offered and that was approved by the \nSenate last month. This states that it is U.S. policy to ``carry out \nthe policies, programs and requirements of (the Missile Defense Act of \n1995) through processes specified within, or consistent with the ABM \nTreaty, which anticipates the need and provides the means for amendment \nto the Treaty.''\n  It also states that it is United States policy to initiate \nnegotiations with the Russian Federation as necessary to provide for \nthe NMD systems specified in the NMD architecture section. At the \nurging of Congress in the Missile Defense Act of 1991, President Bush \ninitiated such negotiations with Moscow.\n  It is my understanding that tentative agreement was reached to \nprovide for the deployment of ground-based multiple-site NMD systems. \nBut the Clinton administration discontinued those negotiations. Under \nthis legislation, it would be U.S. policy to once again engage Moscow \nin negotiations to amend the ABM Treaty or otherwise allow for \nmultiple-site NMD systems.\n  The policy section then states that ``it is the policy of the U.S. to \n* * * consider, if those negotiations fail, the option of withdrawing \nfrom the ABM Treaty in accordance with the provisions of Article XV of \nthe Treaty, subject to consultations between the President and the \nSenate.''\n  I would note that both amendment to the treaty, as provided for in \narticles XIII and XIV, and withdrawal from the treaty, as provided for \nin article XV, are ``processes specified within the ABM Treaty.''\n  Contrary to the concerns of some, the Armed Services Committee never \nadvocated abrogation of the treaty and the bill reported out by the \ncommittee neither required nor supported abrogation. The debate that \ntook place during the committee mark-up made it clear that there was \nabsolutely no intent to abrogate.\n  These provisions regarding the ABM Treaty and negotiations with \nMoscow \n\n[[Page S 12586]]\ntaken from the Cohen amendment and incorporated into the bipartisan \namendment reaffirm what was always the intent of the committee.\n  Mr. President, I want to emphasize that these provisions and the \nother language in the section 233 clearly state that these policies are \n``the policy of the United States.'' Not the policy of the Senate or \nthe policy of the Congress. I say this because I have heard that an \nadministration official has said that, once this bill becomes law, the \nadministration will declare that these statements of U.S. policy are \nnot its policy but merely the sense of the Congress.\n\n  The bill makes a clear distinction between statements of U.S. policy \nand expressions of the sense of Congress. We have spent a great deal of \neffort negotiating exactly what statements will fall into the policy \nsection and which will be in the form of sense of the Congress. In \nfact, these negotiations began with Senator Nunn urging that the Cohen \namendment be strengthened from being the sense of the Congress to a \nstatement of U.S. policy.\n  Mr. President, I would merely note the obvious fact that once the \nbill becomes U.S. law, then the bill's statements of policy are U.S. \npolicy.\n\n\n                            nmd architecture\n\n  The bipartisan amendment also provides changes and clarifications in \nsection 235, regarding the architecture of the national missile defense \nsystem.\n  The committee's bill stated that the NMD system ``will attain initial \noperational capability by the end of 2003.'' The bipartisan amendment \nstates that the NMD system will be ``capable of attaining initial \noperational capability by the end of 2003.'' This is a useful \nclarification because while Congress can mandate many things, we cannot \ndictate with certainty that engineers will accomplish specific tasks \nwithin a specific period of time.\n  Section 235 also states that the NMD ``system shall include * * * \nground-based interceptors capable of being deployed at multiple sites, \nthe locations and numbers of which are to be determined so as to \noptimize the defensive coverage of the continental United States, \nAlaska, and Hawaii against limited, accidental, or unauthorized \nballistic missile attacks.'' The committee's version of this provision \nwas identical except that the bipartisan amendment inserted the words \n``capable of being.''\n  I found this suggestion from the other side to be acceptable because \nI do not think it really changes the meaning of the original text. \nInterceptors are inherently ``capable of being deployed at multiple \nsites.'' I cannot conceive of any technical reason that an interceptor \nwould be incapable of being deployed at multiple sites. Accordingly, \n``capable of being deployed at multiple sites'' does not, as far as I \ncan tell, in any way limit the NMD system proposed by the committee. \nIndeed, one could argue that the only way that ground based \ninterceptors are ``capable of being deployed at multiple sites'' is if \nthere are multiple sites.\n\n  So, I am pleased that this change helped to produce a bipartisan \nresolution to this matter, even if I cannot find any substantive result \nof this change.\n  In subsection (b) of section 235, our side did make a concession. The \ncommittee's bill directed the Secretary of Defense ``to develop an \ninterim NMD capability to be operational by the end of 1999.'' In order \nto achieve agreement with the other side, we have modified this to \nrequire the Secretary ``to develop an interim NMD plan that would give \nthe U.S. the ability to field a limited operational capability by the \nend of 1999 if required by the threat.'' In both versions, the interim \ncapability would have to not interfere with deployment of the full up \nNMD system by 2003.\n  Mr. President, I would also note that the bipartisan amendment \nretains the portion of section 235 that calls for a report by the \nSecretary of Defense analyzing ``options for supplementing or modifying \nthe NMD system by adding one or a combination of sea-based missile \ndefense systems, space-based kinetic energy interceptors, or space-\nbased directed energy systems.'' As I discussed earlier, such options \nfor layered defenses are of considerable interest to many Members.\n  To summarize, Mr. President, the bipartisan amendment both clarifies \nand changes the committee bill's provisions on national missile \ndefense. It keeps us on the path toward a ground-based, multiple-site \nNMD system with options for layered defenses as the threat changes. But \nit recognizes that requests for NMD procurement funds will not be made \nfor several years.\n\n\n                            tmd demarcation\n\n  The other issue that required much discussion was what is commonly \nreferred to as the theater missile defense demarcation question. I \nwould like to summarize the resolution that was achieved in section \n238, which was completely rewritten with the assistance of many \nSenators.\n  The section has findings noting that the ABM Treaty ``does not apply \nto or limit'' theater missile defense systems. The findings also note \nthat ``the U.S. shall not be bound by any international agreement that \nwould substantially modify the ABM Treaty unless the agreement is \nentered into pursuant to the treaty making powers of the President \nunder the Constitution.'' What this means is that any agreement that \nwould have the effect of applying limits on TMD systems under the ABM \nTreaty must be approved as a treaty by the Senate.\n\n  Section 238 then states the sense of Congress that a defensive system \nhas been tested in an ABM mode, and therefore is subject to the ABM \nTreaty, only if it has been tested against a ballistic missile target \nthat has a range in excess of 3,500 kilometers or a velocity in excess \nof 5 kilometers per second. This threshold is the one defined by the \nadministration and proposed in its talks with Moscow on this subject.\n  Finally, section 238 has a binding provision that prohibits \nimplementation during fiscal year 1996 of an agreement with the \ncountries of the former Soviet Union that would restrict theater \nmissile defenses. This prohibition would not apply to the portion of an \nagreement that implements the 3,500 kilometer or 5-kilometer-per-second \ncriteria nor to an agreement that is approved as a treaty by the \nSenate.\n  But it would apply to all portions of an agreement that sought to \nimpose any restrictions other than the 3,500 kilometer or 5-kilometer-\nper-second criteria. Various other potential restrictions have been \ndiscussed, such as limits on the number of TMD systems or system \ncomponents, geographical restrictions on where TMD systems can be \ndeployed, restrictions on the velocity of TMD interceptor missiles, and \nrestrictions on the volume of TMD interceptors missiles. Under section \n238 of the bipartisan amendment, during fiscal year 1996, the \nadministration is barred from implementing any of these potential \nrestrictions or any other restrictions on the performance, operation, \nor deployment of TMD systems, system components, or system upgrades.\n  At the same time, Mr. President, there are no constraints on the \nability of the President to engage in negotiations on the demarcation \nissue, which I know was an issue of concern to some. What section 238 \ncontrols is the implementation of any restrictions on TMD systems.\n  Mr. President, I want to acknowledge the efforts of the many Senators \nwho contributed to the drafting of this amendment. Every member of the \nArmed Services Committee played a role, as did the two leaders, and key \nSenators off the committee. Senator Kyl played a very constructive \nrole, offering language that formed the basis for the resolution on \nsection 238 and providing useful suggestions on the NMD portions of the \nbill. The chairman of the Armed Services Committee is to be especially \ncommended for providing strong guidance to the negotiators and the \ncommittee, as a whole, and facilitating the talks along the way.\n  I want to commend Senator Nunn, once again, and Senator Levin and \nSenator Warner for the many, many hours that were spent negotiating \nover specific words. As I mentioned before, words matter a great deal \nwhen we are talking about arms control.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could take a minute.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the able Senator \nfrom Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this time I just want to take 30 \nseconds to thank my distinguished colleague from \n\n[[Page S 12587]]\nMaine. He ended up on a very important note, ``use of words.'' I can \nassure you, when we were sitting around, time and time again, we \nreferred to him as the master craftsman for the use of words, the \nplacement of a comma and the prose that flows. Make no mistake about \nthat. If this thing ever has to go to court, it is your fault.\n  [Laughter.]\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields the Senator time?\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Michigan such time \nas he may desire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. NUNN. Within reason.\n  [Laughter.]\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if we can get a parliamentary interpretation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is exactly 1 hour and 50 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I definitely thank the Chair, and I think I thank my \nfriend from Georgia.\n  Mr. President, first let me echo the words of those who have already \nspoken about the process just for a minute. The four of us have worked \ntogether now many, many years in this Senate, particularly on the Armed \nServices Committee, but on other matters as well. We know each other, \nlike each other a great deal, respect each other as individuals and \nalso for the depths of our beliefs and our feelings.\n  It was a true pleasure to work with Senators Nunn, Warner and Cohen \nas we crafted this substitute. There is a lot in here representing each \nof us. Most important, I believe this substitute reflects a wise course \nrelative to national missile defense.\n  I agree fully with what Senator Warner just said about Senator Cohen. \nNo one is a greater crafter of words around this place than Senator \nCohen. He is not just a poet, but he is a writer of fiction as well, \nand some darned good nonfiction, too.\n  Mr. President, first, I want to start with what the law currently is. \nThere is a lot of misconception, I think, in this body about what the \ncurrent law is relative to national missile defense. We are not \nstarting with a clean slate here called a bill and then adding a \nsubstitute for consideration by the Senate. We are starting with an \nexisting law on national missile defense, then there is a bill, then \nthere is a substitute.\n  The existing law already provides that it is a goal of the United \nStates to develop the option to deploy an antiballistic missile system \nthat is capable of providing a highly effective defense of the United \nStates against limited attacks from ballistic missiles.\n  So that is the ground on which we are starting, that we already have \nin law a goal of the United States to develop the option to deploy this \nnational missile defense system that we are talking about.\n  The bill that is before us, to which many of us had strong \nobjections, goes way beyond saying that we should develop an option to \ndeploy and then at some future time decide whether to exercise the \noption. The bill that we have before us says that we ``shall deploy'' \nand that is what gets us into great difficulty. It gets us into great \ndifficulty in terms of the ABM Treaty, which prohibits the deployment \nof certain systems, antiballistic missile systems, at multiple sites.\n  The section of the bill before us, section 233, says that it is ``the \npolicy of the United States to deploy a multiple-site national missile \ndefense system.''\n  No ifs, no ands, no buts. That is the policy of the United States in \nthe bill. The trouble with that is we have a number of impediments to \nthat policy being a wise one. We have the question of what the threat \nis, what the cost effectiveness is, what the military effectiveness of \nsuch a system is, and we have an agreement with the Russians called the \nAnti-Ballistic Missile Treaty which President Nixon entered into and \nwhich has helped to create some major stability in the relationship \nbetween the two countries when there was a cold war. And now that the \ncold war is over, we must figure out how to deal with a new Russia who \nis a partner, a friend, an ally hopefully, not an adversary of the \nUnited States.\n  When the bill says that we will deploy a system which the ABM Treaty \nsays we cannot, what the bill does is set us on a course of action \nwhich is not only unwise but is reckless.\n  We received letters from both General Shalikashvili, who is our \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Secretary of Defense, \nSecretary Perry, in strong opposition to the bill because of what it \ndoes to the ABM Treaty but, most important, because of the jeopardy in \nwhich it places the Start II Treaty that we are hoping to ratify. That \ntreaty will reduce significantly the number of nuclear warheads on both \nsides, and that is really the issue.\n  The issue here is the impact of the action of the Senate on the \nreduction of offensive nuclear weapons which threaten us. Surely it is \nnot in our national interest to be trashing an agreement relative to \nantiballistic missile systems if, by undermining that agreement, we are \nthen going to end up facing thousands more warheads on ballistic \nmissiles which Russia would insist on keeping if we unilaterally pull \nout of the ABM Treaty. That is why General Shalikashvili said:\n\n       While we believe that START II is in both countries' \n     interest, regardless of other events, that we must assume \n     that unilateral U.S. legislation could harm prospects for \n     START II ratification by the Duma and probably impact our \n     broader security relationship with Russia as well.\n\n  That letter was dated June 28, 1995.\n  And in a letter dated July 28, 1995, Secretary Perry said:\n\n       Certain provisions related to the ABM Treaty would be very \n     damaging to U.S. security interests. By mandating actions \n     that would lead us to violate or disregard U.S. treaty \n     obligations, such as establishing a deployment date of a \n     multiple-site NMD system, the bill would jeopardize Russian \n     implementation of the START I and START II treaties which \n     involve the elimination of many thousands of strategic \n     nuclear weapons.\n\n  We tried to modify the language in the bill pursuant to the amendment \nprocess prior to the recess. We tried to strike language which \ncommitted us to a course of action which would, by violating the ABM \nTreaty, jeopardize the reductions in the numbers of offensive nuclear \nweapons on the side of the Russians. We failed to do that by a couple \nvotes.\n  Let me put some numbers on this. If the Russians see us violating a \ntreaty which has allowed us to negotiate reductions in offensive \nnuclear weapons, the likelihood is that we are going to face 8,000 \nRussian nuclear weapons instead of about 3,000. To put this in very \nspecific numbers, that is what we are talking about. That is what the \nstakes are here, and that is why the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff and the Secretary of Defense expressed such grave doubts about \nthe language in this bill.\n  There were a number of problems which we confronted and which, we \nhope, we resolved in a sensible way. One problem which was in the bill \nwhich we have attempted to address was the unilateral declaration as to \nwhat the dividing line is between theater missile defenses and \nstrategic missile defenses. It is clear that the ABM agreement does not \ncover theater missile defenses. I think everybody would agree to that.\n  I think everyone would also agree, at least I hope they would, that \nin the event of a substantial modification of the ABM Treaty, that the \nPresident then must submit that modification to the Senate for advice \nand consent to ratification. As a matter of fact, this substitute \namendment refers to section 232 of the Fiscal Year 1995 National \nDefense Authorization Act which provided exactly that. That is existing \nlaw; it says that:\n\n       The United States shall not be bound by any international \n     agreement that would substantively modify the ABM Treaty \n     unless the agreement is entered into pursuant to the treaty-\n     making power of the President under the Constitution.\n\n  That is the law regardless of this bill. That is the law of the land. \nYou cannot substantially modify a treaty unless you get advice and \nconsent to ratification by the Senate, which previously approved that \ntreaty. That is the law, with or without our statute saying that. We \nalready have a statute which repeats that law, and we made reference to \nthat statute.\n  But unless this substitute language is adopted, the bill declares \nwhat the dividing line is between these strategic and theater missile \ndefense systems, declares the specific dividing line and says to the \nPresident in the bill, you cannot negotiate any other dividing line. \nYou cannot sit down with the \n\n[[Page S 12588]]\nRussians and come up with any dividing line between strategic and \ntheater missile defense systems other than the one we are unilaterally \ndeclaring in this bill. That makes the Senate the negotiator, not the \nPresident of the United States.\n  While we can advise and consent to ratification, we are not the party \nthat negotiates the treaty. It was a mistake in this bill to attempt to \nput that dividing line between strategic missile defensive systems \ncovered by the ABM Treaty, and the theater missile defense systems not \ncovered, into law. We have corrected that. We have indicated what we \nbelieve the correct dividing line is. We have now told the President, \nin effect, that you are free to negotiate, but if you negotiate a \ndifferent demarcation, do not use the funds that we provide in the \nappropriation bill to implement that without giving Congress the \nopportunity to approve or to disapprove. That is very different. That \nis strikingly different from what was in the bill itself.\n  Following these efforts to amend the language in the bill prior to \nthe recess, we entered into lengthy discussions at the request of the \nmajority leader and Senator Daschle, the Democratic leader. The four of \nus spent many days, as has been outlined, in devising the substitute \nwhich is before us. This substitute corrects the major defects and many \nof the smaller defects in the original language. It basically returns \nus to the approach in current law. The approach in current law is that \nwe want an option to deploy. We are not committed to deploy, but we \nwant an option.\n  The approach in the substitute is that we want to develop for \ndeployment a national missile defense system, but what we say in the \nsubstitute is that we are not deciding to deploy that here and now. \nThat is very explicitly left to a later decision. We also say that \ndecision should follow consideration of a number of things: Cost \neffectiveness, military effectiveness, the threat, and the impact on \nthe ABM Treaty. That is the vital difference between the bill's \nlanguage and the substitute.\n  In section 233 of the substitute, we explicitly state that the policy \nof the United States is to develop for deployment a multiple-site \nnational missile defense system. And then we go into the ifs, ands, and \nthe buts. The bill said ``deploy''--no ifs, ands, or buts. The \nsubstitute says ``develop for deployment'', but with these ifs, these \nands, and these buts. The critical ones, again, are to be cost \neffective, militarily effective, consistent with the threat, and not \nadversely affect the ABM Treaty, or at least, if we are going to decide \nto deploy, do so in a way which is through processes that are specified \nwithin or consistent with the ABM Treaty.\n  The critical language here is that we say explicitly that it is the \npolicy of the United States to ``ensure congressional review prior to a \ndecision to deploy the system developed for deployment under paragraph \n2 of (a) the affordability and operational effectiveness of such a \nsystem, (b) the threat to be countered by such a system, and (c) ABM \nTreaty considerations with respect to such a system.''\n  Mr. President, again, I want to thank our colleagues for their long \nand very arduous discussions. It has produced a substitute which I can, \nin good conscience, support, because we have removed the objectionable \nlanguage in the bill which committed us to deploy a system which, by \nviolating the ABM Treaty, would have almost certainly led to our facing \nthousands of more offensive nuclear warheads than we otherwise would be \nfacing. We have attempted to carry out the thoughts of General \nShalikashvili and his caution to us about the importance of our \nrelationship with Russia and trying to maintain it in a stable way and \nnot to be unilaterally declaring that we are going to abrogate \nagreements we have entered into with their predecessor. We have done so \nin a bipartisan way. I hope that we have done so in a constructive and \na thoughtful way which will command the broad support of Members of \nthis body.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this point a \nnumber of documents, including the letters referred to from General \nShalikashvili, Secretary Perry, a side-by-side comparison of the bill \nand the substitute language relative to the ABM Treaty, as well as a \nfurther amplification of my statement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 28, 1995.\n     Hon. Sam Nunn,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nunn: I write to register my strong opposition \n     to the missile defense provisions of the SASC's Defense \n     Authorization bill, which would institute Congressional \n     micromanagement of the Administration's missile defense \n     program and put us on a pathway to abrogate the ABM Treaty. \n     The Administration is committed to respond to ballistic \n     missile threats to our forces, allies, and territory. We will \n     not permit the capability of the defenses we field to meet \n     those threats to be compromised.\n       The bill's provisions would add nothing to DoD's ability to \n     pursue our missile defense programs, and would needlessly \n     cause us to incur excess costs and serious security risks. \n     The bill would require the US to make a decision now on \n     developing a specific national missile defense for deployment \n     by 2003, with interim operational capability in 1999, despite \n     the fact that a valid strategic missile threat has not \n     emerged. Our NMD program is designed to give us the \n     capability for a deployment decision in three years, when we \n     will be in a much better position to assess the threat and \n     deploy the most technologically advanced systems available. \n     The bill would also terminate valuable elements of our TMD \n     program, the Boost Phase Intercept and MEADS/Corp SAM \n     systems. MEADS is not only a valuable defense system but is \n     an important test of future trans-Atlantic defense \n     cooperation.\n       In addition, certain provisions related to the ABM Treaty \n     would be very damaging to US security reasons. By mandating \n     actions that would lead us to violate or disregard US Treaty \n     obligations--such as establishing a deployment date of a \n     multiple-site NMD system--the bill would jeopardize Russian \n     implementation of the START I and START II Treaties, which \n     involve the elimination of many thousands of strategic \n     nuclear weapons. The bill's unwarranted imposition, through \n     funding restrictions, of a unilateral ABM/TMD demarcation \n     interpretation would similarly jeopardize these reductions, \n     and would raise significant international legal issues as \n     well as fundamental constitutional issues regarding the \n     President's authority over the conduct of foreign affairs. \n     These serious consequences argue for conducting the proposed \n     Senate review of the ABM Treaty before considering such \n     drastic and far-reaching measures.\n       Unless these provisions are eliminated or significantly \n     modified, they threaten to undermine fundamental national \n     security interests of the United States. I will continue to \n     do everything possible to work with the Senate to see that \n     these priorities are not compromised.\n           Sincerely,\n     William J. Perry.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                              Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 28, 1995.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin. Thank you for your letter and the \n     opportunity to express my views concerning the impact of \n     Senator Warner's proposed language for the FY 1996 Defense \n     Authorization Bill on current theater missile defense (TMD) \n     programs.\n       Because the Russians have repeatedly linked the ABM Treaty \n     with other arms control issues--particularly ratification of \n     START II now before the Duma--we cannot assume they would \n     deal in isolation with unilateral US legislation detailing \n     technical parameters for ABM Treaty interpretation. While we \n     believe that START II is in both countries' interests \n     regardless of other events, we must assume such unilateral US \n     legislation could harm prospects for START II ratification by \n     the Duma and probably impact our broader security \n     relationship with Russia as well.\n       We are continuing to work on TMD systems. The ongoing \n     testing of THAAD through the demonstration/validation program \n     has been certified ABM Treaty compliant as has the Navy Upper \n     Tier program. Thus, progress on these programs is not \n     restricted by the lack of a demarcation agreement. We have no \n     plans and do not desire to test THAAD or other TMD systems in \n     an ABM mode.\n       Even though testing and development of TMD systems is \n     underway now, we believe it is useful to continue discussions \n     with the Russians to seek resolution of the ABM/TMD issue in \n     a way which preserves our security equities. Were such \n     dialogue to be prohibited, we might eventually find ourselves \n     forced to choose between giving up elements of our TMD \n     development programs or proceeding unilaterally in a manner \n     which could undermine the ABM Treaty and our broader security \n     relationship with Russia. Either alternative would impose \n     security costs and risks which we are seeking to avoid.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            John M. Shalikashvili,\n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                  \n[[Page S 12589]]\n\n\n           Missile Defense Act of 1995: Substitute Amendment\n\n       Side-by-side comparison of the Missile Defense Act in S. \n     1026 and the substitute amendment of August 10, 1995.\n\n\n                            sec. 233. policy\n\n       The bill asserted that the policy of the U.S. was:\n       To ``deploy a multiple site'' national missile defense \n     system that ``will be'' augmented to provide a larger defense \n     in the future.\n       The substitute amendment has as the policy:\n       To develop for deployment a national missile defense system \n     that can be augmented.\n       To negotiate with Russia to provide for such a system, \n     based on the ABM Treaty.\n       To consider, if those negotiations fail, the option of \n     withdrawing from the ABM Treaty.\n       The purpose of the system is to defend only against \n     limited, accidental and unauthorized missile attacks.\n       A new provision in the substitute amendment states the \n     policy that:\n       Congress shall review the affordability, the operational \n     effectiveness and the threat to be countered by the national \n     missile defense system, and ABM Treaty considerations, prior \n     to deciding whether to deploy the system.\n       The last new policy provision:\n       To carry out the policies, programs and requirements of the \n     Missile Defense Act through processes specified in or \n     consistent with the ABM Treaty.\n\n\n                 sec. 234. theater missile architecture\n\n       The bill requires the Pentagon to meet certain dates for \n     the specified programs.\n       The substitute amendment:\n       Relaxes the requirement to meet those dates,\n       Requires a report for each program/date explaining the cost \n     and technical risk of meeting those dates,\n       And requires a report on the specific threats to be \n     countered by each TMD system.\n\n\n            sec. 235. national missile defense architecture\n\n       The Bill requires the Pentagon to develop a national \n     missile defense system which will be operational first in \n     2003. It requires the system to include ground-based \n     interceptors ``deployed at multiple sties''.\n       The substitute amendment requires the Pentagon to develop a \n     national missile defense system that is capable of being \n     first operational by the end of 2003. It states that the \n     system shall include ground-based interceptors capable of \n     being deployed at multiple sites.\n       Interim capability: The bill required the Pentagon to \n     develop an interim capability to be operational by 1999.\n       The substitute amendment requires the Pentagon to develop a \n     plan instead of a capability, and that it would give the U.S. \n     the ability to have such an interim capability in place by \n     1999 if required by the threat.\n       The substitute amendment also requires a report that would \n     include information on the cost of the program, the specific \n     threat to be countered, and the Defense Secretary's \n     assessment of whether deployment is affordable and \n     operationally effective.\n\n\n               sec. 237. policy regarding the abm treaty\n\n       The Bill has sense of Congress language that:\n       The Senate should conduct a review of the ABM Treaty.\n       The Senate should consider establishing a Select Committee \n     to conduct the review, and\n       The President should cease all efforts to ``modify, \n     clarify, or otherwise alter'' our obligations under the ABM \n     Treaty.\n       The Bill requires the Secretary of Defense to provide a \n     declassified record of the ABM Treaty negotiations.\n       The substitute amendment adds findings related to the ABM \n     Treaty, including that the policies, programs and \n     requirements of the Missile Defense Act can be accomplished \n     in accordance or consistent with the ABM Treaty.\n       The substitute amendment:\n       Strikes the proposal to establish a Select Committee.\n       Strikes the proposal that the President cease all efforts \n     to modify or clarify our obligations under the ABM Treaty.\n       Strikes the entire provision calling for a declassified \n     treaty negotiating record.\n       States that the Foreign Relations and Armed Services \n     committees should conduct the review of the Treaty.\n\n\nSec. 238. Prohibition on Funds to Implement a TMD Demarcation Agreement\n\n       The Bill:\n       States the policy that ``unless and until'' a missile \n     defense system is tested against a target missile with a \n     range greater than 3,500 km or a velocity greater than 5 km \n     per second, it has not been tested ``in an ABM mode'' nor \n     ``been given capabilities to counter strategic ballistic \n     missiles'' (both of which are prohibited by the ABM Treaty), \n     and therefore is not subject to ABM Treaty application or \n     restrictions.\n       Prohibits any appropriated funds from being obligated or \n     expended by any official of the federal government to apply \n     the ABM Treaty to TMD systems, or for ``taking any other \n     action'' to have the ABM Treaty apply to TMD systems. (This \n     would prevent any discussion or negotiation by federal \n     officials with the Russians to consider any other demarcation \n     than the one specified in the bill.)\n       The substitute amendment strikes Sec. 238 and replaces it \n     with:\n       Two findings that restate items from previous Acts.\n       Sense of the Congress language defining the TMD demarcation \n     (3,500 km/ 5kps), and stating that unless a TMD system is \n     tested above the demarcation threshold, the system has not \n     been tested in an ABM mode, nor deemed to have been given \n     capabilities to counter strategic ballistic missiles''.\n       Sense of Congress language saying that any agreement with \n     Russia that would be more restrictive than the demarcation \n     provided should require ratification.\n       Binding prohibition on funding: FY 96 DOD funds cannot be \n     used to implement a demarcation agreement unless: provided in \n     a subsequent act (majority vote), or if the agreement goes \n     through the ratification process.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Again, I thank my good friends from Georgia, Virginia, and \nMaine for their hard work. I thank the chairman for his support of this \neffort, and I thank, also, Senator Daschle, who has spent so much time \non this effort to make sure that we come up with a solution which \nsatisfies the basic principles that we set out to achieve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the able Senator \nfrom Virginia, Senator Warner.\n  Mr. COHEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. COHEN. Would the Senator from Virginia be willing to delete from \nthe Record the depositing of any legal responsibility on my doorstep?\n  Mr. NUNN. I will object to any such deletion, Mr. President. I think \nthe responsibility is clearly established.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think that brief exchange underlines \nwhat has been said by all of my colleagues preceding me regarding the \nfour of us having been associated now more than 17 years together on \nthis committee, under the tutelage of Senators like Senator Thurmond, \nSenator Stennis, Senator Tower, and Senator Jackson. These were great \nteachers. We had the opportunity to learn from them. I hope that today \nin our service to the Senate as members of this committee, we can \nachieve some of the goals that those great Senators contributed to \nlegislation for the national security of the United States.\n  Mr. President, as I listened to these remarks, it occurs to me that \nif we were walking down Main Street America today and we were to be \nstopped and questioned by any of our constituents, candidly, I say to \nthe Senate, they would think this system is in place today.\n  It is inconceivable after the billions and billions and billions of \ndollars we have spent on our national defense over the last, really, \ntwo decades, that a series of Presidents and a series of Congresses \nhave not put in place for the basic protection of the American citizen \nsomething to interdict the accidental or unintended firing of an \nintercontinental missile.\n  This is not star wars. I will ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, \nto have printed in the Record following my remarks an article that \nappeared today in the Washington Post, in which I and other Members \nwere interviewed to talk about this particular piece of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. It took me some time to try to get home to the reporter, \nand indeed I think he grasped it rather readily, that the biggest \nburden we had is to overcome the lingering apprehension that what we \nare doing in this amendment is laying the foundation for another star \nwars program. That is not the case. It is a very limited defense. It is \nprecisely as described by those who have spoken previously, a system \nfor limited purposes.\n  It is in the interest of the former Soviet Union, and particularly \nRussia, that this be put in place because should an accidental firing \noccur, perhaps the first focus of attention would be turned to Russia. \nI am hopeful that this technology that will be developed could be used \nby Russia to install their own system. We do not fear in this country \nRussia putting in a system comparable to this. It is in the mutual \nbenefit of both nations to have such a system.\n  I am happy to have joined with my colleagues. Someone mentioned it is \nlike the old four horsemen getting together once again to resolve a \nsituation which for a period of time appeared to be unresolvable.\n  I want to say that Senator Cohen and I particularly value the advice \nand \n\n[[Page S 12590]]\ncounsel we received from the distinguished chairman of the committee, \nSenator Thurmond, Senator Lott, Senator Smith, and Senator Kyl. Each of \nthese Senators have spent a number of years studying this question. \nParticularly in the House, Senator Kyl was well known for his knowledge \non this subject. He was particularly helpful in the course of our \nnegotiations.\n  Prior to taking the position Senator Cohen and I worked up with our \ncolleagues to its final stage, Senator Thurmond convened the full Armed \nServices Committee. Every single member was present. They looked it \nover very carefully. Then we sat down and finalized it with our \ndistinguished colleagues and friends of long standing, the Senator from \nGeorgia and the Senator from Michigan.\n  It is a significant step forward. I was extremely heartened tonight \nwhen Senator Nunn said he had an opportunity to speak with the \nSecretary of Defense. I think this Nation is fortunate to have such a \nfine man as Secretary Perry to take on that heavy and, indeed in many \nrespects, thankless responsibility. This is an area in which he has \nworked for many, many years. All four of us that negotiated this have \nworked with the Aspen Institute when he was one of the leaders of that \ndiscussion forum, and we covered many times--many times--issues \nrelating to the intercontinental missile systems, the deterrence, and \nthe several treaties. Given his background, I hope that he can be \npersuasive to the President and other members of the administration so \nthat this amendment can be accepted. Indeed, not only accepted, but \nperhaps supported.\n  Neither side gained everything they want. That is the essence of a \nnegotiation. The result of this effort is a Missile Defense Act of \n1995, a substitute for the original one in the bill which sets a clear \npath for deployment. That is the way I would like to state it--a clear \npath to deployment.\n  We in the United States cannot--particularly the legislative branch \nof Government--dictate that a certain system will be deployed. Frankly, \nwe do not even know that it will work, we say with considerable candor. \nThe technology is unfolding so rapidly, we do not know exactly whether \nit can work.\n  There is also a very serious element of the cost associated with this \nsystem. These are things that have to be worked out in the future. But \nwe have set, in this amendment, the United States of America on a clear \npath of deployment. Let there be no mistake about that, no wavering--I \ncan certainly speak for this side of the aisle--no wavering of the \nintents of the present composition of the U.S. Senate on this side of \nthe aisle as to the ultimate goal of deploying such a system.\n  Why? Because it is in the mutual interests of ourselves and Russia \nand other nations of the world; and secondly, the American public not \nonly demands it, they think it is its place right now. They would \nexpect no less of a President or series of Presidents and a series of \nCongresses.\n  In the course of our deliberations, there were many concerned with \nthe issue of why now? Why must we press this on now? If we start \ntonight on developing this system, it might well be to the year 2003 or \nlater--7, 8, 9, 10 years--before the system can be developed; that is, \nresearch and development completed and in place to protect the American \ncitizen--perhaps a decade.\n  In the same period of time, there are estimates that those nations \napart from Russia and our allies who particularly want to develop for \nthemselves the missile system, they will have in all likelihood systems \nof their own in place. Many of the nations that we fear most today have \nthis as a top agenda item, to build this type of system.\n  My point is, there is a coincidence in time of the defensive system \nthat we want to put in place and the offensive systems being developed \nby other nations, call them rogue nations, who very much desire to \nthreaten the United States some day with a missile.\n  The revised Missile Defense Act of 1995 establishes a policy of \ndevelopment for deployment of a multiple-site national missile defense \nsystem capable of defending the United States--that is, from the \nlimited attack--and prohibits any final effort by the administration to \nimpose limitations without the consent of the U.S. Senate pursuant to \nthe Constitution of the United States on the development and deployment \nof a U.S. theater missile defense system by virtue of new \ninterpretations of the ABM Treaty of 1972.\n  I was extremely heartened to hear my distinguished colleague from \nMichigan say unequivocally that that treaty does not cover short-range \nballistic missile systems. That is important. I would rejoin by saying, \nbut the technology advances that have taken place since 1972 force now \nthis type of legislation which is intended to maintain an operation \nbetween the theater systems and the intercontinental systems and \nmaintain that separation in a way that will not undermine the \nfundamental goals of the ABM Treaty.\n  The principle focus of my remarks today is on the changes made to \nsection 238 of the Missile Defense Act of 1995. That is a section that \nI worked on as a member of the Armed Services Committee and an \namendment which I put forth in that committee which was eventually \nincorporated into the bill as now written. And that amendment of mine \nis being revised by this amendment, which is the subject of the \ndiscussion for the moment.\n  As it originally appeared in my amendment, section 238 used the \nSenate's power of the purse to impose a broad and absolute prohibition \non the administration's ability to take any action which imposed ABM \nTreaty restrictions on the development and deployment of theater \nmissile defense systems. These systems are urgently needed to protect \nthe lives of the men and women of the armed services and our allies in \ntheir forward-deployed situations.\n  How well we know that. Senator Nunn recounted, in the course of our \nlast debate, how Senator Nunn, Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, and I \nwere in Tel Aviv when the last Scud missile fell and we saw firsthand \nthe use of that system, not for military purposes but for purposes of \nsheer terrorism. Saddam Hussein leveled that system on Tel Aviv for no \nother purpose than to terrorize those people. The Patriot, as best it \ncould--the best defense we had at that period of time--I think in a \ncredible manner interdicted a number of those missiles. That is why we \nare here tonight to lay the foundation to move ahead in the technology \nso that we can employ all of the brains, all the technology without any \nrestriction imposed by the ABM Treaty on developing the future systems \nto interdict the short-range ballistic missiles that were encountered \nduring the gulf war.\n  The bipartisan amendment, which we urge the Senate to adopt, achieves \nour goal, namely to prohibit the administration from implementing any \nagreement with Russia which would impose limitations including \nperformance, operation or deployment limitations on theater missile \nsystems unless the Senate exercised, pursuant to a Presidential \nsubmission of such agreement, its constitutional right of advice and \nconsent.\n  The 1972 ABM Treaty never intended, never envisioned the theater \nsystems. I was in the Department of the Navy at that time. I was in \nMoscow in 1972, when ABM was signed, as a part of President Nixon's \ndelegation. My duties then were related primarily to naval matters, but \nall of us in the Department of Defense watched with great interest how \nthis treaty, the ABM Treaty, was developed.\n  Dr. John Foster, who was then the Director of Research and \nDevelopment in the Pentagon, was one of the key individuals. I recently \nconsulted him about his recollection with respect to the ABM Treaty, \nand he confirmed what I believed was true then, as I do today, that the \nnegotiators never had in mind the theater systems which we must employ \nnow in our defense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask if I may have a few more minutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator may \nrequire for further debate.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman.\n  As I said before the Senate went on recess, during the original \ndebate on this amendment, I have long believed that we must accelerate \nthe development and then the deployment of operationally effective \ntheater missile systems for our troops, defenses that are not \nimproperly constrained by the \n\n[[Page S 12591]]\nABM Treaty. This amendment does that. Likewise, we must, in the \ninterests of the American people, make a clear statement of our \nnational determination to proceed to a national defense system to \nprotect against the threats enunciated in this bipartisan amendment.\n  The threat that theater missiles propose to our forces is clear. \nThirty nations have short-range theater ballistic missile systems, and \nmore and more each day are acquiring the same capability.\n  The gulf war should have caused all Americans to unite behind the \nmissile defense effort. What can be more terrifying than the thought of \nU.S. citizens, both at home and deployed overseas, defenseless against \nthis type of weapon of terror, once used by Saddam Hussein, and which \ncould be used in the future by others. Yet, here we are, 5 years after \nthat conflict in the gulf, and our troops are still not adequately, in \nmy judgment, protected from ballistic missile attacks. And there are \nthose who still resist efforts to move forward in this area.\n  Fortunately, I think, as a result of this compromise, we now have \ngained sufficient strength in the U.S. Senate to move this amendment \ntomorrow in a positive way.\n  Mr. President, it became evident to me, earlier this year, that our \ncrucial effort to develop and deploy the most capable theater missile \ndefense systems was in danger of being unacceptably hampered by the \nadministration's desire to achieve a demarcation agreement with the \nRussians. They were actively negotiating toward that goal. Several of \nthe negotiating positions either proposed or accepted by the \nadministration would have severely limited the technological \ndevelopment of U.S. theater missile defense systems, and would have \nresulted in an international agreement imposing major new limitations \non the United States. Consequently, I have taken actions in 1994 and \nnow in 1995 to prohibit such actions by the administration.\n  Mr. President, previously I have tried other avenues to have the \nSenate's voice heard on the issue of ABM/TMD demarcation. My preferred \noption--and the one which I tried last year--was simply to require the \nPresident to present to the Senate for advice and consent any \ndemarcation agreement which would substantially modify the ABM Treaty. \nThe Congress adopted my views and made them part of the fiscal year \n1995 Defense Authorization Act.\n  However, despite that legal requirement, the administration has made \nit abundantly clear that it does not intend to submit any such \ndemarcation agreement, pursuant to the Constitution, to the Senate for \nadvice and consent. Although the administration was negotiating an \nagreement that would, in effect, make the ABM Treaty a TMD Treaty, \nadministration officials believed that there was no need for the Senate \nto exercise its constitutional right to provide advice and consent to \nthat agreement.\n  It was clear that a new approach was needed. Therefore, I focused on \nthe Congress' power of the purse to ensure that the views of the Senate \nwere considered in the demarcation negotiations.\n  The bipartisan missile defense amendment preserves this approach. \nSection 238 prohibits the expenditure of funds for fiscal year 1996 to \nimplement an agreement that would establish a demarcation between \ntheater missile defense systems and ABM systems or that would restrict \nthe performance, operation or deployment of U.S. theater missile \ndefense systems, unless that agreement is entered into pursuant to the \ntreaty-making powers of the President, or to the extent provided in an \nact subsequently enacted by the Congress. In other words, for the \ncoming fiscal year the prohibition stands unless the Senate takes an \naffirmative act to change or remove that prohibition.\n  In addition, this provision establishes as a sense of the Congress \nthe generally accepted demarcation standard between TMD and ABM \nsystems. Section 238(b)(1) states that ``unless a missile defense \nsystem, system upgrade, or system component, including one that \nexploits data from space-based or other external sensors, if flight \ntested against a ballistic missile target that exceeds a range of 3,500 \nkilometers or a velocity of 5 kilometers per second, such missile \ndefense system, system upgrade, or system component has not been tested \nin an ABM mode nor deemed to have been given capabilities to counter \nstrategic ballistic missiles.'' This was the standard used by the \nClinton administration at the beginning of the demarcation negotiations \nin November 1993. The administration would be well-advised to return to \nthat standard.\n  Mr. President, I would have preferred a prohibition that would have \nremained in effect for more than 1 fiscal year. I would have preferred \na demarcation standard adopted in a binding form, rather than as a \nsense of the Congress. But I believe that the essence of my original \namendment was preserved in this compromise package.\n  This legislation represents a significant step forward in the effort \nto provide the men and women of the Armed Forces with the most \neffective theater missile defense systems that our great nation is \ncapable of producing. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Finally Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge my special appreciation \nand respect for Senator Cohen's very valuable contribution to the \nnegotiations leading up to the bipartisan amendment. We have worked \ntogether for 17 years on the Armed Services Committee, and I value his \nadvise and counsel.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n            Congress to Push For a National Missile Defense\n\n                           By Bradley Graham\n\n       Two years after the Clinton administration placed the \n     program on a back burner, Congress is about to redouble U.S. \n     efforts to build a national system against ballistic missile \n     attack, putting it at odds with the White House and at risk \n     of confrontation with the Kremlin.\n       Republicans leading the initiative stress their plan is not \n     a return to the ``Star Wars'' dream of President Ronald \n     Reagan, who envisioned a space-based shield that would make \n     the United States impenetrable to a massive launch of enemy \n     missiles. Rather, the stated aim now is to erect a more \n     modest, ground-based system that would protect the country \n     against accidental launch or limited attack at a time when \n     more nations are coming into the possession of ballistic \n     missiles.\n       But opponents regard even this scaled-back effort as \n     dubious technologically and not urgent strategically since \n     little immediate threat exists. They say the program is a \n     waste of the billions of dollars that the House and Senate \n     appear ready to pour into it over the next few years.\n       Moreover, administration officials worry that a hellbent \n     congressional effort to develop a missile defense system, \n     coupled with renewed Republican talk of undoing the 1972 \n     Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, will upset relations \n     with Moscow and scuttle the planned elimination of thousands \n     of nuclear warheads.\n       When the Senate returns from its August recess today, it is \n     scheduled to debate a compromise measure hammered out by a \n     four-man bipartisan group to avoid breaching the ABM Treaty \n     while still calling for accelerated development of a national \n     missile defense system.\n       In attempting to establish a policy that can be supported \n     by a broad majority of senators, however, the measure \n     effectively postpones the day of political reckoning between \n     proponents and opponents of a national system and between \n     Washington and Moscow.\n       The measure would direct the Pentagon to ``develop for \n     deployment'' a multisite missile defense system capable of \n     being operational by 2003. But the decision to deploy would \n     be put off until an unspecified time and subjected to \n     considerations of affordability, effectiveness, threat \n     assessment and treaty implications.\n       ``I am not opposed to having an option to deploy providing \n     we don't move toward it in a hasty way,'' said Carl M. Levin \n     (D-Mich.), a liberal whose involvement in negotiating the \n     compromise was key. ``What I strongly oppose is doing it in a \n     way that would undermine the relationship with Russia and the \n     whole planned dismantlement of nuclear weapons.''\n       For the Republicans who won control of Congress last \n     November, revival of the missile defense issue seemed at \n     first a simple way of dramatizing their general appeal for a \n     stronger defense, while also addressing their real concern \n     about the growing number of rogue states with access to \n     ballistic missiles.\n       The GOP's ``Contract With America'' called for faster \n     deployment of a national missile defense system. Many \n     Republicans have sought to frame the political debate around \n     the fact that the United States has no system to fend off \n     even a single incoming ballistic missile. Opinion polls show \n     that most Americans are surprise to learn the country lacks \n     such a system.\n       But wrangles over the continued relevance of the ABM Treaty \n     have complicated the debate. So has a related dispute about \n     where to \n\n[[Page S 12592]]\n     draw the line between a national defense system, which is covered by \n     the treaty, and increasingly powerful ``theater'' systems for \n     guarding against shorter-range missile attack, which do not \n     come under the treaty's purview.\n       The 23-year-old ABM pact was meant to block Washington and \n     Moscow from building nationwide defenses against ballistic \n     missile attack, on the premise that as long as each country \n     is vulnerable to the other's nuclear arsenal, neither will \n     attack the other. The accord allows each side to establish a \n     single-site system with no more than 100 interceptor \n     missiles.\n       Administration officials say the treaty remains a \n     cornerstone of international arms control efforts and \n     abrogating it would jeopardize plans to cut U.S. and Russian \n     nuclear arsenals to 3,000 warheads and possibly fewer \n     under strategic arms reduction treaties. Such arms control \n     agreements, not antimissile weapons systems, offer the \n     more reliable protection for U.S. interests, say missile \n     defense skeptics.\n       ``No one will reduce their strategic forces if there's a \n     buildup in strategic defense,'' said Spurgeon M. Keeny Jr., \n     director of the Arms Control Association. ``If we lose all of \n     this for a system that might kill only a handful of missiles, \n     it's madness. We'll soon find much of the Defense \n     Department's procurement budget going into this Fortress \n     America.''\n       But some key Republican players have questioned the \n     relevance of the ABM Treaty in today's security environment, \n     arguing that Cold War logic does not hold in a world no \n     longer dominated by U.S.-Soviet tensions and now menaced by \n     less familiar adversaries.\n       ``Frankly, we think the ABM Treaty has to be renegotiated, \n     so I'm not too concerned about bumping up against it,'' said \n     Sen. John Kyl (R-Ariz.). ``We've pretty much established the \n     need to revise it, so we might as well face up to that.''\n       A month ago, Senate Republicans were backing language in \n     the 1996 defense authorization bill that required deployment \n     of a multisite missile defense system by 2003. Arguing that \n     such a move would violate the ABM Treaty, Democrats prepared \n     to filibuster and the Clinton administration threatened to \n     veto the bill if it passed.\n       After nearly a week of intensive talks in early August, \n     Sens. Levin, Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), John W. Warner (R-Va.) and \n     William S. Cohen (R-Maine) offered a compromise substitute \n     amendment--expected to win floor approval this week--that \n     promises to avert a showdown with the White House for now and \n     clear the way for passage of a defense authorization bill.\n       The measure reaffirms that U.S. policy is to act \n     consistently with the ABM Treaty but also approves \n     negotiations with the Russians on the admissibility of the \n     planned U.S. system. If those talks fail, the amendment \n     asserts, the United States can consider withdrawing from the \n     treaty.\n       The House already has approved a 1996 defense bill calling \n     for deployment ``as soon as practical'' of a national missile \n     defense system, without specifying the number of sites. And \n     both the House and Senate are proposing to add several \n     hundred million dollars to the Clinton administration program \n     in fiscal 1996 for work on a national missile defense system.\n       The Clinton administration is not opposed to developing a \n     system capable of protecting U.S. territory. It budgeted \n     nearly $400 million for 1996 to pursue technologies for a \n     ground-based system, beefing up the program a bit in view of \n     congressional interest to include a deployment contingency \n     early next century.\n       But when it took office in 1993, the administration \n     drastically reordered the priorities of the Pentagon's \n     missile defense effort, shrinking work on a national system, \n     renaming the supervising agency, and concentrating about 80 \n     percent of the funds of what is now called the Ballistic \n     Missile Defense Organization on fielding theater defense \n     systems to protect U.S. troops in combat zones abroad.\n       The rationale for the shift was the belief that the spread \n     of shorter-range ballistic missiles poses a more immediate \n     threat than the possibility of hostile nations developing \n     intercontinental missiles that can strike the United States.\n       Currently, more than 15 Third World nations have ballistic \n     missiles and 77 have cruise missiles, according to U.S. \n     intelligence reports. By contrast, only several former Soviet \n     states and China possess missiles capable of reaching the \n     continental United States, and the U.S. intelligence \n     community sees no new country developing the capability to \n     hit the United States with a long-range missile for the next \n     decade.\n       Administration officials also contend the likelihood of \n     accidental launch by Russia or China is decreasing due to the \n     elimination of many nuclear warheads in the former Soviet \n     states and more reliable command and control procedures for \n     Russian and Chinese forces. Moreover, they argue that with \n     rapid advances occurring in information technologies, \n     premature deployment of a U.S. system would limit the \n     technical options and risk saddling the United States with an \n     overly costly and quickly outdated system.\n       Other critics of a national system note that the country \n     has been trying off and on for several decades to build one, \n     without much success. More than $38 billion went into \n     Reagan's Star Wars program alone.\n       ``People are talking as if we've never tried this before,'' \n     said Stephen I. Schwartz, director of the Brookings \n     Institution's U.S. Nuclear Weapons Cost Study Project. ``We \n     don't seem to learn from the fact that we spent a lot of \n     money before and didn't get much for it.''\n       But many Republican legislators worry the administration is \n     underestimating how quickly the threat of ballistic missile \n     attacks from rogue countries may materialize. They cite \n     development of North Korea's Taepo Dong-2 missile, capable of \n     reaching Alaska or parts of Hawaii, and the potential sale to \n     Third World countries of Russia's SS-25 as a space launch \n     vehicle.\n       In fact, the U.S. intelligence community has been slow to \n     provide a current estimate of the emerging missile threat to \n     the United States. Lt. Gen. Malcolm O'Neill, who heads the \n     Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, said in an \n     interview that he has been waiting more than eight months for \n     an update measuring the degree of uncertainty in the U.S. \n     prediction.\n       Advocates of a national system, mindful of past failures to \n     achieve their dream, contend the technology is now within \n     reach.\n       ``This is not Star Wars, this is not an umbrella system,'' \n     asserted Warner, the Virginia senator. This is a bare bones \n     effort to build a system to intercept missiles launched \n     accidentally in limited number.''\n       Some of the more hawkish proponents still argue for a more \n     ambitious setup, criticizing the Pentagon's current focus on \n     ground-based interceptors. A study earlier this year by the \n     Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank recommended \n     concentrating instead on a Navy plan to deploy ship-based \n     interceptors within three or four years, and then move to a \n     space-based system by early in the next decade.\n       One area in which Republicans and Democrats generally agree \n     is on the need for effective theater missile defense systems, \n     with the GOP eager to add even more money to development \n     efforts there as well. But the growing sophistication of \n     theater systems, is posing an ABM Treaty problem.\n       Some of the theater systems under development by the \n     Pentagon may prove powerful enough to thwart ballistic \n     missiles, meaning the Russians may view them as a national \n     defense system and thus a circumvention of the ABM Treaty.\n       Administration efforts to negotiate with Moscow a \n     distinction between defenses against long-range strategic \n     missiles and short-range theater missiles have drawn \n     Republican concern that the administration may be willing to \n     accept too many limits on development of theater defenses, \n     particularly on the speed of interceptors.\n       Accusing the administration of trying to apply the ABM \n     Treaty to theater systems, Senate Republicans originally \n     moved to include in the 1996 defense bill a unilateral \n     declaration of the dividing line between strategic and \n     theater weapons and a ban on the president negotiating any \n     other demarcation.\n       Administration officials protested that a unilateral \n     interpretation of the demarcation line was unwarranted \n     because the ABM Treaty is not constraining theater programs, \n     and unwise because enactment would threaten ratification of \n     the second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and set a \n     dangerous precedent.\n       The Senate compromise includes a nonbinding ``sense of \n     Congress'' provision reasserting what has been the \n     demarcation standard, which would exempt the Pentagon's \n     fastest, longest-range theater antimissile systems from ABM \n     coverage as long as they were not tested against a missile \n     with a range greater than 3,500 kilometers (or about 2,174 \n     miles) or a velocity greater than 5 kilometers (about 3 \n     miles) per second. But the measure also would permit the \n     president to negotiate an alternative demarcation line \n     between strategic and theater missiles, provided he sought \n     congressional ratification of any new agreement with Moscow--\n     a condition the administration has been reluctant to accept.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, the bill as reported set forth the proposed \npolicy for future missile defense as outlined here on the floor this \nevening. It also proposed the demarcation between theater and anti-\nballistic-missile defenses, and I am talking about the underlying bill, \nnot the substitute. In my judgment, however, and that of many other \nSenators, the proposal addressed these vital issues in a manner that \nunnecessarily presented major difficulties in terms of arms control and \nconstitutional considerations.\n  As Senator Levin pointed out so well, what we want to do is move \nforward with a missile defense against limited, unauthorized, third-\ncountry-type attacks, but what we do not want to do in the process of \ntrying to accomplish that goal, that important goal, we do not want to \nend up inadvertently and unintentionally ending the reduction of \nmissiles pointing at us that have already been agreed to. It would be \nthe supreme irony if, in dealing with a future threat, we ended up \nbasically negating 20 years of efforts to reduce the current threat, \nwhich is, of course, the continuation of very large numbers of \n\n[[Page S 12593]]\nmultiwarhead missiles pointing at the United States by Russia, which we \nhave agreed to dramatically reduce both in START I, which has been \nentered into, and START II, which is now pending and which we hope at \nsome point the Russian Duma, or legislative body, will, indeed, agree \nto.\n  So, in my floor statement on August 3, I outlined five major problems \nwith the version of the bill that this substitute is intended to \ncorrect and I believe does correct. This is the underlying bill.\n  First, I said on August 3, it abandons U.S. adherence to the ABM \nTreaty. What I meant by that, and what I would mean by that now, is it \nis an anticipatory breach, the way the original underlying bill is \nworded.\n  Second, abandoning adherence to that ABM Treaty now is unnecessary. \nWe can conduct an effective missile defense program, developing for \ndeployment, as the substitute called for in the near term, while \ncontinuing our adherence to the ABM Treaty. We do not have to make that \nchoice now. So why risk the very large reductions of the threat now \naimed toward us that are underway in order to accomplish a goal where \nwe do not have to make that move at this point in time?\n  Third, abandoning adherence now to the ABM Treaty is likely to impose \nhuge costs on us if Russia declines to carry out some of its legal \nobligations and in response to our anticipatory breach.\n  Fourth, the Senate Armed Service Committee bill abandons adherence by \nstealth rather than directing the administration to use the legal \nwithdrawal procedures contained in the treaty.\n  Mr. President, if we decide that the ABM Treaty is no longer in our \ninterest--we may get to that point at some point in the future because \nwe may find that we cannot negotiate the modest amendments required to \nprovide for this national defense. I hope that we can because I think \nit is in the mutual interest of the United States and Russia. But if we \nget to that point, then we ought to do what the ABM Treaty calls for, \nand that is to use legal withdrawal proceedings in our national \ninterest, supreme national interest. Of course, we can do that. I \nbelieve the timeframe is 6 months.\n  We have the right under that treaty to state that in our supreme \nnational interest, it is no longer in our supreme national interest to \nbe a part of that treaty, and then we withdraw from the treaty in \naccordance with the terms of treaty. That is the way to do it if we \never have to move in that direction or feel that it is in our interest \nto move in that direction.\n  Fifth, by failing to use the legal option under the treaty, the \nSenate would be compelling the executive branch to abandon adherence to \nthe ABM Treaty by usurping certain powers of the executive branch over \nthe conduct of foreign policy, a move that certainly would raise \nserious constitutional issues.\n  So, Mr. President, this is the underlying bill and the problem with \nthe underlying bill. That is what we are basically correcting with this \nsubstitute amendment.\n  Mr. President, again, I thank my colleague from Michigan, who did a \nsuperb job on this. I thank my colleague from Virginia and my colleague \nfrom Maine, Senator Warner and Senator Cohen, who are indeed not only \nknowledgeable but they are skillful in their negotiating ability and in \ntheir discerning ability to understand the fundamental issues as \nopposed to some of the rhetorical issues. I think that is the reason we \nwere able to work this out.\n  I thank the Senator from South Carolina, because he was the one who \ncame up with the idea of getting the four of us to work on this \nproposal and to try to find a way to reach a consensus. He also not \nonly instigated this effort but discussed it with the majority leader \nand the minority leader. He also constantly gave us both the \nencouragement and support, and indeed some very timely prodding to get \nthis agreement worked out.\n  So I appreciate the Senator from South Carolina and his leadership.\n  Mr. President, I believe that there are no other remarks after the \nSenator from Michigan, who may want to conclude. I believe we are about \nto wrap up the debate. I believe the Senator from Texas wants to take \nsome remarks.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield for a \nbrief question on this matter.\n  During the course of my remarks, I opined that I thought this \namendment as currently drawn would be in the mutual interest of the \nUnited States and Russia. Should an accidental firing occur, I think \nall attention would instantly focus on Russia as being the origin. And, \ntherefore, it seems to me, whether it was from Russia or wherever the \nmissile was fired from, I think the initial reaction of the American \npublic would be, well, they are the ones that have it, because many do \nnot understand in the years immediately preceding other nations have \ncome forward now and have made fundamental investment in the system.\n  So I just ask if my distinguished colleague concurs with my view that \nit is in the mutual interest of both Russia and the United States.\n  Mr. NUNN. I do. I say to my friend from Virginia that I think it is \nin the interest of the United States and Russia to both move forward \nwith modest adjustments to the ABM Treaty so both can protect their \ncountries against accidental unauthorized launch or third-country \nlaunch.\n  As the Senator from Virginia well knows, I first posed this question \nto the then head of the Strategic Air Command, Gen. Dick Ellis, a \nwonderful and fine Air Force general, now deceased. But that was in the \nearly 1980's. I asked him the question, I said, ``General Ellis, what \nbasically is our ability to detect the origin of some limited attack \nagainst the United States? Could we know for sure where that attack \noriginated? We would not have the ability to defend against it, and \nwould we know for sure the origin of that attack?'' He said he needed \nto study that.\n  He did study it. He and his whole team studied it for almost a year \nand came to the conclusion that the United States, while we had some \ncapability of determining the origin of attack, it was not nearly as \ngood as it should be and the Russians' ability was not as good as ours. \nMost of that study remains classified.\n  But I came out with a profound not only sense of unease about our \nability and their ability to detect the origin of attack, let us say \nfrom an underwater submarine which could be from a third country, but \nwe would both assume it was coming, if we were struck, from the other \nsuperpower in terms of nuclear arms. I came to the conclusion that \nneither of us had the capability that we needed in that regard.\n  But more importantly, I came to the conclusion that we both had a \nmutual stake in the ability of each to be able to detect the origin of \nan attack and also to be able to defend against that kind of an attack \nso that we never got into an inadvertent war that no one intended by \nmistake or by accident. And I still have that conclusion even though \nthe circumstances between the United States and Russia have now changed \ndramatically. We are no longer in this confrontation. We still have \nnuclear arms that will be with us for years to come even after we \nreduce under START I and START II.\n  So that is a long answer to the Senator's underlying question, but I \nthink it is a very important question. And the answer is, yes, I do \nbelieve Russia has a similar interest. I think we have many mutual \ninterests. In fact, our interest in terms of nuclear arms, in terms of \ndestruction, the safety, the handling, the prevention of leakage of \nthis kind of material, both nuclear, chemical, biological, as well as \ntechnology and the scientists, we have a tremendous mutual type of \nsecurity interest now with Russia more than perhaps any other nation \nbecause we are the two that have these nuclear weapons and the awesome \nresponsibility to deal with them responsibly so that we never, God \nforbid, have nuclear disaster, not only in this country but in Russia \nor in the world.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. I \nconclude that I, too, remember General Ellis very well. He was a highly \ndecorated fighter pilot in World War II. He was head of the Strategic \nAir Command. And, as my colleague will recall, he was appointed to the \nstanding consultative commission, which, Mr. President, is that body \nthat is entrusted with resolving underlying questions with respect to \nthe framework of arms control treaties, including the ABM. \n\n[[Page S 12594]]\nAnd he discharged that responsibility with great distinction.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to thank the able Senator from \nGeorgia for his kind remarks.\n  I now yield to the able Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, such \ntime as she may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the distinguished \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee. I, too, want to commend the \nchairman of the committee, the ranking member from Georgia, and the \ngroup that got together and worked long into the night before the \nsummer recess in an attempt to reach an accommodation that would allow \neveryone to feel comfortable about how we are treating theater missile \ndefense.\n  Mr. President, I want to speak because I believe that we have only \nsettled this issue in a very temporary way this year. But I want to say \nthat it is very important for us to look at this for the future because \nthis is going to be one of the major policy decisions that we are going \nto have to make, not only today but for the future. I think the Senator \nfrom Georgia was correct when he said that we may have to make some \nadjustments in the ABM Treaty. It may well be not only in our best \ninterest to do so, but it may be in the best interest of Russia as \nwell.\n  We are continuing to make adjustments in the post-cold war era. We do \nnot live in a bipolar world anymore. We now live in a multipolar world, \nbut we have treaties that were based on the bipolar world. We have many \nother concerns that were addressed in a bipolar context. We know now \nthat technology exists for ballistic missiles in more than 10 countries \naround the world.\n  No longer is the threat just from the missiles that we know are in \nRussia and some of the former republics of the Soviet Union that are \nnow independent countries. We now recognize that there are capabilities \nin many other nations around the world and that in the future the \ntechnology will likely proliferate to such an extent that many \ncountries may soon have the capability of launching ballistic missiles \nthat could threaten our Nation.\n  So it is incumbent on us as leaders of our country to prepare, and we \nmust have the time to do that and we must start looking at some of \nthese policy issues that must be addressed in this new multipolar \nworld.\n  As many of us who have traveled into some of the central European \ncountries and into the republics of the former Soviet Union know, this \nis an unstable world.\n  We are seeing ethnic conflicts. We are seeing border disputes. We are \nseeing turf wars. I think the United States is going to have to step \nback and decide, what our role should be in this new world? When are \nour armed forces going to be needed? When do we have a U.S. interest \nand when is that interest a vital U.S. security interest?\n  I think it is clear just from what has happened in the last 2 weeks \nthat the world is looking to America for leadership. If there is one \nthing America is--and it is probably the consensus in the world--we are \nthe beacon for a democracy that has worked and that has created the \nstrongest Nation in the history of the world. Because of that, many \ncountries are looking to us for leadership, and we must determine how \nmuch leadership we can give, how much is monetary, and how much is \nsecurity oriented. And I think that is going to have to set the stage \nfor how we prepare to be the world's superpower and yet maintain our \nstrength and protect our shores.\n  The greatest lesson of all is that the cold war was ended; we \nobtained that peace through strength. We did not end the cold war \nthrough weakness. Other countries in the world knew that we had the \ncapacity and the commitment to protect our interests. We must never \nveer from that fundamental principle that we are a superpower that will \nprotect ourselves. We must not allow unilateral disarmament of any \nkind, of any type.\n  When you talk about a treaty that was made in a bipolar world between \nthe two preeminent powers at the time you cannot have any confidence \nthat those who wrote that treaty could envision all of the things that \ncould happen in the world today. No treaty at that time could ever \nenvision the technologies available to many countries today that have \nrendered the treaty outdated, outmoded, and no longer a strong approach \nfor us to take. So we are going to have to look at our strategic \ninterests, and in doing that we are going to have to determine what we \nmust do as the leaders of our country to make sure we will have \nappropriate defenses against any missile that could ever come into our \nborders.\n  That is something we are going to have to debate this year, and we \nare going to have to continue our vigilance to make sure our young \npeople know they can be assured of the strength of our country and that \nwe have the foresight and the vision to maintain that strength.\n  I am going to support the compromise that has been reached, but I do \nhave reservations that we are not as a group looking to what we must do \nto make sure we have the strength to withstand any kind of attack that \ntechnology has the capability to deliver to our shores. And I think we \nare going to have to continue our debates, continue our studies, \ncontinue our technological advances, and under no circumstances at any \ntime should we say we are not going to defend our shores, that we are \nnot going to make sure that our nuclear stockpile, which is dormant, is \nnevertheless still capable. Unilateral disarmament is not anything we \ncan consider in any manner if we are going to remain the greatest and \nonly superpower left in the world.\n  So I commend my colleagues for coming to this conclusion. But it is \nmerely the beginning of a very important policy debate that I think is \ngoing to be more important as we learn more of the technologies and the \nintelligence about what is happening around the world in the area of \ndefense and security.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. \nAfter the debate is concluded on this matter, then we will have a wrap-\nup tonight. I have asked Senator Warner if he would conduct the wrap-up \non this side. He has agreed to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Michigan has some \nconcluding remarks and I would yield him such time as he may desire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend from Georgia.\n  Mr. President, I will be very brief, indeed.\n  Section 232 of Title X, which is the current law, reads as follows: \nthat the goal of the United States is ``to develop and maintain the \noption to deploy an antiballistic missile system that is capable of \nproviding a highly effective defense of the United States against \nlimited attacks of ballistic missiles.''\n  So the current law is to develop the option to deploy, but to decide \nat a future time whether or not to deploy, depending on the \ncircumstances at that time, including the threats at the time, and the \ncost and military effectiveness of such a system. The bill says deploy. \nThe current law says develop with an option to deploy. The bill says \ndeploy.\n  The substitute amendment goes back to the fundamental approach of the \nexisting law, which is to develop so that we can deploy, but then makes \nit very clear that we will make the decision on whether to deploy at a \nfuture date and specifies what the criteria are for consideration at \nthe time of that decision.\n  Section 233 of our bill says that it is the policy of the United \nStates, in subsection 3, to ``ensure congressional review prior to a \ndecision to deploy the system developed for deployment, under paragraph \n2'', of four things: the affordability and operational effectiveness of \nsuch a system, the threat to be countered by such a system, and fourth, \nABM Treaty considerations with respect to such a system.\n  In doing this, this substitute recognizes the importance of the ABM \nTreaty to our security. The ABM Treaty has been one of the reasons we \nhave been able to reduce the number of offensive nuclear weapons that \nface us.\n  We are going to be facing a small percentage of the nuclear weapons \nthat used to confront us because, the Russians have told us over and \nover again, \n\n[[Page S 12595]]\nwe have adhered to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. That has allowed \nthem to agree to these very drastic reductions in the numbers of their \noffensive weapons. And so we are on the threshold of seeing continuing \nsignificant reduction in offensive weapons that we face, or that we \ncould theoretically face, no longer from an adversary but now from \nsomeone with whom we are having a growing and a deepening partnership.\n  It is not just the current law that we should develop technology for \na national missile defense--that is the law I read--it is also the \npolicy of this administration to develop that technology in a way that \nwe could deploy it in time to counter any ballistic missile threat that \nemerges to the United States. So we have a law that says develop and we \nhave a current policy that says develop. But both by current law and \ncurrent policy the decision whether to deploy is left for a future \ntime.\n  That is the approach which this substitute restores; develop, but \nleave the decision to deploy for a future time based on criteria which \nwill be considered at that time to help us make a decision which makes \nsense for the security of this Nation.\n  So the road to reductions is dependent in part on the existence of an \nABM Treaty. That treaty still continues to serve our national interest. \nThis substitute in a number of ways explicitly and otherwise recognizes \nthe importance of that treaty to this relationship and to the \ncontinuing reductions in the number of offensive weapons.\n  So I do hope that our colleagues will find favor with this substitute \nand will support this substitute. Again, I want to thank all the \ncolleagues who participated in the formulation of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I could ask for a minute.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield such time as the able Senator from Virginia \nshall require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the concluding remarks by our colleague \nfrom Michigan, I think, set the tone when he seeks to reassure the \nSenate that this legislation is in the best interest of our Nation and \nthat he is hopeful that we will gain the support of other Senators, \nbecause no single Senator fought harder for certain changes in this \namendment than did the Senator from Michigan. And I think we conclude \ndebate on a very positive note.\n  With that statement, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Georgia, but I continue to have strong reservations about \nthe remaining aspects of the Missile Defense Act. The amendment makes \nan unwise provision better, and I commend Senators Nunn, Levin, Warner, \nand Cohen for their effective work in achieving this compromise. It \nfails, however, to do what is necessary to serve the best interests of \nour national security.\n  The remaining shortcomings in the Missile Defense Act become clear \nwhen we consider the principal threats that the United States faces \nfrom nuclear missile attack, and the more effective way these threats \nare addressed by current administration policy, which is also \nlongstanding bipartisan policy under both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations.\n  One of the threats we face is clearly from nations which now lack \nballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction, but which may \ndevelop them in the near future. Proponents of building a national \nmissile defense argue that the prospect of such a threat is sufficient \ngrounds for deploying a defensive system as soon as possible.\n  The weakness in this argument, however, is revealed in the undisputed \ntestimony of Lt. Gen. James Clapper before the Armed Services Committee \nlast January. General Clapper at that time was the head of the Defense \nIntelligence Agency. He stated that:\n\n       We see no interest in or capability of any new country \n     reaching the continental United States with a long range \n     missile for at least the next decade.\n\n  The missile threat from a new nuclear power is neither real nor \nimminent, and it will not materialize for at least ten years. The \nDefense Department's missile defense plan calls for a research and \ndevelopment program that will enable us to build and deploy a national \ndefense rapidly if unforeseen threats materialize. The Clinton defense \nplan will keep us safe from ballistic missile threats from new nuclear \npowers.\n  A more serious threat comes from existing nuclear arsenals of \npotential adversaries. There is a very low likelihood in the current \nworld situation that we will be subject to nuclear attack from Russia \nor China. But such a possibility is the most serious potential threat \nto the security of the United States, and therefore merits careful \nconsideration.\n  Russia, and to a lesser extent China, possess nuclear arsenals that \nthreaten the security of the United States. This fact is nothing new. \nThe arsenal controlled by Moscow has posed this threat to our Nation \nfor roughly 40 years. Yet, we were able to ensure the security of the \nUnited States over this period, in spite of the tensions and \nconflicting interests of the cold war. We did so by maintaining a \nnuclear arsenal that could deter the use of nuclear weapons against us \nby any adversary. Mutual deterrence guaranteed our security from \nnuclear attack throughout the nuclear age, and it is still our best \nguarantee.\n  Now, in the post-cold-war era, the stability and effectiveness of \nthis deterrent relationship is even greater than it was during the cold \nwar, and it is just as important. Russia is no longer our adversary, \nand therefore the likelihood of conflict between us has greatly \ndiminished. We have signed the START I and START II Treaties which, if \nimplemented, will create stable deterrence at reduced levels of nuclear \nweapons.\n  In his famous phrase, President Reagan called on us to trust but \nverify. Now, the increased trust between our nations has magnified our \nability to verify. The START Treaties provide for verification with \nextensive and effective monitoring that was not possible during the \ncold war. As the political and military leaders of Russia confirm, the \ndeterrent relationship that has long existed remains the centerpiece of \nnuclear safety for our two nations. And we can achieve even greater \nsafeguards in the future by maintaining that cooperative relationship. \nIt makes no sense to take unilateral actions that would jeopardize that \nrelationship, as the missile defense advocates would do.\n  Mutual deterrence is the foundation of the United States-Russian \nstrategic relationship, and the ABM Treaty is the basis for mutual \ndeterrence. For over two decades, the ABM Treaty has insured that the \nsuperpowers' nuclear arsenals continue to be effective as deterrents, \nwhich is the necessary condition for strategic stability. The Russians \nthemselves have reaffirmed the importance of this longstanding treaty \nto cooperation in arms reduction.\n  The proponents of the Missile Defense Act place too little value on \nthe improved strategic relationship between the United States and \nRussia, and the essential role of the ABM Treaty as the heart of that \nrelationship. Deploying a multisite missile defense would violate the \nABM Treaty as it currently stands.\n  The Russians have clearly stated that they will not ratify START II \nif the United States violates or withdraws from the ABM Treaty. In my \nview, the United States is safer facing a Russian arsenal of 3,000 \nweapons under START II, than if we possess several hundred ABM \ninterceptors while facing the present Russian arsenal of 10,000 \nweapons.\n  Deploying a national missile defense system will also impair the \ncooperative threat reduction programs, under which Russia is accepting \nUnited States funds to help dismantle their nuclear weapons.\n  In addition, withdrawing from the ABM Treaty may also cause the \nRussians to put their nuclear arsenal on a higher state of alert, \nincreasing the risk of accidental launch against the United States.\n  The course set by this bill may also lead the Russians to reverse the \nnegotiated step, achieved in 1994, whereby we agreed not to target each \nother's territory with the missiles deployed in silos and on \nsubmarines. If the Russians retarget their missiles, the threat \n\n[[Page S 12596]]\nof catastrophic damage to the United States from accidental or \nunauthorized attack will clearly rise.\n  The proponents of the Missile Defense Act ignore all of these \nconsiderations. They are proposing a more dangerous course for our \nnational security which Congress should not follow.\n  The Nunn/Levin/Warner/Cohen amendment will improve the bill compared \nto its present terms, and I urge adoption of the amendment. But I also \nurge my colleagues to support the administration's more sensible course \non the development of missile defenses. President Clinton's policy is \ndesigned to explore the new avenues of nuclear safety opened to us by \nthe end of the cold war, without sacrificing the solid foundation of \nour security--the mutual deterrence established and supported by \nDemocratic and Republican administrations alike over the past four \ndecades.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I do not know if anyone is going to want to \nspeak any more on this one on either side. I do not have any more \nrequests on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. President, does the Senator from Michigan know of anyone else who \nwould like to speak on this?\n  Mr. LEVIN. No.\n  Mr. NUNN. As I understand the time agreement, we will have the vote \non this at 9:30 tomorrow morning.\n  Does the Senator from South Carolina know when we will be coming in \non the bill? Should we reserve any time in case anyone wants to speak \nin the morning?\n  Mr. THURMOND. We will be coming in at 9:25 in the morning, and we \nwill get on the bill by 9:30.\n  Mr. NUNN. Then we will vote at 9:30.\n  Mr. THURMOND. We are supposed to vote at 9:30.\n  I am prepared to yield back my time, Mr. President.\n  Mr. NUNN. I think, just in case there is a minute or two someone \nwants to speak in the morning, we ought to probably reserve 2 minutes \non each side and give back the remainder of the time. That would give \nus a chance if somebody else wants a minute to be heard.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we are agreeable to that.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I would yield back all of my time except 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. The same here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the time is yielded back \nwith the exception of 2 minutes on each side.\n  Mr. NUNN. I know the Senator from South Carolina would like us to \nhandle several amendments that have been agreed to before we conclude \nthe debate on this Missile Defense Act of 1995 substitute. And, again, \nI want to thank my friend from Michigan, who did a superb job, and my \nfriend from Virginia and my friend from Maine, who did, I think, a very \ngood job in terms of negotiating what is a consensus, I think a \npositive step forward, as the Senator from Virginia said, for our \nNation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join my colleague with respect to all \nthe efforts that were made. Indeed, it was a monumental task. I think \nthe result will be accepted strongly by the Senate tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I wonder, if I can have the attention of the \ndistinguished chairman and the ranking member of the committee, if I \ncould bring up another point. That is, Mr. Chairman, I think it is \nimperative that the Senate receive a briefing from the administration \non the situation as it exists in Bosnia today.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we have already made the request.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished chairman, because I have \nwritten a memorandum to the chairman. It would not be on his desk until \ntomorrow morning.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we have 5 \nminutes each in the morning. I have a closing statement I would like to \nmake in the morning just before we vote on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time will be yielded \nback with the exception of 5 minutes on each side.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I ask unanimous consent that--I understand I probably \nwould make that after the bill passes, and so just as to say 2 minutes \nto each side before that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, could I inquire of the Chair as to the time \nagreement now?\n  I understand that we have the Missile Defense Act to be voted on at \n9:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. NUNN. Could the Chair inform the Senate of what takes place after \nthat amendment has been voted on and disposed of? It is my \nunderstanding we have several other possible amendments, including an \namendment by the Senator from South Carolina that is relevant and an \namendment by the Senator from Georgia, myself, that is relevant, as \nwell as a Levin amendment which may or may not be required to be voted \non. We will have time for remarks before final passage of the bill. I \nbelieve that is what the Senator from South Carolina has made reference \nto.\n  I do not believe the Senator is going to need more time for speaking \non this amendment which we vote on at 9:30. I think we will have other \ntime on the bill before that is concluded.\n  Mr. THURMOND. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator would yield for a comment. We believe we \nworked out the Levin amendment which you referred to, and that it will \nnot require a rollcall vote. We have not agreed yet on the final \nlanguage, but we have agreed on the principle of an amendment. So we do \nnot expect a rollcall will be necessary on the Levin amendment.\n  Mr. NUNN. We will have other amendments that have to be accepted \ntomorrow morning. We have not worked them out. We will not be able to \nconclude all of those. We are going to have to have some time--I hope \nit will not be a lot of time--after the passage of this Missile Defense \nAct, assuming it passes, before we vote on final passage.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we have no objection to that.\n  I hope we can wrap everything up tonight as much as possible and have \nas few things to do tomorrow before we vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I believe we are prepared to have some of the amendments \nthat have been agreed to now propounded to the Senate.\n\n\n  THE BROWN AMENDMENT CONCERNING THE REUSE OF FITZSIMONS ARMY MEDICAL \n                                 CENTER\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I agreed to accept the amendment of the \nSenator from Colorado which states congressional support for the timely \nreuse of military installations approved for closure or realignment. \nThe Senator from Colorado is particularly interested in expediting the \nreuse of Fitzsimons Army Medical Center in Colorado. While I understand \nthe Senator's support for the reuse of Fitzsimons, I believe expedited \nreuse should hold true for all military installations impacted by base \nrealignment and closure.\n  Over the last few years, Congress has enacted legislation to improve \nbase disposal procedures by expediting the overall process and giving \ngreater power to Local Redevelopment Authorities [LRAs] in making \ndisposal and reuse decisions.\n  Current law prescribes time-lines for screening and disposal of \nformer military installations. From the time an installation is \napproved for closure or realignment, the following must occur:\n  0-6 months--Military department identifies DOD and Federal property \nneeds, makes excess and surplus determinations, and commences \nenvironmental impact analysis process.\n  6-18 months--LRA solicits and considers notices of interests, \nconducts outreach, considers homeless assistance needs, and consults \nwith military departments regarding surplus property uses.\n  18-33 months--LRA prepares redevelopment plan and homeless submission \nand submits to DOD and HUD; military department reports property to \nFederal sponsoring agencies for public benefit conveyances, completes \nenvironmental impact analysis, and makes disposal decisions.\n  33+ months--Military department conveys property and LRA implements \nredevelopment plan.\n  It should be noted that turning property over to LRAs could occur \nmuch \n\n[[Page S 12597]]\nsooner than 33 months--in fact, transfer could occur as soon as 20 \nmonths if reuse plans are developed and approved early in disposal \nprocess. LRAs that act expeditiously in developing and adopting reuse \nplans should be commended as this is not an easy task. Accordingly, the \nmilitary services should do all in their power within the letter of the \nlaw to convey appropriate property to LRAs that have fulfilled all \nnecessary requirements and are ready and able to accept these \nproperties for reuse.\n  Mr. President, my point is that expedited reuse is the goal for all \ninstallations impacted by base closure and realignment decisions.\n\n\n                           HYDRONUCLEAR TESTS\n\n   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the Exon amendment to clarify \nthe meaning of this bill regarding nuclear weapons testing. This \namendment will bring the bill into closer agreement with President \nClinton's policy seeking prompt achievement of a Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty.\n   On August 11, President Clinton took a pathbreaking step by \nannouncing his intention to seek a true comprehensive test ban. The new \nU.S. policy is to ban all nuclear tests of any size, including the \nhydronuclear tests addressed in this bill.\n   President Clinton's action supports our Nation's commitment, made in \nMay at the conference on the permanent extension of the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, that the United States will seek prompt \nnegotiation of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Many of the 178 nations \nwho are parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty conditioned \ntheir support for the treaty's permanent extension on the prompt \nachievement of a comprehensive test ban. The test ban is an essential \npart of the international nuclear non-proliferation regime, which is \none of the highest security priorities of the United States.\n   A ban on nuclear tests will serve our non-proliferation goals, \nwithout jeopardizing the maintenance of a safe and reliable nuclear \nstockpile. The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy, and the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff all support the President's new \npolicy. They agree that it provides for effective maintenance of our \nnuclear arsenal.\n   The Exon amendment would ensure that this bill takes no action to \nviolate the President's policy, or the testing moratorium enacted into \nlaw in 1992. It will clear the way for us to sign a comprehensive test \nban, and begin a new era of nuclear security and non-proliferation for \nthe entire world. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I inquire of the Senator from Georgia \n[Senator Nunn], if I may ask him a question about a provision of the \nfiscal year 1995 Department of Defense Authorization Act.\n  Mr. NUNN. I would be pleased to answer the questions of the Senator \nfrom California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Section 816 of the fiscal year 1995 Defense Authorization \nAct authorized a demonstration project in Monterey County, CA, which \nwould permit the Department of Defense to purchase fire-fighting, \npolice, public works, utility, and other municipal services from \nGovernment agencies located in Monterey when such services are needed \nfor operating Department of Defense assets in the county.\n  Mr. NUNN. I am familiar with this section. It allowed such municipal \nservices to be purchased notwithstanding section 2465 of title 10, \nUnited States Code.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would ask the Senator, was it the committee's intent to \nrequire an OMB Circular A-76 study before the demonstration program \ncould begin?\n  Mr. NUNN. The purpose of the provision was to expedite the \ndemonstration project, and it is therefore my view that to proceed \nwithout conducting an A-76 study would be consistent with section 816 \nof the fiscal year 1995 Defense Authorization Act.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2452\n\n (Purpose: Relating to testing of theater missile defense interceptors)\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Pryor, I offer an \namendment which will establish testing requirements for theater missile \ndefense interceptor missiles. This amendment is supported by both the \nBallistic Missile Defense Organization and Director of Operational Test \nand Evaluation in the Pentagon.\n  I believe this amendment has been cleared on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn], for Mr. Pryor, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2452.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 49, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 224. TESTING OF THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE INTERCEPTORS.\n\n       (a) The Secretary of Defense may not approve a theater \n     missile defense interceptor program proceeding beyond the \n     low-rate initial production acquisition stage until the \n     Secretary certifies to the congressional defense committees \n     that such program has successfully completed initial \n     operational test and evaluation, and is found to be a \n     suitable and effective system.\n       (b) In order to be certified under subsection (a) as having \n     been successfully completed, the initial operational test and \n     evaluation conducted with respect to an interceptor program \n     must have included flight tests--\n       (1) that were conducted with multiple interceptors and \n     multiple targets in the presence of realistic \n     countermeasures; and\n       (2) the results of which demonstrate the achievement by the \n     interceptors of the baseline performance thresholds.\n       (c) For purposes of this section, the baseline performance \n     thresholds with respect to a program are the weapons systems \n     performance thresholds specified in the baseline description \n     for the system established (pursuant to section 2435(a)(1) of \n     title 10, United States Code) before the program entered the \n     engineering and manufacturing development stage.\n       (d) The number of flight tests described in subsection (b) \n     that are required in order to make the certification under \n     subsection (a) shall be a number determined by the Director \n     of Operational Test and Evaluation to be sufficient for the \n     purposes of this section.\n       (e) The Secretary may augment flight testing to demonstrate \n     weapons system performance goals for purposes of the \n     certification under subsection (a) through the use of \n     modeling and simulation that is validated by ground and \n     flight testing.\n       (f) The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation and \n     Ballistic Missile Defense Organization shall include in their \n     annual reports to Congress plans to adequately test theater \n     missile defense interceptor programs throughout the \n     acquisition process. As these theater missile defense systems \n     progress through the acquisition process, the Director of \n     Operational Test and Evaluation and Ballistic Missile Defense \n     Organization shall include in their annual reports to \n     Congress an assessment of how these programs satisfy planned \n     test objectives.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment on behalf of \nSenator Nunn, Senator Bingaman, and myself to restore some common sense \nto the Missile Defense Act of 1995.\n  As my colleagues know, the Missile Defense Act of 1995 contains an \naggressive program to develop and deploy theater missile defenses in \nthe form of sophisticated missile interceptors.\n  I say to my colleagues--if we want to protect ourselves from the \nthreat of theater missile attacks, let's make sure the interceptors are \ncapable of destroying incoming missiles!\n  I was disappointed that this bill deleted a provision passed by \nCongress 2 years ago that would help us monitor these programs through \na series of live-fire tests.\n  I believe it would be dangerous for the Senate to show a lack of \ninterest in monitoring the progress of our theater missile defense \ninterceptors. Our primary concern should be in making sure they are \nmaturing properly.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the Director of the Ballistic \nMissile Defense Organization [BMDO] and the Pentagon's Director of \nOperational Testing agreed to work together in an effort to help us \nproperly emphasize the importance of testing our TMD interceptor \nprograms.\n\n[[Page S 12598]]\n\n  I applaud the Director of the BMDO, Gen. Malcolm O'Neill, and the \nDirector of Operational Testing, Phil Coyle, for working cooperatively \nin this effort.\n  Mr. President, this is a responsible amendment that asks the Pentagon \nto periodically assess the maturity of each interceptor program, and to \nadvise Congress on the progress we're making. It also asks the \nSecretary of Defense to certify to Congress that these programs work \nproperly before they enter into full-rate production. Finally, this \namendment will help prevent the wasteful practice of building weapon \nsystems that do not work as expected.\n  This concept, Mr. President, is commonly referred to as fly before \nyou buy. Fly before you buy means that new weapons must demonstrate \ntheir progress and maturity in operational testing so that we do not \nwaste money buying systems that do not work.\n  I am proud to say, Mr. President, that with this amendment, the \nweapon developers in the BMDO office and the Pentagon's testers have \nworked together to reach an agreement on the proposed language.\n  This is a remarkable accomplishment that the entire U.S. Senate \nshould applaud.\n  This is exactly the type of productive cooperation that Senator \nGrassley, Senator Roth and I envisioned when we wrote the legislation \ncreating the independent testing office back in 1983. Developers and \ntesters working together for a common goal. Unfortunately, for many \nyears, the developers have refused to allow operational testers to \nmonitor their progress. Too often in the Pentagon, the word ``test'' is \nconsidered a four-letter word.\n  This is exactly the scenario we should avoid with our interceptor \nprograms.\n  We have already spent over $5 billion on theater missile defense \ninterceptors. In this bill, an additional $2 billion is authorized for \nthese programs. And the total costs are projected to exceed $22 \nbillion!\n  As we continue spending more and more on ballistic missile defenses, \nlet us not forget the most basic and most important element of these \nprograms--making sure they work.\n  I wish to once again thank Gen. Malcolm O'Neill for his cooperation. \nAlso, special thanks to Mr. Phil Coyle for his outstanding leadership \nas the Pentagon's testing czar. Thanks also to Larry Miller of Mr. \nCoyle's staff for his tremendous efforts in helping to prepare this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I thank the managers of this bill for accepting this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the amendment is acceptable. The Senator \nis correct, we support the amendment and urge its adoption.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2452) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2453\n\n            (Purpose: To make certain technical corrections)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment on behalf \nof the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Thurmond. It is a \ntechnical amendment which makes certain corrections to S. 1026.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment. We \nsupport it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for Mr. Thurmond, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2453.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Byrd, the Senator from \nWest Virginia, I offer an amendment which would authorize the Navy to \nuse operation and maintenance funds up to a total of $2 million to \naddress essential safety concerns at a Government-owned, contractor-\noperated weapons facility.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt this amendment. I believe the other side \nhas cleared this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct. This is an amendment originally \nconsidered in the course of the markup of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. I was awaiting further information. That information, to my \nunderstanding, has been received and, therefore, the amendment is \nworthy of consideration and support by the Senate.\n  Mr. NUNN. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn], for Mr. Byrd, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 2454.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 137, after line 24, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 389. ALLEGANY BALLISTICS LABORATORY.\n\n       Of the amount authorized to be appropriated under section \n     301(2), $2,000,000 shall be available for the Allegany \n     Ballistics Laboratory for essential safety functions.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the amendment that I offer addresses \nimmediate safety concerns associated with the Allegany Ballistics \nLaboratory. The Allegany Ballistics Laboratory is the leading producer \nof tactical missile propulsion systems and conventional warheads for \nthe Department of Defense, \n\n[[Page S 12599]]\ncurrently producing rocket motors, sensor fuzed weapons, a variety of \nstate-of-the-art missiles, warheads for the Maverick and more. \nAdditionally, the Allegany Ballistics Lab is developing motors and \nwarheads for the next generation of smart precision guided weapons.\n  Of great concern to me are the many significant safety violations, \ndue to the age of the facility. Originally acquired by the Army in \n1941, the Navy was given custody of the site in 1945. In fiscal year \n1994, the Naval Sea Systems Command [NAVSEA] requested restoration of \nthe 50-year-old plant over a 5-year period. Now, in what would be its \nthird year of restoration, the plant lacks programmed funding for the \nongoing restoration plan. This year's programmed restoration costs \nwould be $38.5 million, of which the Senate Appropriations Committee \nhas provided $30 million. Due to an unfortunate oversight during the \nArmed Services Committee preparation of this bill, the authorization \nbill does not include language supporting the safety upgrades at this \nfacility.\n  Because of the potentially hazardous circumstances that might develop \ndue to neglected safety precautions at this antiquated weapons-\nproducing facility, my amendment would ensure the authorization for a \nminimal $2 million to provide for the essential safety measures \nrequired for the continuing operations of this plant.\n  The laboratory provides and services munitions for all the military \nservices. Its programs include Naval propulsion technologies, \nSidewinder, and Sea Sparrow missiles; for the Army, solid propulsion \ntechnologies, special munitions technologies, jointly produced rocket \nengines; rocket and laser systems for the Air Force; and a variety of \nmotor and generator technologies for ballistic, cruise, and tactical \nmissiles.\n  A facility of this magnitude and importance to national security \nrequires, at a minimum, the funding for essential safety measures to \navert a potential disaster. If these needs are not met, we risk not \nonly plant security and safety, but we risk the loss of our Defense \nDepartment's ability to provide adequate munitions to our fighting \nforces.\n  Mr. President, safe operations of the plant and safe function of the \nweapons and defense conversion products depend on competent structural \nand hazards testing capability. Facilities currently being used are \nover 40 years old. Needed are safe, efficient control rooms for \nInsensitive Munitions, hazards and warhead testing to replace the \nobsolete facilities.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment, that will help \nkeep a portion of our defense industry free from the occurrence or risk \nof injury or loss.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2454) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2455\n\n (Purpose: To revise for fiscal and technical purposes the provisions \n       relating to military construction projects authorizations)\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, on August 2, the Senate adopted an \namendment authorizing $228.0 million for military constructions \nprojects that were appropriated in the military construction \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 1996. The amendment I am offering \ntoday identifies offsets that will be used to pay for these additional \nprojects. Specific amounts are as follows:\n  $30.0 million from a reduction to the foreign currency fluctuation \naccount previously made by the Senate.\n  $98.7 million from construction projects that are no longer required \ndue to the recommended closures by the Base Closure and Realignment \nCommission. These reductions were taken from a list compiled by the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  $49.0 million from prior year funds for projects that resulted in \ncontract savings or were previously approved and now are no longer \nneeded. This action mirrors the action taken by the Senate MILCON \nAppropriations Subcommittee.\n  $53.0 million from the $161.0 million request for the Pentagon \nrenovation. The fiscal year 1996 request included $53.0 million for \nconstruction of wedge 1 of the project, which has been delayed for 1 \nyear pending a comprehensive review of the $1.2 billion renovation \nproject.\n  Mr. President, the reductions to the various programs will not impair \nthe progress of these programs. On the other hand, the additional \nmilitary construction projects funded by these offsets will enhance the \nreadiness of our Armed Forces and provide for the \n\n[[Page S 12600]]\nwelfare of the men and women who serve in the uniform of this Nation. \nMr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this amendment provides offsets for the \nmilitary construction projects authorized by the Senate earlier in its \ndeliberations on this bill.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment, and \nthis side has cleared the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2455) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2456\n\n(Purpose: To authorize a land conveyance, Naval Communications Station, \n                         Stockton, California)\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Feinstein, the Senator \nfrom California, I offer an amendment which authorizes the Secretary of \nthe Navy, upon concurrence of both the General Services Administration \nand HUD, to convey 1,450 acres of property at the Naval Communications \nStation, Stockton, CA, to the Port of Stockton.\n  This amendment also allows for all existing leases involving Federal \nagencies located on the site to remain under existing terms and \nconditions.\n  Mr. President, I believe this amendment has been cleared by the other \nside.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 487, below line 24, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 2838. LAND CONVEYANCE, NAVAL COMMUNICATIONS STATION, \n                   STOCKTON, CALIFORNIA.\n\n       (a) Authority To Convey.--The Secretary of the Navy may, \n     upon the concurrence of the Administrator of General Services \n     and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, convey to \n     the Port of Stockton (in this section referred to as the \n     ``Port''), all right, title, and interest of the United \n     States in and to a parcel of real property, including any \n     improvements thereon, consisting of approximately 1,450 acres \n     at the Naval Communication Station, Stockton, California.\n       (b) Interim Lease.--Until such time as the real property \n     described in subsection (a) is conveyed by deed, the \n     Secretary may lease the property, along with improvements \n     thereon, to the Port under terms and conditions satisfactory \n     to the Secretary.\n       (c) Consideration.--The conveyance may be as a public \n     benefit conveyance for port development as defined in Section \n     203 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act \n     of 1949, (40 U.S.C. 484), as amended, provided the Port \n     satisfies the criteria in section 203 and such regulations as \n     the Administrator of General Services may prescribe to \n     implement that section. Should the Port fail to qualify for a \n     public benefit conveyance and still desire to acquire the \n     property, then the Port shall, as consideration for the \n     conveyance, pay to the United States an amount equal to the \n     fair market value of the property to be conveyed, as \n     determined by the Secretary.\n       (d) Federal Lease of Conveyed Property.--Notwithstanding \n     any other provision of law, as a condition for transfer of \n     this property under subparagraph (a), the Secretary may \n     require that the Port agree to lease all or a part of the \n     property currently under federal use at the time of \n     conveyance to the United States for use by the Department of \n     Defense or any other federal agency under the same terms and \n     conditions now presently in force. Such terms and conditions \n     will continue to include payment (to the Port) for \n     maintenance of facilities leased to the Federal Government. \n     Such maintenance of the Federal premises shall be to the \n     reasonable satisfaction of the United States, or as required \n     by all applicable Federal, State and local laws and \n     ordinances.\n       (e) Description of Property.--The exact acreage and legal \n     description of the property to be conveyed under subsection \n     (a) shall be determined by a survey satisfactory to the \n     Secretary. The cost of such survey shall be borne by Port.\n       (f) Additional Terms.--The Secretary may require such \n     additional terms and conditions in connection with the \n     conveyance under subsection (a) or the lease under subsection \n     (b) as the Secretary considers appropriate to protect the \n     interests of the United States.\n       (g) Environmental Quality of Property.--Any contract for \n     sale, deed, or other transfer of real property under this \n     section shall be carried out in compliance with section \n     120(h) of the CERCLA (42USC9620(h)) and other environmental \n     laws.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment that \nconveys the right, title and interest of the Naval Communications \nStation at Rough and Ready Island in Stockton, California, from the \nNavy to the Port of Stockton.\n  This conveyance is a win-win for California and the Navy. The \ntransfer of this property will result in the creation of thousands of \njobs in my state and further solidify the Stockton Ship Deepwater \nChannel as one of the premier international shipping hubs in \nCalifornia. In addition, the Navy will be able to reduce infrastructure \nthat it no longer needs nor is able to maintain. But the Navy and the \nPort of Stockton support this amendment.\n  The Port of Stockton's Rough and Ready Island is located 75 nautical \nmiles east of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. The island \nconsists of approximately 1,450 acres, of which roughly half is \ndedicated to general purpose warehousing.\n  Since 1944, Rough and Ready Island has been home to the Navy and \nplayed a prominent role in our nation's defense during war and peace \nalike. Currently Rough and Ready is the site of a U.S. Naval \nCommunication Station (NAVCOMSTA). While the NAVCOMSTA will continue to \nmaintain its presence on the island indefinitely, the Navy has made it \nclear that continued ownership of such a facility, with its \nconsiderable infrastructure, is not consistent with ongoing military \nrealignment objectives.\n  In addition to the NAVCOMSTA, the Department of Defense houses its \nregional distribution center on the island. Other Federal agencies that \nlease space include the General Services Administration, the U.S. \nPostal Service, and the U.S. Border Patrol.\n  However, while part of Rough and Ready Island houses a number of \nFederal tenants, a significant percentage of the island has fallen in \ndisrepair. If it is to be used to its fullest capacity, a number of \nimprovements such as ameliorating and expanding the docks, deepening \nthe waterways, and upgrading the railroad tracks are essential. The \nonly private entity able and willing to adequately execute such an \nenormous effort is the Port of Stockton.\n  The Port of Stockton, which operates a 600 acre complex contiguous to \nRough and Ready Island, is ready to assume the host position and make \nthe necessary improvements. The Stockton Port District, which was \nformed in 1927, functions as a nonprofit municipal corporation and is \nempowered by the California Harbors and Navigation Code to acquire real \nproperty by grant or gift in order to promote Maritime and Commercial \nInterests.\n  The Port of Stockton is the local sponsor for the Stockton Ship \nChannel which is one of the busiest interior industrial water ways in \nthe United States. Because it is the only deep-water cargo Port that \nhandles bulk, between 3.5 million and 4 million tons of cargo travel \nthrough the Channel every year.\n  The Port of Stockton will receive the property through a public \nbenefit conveyance. Further, the Port of Stockton has repeatedly \noffered to honor any long-term leases that are currently operative on \nRough and Ready Island with the Navy, Federal agencies, and other \ntenants.\n  In addition to the benefits to the Navy, this land conveyance could \nalso create thousands of new jobs in an area that has traditionally \nsuffered from double digit unemployment.\n  Currently, Cost Plus, a major retailer, occupies 400,000 square foot \nof warehouse space of the Port of Stockton. Although the Port has \nreceived inquiries from other large businesses eager to establish \ndistribution centers of similar size, it is unable to accommodate these \nrequests because it simply does not have the space. The consolidation \nof Rough and Ready Island with the Port of Stockton will provide more \nopportunity to fulfill these requests for more space and in turn \nprovide more jobs for the residents of the area.\n  The Port of Stockton estimates that in the long term, the potential \nfor \n\n[[Page S 12601]]\nlarge and small businesses utilizing the expanded warehousing, a \nproposed 92,000 square foot boat storage complex and new dock \nfacilities will result in as many as 2,000 new jobs in the area.\n  Mr. President, allowing the transfer of Rough and Ready Island is a \ngood deal for California and good deal for the Navy. Not only does this \ntransfer give the Navy an opportunity to relinquish itself of land that \nis in considerable need of improvement, but it will create economic \nopportunities for many Californians.\n  I thank my colleagues for supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. NUNN. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2456) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2457\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from Iowa, Senator \nHarkin, and the Senator from California, Senator Boxer, I send an \namendment to the desk that provides that cost-type contract DOD \nreimbursement of contract executive compensation would be capped at \n$200,000. This is similar to the amendment the Senate adopted on the \nDOD appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn], for Mr. Harkin, for \n     himself and Mrs. Boxer, proposes an amendment numbered 2457.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     ``SEC.   . RESTRICTION ON REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS.\n\n       ``(a) None of the funds authorized to be appropriated in \n     this Act for fiscal year 1996 may be obligated for payment on \n     new contracts on which allowable costs charged to the \n     government include payments for individual compensation \n     (including bonuses and other incentives) at a rate in excess \n     of $250,000.\n       ``(b) It is the Sense of the Senate that the Congress \n     should consider extending the restriction described in \n     section (a) permanently.''\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on this amendment, this is the first \nopportunity this Senator has had to review it. The chairman of the \ncommittee has instructed me to accept the amendment.\n  I must say, it causes me some initial concern, but as I understand \nit, it is part of the DOD appropriations bill at the present time. \nSpeaking only for myself, I will reexamine this amendment in the course \nof the conference deliberation on the bill.\n  So for the present time, I indicate that it is acceptable on this \nside for the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. NUNN. On behalf of Senators Harkin and Boxer, I urge its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2457) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2458\n\n (Purpose: To improve the management of environmental restoration and \n         waste management activities authorized under this Act)\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nMr. Johnston and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn], for Mr. Johnston, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2458.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 535, at the end of subtitle A, add the following \n     new sections:\n\n     ``SEC.   .

Mr. President, the amendment that I have offered \naddresses two crucial management issues for the defense-related \nenvironmental restoration and waste management programs authorized in \nthis bill. The first issue is the continued existence of obsolete \nconflict-of-interest and financial reporting requirements at the \nDepartment of Energy that conflict with governmentwide standards. These \nrequirements result in unnecessary duplication of effort and have \ndeterred outstanding individuals from accepting managerial positions \nwithin the Department. The second issue is the impending imposition of \ncriminal liability for Federal managers of environmental cleanup \nactivities in the case of a funding shortfall that prevents full \ncompliance with the law. Action on these management issues is \nessential, if defense environmental restoration and waste management \nprograms are to succeed.\n  My amendment will remove the first of these two obstacles and express \nthe sense of the Congress on the the second.\n  The first part of my amendment repeals three sections of the \nDepartment of Energy Organization Act, Public Law 95-91, that were \nenacted in 1977 and that deal with conflict-of-interest requirement for \ndepartmental employees. It also repeals two other free-standing \nfinancial reporting requirements enacted as parts of other legislation \nin 1977. All of these requirements were enacted prior to passage of \ngovernmentwide ethics requirements in the Ethics in Government Act of \n1978, and in some sense served as a prototype for these requirements. \nSince the passage of the Ethics in Government Act and the Ethics Reform \nAct of 1989, though, the need for specific ethics and financial \nreporting requirements in DOE that are different from governmentwide \nrequirements has disappeared.\n  Adoption of this provision would not affect the applicability of \ngovernmentwide conflict-of-interest and financial reporting \nrequirements to DOE employees. These restrictions, codified in 18 \nU.S.C. 207 and 208, 41 U.S.C. 423, and 5 CFR 2634 are not affected by \nthe amendment and would remain fully in force for DOE employees.\n  The Senate has, on four different occasions during the last two \nCongresses, approved language to repeal these requirements--in the \nEnergy Policy and \n\n[[Page S 12602]]\nConservation Act Amendments of 1994, S. 2251, the Department of Energy \nLaboratory Partnership Act of 1994, S. 473, the fiscal year 1994 \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill S. 1298, and the fiscal year \n1992-93 Department of Defense authorization bill. In addition, Congress \nhas twice enacted into law temporary suspensions affecting the sections \nof the Department of Energy Organization Act that would be repealed by \nthis amendment.\n  The Department of Energy and the administration strongly support this \npart of my amendment. Repeal of these provisions has also been \nrecommended by the National Academy of Sciences in its 1992 report on \n``Science and Technology Leadership in American Government: Ensuring \nthe Best Presidential Appointments.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the administration \ntransmitting the text of this part of the amendment and supporting the \nrepeal of these provisions be printed in the Record following my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, the second part of my amendment provides \nthe sense of the Congress on an issue that, if unresolved, will greatly \nincrease the difficulty of attracting and retaining the best managers \npossible for cleanup activities. Under the Federal Facility Compliance \nAct of 1992, beginning on this October 6, Federal managers in the DOD \nand DOE cleanup programs will incur criminal liability for instances of \nnoncompliance resulting from funding shortfalls. They literally can be \nsent to jail under State or Federal law if the appropriations acts do \nnot contain enough funding to satisfy every last requirement of every \nState and local solid or hazardous waste law. No manager, scientist, or \nengineer worth having in a cleanup program can be expected to be \nattracted to a job in which they are exposed to this sort of criminal \nsanction.\n  This potential criminal liability problem may become very real very \nsoon, depending on the outcome of the conference on the Energy and \nWater Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1996. The Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, of which I \nam the ranking member, reported a bill that was passed by the Senate \nand that fully funded the President's budget request for the Department \nof Energy environmental management program for fiscal year 1996. We \nwill strongly support the Senate position in conference against a House \nmark for this program that is far smaller. I hope that we prevail. In \nany case, it is clear that the problem of appropriating funds to meet \nthe expanding requirements of the DOE environmental management program \nwill become increasingly acute over the next several years. I strongly \nbelieve that we should start thinking about this problem now, in a \ndeliberative manner, rather than wait for a crisis.\n  My amendment provides the sense of Congress that--\n\n       (1) individuals acting within the scope of their employment \n     shall not be personally subject to civil or criminal sanction \n     for any failure to comply with environmental cleanup \n     requirements under the Solid Waste Disposal Act or the \n     Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and \n     Liability Act, or an analogous requirement under comparable \n     Federal, State, or local laws, where the noncompliance is due \n     to lack of funds; and\n       (2) if appropriations are insufficient to fund \n     environmental cleanup requirements, the Congress shall \n     consider appropriate statutory amendments to address \n     potential liability issues for Federal agencies and \n     contractors, after an examination by the appropriate \n     Committees, and after affected Federal agencies, States, and \n     the public have had an opportunity to express their views.\n\n  This amendment has been cleared on both sides by the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works and the Committee on Governmental Affairs. \nI urge its adoption.\n\n                               Exhibit 1 \n\n\n                                       The Secretary of Energy\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 28, 1995.\n     The Hon. Newt Gingrich,\n     Speaker of the House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker. Enclosed is proposed legislation that \n     would place employees of the Department of Energy on the same \n     basis as most other government employees with respect to \n     restrictions on holding financial interests that have the \n     potential to conflict with official responsibilities, and \n     with respect to financial disclosure requirements.\n       The legislation would repeal the divestiture provision of \n     the Department of Energy Organization Act (DOE Act) and \n     related disclosure statutes that were enacted in the mid-\n     seventies. The criminal conflict of interest statutes, the \n     standardized financial disclosure rules under the Ethics in \n     Government Act, and the executive branch standards of conduct \n     which are now in place make these provisions no longer \n     necessary.\n       More specifically, the enclosed proposal would repeal the \n     divestiture provision in part A of title VI of the DOE Act \n     and also would repeal disclosure provisions in other laws \n     that were superseded but not repeated by part A when it was \n     enacted. The divestiture provision was the only conflict-of-\n     interest provision of the DOE Act not repealed by section \n     3161 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 1994 (Pub. L. No. 103-160). That Act repealed several \n     obsolete conflict-of-interest requirements concerning \n     financial disclosure, post-employment restrictions, and \n     participation restrictions, and was a significant step in \n     ensuring consistency in the application of conflict-of-\n     interest requirements throughout the executive branch.\n       In addition to repealing most of the Department's obsolete \n     conflict-of-interest provisions, section 3161 required the \n     enclosed report on the divestiture provision. The Department \n     submitted this report to Congress on April 8, 1994, after its \n     review by the Office of Government Ethics which has no \n     objection to repeal of the divestiture provision. The report \n     affirms our earlier conclusion that the divestiture \n     requirement is obsolete, overly broad, and unnecessary, and \n     our recommendation that it should be repealed.\n       The Department of Energy has been and continues to be \n     strongly committed to the highest ethnical standards. Every \n     employee of the Department is expected to follow not only the \n     letter of the conflict-of-interest laws and regulations, but \n     also their spirit. Elimination of the Department of Energy \n     divestiture provision that, more often than not, requires \n     divestiture when there is no actual conflict-of-interest, \n     would lessen employee perception that the conflict-of-\n     interest rules are arbitrary and unfair. Approval of this \n     proposal would be a significant step in ensuring consistency \n     in the application of conflict-of-interest requirements \n     throughout the executive branch, and we request its prompt \n     consideration.\n       If these provisions are eliminated, the conflict-of-\n     interest concerns underlying the divestiture provision will \n     continue to be addressed by a statute and regulations \n     applicable to all executive branch employees. These \n     regulations were promulgated by the Office of Government \n     Ethics (Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the \n     Executive Branch, 5 CFR Pan 2635) and provide a mechanism for \n     the Department to issue supplemental regulations that would \n     prohibit or restrict the acquisition or holding of a \n     financial interest or a class of financial interests by \n     agency employees, or any category of agency employees, based \n     on the agency's determination that the acquisition or holding \n     of such financial interests would cause a reasonable person \n     to question the impartiality and objectivity with which \n     agency programs are administered. If needed, regulations to \n     this effect will be pursued.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that from \n     the standpoint of the President's program there is no \n     objection to the submission of this proposal.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Hazel R. O'Leary.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as stated by Senator Johnston, the \nproposed amendment was cleared by both sides. I would like to briefly \ncomment on the amendment. First, I feel that the conflict of interest \nprovisions are consistent with past Senate efforts to eliminate agency-\nspecific requirements that are no longer necessary. Second, the Sense \nof the Senate related to environmental restoration addresses concerns \nrelated to civil and criminal liability of individual Federal employees \nacting within the scope of their employment. The sense of the Senate \nspecifically provides that Federal employees shall not be held \npersonally liable for a failure to fulfill an environmental cleanup \nrequirement that is the result of insufficient congressional \nappropriations. I support the amendment, as offered by Senator \nJohnston.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, this amendment would repeal conflict of \ninterest laws applicable only to DOE and not other agencies. It sets \nforth a sense of the Senate that executive branch officials should not \nbe held criminally liable for failure to implement an environmental \ncleanup requirement where the failure is attributable to insufficient \nfunding.\n  I believe this has been cleared by the majority.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2458) was agreed to.\n  \n[[Page S 12603]]\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2459\n\n   (Purpose: To authorize the conveyance of the William Langer Jewel \n Bearing Plant to the Job Development Authority of the City of Rolla, \n                             North Dakota)\n\n  Mr. NUNN.

LAND CONVEYANCE, WILLIAM LANGER JEWEL BEARING \n                   PLANT, ROLLA, NORTH DAKOTA.\n\n       (a) Authority To Convey.--The Administrator of General \n     Services may convey, without consideration, to the Job \n     Development Authority of the City of Rolla, North Dakota (in \n     this section referred to as the ``Authority''), all right, \n     title, and interest of the United States in and to a parcel \n     of real property, with improvements thereon and all \n     associated personal property, consisting of approximately \n     9.77 acres and comprising the William Langer Jewel Bearing \n     Plant in Rolla, North Dakota.\n       (b) Condition of Conveyance.--The conveyance authorized \n     under subsection (a) shall be subject to the condition that \n     the Authority--\n       (1) use the real and personal property and improvements \n     conveyed under that subsection for economic development \n     relating to the jewel bearing plant;\n       (2) enter into an agreement with an appropriate public or \n     private entity or person to lease such property and \n     improvements to that entity or person for such economic \n     development; or\n       (3) enter into an agreement with an appropriate public or \n     private entity or person to sell such property and \n     improvements to that entity or person for such economic \n     development.\n       (c) Preference for Domestic Disposal of Jewel Bearings.--\n     (1) In offering to enter into agreements pursuant to any \n     provision of law for the disposal of jewel bearings from the \n     National Defense Stockpile, the President shall give a right \n     of first refusal on all such offers to the Authority or to \n     the appropriate public or private entity or person with which \n     the Authority enters into an agreement under subsection (b).\n       (2) For the purposes of this section, the term ``National \n     Defense Stockpile'' means the stockpile provided for in \n     section 4 of the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock \n     Piling Act (50 U.S.C. 98(c)).\n       (d) Availability of Funds for Maintenance and Conveyance of \n     Plant.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, funds \n     available in fiscal year 1995 for the maintenance of the \n     William Langer Jewel Bearing Plant in Public Law 103-335 \n     shall be available for the maintenance of that plant in \n     fiscal year 1996, pending conveyance, and for the conveyance \n     of that plant under this section.\n       (e) Description of Property.--The exact acreage and legal \n     description of the property conveyed under this section shall \n     be determined by a survey satisfactory to the Administrator. \n     The cost of such survey shall be borne by the Administrator.\n       (f) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Administrator may \n     require such additional terms and conditions in connection \n     with the conveyance under this section as the Administrator \n     determines appropriate to protect the interests of the United \n     States.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to the \ndefense authorization bill. I would like to take a bit of time to \ndescribe my amendment.\n  My amendment would expedite the conveyance of the William Langer \nJewel Bearing Plant in Rolla, ND, to the Job Development Authority of \nthe city of Rolla. The amendment would enable the General Services \nAdministration to transfer the plant to the authority more quickly, and \nin a way that would enable the plant to continue as a going enterprise. \nMy senior colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, is cosponsoring \nthis amendment, and the Defense Department and the General Services \nAdministration have no objection to the amendment.\n  Let me just give my colleagues a bit of background on the Langer \nPlant. The Langer Plant has roots in the Cold War. Back in the 1950's, \nwhen we were in the depths of the cold war, the Congress and the \nadministration took a long look at our defense industrial base. Our \ndefense leadership realized that we at that point lacked the ability to \nproduce jewel bearings, which are finely machined bits of carborundum. \nThese bearings were crucial components in military avionics systems.\n  The Congress located the plant in North Dakota because of our \nstrategic location. The idea was to put this crucial facility in the \nmiddle of our country, where enemies could not easily reach it. It \nseems a startling consideration, but it is the way people were thinking \nat the time. So the William Langer Jewel Bearing Plant has been making \njewel bearings for the Federal Government since the 1950s.\n  My colleagues should also know that the plant is a few miles from the \nTurtle Mountain Indian Reservation. Of the plant's hundred or so \nemployees remaining after a downsizing, about 60 percent are Native \nAmerican. The Langer Plant brings crucial skilled jobs to an \neconomically depressed area.\n  Since the plant's founding, Bulova Corp. has run the plant for the \nPentagon on a Government-owned, contractor-operated basis. However, \nchanging technology has led the Defense Logistics Agency to declare the \nplant excess to the Defense Department's needs. The National Defense \nStockpile no longer needs to buy jewel bearings. So the Defense \nDepartment has reported the plant to the General Services \nAdministration as excess property.\n  Last year, the Senate Appropriations Committee's report on the \nDefense Appropriations Act for this fiscal year provided funding to \nensure that the plant succeed in its transition from a Government-owned \nmilitary supplier to a more commercially oriented firm that also \nremains a viable part of the defense industrial base. This amendment \nwill help complete the plant's transition to commercial operation.\n  Those of my colleagues who are dealing with base closures and defense \ndownsizing know that Rolla faces a crisis and an opportunity with \nregard to this plant. The future of this factory depends on its ability \nto become a commercial manufacturer. While the plant has always sold \njewel bearings and related items in the commercial market, it is \nredoubling its efforts. Its chief commercial products are ferrules, \nwhich connect fiber optic cables. Japanese firms dominate volume \nproduction of ferrules, but the plant is establishing itself as a \nsupplier of specialty ferrules in niche markets.\n  I would also note that while the Federal Government no longer needs \njewel bearings, it does require the kind of unique micromanufacturing \ncapability that the William Langer Plant provides.\n  The plant also manufactures dosimeters, which measure doses of \nnuclear radiation. Dosimeters are vital to the military, to commercial \nutilities that operate nuclear reactors, and to FEMA's emergency \npreparedness programs. FEMA has indicated that it will work with new \nownership and management of the plant to maintain the plant's \ncapability to manufacture dosimeters. So the plant's employees have \nseveral reasons to hope that the plant will survive in the long run.\n  However, the plant badly needs legislative help in the short run. The \nnormal excess property procedure would require the GSA to sell the \nplant for fair market value. The problem is that no local entity can \nafford the plant, which has an original cost of $4.2 million. The plant \nitself is not now healthy enough in a business sense to finance its own \nacquisition by a new management team. My amendment's provision that the \nGSA may convey the plant without consideration is therefore vital to \nthe plant's ability to make a successful transition from Government \ncontracts to commercial operations.\n  I would like to stress to my colleagues that the Rolla community, the \nState of North Dakota, the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, and the \nlocal business community have been working hard to ensure that the \nplant makes a successful transition to the private sector. The local \ncommunity is united behind the plan to transfer the plant to the Job \nDevelopment Authority of the city of Rolla. Under my amendment, the \nauthority will be able to lease the plant for economic development \npurposes. The intent of the amendment is to provide both flexibility \nfor commercializing the plant and \n\n[[Page S 12604]]\naccountability to the Federal Government for the plant's future.\n  Mr. President, to sum up, I would simply say to my colleagues that \nthis amendment tries to give a helping hand to the Langer plant and the \ncity of Rolla, while relieving the Federal Government of a facility \nthat it no longer needs.\n  I understand that the amendment will be accepted unanimously, and I \nthank the managers on both sides, Senators Thurmond and Nunn, and the \nsenior Senator from Ohio, Senator Glenn, for their support of this \namendment, as well as their staffs for their assistance with this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, this amendment authorizes the administrator \nof the General Services Administration to convey the William Langer \nJewel Bearing Plant, 9.77 acres of real property, to the city of Rolla, \nND. DOD declared the property in excess to its needs in July. GSA \nconducted a screening of the property and found there are no other \nFederal interests in the facility. I believe this has been cleared on \nthe other side.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this particular amendment has the support \nof this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2459) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2460\n\n   (Purpose: To authorize a land exchange, U.S. Army Reserve Center, \n                            Gainesville, GA)\n\n  Mr. NUNN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 487, below line 24, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 2838 LAND EXCHANGE, UNITED STATES ARMY RESERVE CENTER, \n                   GAINESVILLE, GEORGIA.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Army may convey to \n     the City of Gainesville, Georgia (in this section referred to \n     as the ``City''), all right, title, and interest of the \n     United States in and to a parcel of real property (together \n     with any improvements thereeon) consisting of approximately \n     4.2 acres located on Shallowford Road, in the City of \n     Gainesville, Georgia.\n       (b) Consideration.--As consideration for the conveyance \n     authorized by subsection (a), the City shall--\n       (1) convey to the United States all right, title, and \n     interest in and to a parcel of real property consisting of \n     approximately 8 acres of land, acceptable to the Secretary, \n     in the Atlas Industrial Park, Gainesville, Georgia;\n       (2) design and construct on such real property suitable \n     replacement facilities in accordance with the requirements of \n     the Secretary, for the training activities of the Unites \n     States Army Reserve;\n       (3) fund and perform any environmental and cultural \n     resource studies, analysis, documentation that may be \n     required in connection with the land exchange and \n     construction considered by this section;\n       (4) reimburse the Secretary for the costs of relocating the \n     United States Army Reserve units from the real property to be \n     conveyed under subsection (a) to the replacement facilities \n     to be constructed by the City under subsection (b)(2). The \n     Secretary shall deposit such funds in the same account used \n     to pay for the relocation;\n       (5) pay to the United States an amount as may be necessary \n     to ensure that the fair market value of the consideration \n     provided by the City under this subsection is not less than \n     fair market value of the parcel of real property conveyed \n     under subsection (a); and\n       (6) assume all environmental liability under the \n     Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and \n     Liability Act (42 U.S.C. 9620(h)) for the real property to be \n     conveyed under subsection (b)(1).\n       (c) Determination of Fair Market Value.--(1) The \n     determination of the Secretary regarding the fair market \n     value of the real property to be conveyed pursuant to \n     subsection (a), and of any other consideration provided by \n     the City under subsection (b), shall be final.\n       (d) Description of Property.--The exact acreage and legal \n     description of the parcels of real property to be conveyed \n     under subsections (a) and (b) shall be determined by surveys \n     satisfactory to the Sectretary. The cost of such surveys \n     shall be borne by the City.\n       (e) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Secretary may \n     require any additional terms and conditions in connection \n     with the coneyances under this section that the Secretary \n     considers appropriate to protect the interest of the United \n     States.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, this amendment authorizes the Secretary of \nthe Army to convey 4.2 acres of real property at an Army Reserve \nfacility in Gainesville, GA, in exchange for an 8 acres of land in the \nAtlas Industrial Park, Gainesville, GA. The exchange is for fair market \nvalue.\n  I believe this has been cleared. It is an important amendment to the \npeople in Gainesville, GA, as well as to the Army Reserve, which is \ngoing to get a larger piece of land and also a new reserve facility in \nexchange for an existing piece of land at fair market value.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the amendment has the support of this \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2460) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my understanding is that we will not \nconclude the list of amendments which have been agreed to. We will \nfinish that in the morning. Among those will be one by the Senator from \nVirginia that relates to the spent nuclear fuel issue. I will, \nbeforehand--I repeat, beforehand--have contacted Senators Kempthorne \nand Craig for their views. Today, I received a series of telephone \ncalls, and it was explained that negotiations are still going on with \nthe Governor of Idaho.\n  Also, I must say to my colleagues that this is an issue of very \nserious concern to the U.S. Navy, because it is impacting on the future \nrefueling of our naval ships and consequently impacts on their \ndeployment. It also impacts on the rotation of work among the several \nshipyards in handling the refueling and other naval work.\n  Therefore, I am hopeful that this can be worked out satisfactorily \nbetween the administration and the State of Idaho and the U. S. \nDepartment of Defense. But I am concerned that the progress thus far \nleaves this Senator--and I just speak for myself--somewhat \ndisheartened. Therefore, I will continue to monitor and address this \nissue. I may have further remarks on it tomorrow after consultation \nwith my colleagues, the Senators from that State. But I wish to alert \nSenators of the concern of this Senator on this matter.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I believe that amendment is being worked on \nby staff. I think it is either worked out or very close to being worked \nout. So I anticipate that we will be in a position to deal with it \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think we will turn to the conclusion of \nthe Senate's business, unless the Senator has further comments. He is \nbeating a hasty retreat. It is my lifetime opportunity to do what I \nwant in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12579-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I want to add a few words to the chorus of \npraise for our distinguished colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Pell. \nAs has been noted in the remarks of my colleagues, Senator Pell's \nservice in Congress includes so many accomplishments of such great \nconsequences for our country that it would distinguish the careers of \n10 public servants. That one man rendered so many important services to \nthe American people is truly astonishing, and reflects great credit on \nSenator Pell.\n  Senator Pell now informs us that his service in the Senate will \nconclude at 36 years. Thirty six years is a long \n\n[[Page S 12605]]\ntime to be sure, and Senator Pell has more than earned his comfortable \nretirement. But the sentiments held by his colleagues that this place \nwill be improverished by his departure are genuine. For Senator Pell's \ncareer was marked by more than extraordinary achievement. It was marked \nby extraordinary graciousness, and generosity, and an indefatigable \ndecency toward others. I think we would all agree that when it comes to \nthese virtues, Claiborne Pell is a gentleman without peer.\n  In his announcement of his retirement, Senator Pell expressed some \nvery gracious sentiments about this institution and the men and women \nwho work here. Coming from him, they were most appreciated. For if the \nSenate is indeed a finer place than it is popularly perceived to be \nthat quality is due in part to Claiborne Pell's presence here. He will \nbe greatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12604-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12605-S12608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN EAST ASIA\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, while we were out of session over the last \nthree weeks there were a number of important developments in Asia--\nspecifically Vietnam, Cambodia and China --to which I, as the Chairman \nof the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, would like to \ndraw my colleagues' attention.\n  First, the human rights situation in Vietnam continues to be of great \nconcern. The weekend of August 12, barely a week after Secretary of \nState Christopher opened the newly-established U.S. embassy in Hanoi, a \nVietnamese court convicted two Vietnamese-born U.S. citizens and seven \nVietnamese nationals accused of being counter-revolutionaries and \nacting to ``overthrow the people's administration.'' The group, allied \nwith the banned political party Tan Dai Viet, was apparently trying to \norganize a conference in Ho Chi Minh City (the former Saigon) to \ndiscuss human rights and democracy in Vietnam. After their first \nattempt failed, they tried to set up another meeting but were arrested \n10 days before it was held. Radio Hanoi Voice of Vietnam, in somewhat \ncharacteristic rhetoric, described their ``crimes'' as follows:\n\n       Taking advantage of our party's renovation policy, they \n     used the pretext of democracy and human rights to distort the \n     truth of history, smear the Vietnamese communist party and \n     state, instigate bad elements at home, and contact hostile \n     forces abroad to feverishly oppose our state in an attempt to \n     set up a people-betraying and nation-harming regime. A check \n     of their personal backgrounds indicated that they spent \n     almost all their lives serving the enemy of our people and \n     giving a helping hand to the aggressors' attempts to oppose \n     our country.\n       The administration warned them and used educational \n     measures on them after it discovered their sabotage scheme. \n     Nonetheless, they stubbornly contacted reactionary forces \n     abroad and carried on their scheme aimed at opposing and \n     overthrowing the people's administration. Their activities \n     posed a particular danger to society and was detrimental to \n     national security.\n\n  Americans Nguyen Tan Tri and Tran Quang Liem received a 7-year and 4-\nyear prison sentence respectively.\n\n  In addition, the Vietnamese government's persecution of Buddhist \nleaders continues unabated. On August 15, a Vietnamese court sentenced \na leader of a banned Buddhist church to five years in prison for \ncriticizing Communist rule and maintaining an independent (i.e., \noutside direct Communist control) Buddhist church. The court convicted \nThich Quang Do, secretary general of the Unified Buddhist Church of \nVietnam (UBCV), and five other activists in a 1-day trial. Thich Quang \nwas accused of publishing a criticism of the Communist Party and \nsending two faxes to overseas Buddhists accusing the Vietnamese \nGovernment of obstructing a church-sponsored flood-relief mission in \n1994. The other five were arrested for participating in that mission.\n  Vietnamese authorities also recently announced that the government \nwould soon try the acting head of the UBCV Thich Huyen Quang, who is \nunder house arrest at the Quang Phuoc Shrine in Quang Ngai; and Thich \nLong Tri, UBCV's third highest official, who is under house arrest at \nthe Vien Giac Pagoda in Hoi An, Quang Nam. The announcement is \nespecially ironic given that since last year the government has \nsystematically denied that Thich Huyen had ever been placed under \narrest. On December 29, the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry announced that \nreports of Thich Huyen's arrest were fabrications and that he had \nsimply been ``moved to another pagoda at the requests of other monks.''\n  Mr. President, these are not isolated incidents, but part of a \nsystematic denial of even the most basic human rights on the part of \nthe Vietnamese government. Let me list just a few others:\n\n       Thich Tri Tuu, the senior monk of the Linh Mu pagoda in Hue \n     and a close disciple of the late Supreme Patriarch of the \n     UBCV, is serving a four-year sentence on charges of ``public \n     disorder'' at the Ba Sao prison camp, Nam Ha, Phu Ly \n     province, in conjunction with the May 1993 protest in Hue. At \n     the time of the demonstration, Thich Tri was being held in \n     police custody, and police refused to let Buddhist monks who \n     began the protests see him or talk to him. The crowd later \n     saw him slumped in the back of a police vehicle, stopped the \n     vehicle and extracted him from it--he had apparently \n     fainted. He was placed, unconscious, into a cyclo-pousse \n     which carried him back to his temple as the protest \n     continued and certain persons in the crowd set the police \n     vehicle on fire. Also still imprisoned at the Ba Sao camp \n     on public disorder charges stemming from this protest are \n     Thich Hai Tang and Thich Hai Thinh. Thich Hai Chanh was \n     released, but not allowed to return to his residence at \n     the Linh Mu pagoda in Hue and has been obliged to move to \n     a pagoda in Quang Tri province.\n       Thich Hanh Duc, appointed by the state-sponsored church to \n     be abbot of the Son Linh Pagoda of Ba Ria-Vung Tau in 1982, \n     was arrested in July 1993 when police attempted to enter the \n     pagoda and a violent confrontation ensued. The Fatherland \n     Front and the provincial people's committee issued an \n     eviction order against Thich Hanh and other monks after the \n     senior monk publicly read an oration of Thich Huyen Quang and \n     expressed support for the restoration of the Unified Buddhist \n     Church. In February 1993, the provincial committee of the \n     state-sponsored church expelled him from the church for \n     ``violating the principles of Vietnamese Buddhism.'' Thich \n     Hanh Duc was ultimately sentenced to three years of \n     imprisonment for ``crimes against on-duty officials'' and \n     ``handing out documents hostile to the socialist government \n     of Vietnam;'' he was last known to be detained at the Phuoc \n     Co prison in Ba Ria-Vung Tau.\n       Do Trung Hieu, formerly a Communist Party cadre in charge \n     of religious affairs in Ho Chi Minh City and now a private \n     businessman, was detained by police in Ho Chi Minh City on \n     June 14, 1995. Hieu had written and circulated an \n     autobiographical essay describing the Party's efforts to \n     dismantle the Unified Buddhist Church after the war out of \n     fear that its influence and following would spread throughout \n     Vietnam. Hieu has reportedly been transferred to Hanoi for \n     questioning, but his whereabouts have not been confirmed.\n       Hoang Minh Chinh, a well-known communist intellectual, was \n     also detained in Hanoi on June 14 this year. This was his \n     third detention for criticizing Party policy; he had \n     previously been arrested for advocating ``revisionist'' lines \n     in 1967 and 1981. The cause of the latest detention appears \n     to be petitions he sent to the highest levels of the Party \n     demanding that his name be cleared for his previous jailings, \n     and his questioning the propriety of the constitutional \n     provision that enshrines the leading role of the Vietnam \n     Communist Party.\n       Doan Thanh Liem, a law professor who was educated in the \n     United States, is serving a twelve-year sentence for \n     ``counter revolutionary propaganda''--that is, notes he had \n     prepared on constitutional reform. He was arrested in April \n     1990 for his association with Michael Morrow, Dick Hughes and \n     Don Luce. He knew all three Americans from his participation \n     in a well-known Saigon charity, the Shoeshine Boys. Liem, \n     held in the Ham Tan camp, has developed a serious pulmonary \n     condition in prison that is often associated with \n     tuberculosis. Senator Harkin's request to meet with Liem was \n     denied during his July 1995 visit.\n       Nguyen Tri, also known as Truong Hung Thai, was sentenced \n     to eight years at the trial of Doan Thanh Liem for having \n     helped Liem purchase a typewriter and having received from \n     Liem two documents the official press described as ``anti-\n     communist.''\n       Doan Viet Hoat, one of Vietnam's most prominent political \n     prisoners, was transferred abruptly among three different \n     prisons last year, ending up in the Thanh Cam camp, a \n     facility for common criminals in a remote and malarial part \n     of Thanh Hoa province. Arrested in November 1990, Dr. Hoat \n     was given a fifteen-year sentence on charges of ``attempting \n     to overthrow the government'' for producing the reformist \n     newsletter Freedom Forum. His transfers seem to have come in \n     reaction to public statements which he has periodically been \n     able to release since his initial detention. The move to \n     Thanh Cam has isolated him from the outside world, and he is \n     allowed only limited communication with his family.\n       Pham Duc Kham, also tried for the Freedom Forum affair, was \n     sentenced to sixteen years of imprisonment (later reduced to \n     just under twelve years) for his participation. He was \n     transferred in November 1994 from the Xuan Phuoc labor camp \n     in Phu Yen province \n\n[[Page S 12606]]\n     to the Cam Thuy camp Number 5, not far from the Thanh Cam camp in a \n     remote part of Thanh Hoa province.\n       Le Duc Vuong, tried for the Freedom Forum affair, was \n     sentenced to a five-year term. He was last known to be \n     performing hard labor at the A-20 camp in Xuan Phuoc.\n       Dr. Nguyen Dan Que, an endocrinologist who was sentenced in \n     1991 to twenty years of imprisonment on charges of \n     ``attempting to overthrow the government'' for publicly \n     signing a declaration calling for political reform and \n     respect for human rights, is reported to be in fair health, \n     having received some medication for a kidney stone. He has \n     been held in isolation at Xuan Loc prison camp for nearly two \n     years, following the Vietnamese government's unwillingness to \n     allow our colleague Senator Robb to meet him.\n       Do Van Thac was arrested with five other members of the \n     opposition Dai Viet Duy Dan (People's Party) on July 9, 1991. \n     In January 1992, a court in Hanoi sentenced Do Van Thac to \n     fourteen years' imprisonment--later commuted to twelve \n     years--on charges of ``attempting to overthrow the \n     government,'' apparently for circulating writings describing \n     the People's Party and calling for political and economic \n     reform.\n       Vu Thanh, Dat Hai, Paul Nguyen Chau Dat, and five other \n     members of the Congregation of the Mother Co-Redemptrix \n     remain in prison. On May 15, 1987, these persons, along with \n     Father Dominic Tran Dinh Thu and approximately sixty other \n     Catholic clergy and laypersons were arrested when authorities \n     raided the compound of the order founded by Father Dominic. \n     During the raid, authorities seized rice stocks from the \n     community and religious literature, causing people from the \n     surrounding area to defend the congregation (and their rice \n     stocks) with improvised arms. Vu Thanh, Dat Hai, Paul Nguyen \n     Chau Dat and twenty others were tried on October 30, 1987 and \n     convicted of ``sowing disunity between the people and the \n     government.'' Vu Thanh Dat Hai was sentenced to ten years of \n     imprisonment and three years of suppression of civil rights, \n     and is now in the Long Khanh prison camp. Paul Nguyen Chau \n     Dat was given a twenty-year term, which he is also serving in \n     Long Khanh. Nguyen Van Thin Quan is serving a sixteen-year \n     sentence in the Ham tan camp; Mai Duc Chuong Nghi is serving \n     an eighteen-year term in a Thanh Hoa province labor camp; \n     Dinh Viet Hieu Thuc is serving a fourteen-year sentence in \n     the Long Khanh prison camp; Pham Ngoc Lien Tri is serving a \n     twenty-year term at the Long Khanh camp, and Nguyen Thien \n     Phung Huan is also serving a twenty-year term at Long Khanh.\n       Pastor Nguyen Duc Loi and Pastor Nguyen Van Vui are \n     reported to have been arrested on November 20, 1994 when \n     proselytizing among the ethnic Hre minority in Quang Ngai \n     province. According to unconfirmed local sources, the two \n     have been accused of pursuing political activities under the \n     guise of religion, and after their arrest officials ordered \n     local Christians to cease all religious activities, including \n     prayer meetings.\n\n  Mr. President, in all the controversy surrounding the Clinton \nadministration's recent questionable decision to normalize relations \nwith Vietnam, the emotional and unresolved POW-MIA issue, and the blind \nheadlong rush of United States business to enter the expanding \nVietnamese market regardless, I believe that some Americans have lost \nsight of an important fact: the Vietnamese Government is a textbook \nCommunist dictatorship to which the idea of basic human rights is \nsimply a nuisance. No amount of talk about their modernizing their \neconomy or welcoming American investment will change that fact. I am \nalready seriously disinclined to support the establishment of a United \nStates ambassador in Hanoi, or the granting of most favored nation \nstatus or OPIC funding for Vietnam because, unlike the administration, \nI do not believe that the Vietnamese have been as forthcoming as they \ncould be on the POW-MIA issue; their human rights record makes me even \nless so.\n  Moving on to Cambodia, Mr. President, following closely on the \nunfortunate expulsion of Sam Rainsy from the Cambodian legislature the \ngovernment of that country has once again taken steps which call into \nserious question its commitment to its nascent democracy. Over the past \nyear and a half, the frequency of the government's mistreatment of the \ndomestic media and its suppression of the freedoms we have embodied in \nour First Amendment has become alarming; journalists critical of the \ngovernment have been arrested and prosecuted and newspapers have been \nshut down.\n  Just recently, the government charged the Phnom Penh Post and Michael \nHayes, its American publisher, with violations of Article LXII of the \nCambodian Criminal Code and is seeking to fine the publisher and close \ndown the paper. Article LXII provides for a fine and up to 3 years \nimprisonment for publishing false or falsely attributed information in \nbad faith and with malicious intent when the publication has disturbed \nor is likely to disturb the public peace. In order to convict, the \ngovernment must prove all three elements--falsity, malicious intent, \nand public disturbance. The story in question is an article by Nate \nThayer in the March 24/April 6 edition entitled ``Security Jitters \nWhile PM's Away.'' The article detailed alleged security threats and \nmeasures taken by the government while the two Prime Ministers \nattended  the April 1995 meeting of the country's principal aid donors. \nIn reporting about the threats, Mr. Thayer clearly notes that many of \nthe reported assertions were ``rumor'' or opinions or statements \nattributed to unnamed third parties. The article went on to cite \n``human rights officials'' as saying that recent government actions \nagainst the press, the U.N. Center for Human Rights, and M.P. Sam \nRainsy are the beginning of an official effort to put an end to \ncriticism of the government that leaders say undermines its image at \nhome and abroad as a democratic country.\n\n  Despite the fact that from the particulars of the case I doubt very \nmuch that the government could actually prove a violation of Art. LXII, \nthey have decided to proceed with the case. The purpose of that \ndecision is clearly is two-fold. First and foremost, there is the \nchilling effect bringing a criminal prosecution has on other like-\nminded journalists; the threat of jail or a fine--even simply the \nthreat of criminal litigation--can make even the most serious and \naccurate journalist skittish. The reason for picking on a foreign-owned \npaper is also clear; as a U.N. worker recently noted:\n\n       The cases against the Khmer press are in a slightly \n     different category because they have been persecuted for \n     articles that are mostly opinion. The Phnom Penh Post and \n     other Western--style newspapers are more troubling to the \n     government because they deal with facts that can be proved \n     true. They bring to light the inner workings of government \n     and that bother [the government] far more than opinions that \n     are sometimes insulting.\n\n  Second, the government seeks to use the law to discover the \nidentities of Mr. Thayer's sources. To prevent the government from \nproving the first element of an Art. LXII offense in court--false \nattribution--Thayer would be forced to disclose his sources. Any forced \ncompromise of journalistic sources severely curtails the ability of a \nfree press to report on, and the people's right to be informed about, \nmatters of public interest. This is especially true in instances \ninvolving such issues as government corruption, where the power of the \nwrongdoers makes those knowledgeable about the wrongdoing hesitant to \ncome forward.\n  This is far from being the only time that the Cambodian Government \nhas initiated an Art. LXII prosecution on flimsy grounds. Two Cambodian \njournalists have already been convicted under that provision for \narticles that, in my view, plainly reported opinions--which are by \ndefinition subjective rather than objective--rather than facts. On May \n19, the editor of Oddom K'tek Khmer, Thun Bunly, was sentenced to a \nfine of R5,000,000 ($2,000) or one year in jail for printing a letter \nto the editor entitled ``Stop Barking Samdech Prime Ministers.'' The \nfollowing day, Hen Vipheak was sentenced to a fine of R5,000,000 or two \nyears in jail for a cartoon and satire of the three branches of \ngovernment. Most recently, Thun Bunly was tried again, this time for \nexpressing opinions highly critical of the government; he described \ncertain government officials as greedy dictators. His paper was shut \ndown and he was sentenced to a fine of R10,000,000 or two years in \njail.\n  Unfortunately, this blatant intimidation shows no signs of abating. \nLast week the Ministry of Information announced that the government is \nseeking prosecution on unspecified charges of between two and five \nnewspapers. One of them, Samleng Yu Vachuon Khmer, has already received \na court summons. In addition, the government has adopted a new press \nlaw that would allow criminal prosecutions where the published material \naffects national security and political stability--as nebulous a \nstandard as I have seen--and permits the Ministries of the Interior and \nInformation to confiscate publications they find objectionable or \ntemporarily suspend publications without the \n\n[[Page S 12607]]\napproval or oversight of an independent court. Although the measure has \nyet to be signed into law by King Sihanouk and therefore is not legally \nin effect, it is being used to bring charges against the media.\n  The repeated pattern of these prosecutions, as well as the fact that \nall of the alleged offenders have all stepped on the government's toes, \nleads me and groups like Human Rights Watch/Asia to conclude that the \ngovernment has embarked on a program of intimidation aimed at quelling \nits detractors. That perception is not helped by statements such as \nthose by Prime Minister Prince Ranariddh last month that foreign \nnewspapers are distorting the current situation in Cambodia and that \nthe Western brand of democracy and freedom of the press is not \napplicable to Cambodia. The Prince needs to be reminded, however, that \nthe freedoms embodied in the Paris Accords are not Western, but \nuniversal, and as such were supported by each of Cambodia's political \nparties. In addition, they are embodied in the International Covenant \non Civil and Political Rights to which Cambodia is a signatory.\n  The Cambodian Government may believe that no one is watching, or that \nno one outside Cambodia cares, or that their actions are somehow \nexcused by the nascent nature of their democracy; they could not be \nmore wrong. Mr. President, we and the other donor countries are \nwatching and we care. It is precisely because Cambodia's democracy is \nin its infancy that it is impor- tant to avoid the tendency towards \nthis type of abuse; otherwise, Cambodia risks institutionalizing the \nbehavior. If the Cambodian Government is unwilling to protect these \nuniversally recognized rights, and to protect journalists and others \nwho peacefully advocate dissenting political views, then we and the \nother donor nations will ensure that there is literally a price to be \npaid.\n  Last, but certainly not least, there were a number of developments in \nChina which are noteworthy. First, on the brighter side, there appears \nto have been a slight warming in our bilateral relationship. On August \n24, the Wuhan People's Court sentenced Harry Wu to a 15-year jail term \nand expelled him from the country, thus removing a serious obstacle to \nthe  resumption of friendly relations between us. A number of \nencouraging signs have followed. The Chinese have indicated that they \nwill be sending back to Washington their ambassador, Li Daoyu, who was \nrecalled after our decision to admit Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui \nfor a private visit. Having previously broken off all high-level \ngovernmental contacts, the Chinese agreed to a 3-day visit by United \nStates Undersecretary of State Tarnoff to discuss a variety of \nbilateral issues. In addition, on September 1, Li Xilin, the Guangzhou \nMilitary Area Commander of the People's Liberation Army, attended a \nceremony in Honolulu marking the 50th anniversary of the end of World \nWar II as the representative of Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian. \nThere is also talk of an October summit meeting between President \nClinton and his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin. These contacts are \nimportant because they provide a venue for dialog and dialog keeps \nparties from misunderstanding each other.\n\n  I am very pleased that it appears that the dip in our bilateral \nrelationship has reached its nadir and is on the upswing. That is not \nto say, of course, that everything has returned to normal. Reports in \nthe Chinese media, and statements from the Foreign Ministry, indicate \nthat that government is still adhering to the unacceptable position \nthat the United States is solely responsible for the current problems \nin Sino-U.S. relations; Washington should take all the blame for the \nproblems. Mr. President, the PRC should be mindful of the adage that \nwhen you point the finger of blame at someone, three fingers are \npointing back at you. If the Chinese were to indulge in one of their \nfavorite political pastimes--self-criticism--then perhaps they would \nrealize that it is they that may be at fault: their overreaction to \nPresident Lee's visit, technology transfers to Pakistan and Iran, \nfailure to enforce its obligations in regards to intellectual property \nand arbitral conventions--the list goes on. The Chinese need to get \nover the blame game and get down to constructive dialog and \nconstructive actions.\n  Despite my generally optimistic feeling about the general trend in \nour relationship, however, there have been a number of developments \nthere which are troubling to me. First, on August 17 China conducted \nits second underground nuclear test this year at its facility at Lop \nNor--its fourth in the past 14 months. This test concerns me, and \nothers, for the same reason as the proposed French tests in Mururoa; I \nbelieve that conducting these tests is damaging to international \nefforts to curb the proliferation of nuclear weapons. In May of this \nyear, the world's five acknowledged nuclear powers persuaded the rest \nof the world to extend indefinitely the Nuclear Non-proliferation \nTreaty. To win that consensus, the five countries promised to sign a \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty [CTBT] by the end of the year. The \ncontinuation of Chinese testing though, only 4 months after China \nsigned the agreement, calls into question that country's commitment to \nthe CTBT and consequently undermines these international efforts to \ncurb nuclear proliferation. What possible incentive do other nuclear \ncountries have to refrain from testing if others continue to test?\n  I am not alone in my disappointment at this decision. Many countries \nin the region, including Australia and Japan, have been very vocal in \ntheir opposition. In fact, on August 30 Japan announced it will freeze \nmost of its grant aid--about $81.2 million in fiscal year 1995--because \nof China's testing. Foreign Minister Kono Yohei told a news conference: \n``We have decided to freeze aid to China with the exception of a \nportion that is provided for emergency relief measures and humanitarian \naid--until China says it will stop nuclear tests.''\n  I would hope that Beijing would reconsider this course, not because \nwe disapprove, or other countries disapprove, but because of the \nbenefits that will accrue to the world as a whole as a result.\n  Another issue, Mr. President, is the unfortunate Chinese decision to \ndeny a visa to Hong Kong political leader Martin Lee Chu-ming. Lee is \nthe Chairman of the Democratic Party in Hong Kong, a principal voice of \nsupport for democracy in the colony; in that role, he has been a \nfrequent critic of the communist government in Beijing. Lee needed the \nvisa to attend the LawAsia conference in Beijing, to which he had been \nofficially invited. But before he could apply, Zou Yu, the head of the \nlocal coordinating body the China Law Society, said there was no place \n[here] for people like him because he was one of the founding members \nof the subversive Hong Kong Alliance in Support of a Patriotic \nDemocratic Movement. Ironically, Lee has a letter of invitation to the \nconference, which delegates had been told would be enough to have a \nvisa issued on presentation, signed by Mr. Zou.\n  Before I hear it from the Chinese Foreign Ministry, I will state at \nthe outset that I fully recognize that who the PRC does or does not \nadmit within its borders is purely an internal matter in which third \ncountries have no right to interfere. Certainly, Lee's statements in \nsupport of democracy are not music to the senior cadres' ears and if \nthey choose to exclude him on that basis so be it. However, I believe \nthat it would have been in China's best interests to admit him. Such a \nmove would have been greatly reassuring to Hong Kong--to both its \ncitizenry and business interests--and would have gone a long way to \nbolster China's stature worldwide. As it stands though the Chinese move \nseems petty and vindictive, and calls into question both its post-1997 \ncommitment to the continuation of democracy in Hong Kong and its \nability to impartially host international conferences.\n  The PRC has a disturbing habit of seeking to host these conferences \nin an effort to boost  its international image, only to then heap a \nhost of conditions on the attendees to ensure that nothing comes up at \nthe conference which might embarrass China by, say, openly discussing \nits abysmal human rights record. The LawAsia Conference and Martin Lee \nare one example; another is the present U.N. women's conference in \nBeijing. When it became clear to the Chinese authorities that the \nparticipants in the conference's NGO forum are prone to spontaneous \ndemonstrations and statements in support of a \n\n[[Page S 12608]]\nvariety of causes the regime finds threatening--democracy, opposition \nto coerced abortion, the role of women in society--the forum suddenly \nfound itself moved a substantial distance outside Beijing to the small \nvillage of Huairou. The official reason was that the Beijing stadium \noriginally planned to hold the forum was structurally unsound--despite \nthe fact that only 2 weeks ago the Chinese held a major event there. \nThe unofficial reason is clear to everyone; Chinese authorities are \ndoing their best to make sure that the flood of delegates does not \ncontaminate China or its citizenry with foreign ideas and open dialog.\n\n  Official statements to the contrary aside, the Chinese are fooling no \none. As the Chinese themselves are fond of saying: ``Actions speak \nlouder than words.'' Once Beijing began to prepare for the conference, \nthe patterns of isolating delegates and imposing censorship became \nclear. Delegates with views with which China disagrees were denied \nvisas. Groups representing Tibetan and Taiwanese women were unfairly \ndenied accreditation, lest they embarrass the host country. Thirty \ndelegates from Niger were denied visas; ostensibly because their \npaperwork was not entirely in order, but more likely--as almost \neveryone believes--because Niger diplomatically recognizes Taiwan. \nDelegates who were allowed in were warned that Chinese customs \nofficials would confiscate any printed material China deemed \nobjectionable, including Bibles. Buses that were promised to run every \n20 minutes from Huairou to Beijing have dwindled to one per day, \neffectively isolating the delegates at Huairou even more. The U.N. \ndesignated ``newspaper of record'' for the forum--chronicling the \nmeetings and seminars and reporting on the day's events--has been \nunable to publish because the Chinese firm with which they contracted \nis suddenly and inexplicably ``too busy with other printing work.''\n  I think one of the especially telling examples of this trend is the \ncreation of an ``official protest site'' for the conference. \nPredictably sited outside of Beijing in Huairou, the official spot is \nlocated on a middle-school athletic field within the confines of the \nforum, where an extra 5,000 police officers will be on duty. There, \nseparated from the Chinese people by an artificially imposed chasm, the \ndelegates are free to protest to their hearts content-with one \nexception. Vice Minister of Public Security Tian Qiyu has announced \nthat ``Inside the site, NGO's are permitted to have demonstrations and \nprocessions, but these should not infringe on the sovereignty of the \nhost country and should not slander or attack [its] leaders.'' In other \nwords, say what you want just don't criticize China. So much for an \nopen forum.\n  The actions of the Chinese Government became so oppressive that they \nthreatened to scuttle the entire forum. Complaints from a large number \nof delegates about the omnipresence of Chinese security police hovering \nover them grew with each passing day of the forum, and for good reason. \nBoth uniformed and plainclothes police monitored meetings and \ndiscussions, and videotaped participants. Security officers have \nsearched hotel rooms, followed delegates, rifled through personal \npapers and tried to restrict the movement of people who have come to \ntake part in the conferences. On August 31, following a screening of a \nvideo about Tibet entitled ``Voices in Exile,'' police snatched the \nvideo cassette and attempted to confiscate it, only to have it snatched \nback by the attendees. Another group of delegates protesting China's \ntreatment of Tibetan women were surrounded by Chinese plainclothes \npolice and shouted down; one Canadian woman, the adoptive mother of a \nTibetan child, was even physically assaulted. Although the Chinese \ndenied such an assault took place, it was captured on video and \nbroadcast here by CNN. A session held by Australian NGO's was disrupted \nwhen security officials seized microphones and video equipment and \nordered the groups to disband; the Australian Government lodged a \nformal protest in response. In another incident, police tried to seize \na Chinese woman who chatted with delegates on the street. When the \nwoman was surrounded by delegates, though, the police retreated. The \nChinese moves are especially galling because under the agreement signed \nby the Chinese the forum site is considered to be under U.N., rather \nthan Chinese, jurisdiction for the duration of the conference, much \nlike embassies are considered to be.\n  Things got so bad that on September 3, the leaders of the forum \nissued an ultimatum to the Chinese demanding that China stop its heavy-\nhanded security measures by noon on that day. In response, the Chinese \ngrudgingly replaced some uniformed officers with plainclothesmen and \nscaled back some of the surveillance. Despite the changes, though, \nclashes between police and delegates continue. Just this last weekend \nIslamic women demonstrators were physically prevented by police from \nmarching out of the forum site into Huairou.\n  Given this somewhat ironic Chinese penchant for actively seeking to \nhost international conferences dealing with human rights and the free \nexchange of ideas only to trample those very rights, I would not be at \nall surprised if the next time the PRC seeks to host such a meeting the \nparticipants think twice; and the Chinese--although they will certainly \ntry--will have no one to blame but themselves. As I have pointed out \npreviously, if China wants to assume a place at the international \ntable, then it must respect international rules and norms of behavior--\nin trade, in diplomacy and military affairs, in nonproliferation, and \nnot least in domestic practice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12605-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12608-S12610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THE AGENCY FOR HEALTH CARE POLICY AND RESEARCH: A BEACON FOR \n                              POLICYMAKERS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as the Congress considers its \nappropriations bills and strives to reduce the rate of growth of \nFederal programs, I would like to call attention to one very small, but \nimportant agency that policymakers and industry representatives alike \nhave praised as responsible and cost-effective--the Agency for Health \nCare Policy and Research [AHCPR].\n  AHCPR, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, \nwas established in 1989 with strong bipartisan support. Broadly stated, \nthe agency's mission is to conduct impartial health services research \nand disseminate information that will complement public and private \nsector efforts to improve health care quality and contain costs.\n  AHCPR's charge is to find out what works and what does not work in \nthe health care system, and the results of its research are being used \nvoluntarily by the private sector to contain health care costs. The \nagency funds outcomes research projects that examine the efficacy of \nmedical interventions in terms of how they affect patients. It also \nfunds studies on the medical effectiveness of particular procedures and \nconducts assessments of health technologies utilized by HCFA and \nCHAMPUS to make coverage decisions. These projects have identified \nmillions of dollars in potential savings to Medicare. Finally, the \nagency convenes multidisciplinary panels of experts to develop clinical \npractice guidelines on such topics as low back pain, cataracts, sickle \ncell anemia, mammography, unstable angina, and cancer pain. These \nguidelines are disseminated to consumers, private and public sector \nhealth care policymakers, providers, and administrators for use as they \nsee fit.\n  AHCPR is a true public/private partnership designed to improve the \nquality of health services and contain their cost. And it is working. \nSupporters of the agency include conservatives and liberals in both \npolitical parties and span the health care spectrum, from the insurance \nindustry to providers to academia and other highly regarded public \npolicy institutions. AHCPR has been called an ``honest broker'' because \nof the way it compiles and distributes health care cost and quality \ninformation among competing public and private sector interests.\n  It is very important to the health care system that AHCPR continue \nproducing the kind of significant research it has developed in the past \n5 years. To slash AHCPR's funding now would truly be penny-wise and \npound-foolish: The current funding level for the agency amounts to a \nlittle more than a dollar per American. Yet potential savings from the \nuse of its guidelines and research could save hundreds of millions, and \nby some estimate billions, of dollars.\n\n[[Page S 12609]]\n\n  AHCPR should continue to play a critical role as we struggle to \ncontrol national health care costs, particularly in the Medicare and \nMedicaid programs. AHCPR-funded research has provided strong evidence \nthat health care costs can be contained while improving the quality of \nservices. It would be irresponsible to devastate funding to the only \nGovernment agency devoted to finding ways for us to improve quality and \nlower costs.\n  Recently three of our esteemed former colleagues who were intimately \ninvolved in the creation of the Agency for Health Care Policy and \nResearch--Senator George Mitchell, Senator David Durenberger and \nRepresentative Willis Gradison--jointly authored an article entitled, \n``The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research: A Beacon for Policy \nMakers.'' This article gives a historical perspective and summarizes \nthe current situation while making a persuasive argument for the \nAHCPR's continued funding. I ask unanimous consent that this article be \nprinted in the Record, and I urge my colleagues to carefully consider \nthese noted health care experts' comments and weigh their advice when \nthe Senate considers the fiscal year 1996 Labor-HHS appropriations \nbill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research: A Beacon for \n                              Policymakers\n\n(Jointly authored by: former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, LL \nB., Georgetown University, B.A. in history, Bowdoin College, currently \n   special counsel to the Washington, D.C.-based law firm of Verner, \n      Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand; former Senator Dave \n Durenberger, J.D., University of Minnesota, B.A. cum laude political \n science and history, St. Johns University, currently senior counselor \n for the Washington, D.C.-based public affairs consulting firm of APCO \nAssociates Inc.; and, former Representative Willis Gradison, MBA, Ph.D \n  in economics, both from Harvard, currently president of the Health \n          Insurance Association of America, in Washington, DC)\n\n       Reasonable people--including the three of us--may disagree \n     about how to address problems in the nation's health care \n     system and the role government should play in ensuring access \n     to health care for American citizens. But there are some \n     major areas of bipartisan agreement as well. We agree that \n     the quality of health care should not be compromised and that \n     we must get the best value for the trillion dollars we spend \n     each year on medical care.\n       One clear way to maximize the value of health care is to \n     create a body of objective, science-based information on the \n     interrelationship of the cost and quality of health care. In \n     the late 1980s, we agreed that a federal investment was \n     needed in health services research. Our thoughts were \n     influenced by the early findings from research funded by the \n     National Center for Health Services Research (NCHSR).\n       For example, the ``small-area analysis'' conducted by John \n     Wennberg and others, and the work of the Maine Medical \n     Foundation, showed wide variations in the type and intensity \n     of medical care provided in different parts of the country. \n     Were people in some areas getting too much care? Were others \n     being under treated? To a large extent, we simply lacked the \n     research tools needed to explain these variations. Early \n     research by Wennberg and others also suggested that providing \n     physicians with credible, high-quality information could \n     modify their behavior, improve quality and reduce costs by \n     eliminating unnecessary or ineffective procedures.\n       While many public and private groups had initiated their \n     own health services research, their efforts were not being \n     coordinated and there were no scientifically-based protocols \n     for research and guideline development. We concluded that a \n     new agency could become the focus of federally-sponsored \n     outcomes studies. This new agency also would elevate the \n     status of health services research in general. Through \n     bipartisan efforts in both chambers, legislation was enacted \n     to create the federal Agency for Health Care Policy and \n     Research (AHCPR). This legislation ultimately became an \n     important part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n     1989 (P.L. 101-239).\n       As noted in a recent historical account of AHCPR, a primary \n     purpose of OBRA 1989 was to improve quality and contain costs \n     in the Medicare program--to curb costs without having to cut \n     back on needed care. Since both the public and private \n     sectors were calling for more readily available information, \n     AHCPR's mandate was two-fold: to find out which treatment \n     methods actually work and which ones are inappropriate and \n     therefore not cost effective. Second, we asked the agency to \n     work closely with the private sector--particularly consumers \n     and health care providers.\n       Among health care providers, physicians are the key. They \n     are an important group to reach, because they are responsible \n     for making most treatment decisions. It is significant to \n     note that many provider groups supported the creation of \n     AHCPR, including the American Medical Association, the \n     American College of Physicians, and the American Society of \n     Internal medicine. It also should be noted that outcomes \n     research was an important companion to the Medicare physician \n     payment reforms enacted the same year.\n       Since the federal government is the largest single payer of \n     health care services in the U.S., we initially asked AHCPR to \n     focus its research on the most common and the most costly \n     treatments for federal health programs such as Medicare and \n     Medicaid. In its first five years of operation, AHCPR has \n     made considerable progress. Its research activities focus on \n     ten of the 15 most common diagnoses for Medicare inpatients, \n     and nine of the 15 most common diagnoses for Medicaid \n     inpatients.\n       To date, the Agency has released 16 clinical practice \n     guidelines designed to inform patients and clinicians of \n     ``state of the art'' medicine. These guideline topics range \n     from the management of acute low back pain in adults to \n     treating otitis media in children.\n       AHCPR also is funding 15 Patient Outcome Research Teams, \n     known as PORTs. These multi-disciplinary, private-sector \n     groups are created to determine the treatment effectiveness \n     of conditions for which there is widespread disagreement \n     about clinical strategies. Current PORTs are studying \n     conditions ranging from cataracts to low birthweight.\n       The research and guideline development are the initial \n     steps. Equally important is making sure those guidelines \n     reach the public. So far, the Agency has distributed 26 \n     million copies of its guidelines to clinicians and consumers. \n     By working through partnerships with entities in the private \n     sector, AHCPR has saved $12.6 million in federal reprinting \n     and distribution costs. Private partners have circulated 11.5 \n     million reprints of AHCRP-funded guidelines.\n\n\n                         1. finding what works\n\n       The Agency's work has already produced scientific findings \n     that can improve the quality of health care while \n     constraining its cost.\n       AHCPR-sponsored research has demonstrated that about half \n     of the 600,000 patients who receive diagnostic cardiac \n     catheterization as inpatients each year could have the \n     procedure on an outpatient basis.\n       Research shows that ordering tests by computer decreased \n     hospital costs by nearly $600 per admission, and reduced \n     average length of stay by almost a day. If this computer \n     system was applied to the entire medicine service, the \n     hospital projected over $3 million in savings per year.\n       The use of transurethral resection of the prostate--an \n     operation for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)--has fallen \n     nearly 33 percent, due in part to AHCPR research on prostatic \n     disease and its guideline on BPH. This saves Medicare an \n     estimated $60 million annually.\n       AHCPR and its predecessor, NCHSR, have also been \n     instrumental in the early development of major improvements \n     to reimbursement systems. They funded the early design of \n     diagnosis related groups (DRGs), which were adapted for \n     Medicare payment reforms in 1983.\n       They also have helped to fine-tune the DRG system over \n     time. This series of payment reforms, in combination with \n     other initiatives (such as the creation of Medicare's Peer \n     Review Organizations (PROs)) has been widely credited with \n     limiting cost increases for Medicare. In addition, many of \n     these reimbursement reforms have been adapted by private \n     sector payers.\n\n\n                     2. Improving clinical practice\n\n       A second type of research conducted and sponsored by the \n     Agency helps physicians and other care-givers take advantage \n     of clinical and cost-effectiveness information. They enable \n     care-givers to use guidelines and other resources to quickly \n     ascertain treatment options and make more informed decisions. \n     For example:\n       Low back pain.--In 1990, the U.S. spent more than $20 \n     billion for direct medical costs associated with low back \n     pain. Lower back pain accounted for one-tenth of total \n     Medicare charges in 1987. Billions could be saved each year \n     by using the AHCPR guideline, without any loss in the quality \n     of care provided. For example, Singing River Hospital in \n     Pascagoula, Mississippi, has reduced the average length of \n     stay for surgical patients by one day since 1993, with the \n     help of AHCPR's acute pain management guideline.\n       Pressure ulcer prevention.--More than 250,000 hospital and \n     nursing home patients suffer from pressure ulcers. Broad use \n     of the AHCPR-supported clinical practice guidelines on \n     prevention could halve the incidence of this very painful and \n     costly problem. For example, Intermountain Health Care, a \n     Salt Lake City-based health care system, saved $240,000 in \n     six months by using the guidelines in one of its hospitals. \n     Intermountain is now implementing the guidelines in its \n     twenty-three other hospitals. Similarly, Abbott-Northwestern \n     Healthcare System in Minneapolis estimates it would save \n     $288,000 a year by using the guideline. South Suburban, a \n     225-bed hospital in Hazel Crest, Illinois, has halved the \n     number of hospital-acquired pressure ulcers since introducing \n     the guideline two years ago.\n       Most AHCPR-funded guidelines are so new that it is too \n     early to assess the extent to which they have been adopted. \n     Preliminary research suggests that many managed care \n\n[[Page S 12610]]\n     entities already use one or more of the AHCPR guidelines. Other groups \n     use the guidelines to improve their internal quality-\n     improvement initiatives.\n\n\n                               The Future\n\n       Like all scientific endeavors, there are no ``quick \n     fixes.'' In its first five years, AHCPR has demonstrated that \n     it is a sound investment for the American taxpayer. In fiscal \n     year 1994, AHCPR's annual operating budget of $162 million \n     represents only one fiftieth of one percent of the nation's \n     $900 billion health care spending. Indeed, all federal health \n     services research activities combined accounted for only \n     one twentieth of one percent of national health spending \n     in 1994.\n       Federal and state legislators grappling with spiraling \n     health care spending should be supporting health services \n     research more than ever before. They need this knowledge to \n     help them make sound decisions as new health delivery systems \n     evolve.\n       Is federally-sponsored health services research still \n     necessary? We believe the answer is yes, for at least three \n     reasons:\n       1. In a market-based delivery system driven by provider \n     competition and consumer choice, the information AHCPR \n     generates is essential--especially to the doctor-patient \n     relationship. Health services research also enables us to \n     study the impact of these delivery changes on quality and \n     access as the public and private sectors struggle to contain \n     health care costs.\n       2. AHCPR-funded research provides the economies of scale \n     that can only occur with a comprehensive national study. Both \n     public and private groups benefit from having this \n     information in the public domain. The federal government's \n     willingness to provide ``seed money'' stimulates privates \n     sector research initiatives and magnifies the applicability \n     of the results.\n       3. AHCPR acts as an ``honest broker'' in developing the \n     science of health services research. The Agency's authorizing \n     legislation does not allow it to regulate the health care \n     industry, it is not empowered to act as a payer of health \n     care services, and it does not administer a health program. \n     Therefore, it is free from conflicts of interest.\n       It is appropriate for the government to have a role in \n     building and sustaining the knowledge base that can meet the \n     information needs of a market-driven health care system. \n     Indeed, AHCPR-funded guidelines are often viewed as the \n     ``gold standard'' of guidelines, and are frequently \n     customized by private entities. For example, UCLA Medical \n     Center, Kaiser-Permanente--Anaheim Medical Center and Saint \n     Luke's Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri are among the many \n     facilities that have utilized AHCPR's acute pain management \n     guideline.\n       These findings have acted like a beacon, they show policy \n     makers in advance where problems are developing and provide \n     alternatives for helping to solve these problems. The \n     creation of AHCPR has improved the quality of health care \n     delivered in this country by facilitating health services \n     research and disseminating the results to the public. At the \n     same time, it has proved to be an extremely sound investment \n     for American taxpayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12608-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE 250TH ANNIVERSARY OF FREDERICK, MARYLAND\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to call to the attention of \nour colleagues celebrations that are underway to celebrate the 250th \nanniversary of the establishment of the city of Frederick, MD. The \nmayor of Frederick, Jim Grimes, along with the entire community, has \nplanned several significant events to commemorate this propitious \nmilestone.\n  Throughout its history, Frederick has served not only as a monument \nto Marylanders, but it has also carved its place in American history as \nwell. Established in 1745, Frederick Town was the home of many great \ncolonial Americans including Francis Scott Key, author of ``The Star \nSpangled Banner''; Roger Taney, second Chief Justice of the Supreme \nCourt; and John Hanson, President of the Continental Congress.\n  The English and German settlers of Frederick Town were ferociously \nproud of the independence and the liberty they found in the New World. \nWhen the British passed the Stamp Act in 1785 requiring colonists to \npurchase stamps for all legal and commercial documents, 12 Frederick \nCounty judges resolved to reject the Stamp Act and approved the usage \nof unstamped documents. This bold maneuver is believed to be the first \nrecorded act of rebellion in the colonies.\n  According to several historians, it was in Frederick Town, not St. \nLouis, where Lewis and Clark began their famed expedition across the \nunexplored Nation. In July 1803, the travelers set forth from the \nHessian Barracks in Frederick Town across the unchartered west and into \nthe unknown territory.\n  Frederick Town was incorporated as a city in 1817, thus officially \nchanging its name to Frederick. In the early 1800's, construction of \nthe B Railroad and the C Canal began. The establishment of these \ntwo major avenues of transportation opened a window to the world for \nthe citizens of Frederick. These corridors to Washington and Baltimore \nwould provide access to jobs, to industry, and to trade.\n  But in 1864, Frederick was faced with grave despair. Under the threat \nof General Jubal Early's torch, city officials had to secure $200,000 \nin loans from local banks to save Frederick. Three of the five original \nbanks that contributed to that ransom are still open for business.\n  Over the course of the next century, Frederick would mature into a \nthriving and continuously expanding community. It is the home of a wide \nspectrum of facilities that include Fort Detrick, high-tech firms that \nare instrumental in AIDS research, the Frederick Keys baseball team, \nHood College and Frederick Community College. And although Frederick is \nthe third largest city in Maryland, it still maintains its small town \ncharm and charisma.\n  Frederick is a model of community spirit and cooperation. The \nactivities that have been sponsored to commemorate this auspicious \noccasion exemplify the deep devotion of Frederick's residents to their \ncommunity. The spirit and enthusiasm of Frederick's citizens have been \nthe foundation of its success. These celebrations provide the \nopportunity to renew the dedication that has supported Frederick \nthroughout its history and helped it to develop into one of Maryland's \nmost attractive communities.\n  We in Maryland are fortunate to have an area as community-oriented as \nFrederick. I join the citizens of Frederick in sharing their pride in \nFrederick's past and optimism for continued success in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12610-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12610-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and treaties which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12610-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12610-S12611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 1995, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on August 11, 1995, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bill:\n       H.R. 2161.

Mr. President, recently, the New York Times had an \neditorial titled, ``Bullying Taiwan,'' which appeared while Congress \nwas not in session.\n  It comments on what is taking place in China and that country's \nirresponsible conduct toward Taiwan.\n  For years before the United States recognized the People's Republic \nof China, I had favored dual recognition, as we did with East Germany \nand West Germany.\n  But for reasons I understand, in part to keep China on an anti-Soviet \ncourse, the United States continued to follow a one China policy. It \nwas wrong before, and it is wrong now.\n  As the editorial points out, Taiwan has been under Beijing's rule \nonly 4 years in the last century.\n  I ask that the New York Times editorial be printed in the Record at \nthis point, and I urge my colleagues to read it, if they have not \nalready.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                            Bullying Taiwan\n\n       China has embarked on an escalating campaign of military \n     maneuvers meant to intimidate Taiwan and undermine its \n     President, Lee Teng-hui. Washington, as much as it wants to \n     calm troubled relations with Beijing, must firmly signal its \n     opposition to this campaign. Ties with China cannot be built \n     on tolerance for provocative displays of military force and \n     efforts to destabilize Taiwan.\n       Last week China began its second missile exercise this \n     summer in the waters surrounding Taiwan. More are planned in \n     the weeks ahead, timed to coincide with the campaign to \n     choose Taiwan's first democratically elected President next \n     March.\n       Mr. Lee, who led Taiwan from dictatorship to democracy \n     after coming to power as the handpicked successor of Chiang \n     Kai-shek and his son, is now the front-runner in that \n     election. But Beijing hopes its military muscle can frighten \n     Taiwan into choosing someone more malleable.\n       Mr. Lee has drawn China's ire by a series by personal \n     visits abroad, most prominently a May trip to attend his \n     college reunion in the United States. Beijing is upset \n     because these actions challenge its contention that Taiwan is \n     an integral part of China and that any separate political \n     identity for Taiwan diminishes China's sovereignty.\n       This ``one-China policy'' had its origins in 1949, when \n     Chiang moved the seat of his defeated Government to Taiwan. \n     From then on, Chiang in Taipei and Mao Zedong in Beijing each \n     insisted his own regime was the legitimate government of \n     China, with authority over both the mainland and Taiwan.\n       When it recognized Chiang, the United States found the one-\n     China formula convenient. When America switched recognition \n     to the Communists in 1979, Beijing insisted that Washington \n     continue to honor the point. The United States therefore has \n     no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.\n       For Beijing, the one-China concept has been the cornerstone \n     of normalized relations with Washington. Tampering with it \n     would throw the entire relationship into turnoil. Yet \n     continued Chinese military provocations could force the \n     United States to re-evaluate its position.\n       While diplomatically convenient, the formula has never \n     corresponded very closely to realty. While most of Taiwan's \n     people are descended from Chinese who migrated there several \n     centuries ago, the island, 100 miles off the Chinese coast, \n     has been under Beijing's direct rule for only four years in \n     the last century.\n  Today Taiwan, with 21 million people, is a prosperous democracy and \nAmerica's seventh-largest trading partner. Though its businessmen have \nstrong economic ties with the mainland, few of its citizens want to \ncome under the rule of the harsh Communist regime in Beijing. But most \nTaiwanese also believe it would be a fatal mistake for Taiwan to \nprovoke China by pushing too hard for the diplomatic trappings of \nindependence.\n  China is trying to intimidate Taiwan into reining in its diplomacy. \nIt is also trying to warn outside powers against \n\n[[Page S 12622]]\ngranting visas to Taiwanese political leaders. That China should be \npressing these positions is not surprising. That it should do so by \nmilitary means, and in the process undermine political stability in \nTaiwan, is disturbing and cannot be ignored.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12621-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12622-S12624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE ACCURACY OF AFDC NUMBERS\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, during the welfare debate on \nAugust 8, I displayed a chart on the floor of this Chamber entitled \n``AFDC Caseload of 10 Largest Cities in the U.S. (1992).'' It showed 62 \npercent of all children in Los Angeles as welfare recipients at some \npoint in 1992, 79 percent in Detroit, on and on. These figures were \nsupplied by the Department of Health and Human Services [HHS].\n  My office provided the chart to the Washington Times at the request \nof its editorial writers. The chart appeared in a Times editorial that \nran last Friday entitled, ``Welfare Shock.'' The numbers, according to \nthe editorial, ``represent a small fraction of the statistical \nindictment against the failed welfare polices of the liberal welfare \nstate.''\n  Regrettably, the numbers from the Department were wrong. On August \n23, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Human Services Policy Wendell E. \nPrimus wrote me to inform me of the error and provided me with new \ndata. It happens that the numerator used was the number of public \nassistance recipients in the surrounding metropolitan statistical areas \n[MSA's], rather than the number of recipients in the cities proper. The \ndenominator, correctly, was the population of each city. I am informed \nby the Department that data on the number of program beneficiaries is \ndifficult to obtain at the city level. The AFDC Program is operated \neither at a State or county level. It was a perfectly honest mistake, \nhonorably acknowledged and corrected.\n  I forwarded the revised numbers to the Washington Times, which \ngraciously ran a follow-up editorial and an explanatory letter from me \nin this morning's edition. The numbers, as the editorial points out, \nwent down for Los Angeles and Detroit, but inched up for New York and \njumped up for Philadelphia. Given the mistake in methodology, I can \nunderstand why the ratios went down for some cities. But I am perplexed \nwhy they climbed for others, including New York. Apparently, we have \nmore work to do. We'll get them right.\n  Today's editorial in the Washington Times, ``Charting the Welfare \nState,'' states that even the lower ratios offer compelling evidence of \nthe complete failure of the current system. I don't disagree. But it \nwould be a huge mistake for the Federal Government to break off its \ncommitment entirely, and we seemed poised to do. If the numbers reveal \nanything that we can understand, it's this: The problem simply has \nbecome too great for the cities to handle on their own. Mr. Hugh Price \nof the Nationals Urban League has recently argued that the welfare \nreform legislation upon which the Senate will take up tomorrow or \nThursday could be a reenactment of the deinstitutionalization of mental \npatients in the 1960's and 1970's which led so directly to the problem \nof the homeless.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter I received \nfrom Deputy Assistant Secretary Primus, the two Washington Times \neditorials, and my letter to the Times appear in the Record following \nmy remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Department of Health and\n\n\n                                               Human Services,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 23, 1995.\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: I very much regret and am deeply \n     embarrassed by the incorrect numbers my office provided to \n     you in response to your request for data on the number of \n     children receiving public assistance in major cities in the \n     United States. I share your passion for data and have \n     published many statistics on welfare during my career. \n     Therefore, I hope you will accept my apologies for this \n     mistake.\n       Unfortunately, there is no good explanation for the error. \n     As you are well aware, we depend upon the states for \n     administrative data concerning AFDC receipt. In most states \n     these statistics are gathered on a county level and are not \n     routinely compiled for other political subdivisions. \n     Estimates on welfare receipt can be made from Census data, \n     but in many cases these data do not correspond to \n     administrative data. In responding to your request, we did \n     not appropriately map administrative data to population \n     counts obtained from the Census Bureau. Revised estimates are \n     enclosed, including a methodological explanation.\n       Again, I am very sorry for providing incorrect data and for \n     any embarrassment it has caused you. I am very aware of how \n     widely you quoted those numbers. Please accept my personal \n     and professional apology.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Wendell E. Primus,\n\n                                        Deputy Assistant Secretary\n                                        for Human Services Policy.\n\n\n notes to tables on rates of public assistance receipt in major cities\n\n       The attached tables present estimates of the number and \n     percentage of persons in major cities who receive Aid to \n     Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Supplemental \n     Security Income (SSI).\n       The AFDC program is operated at either a State or county \n     level. Accordingly, the U.S. Department of Health and Human \n     Services (USDHHS) does not collect data on the number of AFDC \n     recipients by city. In addition, the Social Security \n     Administration keeps data on SSI receipt by State and county, \n     but not by city.\n       Table 1 displays, for the 10 largest cities, the number of \n     AFDC (total and child) and SSI (adult and child) recipients \n     of either the city itself (data permitting) or for the county \n     most closely corresponding to the city. The data are drawn \n     from ``Quarterly Public Assistance Statistics: Fiscal Years \n     1992 and 1993'' (a USDHHS publication) and SSI Recipients by \n     State and County (a Social Security Administration \n     publication) and represent the numbers of AFDC and SSI \n     recipients at a point in time.\n       Data on the number of recipients by program is, as noted \n     above, difficult to obtain at the city level. The decennial \n     Census does contain data by county and city on the number/\n     percentage of households that receive income from any of \n     three public assistance programs (AFDC, SSI or GA) within a \n     year (as opposed to at a point in time). The Census data is \n     not broken down by program; it is not possible to determine \n     from the data how many households received AFDC as opposed to \n     SSI or GA.\n       Note: the decennial Census may undercount the number of \n     public assistance recipients. While undercounting is a \n     problem for the Census as a whole, it is of particular \n     concern with respect to lower-income persons. The degree of \n     undercounting tends to be especially large in the case of \n     poorer residents. The Bureau of the Census employs weighting \n     techniques in order to correct for undercounting; it is not \n     clear if these techniques are completely successful.\n       The Census data can be employed, in conjunction with the \n     information available for the counties corresponding to the \n     major cities, to arrive at estimates by city of the number of \n     recipients in each program. These estimates, found in Table \n     2, are calculated by assuming that for each program (at a \n     point in time) the ratio of recipients in the city to \n     recipients in the county is equal to the ratio of households \n     in the city that received income from any of the three \n     programs to households in the county receiving such income \n     (from the 1990 Census).\n       For example, while there is no data by program for the City \n     of Los Angeles, there is data for Los Angeles County. \n     According to ``Quarterly Public Assistance Statistics,'' \n     there were 784,000 AFDC recipients in Los Angeles County as \n     of February 1993 (see Table 1, column 5, line 2). The 1990 \n     Census found that there were 130,000 households in Los \n     Angeles (city) with public assistance income in 1989 (Table \n     2, column 3, line 2), as opposed to 295,000 in Los Angeles \n     County (Table 1, column 3, line 2), for a ratio of .44 (Table \n     2, column 5, line 2). By applying this ratio to the number of \n     AFDC recipients in Los Angeles County in February 1993, we \n     arrive at an estimate of 350,000 AFDC recipients in Los \n     Angeles (city) as of February 1993 (Table 2, column 6, line \n     2).\n       The tables also contain estimates of the number and \n     percentage of children who receive AFDC and AFDC or SSI over \n     the course of a year, as opposed to at a point in time. These \n     estimates are calculated by assuming that the ratio of child \n     recipients over the course of a year to child recipients at a \n     point in time (for each city) is equal to the nationwide \n     ratio (for all AFDC and GA recipients) from the Survey of \n     Income and Program Participation (Dynamics of Economic Well-\n     Being and Program Participation by the Bureau of the Census).\n\n                              SUMMARY TABLE                             \n[Estimated rates of public assistance receipt: Children in major cities]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   Percent of child population on--     \n                             -------------------------------------------\n                                                     AFDC or            \n            City                AFDC:     AFDC: W/     SSI:     AFDC or \n                               Point in  in a year   Point in  SSI: W/in\n                                 time                  time      a year \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNew York....................         30         39         32         40\nLos Angeles.................         29         38         30         38\nChicago.....................         36         46         38         49\nDetroit.....................         50         67         54         67\nPhiladelphia................         44         57         46         59\nSan Diego...................         23         30         23         30\nHouston.....................         18         22         18         24\nPhoenix.....................         15         18         15         18\nSan Antonio.................         14         21         18         21\n\n\n                                                                        \n\n[[Page S 12623]]\n                        SUMMARY TABLE--Continued                        \n[Estimated rates of public assistance receipt: Children in major cities]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   Percent of child population on--     \n                             -------------------------------------------\n                                                     AFDC or            \n            City                AFDC:     AFDC: W/     SSI:     AFDC or \n                               Point in  in a year   Point in  SSI: W/in\n                                 time                  time      a year \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDallas......................         16         20         16         23\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Given that the actual percentage of county recipients living in a \n  city likely varies by program and may diverge substantially from the  \n  ratio calculated using the 1990 Census data, the figures in Table 2   \n  and in the summary table above should be regarded as relatively rough \n  estimates.                                                            \nCorrection: An error was made in the calculation of earlier estimates   \n  released by the Administration, resulting in inflated figures.

Daniel \n     Patrick Moynihan never has needed hyperbole to describe the \n     dreadful consequences of failed social policies. Perhaps that \n     is because the New York Democrat possesses the uncanny \n     ability to develop or cite pithy statistics that shock even \n     the most jaded welfare analyst, case-worker, senatorial \n     colleague or reporter.\n       Several weeks ago, Sen. Moynihan, appearing on one of the \n     ubiquitous Sunday morning interview shows, shocked his \n     questioners (and, undoubtedly, his television audience) by \n     revealing that nearly two-thirds of the children residing in \n     Los Angeles, the nation's second largest city, lived in \n     families relying on the basic welfare program, Aid to \n     Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). To illustrate that \n     Los Angeles was not unique, he observed that nearly four of \n     every five (!) Detroit children received AFDC benefits.\n       The accompanying chart details the extent to which \n     residents in the 10 largest U.S. cities have become dependent \n     on AFDC--and the government. After about three decades of \n     fighting the War on Poverty, during which time more than $5.4 \n     trillion (in constant 1993 dollars) has been expended, \n     perhaps no single statistic offers more proof of the war's \n     unmitigated failure than the fact that federal and state \n     governments provide the financial support of 38 percent of \n     all children living in the country's 10 largest cities.\n\n     AFDC CASELOAD OF 10 LARGEST CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES (1992)     \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                 As a   \n                                                 Number of    proportion\n                     City                           AFDC        of all  \n                                                  children     children \n                                                              (percent) \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNew York, NY..................................      478,895         28.4\nLos Angeles, CA...............................      534,528         61.8\nChicago, IL...................................      314,706         43.7\nHouston, TX...................................      110,860         24.6\nPhiladelphia, PA..............................      115,697         31.3\nSan Diego, CA.................................      117,197         44.2\nDallas, TX....................................       51,545         20.2\nPhoenix, AZ...................................       66,770         24.3\nDetroit, MI...................................      234,910         78.7\nSan Antonio, TX...............................       52,340         18.6\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Department of Health and Human Services.                        \n\n       How does one begin to address such a horrendous problem? \n     For all the talk among Democrats, particularly President \n     Clinton, about the need for increased spending for education \n     to help underwrite welfare reform, it's worth recalling that \n     real (inflation-adjusted) spending for elementary and \n     secondary education has dramatically escalated since the \n     federal government declared war on poverty. Indeed, some of \n     the highest per pupil expenditures occur in the largest \n     cities. Unfortunately, as spending increased, test scores \n     plummeted.\n       In a more serious tone, Mr. Moynihan approvingly cited the \n     1966 report on the Equality of Educational Opportunity (the \n     Coleman Report), which ``determined that after a point there \n     is precious little association between school resources and \n     school achievement. The resources that matter are those the \n     student brings to the school, including community traditions \n     that value education. Or don't.''\n       Sen. Moynihan has offered his own welfare-reform plan, \n     which, unlike any Republican plan in the House and Senate, \n     would retain AFDC's entitlement status without placing any \n     time restrictions on recipients. Despite the underwhelming \n     success of federal job-training and job-placement programs, \n     his plan places great emphasis on more of the same. Attacking \n     the Republicans' proposals to cancel welfare's entitlement \n     status and enforce time restrictions, Sen. Moynihan frets \n     that ``we don't know enough'' to design programs that attempt \n     to influence the behavior of poor people.\n       Take another look at the figures in the chart provided by \n     the senator. They represent a small fraction of the \n     statistical indictment against the failed welfare policies of \n     the liberal welfare state. Tinkering around the edges of such \n     failure without seeking to change the behavior that three \n     decades of the War on Poverty have produced, will surely not \n     solve any of the many social problems that accompany \n     dependency on the scale depicted in the chart. That much we \n     do know.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Sept. 5, 1995]\n\n                     Charting the State of Welfare\n\n       Even by the appalling standards and results of U.S. welfare \n     policy, the chart that appeared in this space last Friday \n     exaggerated the depths of the situation that prevails in some \n     of this nation's largest cities.\n       Last month Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, New York Democrat, \n     appeared on the floor of the Senate citing statistics showing \n     that nearly two out of three children in Los Angeles and \n     nearly four out of five children in Detroit lived in \n     households receiving the government's basic welfare grant, \n     Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). At the \n     request of The Washington Times' editorial page, Sen. \n     Moynihan's office faxed a copy of a chart listing the 10 \n     largest U.S. cities and the percentage of each city's \n     children relying on AFDC, which was developed by the U.S. \n     Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Regrettably, \n     the information was incorrect.\n       Nearby is a chart with updated, expanded, and presumably \n     correct, information that HHS subsequently sent to Sen. \n     Moynihan's office, which then forwarded it the editorial \n     page. The revised chart offers both as snapshot of welfare \n     dependency of children in our largest cities (at a ``point in \n     time'') and a more expansive statistic incorporating all \n     children whose families relied on AFDC during any portion of \n     an entire year. Clearly, neither classification places Los \n     Angeles or Detroit in nearly as dreadful a position as \n     conveyed by HHS's initial, incorrect tallies. It should also \n     be noted, however that the earlier chart understated the \n     problem of pervasive welfare dependency in other cities: New \n     York and Philadelphia, for example. The revised chart offers \n     no solace to anybody interested in the future of our great \n     cities and the children who live in them.\n\n                    ESTIMATED RATES OF AFDC CASELOADS                   \n                      [In major cities (Feb. 1993)]                     \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                 Percentage   Percentage\n                                                of children  of children\n                     State                       on AFDC at    of AFDC  \n                                                 a point in    within a \n                                                    time         year   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNew York......................................           30           39\nLos Angeles...................................           29           38\nChicago.......................................           36           46\nDetroit.......................................           50           67\nPhiladelphia..................................           44           57\nSan Diego.....................................           23           30\nHouston.......................................           18           22\nPhoenix.......................................           15           18\nSan Antonio...................................           14           21\nDallas........................................           16           20\n                                                                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Department of Health and Human Services.                        \n\n       It's been 30 years since the federal government initiated \n     its so-called War on Poverty. During that time more than $5 \n     trillion was expended fighting it. What has been \n     accomplished? As the Senate reconsiders the various welfare-\n     reform proposals during the next few weeks, let us keep in \n     mind that anything less than revolutionary in scope is likely \n     to have little long-term impact on these depressing \n     statistics and the numerous pathologies and deviancies that \n     derive from them.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Sept. 5, 1995]\n\n             The AFDC Numbers: Bad Enough, But Not That Bad\n\n       Regarding the Sept. 1 editorial ``Welfare shock,'' The \n     Washington Times is entirely correct in stating that the \n     information of AFDC caseloads I presented in the August \n     welfare debate in the Senate was mistaken. We received the \n     data from the Department of Health and Human Services on Aug. \n     4. I found the numbers hard to believe--that bad?--and called \n     the deputy assistant secretary responsible to ask if he would \n     check. He did and called back to confirm.\n       On Aug. 23, however, with the Senate in recess, Mr. Wendell \n     E. Primus, the deputy assistant secretary who provided the \n     data, wrote to say that there had indeed been a \n     miscalculation. It was a perfectly honest mistake, honorably \n     acknowledged and corrected. I will place his letter in the \n     Congressional Record today.\n       The new numbers are sufficiently horrendous. The proportion \n     of the child population on AFDC or Supplemental Security \n     income in the course of a year in Los Angeles is 38 percent. \n     In New York, 40 percent. In Chicago, 49 percent. In \n     Philadelphia, 59 percent. In Detroit, 67 percent. My \n     contention is that things have gotten so out of hand that \n     cities and states cannot possibly handle the problem on their \n     own. Thirty years ago, certainly. No longer. Mr. Hugh Price \n     of the National Urban League suggests that we will see a \n     reenactment of deinstitutionalization of the mental patients \n     which led so directly to the problem of the homeless.

Mr. President, one of the economic leaders in \nthis Nation, with whom I sometimes agree and sometimes disagree, but \nfor whom I have always had great respect is Herbert Stein.\n  Herb Stein is now a senior fellow at the American Enterprise \nInstitute, and recently had an article in the Brookings Institution \npublication titled, ``On Families and Values.''\n  His comments puncture some of our balloons and bring us back to \nreality in a very practical, wholesome way.\n  I ask that his comments be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                         On Families and Values\n\n                           (By Herbert Stein)\n\n       O, Family Values, what wonders are performed in your name! \n     In your name some political leaders propose to give a tax \n     credit of $500 per child to every income-tax-paying unit \n     except the very richest. I use the expression ``income-tax-\n     paying unit'' because no particular family relationship is \n     required. There may be a couple, married or unmarried, or \n     there may be a single tax-payer, male or female, and the \n     children may have a biological relationship to both adults, \n     to one, or to neither. At the same time, also in the name of \n     family values, it is proposed to reduce federal benefits to \n     mother-children units if the mother is young and poor.\n       We do not have a family problem in America, or, at least, \n     that is not one of our major problems. We have a children \n     problem. Too many of our children are growing up uncivilized. \n     The family deserves attention today mainly because it is the \n     best institution for civilizing children. We shouldn't get \n     too sentimental about that, however. Through most of history \n     the family that reared children was not our idealized Poppy-\n     Mommy-Kiddies group but a much more inclusive relationship. \n     The first family was the scene of a fratricide. The most \n     famous families in literature, the Montagues and Capulets, \n     were obsessed with fighting each other, with fatal \n     consequences for their children. Long before Freud we knew \n     that the family could be a nest of vipers.\n       Despite its blemishes, perhaps exaggerated in literature \n     because they are exceptional, the family is the best \n     institution we know for rearing children. It is the best \n     because it is most likely to be governed by certain values--\n     love, responsibility, voluntary commitment to the welfare of \n     others, including those least able to fend for themselves, \n     who are, of course, the children. That is what family \n     values are.\n       In the rearing of children there is no satisfactory \n     substitute for the well-functioning family. We should try to \n     strengthen such families by private example, public policy, \n     and in any other way we can. But even families that function \n     well need supplementation by other institutions. Some \n     families do not function well, for economic or psychological \n     reasons, and they need even more assistance. In modern \n     societies it is recognized that other institutions have a \n     responsibility and capacity to contribute to the raising of \n     children. These institutions include government, whose wide-\n     ranging functions, from education to preventing child abuse, \n     are generally accepted.\n       Moreover, there are really no such things as ``family \n     values.'' What we call family values are simply human values \n     that also exist and are desired in relationships outside the \n     family although they are probably less dominant there.\n       Our need now is to bring what institutions, resources, and \n     values we can to bear on the problem of our children. From \n     that standpoint the current trend of policy seems perverse. \n     The ``child credit'' has little to do with the welfare of \n     children. Very few of the children in the tax-paying-units \n     that would receive the credit are part of the children \n     problem in America, or if they are it is not because the \n     after-tax incomes in the units are too small. Little of the \n     income that would be provided would go to the benefit of \n     children. Presumably the additional income would be used for \n     purposes that the taxpayer had previously thought were of \n     lowest priority. Any need of a child that a taxpayer with \n     an income of, say, $60,000 would meet only upon receipt of \n     a tax credit of $500 could not be a very important need.\n       Neither is it reasonable to think that reducing government \n     cash and food benefits to poor children who are themselves \n     the children of poor child-mothers will help to civilize our \n     children, although it may reduce somewhat the number of them \n     born in the future. More care, nurturing, counselling, and \n     education will be needed, in the home, in a foster-home, in a \n     school, perhaps even in an orphanage. The drive to cut costs \n     in the name of family values provides none of that.\n       When I say that ``our'' children need to be civilized, I do \n     not refer to my biological children and grandchildren, or \n     yours either, dear reader. I refer to America's children. \n     When the bomb exploded in Oklahoma City we all went and \n     prayed for the children. We did not say that they were only \n     their parents' children or Oklahoma's children. They were \n     America's children.\n       The children growing up in wretched families, in unsafe \n     schools, and in vicious streets are also ``our'' children. A \n     decent respect for family values calls for more concern with \n     them and more commitment to them than is shown by most of \n     those who now wave the flag of family values.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12624-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             LARRY DeNARDIS\n\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Larry \nDeNardis who on September 22, 1995, will be the recipient of the \nDistinguished Service Award of the Italian-American Society of Greater \nNew Haven, Inc. The Italian-American Society was founded to celebrate \nand perpetuate the concept of the Italian heritage in America, and the \nsociety strives to acknowledge and commemorate the many contributions \nmade by Italian-Americans.\n  Lawrence J. DeNardis was born and raised in New Haven, where he \ncurrently serves as the president of the University of New Haven [UNH]. \nLarry is well known in both the academic and public service arenas. His \nacademic experience includes 16 years as associate professor and \nchairman of political science at Albertus Magnus College and 11 years \nas an adjunct professor at UNH. He has also been a visiting professor \nof government at Connecticut College, a guest scholar at the Woodrow \nWilson International Center for Scholars of the Smithsonian \nInstitution, and a seminar instructor at Yale University.\n  In the field of government, Larry DeNardis has had the rare and \nnotable distinction of serving as both a Federal and State legislator. \nAfter serving five terms in the State Senate from 1971-79, where I was \nproud to serve with him, Larry was elected to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives from Connecticut's Third District in 1980. I should \nnote here that Larry's elevation to Federal office came at my expense--\nI was on the losing end of that Congressional campaign. But in \nretrospect, I am grateful for his victory, since it opened the door for \nme to serve as Connecticut attorney general and in this Chamber. Larry \nserved ably and honorably in Congress and then went on to serve as \nAssistant Secretary for Legislation at the U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services during 1985-86.\n  Larry continues to reside in the New Haven area, where he is \ncurrently an active member of many organizations including the Greater \nNew Haven Chamber of Commerce, Shubert Performing Arts Center, Mayor's \nTask Force on Transportation, Yale Medical School Library, St. Regis \nHealth Center, and the Knights of Malta. He and his high school \nsweetheart, Mary Lou, have been married for 34 years and have four \nchildren: Larry Jr., Mark, Lesley, and Gregory and reside in Hamden, \nCT. Larry's work and commitment has been an inspiration to those who \nknow him. I am proud to count him as a friend. I salute the Honorable \nLawrence J. DeNardis as he accepts the Distinguished Service Award of \nthe Italian-American Society for his decency, intelligence, and \nsteadfast devotion to the community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12624-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12624-S12625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRANSRACIAL ADOPTIONS IN THE CHILDREN'S BEST INTERESTS\n\n   Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, some weeks ago, the magazine Black \nIssues in Higher Education, which I read regularly for its scholarly \nand sensitive insights into higher education, had an article on \ntransracial adoptions written by Dr. Rita J. Simon--no relative, a \nprofessor of law at the American University.\n  I have a special interest in this field because of some family \ninvolvement in the area, but what she writes makes so much sense that I \nthought this area in which there is sometimes more heat \n\n[[Page S 12625]]\nthan light, needs to see this issue more widely understood.\n  I ask that the article be printed in the Record, and I urge my \ncolleagues to read it.\n  The article follows:\n\n          [From Black Issues in Higher Education, May 4, 1995]\n\n        Transracial Adoptions--In the Children's Best Interests\n\n                         (By Dr. Rita J. Simon)\n\n       The case for transracial adoption rests primarily on the \n     results of empirical research. The data show that transracial \n     adoptions clearly satisfy the ``best interest of the child'' \n     standard. They show that transracial adoptees grow up \n     emotionally and socially adjusted, aware of and comfortable \n     with their racial identity. They perceive themselves as \n     integral parts of their adopted families, and they expect to \n     retain strong ties to their parents and siblings in the \n     future.\n       The findings in our study are neither unique or unusual. \n     All of the studies--even those carried out by researchers who \n     were initially skeptical--arrived at the same general \n     conclusions.\n       Indeed, when given the opportunity to express their views \n     on transracial adoption, most people--Black and white--\n     support it. For example, in January 1991, ``CBS This \n     Morning'' reported the results of a poll it conducted that \n     asked 975 adults, ``Should race be a factor in adoption?'' \n     Seventy percent of white Americans said no, and 71 percent of \n     African Americans said no. These percentages are the same as \n     those reported by Gallup in 1971 when it asked a national \n     sample the same question.\n\n\n                        the simon-altstein study\n\n       In 1971-72, Simon contacted 206 families living in five \n     cities in the Midwest who were members of the Open Door \n     Society and the Council on Adoptable Children (COAC) and \n     asked whether she could interview them about their decision \n     to adopt nonwhite children. All of the families but two \n     (which declined for reasons unrelated to adoption) agreed to \n     participate in the study. The parents allowed a two-person \n     team composed of one male and one female graduate student to \n     interview them in their homes for 60 to 90 minutes at the \n     same time that each of their children, who were between four \n     and eight years old, was being interviewed for about 30 \n     minutes. In total, 204 parents and 366 children were \n     interviewed.\n       The number of children per family in our surveys ranged \n     from one to seven; this included birth as well as adopted \n     children. Nineteen percent of the parents did not have any \n     birth children. All of those families reported that they were \n     unable to bear children.\n       The most important finding that emerged from our first \n     encounter with the families in 1971-72 was the absence of a \n     white racial preference or bias on the part of the white \n     birth children and the nonwhite adopted children. All of the \n     children (adopted and birth) had been given a series of \n     projective tests including the Kenneth Clark doll tests, \n     puzzles, pictures etc., that sought to assess racial \n     awareness, attitudes and identity.\n       Unlike all other previous doll studies, our respondents did \n     not favor the white doll. It was not considered smarter, \n     prettier, nicer, etc., than the Black doll either by white or \n     Black children. Neither did the other tests conducted during \n     the same time period reveal preferences for white or negative \n     reactions to Black. Yet the Black and white children in our \n     study accurately identified themselves as white or Black on \n     those same tests.\n       Thus, contrary to other findings reported up to that time, \n     the children reared in these homes appeared indifferent to \n     the advantages of being white, but aware of and comfortable \n     with the racial identity imposed by their outward appearance. \n     By and large, the parents of these children were confident \n     that the atmosphere, the relationships, the values and the \n     lifestyle to which the children were being exposed would \n     enable successful personal adjustments as adults.\n       Over the years, we continued to ask about and measure \n     racial attitudes, racial awareness and racial identity among \n     the adopted and birth children. We also questioned the \n     parents during the first three phases of the study about the \n     activities, if any, in which they as a family, engaged to \n     enhance their transracial adoptee's racial awareness and \n     racial identity. We heard about dinner-time conversations \n     involving racial issues, watching the TV series ``Roots,'' \n     joining Black churches, seeking Black godparents, preparing \n     Korean food, traveling to Native American festivals and \n     related initiatives. As the years progressed, it was the \n     children, rather than the parents, who were more likely to \n     want to call a halt to these types of activities.\n       ``Not every dinner conversation has to be a lesson in Black \n     history,'' or ``we are more interested in basketball and \n     football than ceremonial dances'' were comments we heard \n     frequently from transracial adoptees as they were growing up.\n       In the 1991 phase of the study, transracial adoptees were \n     asked how they felt about the practice of placing nonwhite--\n     especially Black--children in white homes, what \n     recommendations they might have about adoption practices and \n     what advice they might have for white parents who are \n     considering transracial adoption. We also asked the \n     respondents to evaluate their own experience with transracial \n     adoption.\n       We opened the topic by stating, ``You have probably heard \n     of the position taken by the National Association of Black \n     Social Workers (NABSW) and several councils of Native \n     Americans strongly opposing transracial adoption. Do you \n     agree or disagree with their position?'' All of the \n     respondents were aware of NABSW's position. Eighty percent of \n     the adoptees and 70 percent of the birth children disagreed \n     with the NABSW position. Among the latter, 17 percent agreed \n     and 13 percent were not sure. Only 5 percent of the \n     transracial adoptees agreed with NABSW's position; the others \n     were not sure how they felt about the issue. The reasons most \n     often given for why they disagreed were that ``racial \n     differences are not crucial,'' ``TRA is the best practical \n     alternative,'' and ``having a loving, secure relationship in \n     a family setting is all-important.''\n       One Black male adoptee said, ``My parents have never been \n     racist. They took shit for adopting two Black kids. I'm proud \n     of them for it. The Black Social Workers' Association \n     promotes a separatist ideology.''\n       Another Black female commented, ``It's a crock--it's just \n     ridiculous. They [the NABSW] should be happy to get families \n     for these children--period. My parents made sure we grew up \n     in a racially diverse neighborhood. Now I am fully \n     comfortable with who I am.''\n       Another commented, ``I feel lucky to have been adopted when \n     I was very young [24 days]. I was brought up to be \n     selfconfident--to be the best I can. I was raised in an \n     honest environment.\n       We then shifted to a more personal note: ``How do you think \n     being Black (or, where appropriate, Korean or Native \n     American) and raised by white parents has affected how you \n     perceive yourself today?'' One-third of the transracial \n     adoptees thought the adoption had a positive effect on their \n     self-image. One-third thought it had no effect, and one-third \n     did not know what effect the adoption had on their self-\n     image.\n       One male adoptee said, ``Multicultural attitudes develop \n     better children. I was brought up without prejudice. The \n     experience is fulfilling and enriching for parents and \n     children.''\n       The results of 20 years of study show that transracial \n     adoptions serve the children's best interests. None of the \n     families aborted any of their adoptions. As they moved from \n     childhood to adolescence to adulthood, the transracial \n     adoptees were clearly aware of and comfortable with their \n     racial identity. Today, those who are Black laugh at being \n     labeled ``oreos,'' Black on the outside, white on the inside, \n     by some members of the National Association of Black Social \n     Workers. The Black adoptees stress their comfort with their \n     identity and their awareness that although they may speak, \n     dress, and have different tastes in music than some other \n     Blacks, the African American is wonderfully diverse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12624-4", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12625-S12627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nMRS. CLINTON'S SPEECH TO THE UNITED NATIONS FOURTH WORLD CONFERENCE ON \n                                 WOMEN\n\n   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, earlier today, First Lady \nHillary Rodham Clinton spoke at the United Nations Fourth World \nConference on Women. I urge my colleagues to read this important and \nthoughtful speech.\n  The First Lady spoke eloquently about the main themes of the \nConference--women's education, health care, economic empowerment and \nhuman rights. These are issues that matter to every family in America \nand around the world. If we don't address these issues, all our talk \nabout family values is meaningless.\n  In addition, Mrs. Clinton did not shy away from addressing China's \nserious human rights violations--or their meddling in the content and \nmanagement of the Conference.\n  I commend the First Lady for participating in this important \nConference and ask that her speech be printed in the Record.\n  The speech follows:\n\n  First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's Remarks for the United Nations \n                    Fourth World Conference on Women\n\n\n                   beijing, china, september 5, 1995\n\n       Mrs. Mongella, distinguished delegates and guests:\n       I would like to thank the Secretary General of the United \n     Nations for inviting me to be part of the United Nations \n     Fourth World Conference on Women. This is truly a \n     celebration--a celebration of the contributions women make in \n     every aspect of life: in the home, on the job, in their \n     communities, as mothers, wives, sisters, daughters, learners, \n     workers, citizens and leaders.\n       It is also a coming together, much the way women come \n     together every day in every country.\n       We come together in fields and in factories. In village \n     markets and supermarkets. In living rooms and board rooms.\n       Whether it is while playing with our children in the park, \n     or washing clothes in a river, or taking a break at the \n     office water cooler, we come together and talk about our \n     aspirations and concerns. And time and again, our talk turns \n     to our children and our families.\n       However different we may be, there is far more that unites \n     us than divides us. We \n\n[[Page S 12626]]\n     share a common future. And we are here to find common ground so that we \n     may help bring new dignity and respect to women and girls all \n     over the world--and in so doing, bring new strength and \n     stability to families as well.\n       By gathering in Beijing, we are focusing world attention on \n     issues that matter most in the lives of women and their \n     families: access to education, health care, jobs, and credit, \n     the chance to enjoy basic legal and human rights and \n     participate fully in the political life of their countries.\n       There are some who question the reason for this conference. \n     Let them listen to the voices of women in their homes, \n     neighborhoods, and workplaces.\n       There are some who wonder whether the lives of women and \n     girls matter to economic and political progress around the \n     globe. . . . Let them look at the women gathered here and at \n     Hairou . . . the homemakers, nurses, teachers, lawyers, \n     policymakers, and women who run their own businesses.\n       It is conferences like this that compel governments and \n     peoples everywhere to listen, look and face the world's most \n     pressing problems.\n       Wasn't it after the women's conference in Nairobi ten years \n     ago that the world focused for the first time on the crisis \n     of domestic violence?\n       Earlier today, I participated in a World Health \n     Organization forum, where government officials, NGOs, and \n     individual citizens are working on ways to address the health \n     problems of women and girls.\n       Tomorrow, I will attend a gathering of the United Nations \n     Development Fund for Women. There, the discussion will focus \n     on local--and highly successful--programs that give hard-\n     working women access to credit so they can improve their own \n     lives and the lives of their families.\n       What we are leaning around the world is that, if women are \n     healthy and educated, their families will flourish. If women \n     are free from violence, their families will flourish. If \n     women have a chance to work and earn as full and equal \n     partners in society, their families will flourish.\n       And when families flourish, communities and nations will \n     flourish.\n       That is why every woman, every man, every child every \n     family, and every nation on our planet has a stake in the \n     discussion that takes place here.\n       Over the past 25 years, I have worked persistently on \n     issues relating to women, children and families. Over the \n     past two-and-a-half years, I have had the opportunity to \n     learn more about the challenges facing women in my own \n     country and around the world.\n       I have met new mothers in Jojakarta, Indonesia, who come \n     together regularly in their village to discuss nutrition, \n     family planning, and baby care.\n       I have met working parents in Denmark who talk about the \n     comfort they feel in knowing that their children can be cared \n     for in creative, safe, and nurturing after-school centers.\n       I have met women in South Africa who helped lead the \n     struggle to end apartheid and are now helping build a new \n     democracy.\n       I have met with the leading women of the Western Hemisphere \n     who are working every day to promote literacy and better \n     health care for the children of their countries.\n       I have met women in India and Bangladesh who are taking out \n     small loans to buy milk cows, rickshaws, thread and other \n     materials to create a livelihood for themselves and their \n     families.\n       I have met doctors and nurses in Belarus and Ukraine who \n     are trying to keep children alive in the aftermath of \n     Chernobyl.\n       The great challenge of this conference is to give voice to \n     women everywhere whose experiences go unnoticed, whose words \n     go unheard.\n       Women comprise more than half the world's population. Women \n     are 70% of the world's poor, and two-thirds of those who are \n     not taught to read and write.\n       Women are the primary caretakers for most of the world's \n     children and elderly. Yet much of the work we do is not \n     valued--not by economists, not by historians, not by popular \n     culture, not by government leaders.\n       At this very moment, as we sit here, women around the world \n     are giving birth, raising children, cooking meals, washing \n     clothes, cleaning houses, planting crops, working on assembly \n     lines, running companies, and running countries.\n       Women also are dying from diseases that should have been \n     prevented or treated; they are watching their children \n     succumb to malnutrition caused by poverty and economic \n     deprivation; they are being denied the right to go to school \n     by their own fathers and brothers; they are being forced into \n     prostitution, and they are being barred from the ballot box \n     and the bank lending office.\n       Those of us who have the opportunity to be here have the \n     responsibility to speak for those who could not.\n       As an American, I want to speak up for women in my own \n     country--women who are raising children on the minimum wage, \n     women who can't afford health care or child care, women whose \n     lives are threatened by violence, including violence in their \n     own homes.\n       I want to speak up for mothers who are fighting for good \n     schools, safe neighborhoods, clean air and clean airwaves .  \n     .  .  for older women, some of them widows, who have raised \n     their families and now find that their skills and life \n     experiences are not valued in the workplace .  .  .  for \n     women who are working all night as nurses hotel clerks, and \n     fast food chiefs so that they can be at home during the day \n     with their kids .  .  .  and for women everywhere who simply \n     don't have time to do everything they are called upon to do \n     each day.\n       Speaking to you today, I speak for them, just as each of us \n     speaks for women around the world who are denied the chance \n     to go to school, or see a doctor, or own property, or have a \n     say about the direction of their lives, simply because they \n     are women.\n       The truth is that most women around the world work both \n     inside and outside the home, usually by necessity.\n       We need to understand that there is no formula for how \n     women should lead their lives. That is why we must respect \n     the choices that each woman makes for herself and her family. \n     Every woman deserves the chance to realize her God-given \n     potential.\n       We also must recognize that women will never gain full \n     dignity until this human rights are respected and protected.\n       Our goals for this conference, to strengthen families and \n     societies by empowering women to take greater control over \n     their own destinies, cannot be fully achieved unless all \n     governments--here and around the world--accept their \n     responsibility to protect and promote internationally \n     recognized human rights.\n       The international community has long acknowledged--and \n     recently affirmed at Vienna--that both women and men are \n     entitled to a range of protections and personal freedoms, \n     from the right of personal security to the right to determine \n     freely the number and spacing of the children they bear.\n       No one should be forced to remain silent for fear of \n     religious or political persecution, arrest, abuse or torture.\n       Tragically, women are most often the ones whose human \n     rights are violated. Even in the late 20th century, the rape \n     of women continues to be used as an instrument of armed \n     conflict. Women and children make up a large majority of the \n     world's refugees. And when women are excluded from the \n     political process, they become even more vulnerable to abuse.\n       I believe that, on the eve of a new millennium, it is time \n     to break our silence. It is time for us to say here in \n     Beijing, and the world to hear, that it is no longer \n     acceptable to discuss women's rights as separate from human \n     rights.\n       These abuses have continued because, for too long, the \n     history of women has been a history of silence. Even today, \n     there are those who are trying to silence our words.\n       The voices of this conference and of the women at \n     Hairou must be heard loud and clear:\n       It is a violation of human rights when babies are denied \n     food, or drowned, or suffocated, or their spines broken, \n     simply because they are born girls.\n       It is a violation of human rights when women and girls are \n     sold into the slavery of prostitution.\n       It is a violation of human rights when women are doused \n     with gasoline, set on fire and burned to death because their \n     marriage dowries are deemed too small.\n       It is a violation of human rights when individual women are \n     raped in their own communities and when thousands of women \n     are subjected to rape as a tactic or prize of war.\n       It is a violation of human rights when a leading cause of \n     death worldwide among women ages 14 to 44 is the violence \n     they are subjected to in their own homes.\n       It is a violation of human rights when young girls are \n     brutalized by the painful and degrading practice of genital \n     mutilation.\n       It is a violation of human rights when women are denied the \n     right to plan their own families, and that includes being \n     forced to have abortions or being sterilized against their \n     will.\n       If there is one message that echoes forth from this \n     conference, it is that human rights are women's rights. . . . \n     And women's rights are human rights.\n       Let us not forget that among those rights are the right to \n     speak freely. And the right to be heard.\n       Women must enjoy the right to participate fully in the \n     social and political lives of their countries if we want \n     freedom and democracy to thrive and endure.\n       It is indefensible that many women in non-governmental \n     organizations who wished to participate in this conference \n     have not been able to attend--or have been prohibited from \n     fully taking part.\n       Let me be clear. Freedom means the right of people to \n     assemble, organize, and debate openly. It means respecting \n     the views of those who may disagree with the views of their \n     governments. It means not taking citizens away from their \n     loved ones and jailing them, mistreating them, or denying \n     them their freedom or dignity because of the peaceful \n     expression of their ideas and opinions.\n       In my country, we recently celebrated the 75th anniversary \n     of women's suffrage. It took 150 years after the signing of \n     our Declaration of Independence for women to win the right to \n     vote. It took 72 years of organized struggle on the part of \n     many courageous women and men.\n       It was one of America's most divisive philosophical wars. \n     But it was also a bloodless war. Suffrage was achieved \n     without a shot fired.\n       We have also been reminded, in V-J Day observances last \n     weekend, of the good that comes when men and women join \n     together to combat the forces of tyranny and build a better \n     world.\n\n[[Page S 12627]]\n\n       We have seen peace prevail in most places for a half \n     century. We have avoided another world war.\n       But we have not solved older, deeply-rooted problems that \n     continue to diminish the potential of half the world's \n     population.\n       Now it is time to act on behalf of women everywhere.\n       If we take bold steps to better the lives of women, we will \n     be taking bold steps to better the lives of children and \n     families too. Families rely on mothers and wives for \n     emotional support and care; families rely on women for labor \n     in the home; and increasingly, families rely on women for \n     income needed to raise healthy children and care for other \n     relatives.\n       As long as discrimination and inequities remain so \n     commonplace around the world--as long as girls and women are \n     valued less, fed less, fed last, overworked, underpaid, not \n     schooled and subjected to violence in and out of their \n     homes--the potential of the human family to create a \n     peaceful, prosperous world will not be realized.\n       Let this conference be our--and the world's--call to \n     action.\n       And let us heed the call so that we can create a world in \n     which every woman is treated with respect and dignity, every \n     boy and girl is loved and cared for equally, and every family \n     has the hope of a strong and stable future.\n       Thank you very much.\n       God's blessings on you, your work and all who will benefit \n     from it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12625-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IT'S NOT FOR WHITE MEN TO DECIDE\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, we have heard a lot of talk about \naffirmative action, much of it designed to attract votes rather than to \ncontribute any light or rational discussion.\n  Recently, I was on a radio discussion program with our former \ncollege, Pete Wilson, now the Governor of California. His position is \none that I am sure is supported by a majority of Republicans and may be \ntemporarily politically wise. But I do not believe it serves the Nation \nwell.\n  In an appearance on the David Brinkley program, he quoted Arthur \nSchlesinger, Jr. It was of interest to me then to pick up the Los \nAngeles Times and read Arthur Schlesinger's response.\n  Like most things Arthur Schlesinger writes, it is loaded with good \nsense, and I ask that his response be printed in the Record.\n  The response follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Aug. 3, 1995]\n\n                    It's Not for White Men To Decide\n\n                      (By Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.)\n\n       On Sunday, July 23, while I was befogged in Dark Harbor, \n     Me., Gov. Pete Wilson of California seemed even more befogged \n     on ``This Week With David Brinkley.'' On this program, he \n     cited me and my small book ``The Disuniting of America'' in \n     support of his crusade against affirmative action. \n     ``[Schlesinger] uses a phrase,'' Wilson said, ``that various \n     policies are, in fact, tribalizing America, and, in fact, \n     that is unhappily the case, and we need to end it.''\n       Wilson is quite correct in noting my concern about the \n     campaign by ``multicultural'' ideologues to promote and \n     perpetuate separate ethnic and racial communities. But he is \n     quite wrong in suggesting that I am, for that reason, opposed \n     to affirmative action. On the contrary, affirmative action \n     has been, in my view, a valuable and potent means of moving \n     the republic away from ethnic and racial separatism and \n     toward a more integrated and unified society.\n       Before affirmative action, the labor market and the \n     educational system were encrusted with barriers, antipathies \n     and conditioned reflexes that systematically excluded women \n     and non-white minorities. Affirmative action has played an \n     indispensable role in breaking these terribly well-entrenched \n     patterns in employment, college admission and other arenas of \n     recruitment and upward mobility. The goal of affirmative \n     action is precisely to destroy racial and gender barriers; \n     and it is the free intermingling of peoples that provides \n     that basis for a common culture and an embracing national \n     identity.\n       Unquestionably, some reforms are in order. Rigid \n     application of ``diversity'' standards often leads to bad \n     results, especially in government employment. Programs \n     carried out in the name of affirmative action, especially \n     preferences for what purport to be minority business \n     enterprises, have been sorely abused. Still, affirmative \n     action in the main has served as an agency for the uniting, \n     not the disuniting, of America.\n       I regard affirmative action as a transitional program. I do \n     not expect it to become a permanent feature of the labor \n     market. When should the transition end? It should end when \n     our white male ruling class no longer automatically \n     discriminates against women and against nonwhite minorities. \n     And the decision as to when the point is reached surely \n     belongs to those whose needs affirmative action is intended \n     to meet.\n       Already some beneficiaries are growing increasingly uneasy. \n     Affirmative action seems to cast doubt on their own \n     credentials, competence and worth. They have become partners \n     in the firm or professors in the university, others might \n     think, not on their merits but because of racial or gender \n     preference.\n       Affirmative action can thus become a means of undermining \n     self-esteem and dignity. It can imply that, without \n     affirmative action, women and minorities could not survive \n     and compete in the world of affairs. It may carry with it a \n     flavor of condescension and patronage. And it inevitably and \n     understandably arouses the resentment of those who feel that \n     affirmative action discriminates against them.\n       When enough beneficiaries regard affirmative action with \n     embarrassment and discomfort, the time will have come to roll \n     up the policy. And the more white male America practices \n     policies of inclusion rather than exclusion, the sooner that \n     time will come.\n       But until women and nonwhite minorities see affirmative \n     action as more a handicap than a help, the case for its \n     continuation in some form seems strong. And surely the \n     decision about continuation is not one to be made for hapless \n     minorities by politically ambitious white governors. Such \n     overweening presumption by powerful white men is the true \n     road to the disuniting of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12627-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN HONOR OF KITE SOCIETY OF WISCONSIN WEEK\n\n Mr. KOHL.

Mr. President, one of the most thoughtful observers \nin the Nation today is Felix Rohatyn, an investment banker, who has had \nconsiderable leadership experience at both the local, State, and \nFederal levels.\n  He was chairman of New York's Municipal Assistance Corp., from 1975 \nto 1993 and helped put the pieces together when New York City was in \nsuch desperate straits.\n  He had an article recently in the Washington Post that comments \nspecifically about the District of Columbia and New York City, but it \nis really much more than that. He is really talking about what our \npriorities are as a Nation and what we must do to revitalize urban \nAmerican and revitalize the Nation.\n  To the timid souls in the House and Senate and the administration who \nare afraid to face our problems and come up with realistic answers to \nthose problems, because realistic answers are not going to be \nimmediately popular, I would note his comment:\n\n       Many of our actions were deemed to be political suicide \n     when first considered, but it is worth noting that Governor \n     Carey's approval rating was the highest ever in December 1975 \n     when we had carried out the most painful parts of the \n     restructuring.\n\n  The American public yearns for genuine leadership, not public \nrelations talk. Instead to much too great a degree, we are providing \nthe public relations talk but not genuine leadership.\n  I ask that the Felix Rohatyn article be printed in the Record, and I \nurge my colleagues to read it.\n  The article follows:\n\nBig Mac To Go; Hold the Lies; New York's Recipe for Recovery--and What \n                         D.C. Can Take From It\n\n                           (By Felix Rohatyn)\n\n       Watching the evolution of the District of Columbia's fiscal \n     crisis inevitably brings to many of us here in New York City \n     memories of our own brush with bankruptcy in the 1970s. There \n     are too many differences between our situation 20 years ago \n     and the District's today to draw direct parallels. Still, \n     there are lessons in our successes--and in our failures--that \n     may provide some useful insights to those trying to direct \n     the District's future.\n\n[[Page S 12628]]\n\n       The first of those lessons is that recovery was not rapid \n     and--for reasons both of our own making and beyond our \n     control--it was not permanent. It took New York City almost \n     six years from the time we lost access to the financial \n     markets in 1975 until we regained it in 1981, having balanced \n     three consecutive budgets in the meantime. Now, 14 years \n     later, New York City is again in the throes of a serious \n     budgetary crisis which shows no signs of early resolution.\n       To the extent that we succeeded, much is owed to a few \n     factors: putting able and responsive people into top city \n     management positions; enlisting the cooperative efforts of \n     all parties--state and city officials, labor, business--who \n     contributed to the problem in the first place; getting \n     financial controls into place; building public support for \n     the tough actions needed; securing help from higher levels of \n     government. To the extent we failed, it was because we relied \n     too much on stopgap measures and postponed structural reforms \n     needed to secure the city's future. There are caveats for the \n     District in all this.\n       Many of the forces that drove New York City towards \n     bankruptcy in the '70s are not unlike those that now cast a \n     shadow over the District's, and, indeed, the entire country's \n     future: excessive borrowings, escalating budget deficits, \n     excessive public spending and shrinking private employment, \n     compounded by weak political leadership. Just as the \n     District's problems had been building for many years, under \n     the nose of the mayor, city council and their federal \n     overseers on Capitol Hill, New York's crisis was obscured for \n     many years by imaginative bookkeeping and by lenders who \n     looked the other way.\n       By May 1975, when the banks refused to provide additional \n     loans to the city, short-term debt had climbed from \n     practically nothing six years earlier to almost $6 billion. \n     (In each of those years the city's budget was reported to \n     miraculously, ``in balance.'') The city work force had \n     ballooned to 300,000 people while private employment (and tax \n     revenues) plummeted during the recession of the early 1970s. \n     When newly elected Gov. Hugh Carey, formerly a liberal \n     Democratic congressman from Brooklyn, appointed four private \n     citizens (including me) to recommend a course of action, we \n     were 18 days away from a default and a bankruptcy filing.\n       During the next six months, we put in place practically \n     every new structure and agreement that served as the ultimate \n     cornerstone to our recovery. Some survive to this day. These \n     were the main components:\n       Getting control. In this and many other instances, strong \n     bipartisan leadership at the state level was crucial, support \n     that the District must look to the federal level to supply. \n     Under great pressure from the governor, practically the \n     entire top management of the city was replaced, including the \n     first deputy mayor, budget director, and deputy mayors for \n     finance and operations. All but one of the new appointees \n     came from the private sector. They, together with the \n     executive director of the Emergency Financial Control Board \n     (EFCB), constituted as capable a management team as the city \n     ever had.\n       The EFCB, analogous to D.C.'s new financial control board, \n     consisted of the governor, mayor, city and state comptrollers \n     and three private citizens appointed by the governor. It had \n     the power to set the level of city revenues and to reject any \n     budget submitted by the mayor not in compliance with the \n     long-term plan. All major city contracts, including labor \n     contracts, were subject to its approval. Once these control \n     structures were in place after the usual political struggles, \n     we had total cooperation from city officials--including Mayor \n     Abraham Beame, despite the high cost to his political career.\n       The EFCB's veto power and the shared commitment of top city \n     management meant that it was possible to translate the \n     requirements of the approved budget plan into actual savings. \n     It is always easy to demand or promise cuts on paper; it is \n     much harder to pocket them. This is especially true if, as \n     some in the District are urging, reliance is placed on the \n     voluntary response of city workers to accept buyouts or on \n     privatization to cut costs and payrolls.\n       Getting the facts. We knew the numbers we were working with \n     were meaningless and that we needed a factual basis for any \n     long-term plan. It took many months, but ultimately the city, \n     with the help of outside experts, put in place a system of \n     financial controls and accounting second to none.\n       Just as the true dimensions of the District's fiscal gap \n     were revealed only over a period of months, New York City's \n     1975 deficit turned out to be almost triple the initial \n     estimate--close to $1.5 billion on a total budget of about \n     $13 billion (including about $600 million of expenses buried \n     in the capital budget).\n       Negotiating a social contract between business and labor. \n     Key to our success was enlisting the help of those who had \n     created the problem. The city's labor and business \n     leaderships (including the banks), as well as the state and \n     city themselves, provided a relatively small number of people \n     who could make commitments on behalf of their constituents \n     and deliver them.\n       Having a common goal was important; carrying it out was \n     agonizingly difficult. The ``social contract'' provided labor \n     support for deferring all wage increases, at no interest \n     cost, and a minimum 6 percent attrition rate. Ultimately \n     60,000 workers, 20 percent of the work force, went off the \n     payroll through layoffs or attrition. Pension benefits were \n     rolled back, while union pension funds purchased $2.5 billion \n     of city bonds (which proved a good investment for retirees).\n       Just as the District is beginning to do, we looked hard at \n     city functions to see which were essential and which we could \n     live without. Tuition was imposed, for the first time, at \n     City University. Transit fares were doubled. Services were \n     sharply cut, with the worst impact borne by the school \n     system. Rigid cost controls were imposed. Taxes were \n     temporarily increased.\n       The banks, in turn, supported creation of the Municipal \n     Assistance Corp., a state agency directed by a board of nine \n     private citizens and authorized to issue up to $10 billion of \n     long-term bonds, backed by a portion of the city sales tax. \n     MAC financed the phaseout of the city deficit by 1980, as \n     well as a dramatic increase in the city's infrastructure \n     investment by 1985.\n       All of these actions resulted from difficult and often \n     acrimonious negotiations. For example, after the initial wave \n     of 20,000 layoff notices, striking sanitation workers \n     disrupted the city and greeted arriving passengers at Kennedy \n     Airport with signs saying: ``Welcome to Stink City.'' This \n     scared the mayor into rehiring a number of workers--which, in \n     turn, caused financing for MAC's first private market bond \n     offering to collapse. Still, we were able to stop the \n     bleeding.\n       Getting outside help. For all the pain, the city's \n     redemption depended importantly on help from the state which \n     assumed certain of the city's costs for courts, correction \n     and higher education. At a critical time, the state also \n     purchased $250 million of MAC bonds and provided MAC with its \n     ``moral authority'' to maintain our credit.\n       Federal help, while psychologically critical, was far more \n     limited (Remember the famous New York Daily News headline \n     ``Ford to City: Drop Dead.'') Still, the Ford administration \n     provided a limited amount ($1.5 billion) of seasonal loans \n     which was replaced by the Carter administration by long-term \n     loan guarantees which were totally paid off in the early \n     1980s.\n       Building public support. Being open with the public and \n     consistently explaining actions and goals helped the city's \n     emergency management build and sustain a positive public \n     spirit (an effort made easier by the natural pride and civic \n     spirit of New Yorkers). The fact that New York has a number \n     of powerful newspapers also helped to create the public \n     support our political leaders needed to carry out extremely \n     painful actions every day--the details of which were almost \n     impossible to explain on television. Many of our actions were \n     deemed to be political suicide when first considered, but it \n     is worth noting that Gov. Carey's approval rating was the \n     highest ever in December 1975 when we had carried out the \n     most painful parts of the restructuring.\n       Important as these stern measures were, the city could not \n     have moved its budget into balance after four years without \n     the help of the national economic recovery and the \n     revitalization of the city's own private sector. And a \n     sharply accelerating public investment program helped \n     generate the strong local economy. Budget cuts alone will not \n     create recovery.\n       But it is also true that temporary budget cuts won't solve \n     much of anything. And here is where we made our greatest \n     mistake: Postponing fundamental reform. We believed that we \n     had basically changed the city because we had balanced the \n     budget and regained our credit. We were wrong.\n       The economic recovery of the 1980s seduced the city back \n     into some of its prior spending habits. Prosperity is the \n     enemy of reform. The work force swelled to pre-crisis levels; \n     cost increases were not offset by productivity increases; \n     full pension benefits were restored. No serious though was \n     given to the gradual elimination of certain services or to \n     the possible privatization of functions like the municipal \n     hospital system or to restructuring the school system. No \n     real improvement was made either in the quality or efficiency \n     of service delivery. Similarly, temporary measures were \n     always taken to deal with long-term reductions in the city's \n     revenue base. By the time Mayor Rudolph Giuliani came on the \n     scene in 1993, a major structural deficit was again built \n     into the city's budget.\n       The problems our mayor--like the District's--faces are \n     greater than those of the 1970s, in both the private and \n     public sectors. Much higher levels of crime, drugs and AIDS; \n     rising caseloads for welfare and Medicaid funds; inadequate \n     public schools; high taxes and poor quality-of-life and \n     unsustainable labor costs--all these are driving taxpayers \n     and businesses out.\n       Ultimately, however, success in New York, as in every city, \n     will depend on the private sector. But for a city to retain \n     its advantages as a cultural, communications and financial \n     center, it must provide a level of public service far \n     superior to what most provide today. It must have an educated \n     work force and first-class public schools; safe and clean \n     streets; attractive and affordable public transportation; a \n     business-friendly tax environment; a thriving entertainment \n     district; airports and railroad stations friendly to the \n     traveler; partnership between universities and high-\n     technology companies; and adequate housing for employees. \n     These are all things that only cooperation between the \n     private and public sector can provide.\n       In this regard, the District may have some advantages New \n     York City did not enjoy. \n\n[[Page S 12629]]\n     The biggest one, so far, seems to be the willingness of the Republican \n     leadership in Congress to encourage fundamental change to \n     improve the District's long-term prospects. Tax benefits, \n     school vouchers, extensive privatization, increased \n     infrastructure investment and more should be tried not only \n     in Washington, D.C., but in every metropolitan area. A \n     bipartisan interest in developing a real urban agenda in \n     America is way overdue. Without such an agenda, no city plan \n     anywhere in this country is realistic in the long run.\n       Some of the problems we face in New York as well as those \n     of the District were self-inflicted and due to irresponsible \n     policies. Many others, however, are not of our doing. Only \n     national policies can deal with national problems such as \n     poverty, health care, crime, education and immigration. The \n     idea that sending welfare and Medicaid back to the states \n     will be viable is total fantasy--simply an excuse for massive \n     cutbacks with unfathonable results.\n       America is the only advanced Western democracy that does \n     not consider its cities as both its cultural and economic \n     crown jewels. In Europe, cities existed long before countries \n     came into being. The notion that Paris, Rome, London, Berlin \n     or Amsterdam could face the kind of economic pressures and \n     physical neglect that is faced by America's major cities is \n     unthinkable. Without a change in the appreciation of what \n     cities mean to the U.S. economy, we will ultimately be doomed \n     to fail here in New York, and the District of Columbia will \n     be a permanent ward of the federal government. If the cities \n     fail, ultimately we will be doomed to fail as a society and \n     as a nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12627-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MIKE CURRAN\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to salute a valued and \ntrusted public servant, Mr. Mike Curran, who is retiring this month \nfollowing 30 distinguished years as an employee of the U.S. Forest \nService. Since 1986, Mike has been the forest supervisor for the \nOuachita National Forest in Arkansas, and that is where I came to know \nhim and to admire his abilities.\n  Mike has been an outstanding leader of people and manager of assets \nthroughout his career in public forestry, and his exceptional ability \nto forge through new concepts to meet changing public demands certainly \ncaught my eye. His creative style and national flair for addressing \ncompeting interest groups and issues has been key to his success.\n  In 1990 I became involved in one of the most divisive forest issues \never to face the national forests in Arkansas. Public demand to \neliminate the practice of clear-cutting had reached a peak. Mike was \ninstrumental in bringing the Chief of the U.S. Forest Service to \nArkansas to meet with me to determine whether or not a new way of \nlooking at forest management could be developed that would allow us to \neliminate this disagreeable practice and continue to produce quality \ntimber in quantity.\n  This event led to the implementation to the new perspectives concept \nof sustainable forestry and placed the Ouachita National Forest, under \nMike's leadership, in the lead position in a national movement toward \nthe ecosystem management philosophy. Mike weathered much criticism from \nmany corners as this system began to be developed. At times I know he \nfelt he was under siege personally. Today the Ouachita National Forest \nhas never been healthier, and its future is bright.\n  Mike has made a significant contribution to our Nation, and all of \nour forests have followed his lead.

Mr. President, the University of California has \nbeen the focus of above-average attention on the issue of affirmative \naction because of the presence of two national political figures, \nGovernor Pete Wilson and the Reverend Jesse Jackson.\n  I wish we lived in a time in which affirmative action was not \nnecessary but that is not the case. We have improved as a society--even \nthough many people may not recognize that--since the days of my youth, \nbut we still have a long way to go.\n  Of particular interest to me was a New York Times op-ed piece by \nProfessor Orlando Patterson about the California situation.\n  I ask that the op-ed piece be printed in the Record, and I urge my \ncolleagues to read his remarks, if they did not read them in the New \nYork Times.\n  The material follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Aug. 7, 1995]\n\n                Affirmative Action, on the Merit System\n\n                         (By Orlando Patterson)\n\n       Cambridge, MA.--For years Americans have complained about \n     government programs for the disadvantaged that do not work. \n     Now, however, we are on the verge of dismantling affirmative \n     action, the one policy that, for all its imperfections has \n     made a major difference in the lives of women and minority \n     groups and has helped us achieve the constitutional \n     commitment to the ideal of equality and fairness.\n       In utilitarian terms, it is hard to find a program that has \n     brought so much gain to so many at so little cost. It has \n     been the single most important factor in the rise of a \n     significant, it still economically fragile, black middle \n     class.\n       So it is hard to understand why it has become the most \n     contentious issue in the nation. One would have thought that \n     a policy that so many politicians denounced would have \n     adversely touched the lives of at least a substantial \n     proportion of those opposing it.\n       The facts show just the opposite. A National Opinion \n     Research Center survey in 1990, still applicable today, found \n     that while more than 70 percent of white Americans asserted \n     that whites were being hurt by affirmative action for blacks, \n     only 7 percent claimed to have experienced any form of \n     reverse discrimination. Only 16 percent knew of someone close \n     who had. Fewer than one in four could even claim that it was \n     something they had witnessed or heard about at their \n     workplace.\n\n\n  Standards rose at the University of California in the last 12 years\n\n       So what was the source feeding all the outrage? The vast \n     majority of those interviewed claimed to have heard about the \n     problem either through the press or from other second-hand \n     sources, like their political leaders.\n       Of course, such data would not matter were affirmative \n     action something inherently evil. But this could hardly be \n     the case, because for more than 15 years leaders of both \n     parties, including Senator Bob Dole and Gov. Pete Wilson of \n     California, both Republican Presidential candidates, \n     supported this initiative. Indeed, they lauded it, as both \n     morally defensible and the only effective means of remedying \n     the intolerable exclusion of disadvantaged minorities and \n     women from opportunities to train and apply for the better-\n     paying working- and middle-class jobs.\n       What happened? How did so manifestly worthy and effective a \n     program lose the support, including that of some people who \n     stood the most to gain from it?\n       Blaming the media or the cynicism of our leaders will not \n     do, the transparent opportunism of Mr. Dole and Mr. Wilson \n     notwithstanding. Several factors account for the collapse of \n     support for affirmative action.\n       The first is that the largely erroneous arguments of neo-\n     conservative and other right-wing critics somehow carried the \n     day. Merit, we were repeatedly warned, was being undermined, \n     resulting in both individual inequities and, worse, severe \n     threats to our economy and the demands of a high-tech \n     society.\n       Nonsense, both. Only a minuscule number of whites, we now \n     know, are affected by affirmative action, and of this small \n     fraction, a still smaller percentage are able to claim \n     genuine grievances.\n       The claim that our economic efficiency is being threatened \n     is simply laughable. Oddly enough, the problem right now is \n     not a shortage of highly trained manpower but an oversupply, \n     demonstrated by a saturated market for scientists and \n     engineers. An alarming number of them are becoming lawyers \n     (the overdependence on which being perhaps our biggest waste \n     of manpower resources).\n       White men still control more than 99.9 percent of all the \n     important top positions in private and public institutions, \n     as well as the vast majority of middle-level and high-paying \n     jobs. They will continue to do so unit well into the next \n     millennium.\n       There is also the argument that affirmative action has done \n     nothing for the underclass and poor but favors people already \n     in the middle class. Although rhetorically it is extremely \n     effective, it is deliberately misleading. This point figured \n     prominently the recent broadsides against the University of \n     California's affirmative action policies from Governor Wilson \n     and an influential university regent, Ward Connerly.\n       But affirmative action was never intended to help the \n     poorest and least able. It is, by nature, a top-down \n     strategy, meant to level the field for those who are capable \n     of taking advantage of opportunities denied them because of \n     their sex or race.\n       For the underclass and the working poor, an entirely \n     different set of bottom-up strategies are called for, \n     although no one seems to know what these might be.\n       The University of California's experience with affirmative \n     action demonstrates beyond doubt the shallowness of the \n     politicians' criticisms. Over the past 12 years, it has \n     achieved its goal of incorporating students from \n     disadvantaged minorities.\n       But far from experiencing a decline in standards, the \n     university has not only fulfilled its mandate of selecting \n     students from the top one-eighth of the state's graduating \n     class, but has increased its eligibility requirements five \n     times during this period. It is now a far more selective \n     institution than before the introduction of affirmative \n     action, with improved graduation rates for both black and \n     non-black students.\n\n[[Page S 12630]]\n\n       Nothing could be more hypocritical and contradictory than \n     the spectacle of a Republic governor demanding that his \n     state's university system rely solely on the crude instrument \n     of test scores to select 70 percent of its incoming students.\n       Republicans never tire of saying that what made America \n     great are the virtues of honesty, courage, initiative and \n     imagination, integrity, loyalty and fair play, all best \n     demonstrated by a person's track record and especially his or \n     her perseverance in the face of adversity. Why then are \n     conservatives vilifying universities for taking these values \n     seriously in selecting the next generation of leaders?\n       Race, we are told, should have nothing to do with the \n     assessment of these virtues. Race, however, refers to several \n     aspects of a person. It refers to physical appearance, and \n     this, every African-American would agree with Senator Dole \n     and Governor Wilson, should be a matter of no importance.\n       But for African-Americans, race also means surviving an \n     environment in which racism is still pervasive. It has to be \n     taken into account in assessing the content of any black \n     person's character, and to assert that this amounts to a \n     divisive glorification of race is as disingenuous and as \n     absurd as claiming that we are divisively glorifying poverty \n     and broken families when we take account of these factors in \n     assessing a white student's character.\n       There is a third important meaning of race, and it is here \n     that we enter tricky ground.\n       Blackness also connotes something positive: the subcultural \n     heritage of African-Americans that in spite of centuries of \n     discrimination has vastly enriched American civilization out \n     of all proportion to the numbers, and treatment, of the group \n     creating it. The University of California, like other great \n     institutions of learning, rightly has seen the exposure of \n     all its students to this important minority culture as part \n     of its educational mission.\n\n\n           a policy that works only in an ecumenical america\n\n       This is a noble goal, but it is fraught with dangers. What \n     brought me around to support affirmative action after some \n     strong initial reservations was not only its effectiveness as \n     a strategy for reducing inequality, but also its \n     possibilities for cross--pollinating our multi-ethnic \n     communities. In the process, it could promote that precious, \n     overarching national culture--the envy of the world--which I \n     call ecumenical America.\n       But the promotion of diversity has done nothing of the \n     sort, as Governor Wilson and Mr. Connerly were able to argue \n     with devastating impact. To the contrary, both on an off our \n     campuses affirmative action seems to have been distorted by \n     its beneficiaries into the goal of balkanizing America both \n     intellectually and culturally. One has only to walk for a few \n     minutes on any large campus to witness the pervasiveness of \n     ethnic separatism, marked by periodic outbursts of other \n     chauvinisms and hostilities.\n       No group of people now seem more committed to segregation \n     than black students and young professionals.\n       Their motto seems to be: separate, yes, but make sure there \n     is equality, by affirmative action or any other means. To a \n     lesser extent, the tendency of the new black middle class to \n     segregate itself residentially and to scoff at the norms and \n     values of the ecumenical mainstream is the off-campus version \n     of this lamentable betrayal and abandonment of the once \n     cherished goal of integration.\n       Ethnic separatism has also had deleterious academic \n     consequences. In an experiment conducted at the University of \n     Michigan by two psychologists, Claude Steele and Richard \n     Nisbett, a group of disadvantaged minority students who were \n     encouraged to be part of the campus mainstream, and made to \n     understand that the highest standards were expected of them, \n     consistently performed above the average for white students \n     and the student body as a whole. Members of a control group \n     who took the familiar route of ethnic solidarity and \n     consciousness-raising performed well below the average.\n       At its best, affirmative action compensates for one of the \n     greatest disabilities of minority members: their lack of \n     access to vital networks and other social capital which white \n     men simply take for granted, whether it is the construction \n     worker who mobilizes his neighborhood ties to get on a high-\n     paying work crew, or the upper-middle class manager who draws \n     on his grammar school and Ivy League contacts to land the \n     vice presidency of some budding company.\n       Once in, however, too many minority workers and women felt \n     entitled to automatic promotion and were too quick to use the \n     accusation of racism or sexism when it was denied. Too many \n     supervisors practice a patronizing racism or sexism. The \n     cynical promotion of unqualified people, even if it happens \n     only occasionally, damages the legitimacy of affirmative \n     action since it takes only one such mistake to sour an entire \n     organization.\n       Also damaging were clearly illegal practices like using \n     blacks and women as entrepreneurial fronts to gain access to \n     preferential contracts.\n       These are all correctable errors. Universities and \n     businesses should return to the principle of integration, to \n     the notion that diversity is not something to be celebrated \n     and promoted in its own right, but an opportunity for mutual \n     understanding and the furtherance of an ecumenical national \n     culture.\n       The President should remain firm in his principled resolve \n     to defend a corrected version of affirmative action. And if \n     we give it a time limit of 10 years, it might still be \n     possible to save this troubled but effective and badly needed \n     policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12629-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12630-S12631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HONORING RICHARD A. GRASSO, COOLEY'S ANEMIA FOUNDATION'S HUMANITARIAN \n                              OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Mr. \nRichard A. Grasso, chairman and chief executive officer of the New York \nStock Exchange on his selection as the recipient of the first annual \nHumanitarian of the Year Award presented by the Cooley's Anemia \nFoundation. The Cooley's Anemia Foundation is honoring Mr. Grasso for \nhis support, friendship, and tireless efforts on behalf of the patients \nand families who are impacted by this devastating blood disease.\n  As the father of young children himself, Mr. Grasso, I believe, has a \nkeen understanding of the importance of supporting the efforts led by \nthe Cooley's Anemia Foundation to find a cure for what the World Health \nOrganization has identified as the most common inherited genetic blood \ndisease in the world.\n  Mr. Grasso has had a distinguished career over the last 26 years at \nthe New York Stock Exchange. He is the first member of the New York \nStock Exchange staff to be elected to the position of chairman and \nchief executive officer in the exchange's 200-year history. He has \nexhibited what is best about the American spirit--he has given back to \nhis community by working on behalf of many good causes.\n  Just consider the following. He is currently Chairman of the board of \ntrustees of Junior Achievement of New York and he serves on the board \nof directors of the National Italian-American Foundation. Mr. Grasso is \na trustee of the New York City Police Foundation, as well as a member \nof the board of directors of the Washington, DC-based police \nfoundation. He also serves on the St. Vincent's Hospital Board of \nTrustees in New York City. He is the honorary chairman of the Friends \nof the Statue of Liberty National Monument-Ellis Island Foundation. He \neven finds time to serve his own local community, Old Brookville, NY, \nas police commissioner and village trustee.\n  His receipt of the Cooley's Anemia Foundation's Humanitarian of the \nYear Award adds to the many awards and honors he has already received, \nincluding the Humanitarian of the Year Award from the Tomorrow's \nChildren's Fund, the Special Achievement Award in Business from the \nNational Italian-American Foundation, the Ellis Island Medal of Honor \nfrom the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations, the Good Scout \nAward from the Greater New York Councils for Boy Scouts of America, and \nthe Brotherhood Award from the National Conference of Christians and \nJews. Most recently, he was honored in 1994 as the Man of the Year by \nthe Catholic Big Brothers organization. He is indeed a special person, \nhaving risen to the top ranks of his profession and still finding time \nto give back to these worthwhile causes.\n  His efforts on behalf of the Cooley's Anemia Foundation are \nparticularly important and special to me. I know many of the families \nand patients who must deal with treating this disease every day of \ntheir lives. Every 2 weeks, Cooley's anemia patients require \ntransfusions of red blood cells. Every day they must wear a special \npump that painfully infuses a drug for 12 hours. But, because of \nresearch over the last several decades, treatment has been developed \nwhich prolongs the life of Cooley's anemia patients. Twenty years ago, \nmost patients rarely lived past the age of 10; today many are living \ninto their twenties and trying to be productive citizens. Now, \npromising new research is being conducted into Cooley's anemia, giving \nus all great hope that some day it will be curable.\n  That is why the efforts of people like Richard Grasso are so \nimportant. At a time when new research opportunities are before us, we \nmust ensure that the resources of private philanthropic organizations, \nsuch as the Cooley's Anemia Foundation, are strengthened. Additionally, \nwe must assure that the Federal commitment continues. \n\n[[Page S 12631]]\n\n  Again, I congratulate Richard Grasso on his receipt of the Cooley's \nAnemia Foundation first annual Humanitarian of the Year Award. With his \ncontinued support and assistance, I am confident that we will indeed \nlive to see a cure. He is an example for us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12630-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          VICTIMS OF VENGEANCE\n\n Mr. SIMON.

Nygaard)\n\n       Perry Carris is dead. I doubt that many mourned him. Even \n     among those who did not want him to die, most would readily \n     admit that the world is a better place without him. He was a \n     brutal killer. He and a friend entered the home of the \n     friend's elderly uncle and aunt, then killed and robbed them. \n     The uncle was stabbed 79 times and the aunt, who weighed only \n     70 pounds, 66 times.\n       But, you see, Carris didn't just die--we killed him. One \n     night last year officers of the prison where he spent his \n     final hours injected him with lethal chemicals, and, quietly, \n     he met eternity. Many more are scheduled to die in like \n     fashion. Moreover, the new federal crime bill imposes death \n     as a penalty for 50 more crimes.\n       Is it not time to think about what society is doing? What \n     we are doing? Carris' act was deliberate. So was ours. \n     Carris' motivation was a cruel disregard for life. What was \n     ours? The first killing clearly was criminal and \n     unjustified--and sinful. But how about the second?\n       The death penalty as the ultimate sanction brings \n     punishment sharply into focus. It is the surrogate for \n     society's frustration with the failures of government to \n     maintain order and protect them.\n       As a form of punishment, the killing of criminals is an \n     issue with which Christians also must reconcile their \n     beliefs. Many who are quick to condemn abortion because it \n     kills an innocent being are just as quick to accept the death \n     penalty, ostensibly because it kills a guilty being. Each is \n     the killing of a human: The first is one whom Jesus said \n     knows no sin; the second is one whose sin Jesus said could be \n     forgiven. Is there a difference? Is this a paradox? Or can we \n     reconcile our ambivalent attitudes about death?\n\n\n                             why we punish\n\n       It is important first to know the purpose of our \n     punishment. American penology is really quite simple. We have \n     just three means of criminal punishment: probation, \n     incarceration and death. And we rely upon only four \n     justifications: rehabilitation, deterrence, containment and \n     retribution. How does the death penalty serve these ends?\n       When we look at each possible justification, it becomes \n     clear that both society's motivation and the penal system's \n     justification for the death penalty is simply retribution: We \n     are ``getting even.''\n       First, one can easily reject rehabilitation as the goal. \n     The death penalty surely does not rehabilitate the person \n     upon whom it is imposed. It simply takes his life.\n       The second purpose, deterrence, is more problematic. \n     Statistics uniformly show that condemned criminals on death \n     row did not consider the possibility that they might die for \n     their crimes. Others, of course, may have thought of the \n     consequences--and did not kill. But this possibility has been \n     little-researched. We simply do not know much about this \n     aspect of deterrence. Death, of course, is permanent \n     deterrence. But the question is whether it is necessary. Life \n     imprisonment will protect society from further criminal acts \n     by the malefactor--and at less expense than execution.\n       Containment, the third justification for punishment, also \n     poses a philosophical problem because it punishes a person \n     for something as yet not done. We use the crime already \n     committed to project, sometimes without further information, \n     that he or she will do it again. Then we contain the person \n     to prevent that.\n       Although killing the offender does, in a grim and final \n     sense, contain and so protect society we must ask again: Is \n     it necessary? It is not. Penologists recognize that an \n     offender can be effectively and economically contained in a \n     prison. They also reject containment to justify the capital \n     punishment.\n\n\n                          the ultimate payback\n\n       This leaves only retribution. Revenge--the ultimate \n     payback. As a tool of retribution, death works wonderfully.\n       The desire for revenge is the dark secret in us all. It is \n     human nature to resent a hurt, and each of us has a desire to \n     hurt back. Before the time of law, the fear of personal \n     reprisal may have been all that kept some from physical \n     attacks upon others or property crimes against them. But with \n     law, cultures sought to limit personal revenge by punishment \n     controlled and meted out in a detached fashion by the \n     sovereign.\n       Revenge between citizens is antithetical to civilized \n     society. It invites a greater retaliation . . . which in turn \n     invites counter reprisal . . . which invites more revenge. A \n     spiraling escalation of violence between society and the \n     criminal subculture results. By exacting revenge upon \n     criminals, society plays on their terms and by their \n     rules. We cannot win.\n\n\n                          `Acceptable' revenge\n\n       Leaders know, and have for centuries, that civilization \n     requires restraint. They know that open personal revenge is \n     socially destructive and cannot be permitted. That, indeed, \n     it must be renounced. Official revenge is not better, and the \n     results are no less odious. By catering to the passions of \n     society, government tells its citizens that vengeance is \n     acceptable--it is just that you cannot do it.\n       Leaders today respond politically to the base passions of \n     society rather than act as statesmen upon the sociological \n     necessities of civilization. Vengeance requires a victim. In \n     putting a criminal to death, our government gives us one. \n     ``Paying back,'' although destructive to culture and family \n     alike, is politically popular. And so it is the law.\n       Christians also must confront what institutionalized \n     killing is doing to our attitudes toward ourselves. As a \n     judge, I have seen the defiant and unrepentant murderer. I \n     know how easy it is to identify only with the innocent and \n     injured. But should we not, as Christians, strive to \n     exemplify the grace and mercy of Jesus? Should we not desire \n     this quality also in our society?\n       On the eve of one execution last year, crowds gathered \n     outside the prison to await a condemned man's death. And at \n     the fateful hour, they cheered. The Sunday before another \n     execution, the newspaper printed a photograph of the \n     stretcher upon which the offender was to die.\n       By urging vengeful punishment, society exposes its own \n     desire for violence. Yes, the death penalty is \n     constitutional. It is legal. But is it proper for government \n     to give vent to this base desire of its citizens? I doubt \n     that we, as a society, can kill without doing psychological \n     damage to our culture.\n       Perry Carris, I know, received a fair trial and his full \n     measure of due process on appeal. I know because I sat on the \n     court that declined to stay his execution. What, however, \n     does his death and the deaths of others executed mean--to me \n     or to you, Christians who must decide whether or not to \n     support death as a penalty?\n       We are a government of the people. We citizens are obliged \n     to scrutinize the reason our society, and thus our \n     government, kills. We who are Christians also must be \n     satisfied that the reason is reconcilable with the tenets of \n     our faith. Is it, when the reason is revenge?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12631-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12631-S12632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UKRAINIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Ukrainian Independence Day, August \n24, is a time to remember Ukraine's past and to look to its bright \nfuture. Since Ukrainian independence in 1991, much has been \naccomplished in all areas of the country.\n  The recent legislative and Presidential elections give cause for \nhope. The open and fair manner in which they were carried out is \nevidence that democracy has taken root in Ukraine. Ukraine exhibits \nsigns of a healthy democracy, including the existence of multiple \ninterests represented within the government.\n  In the economic arena, Ukraine has exhibited much potential. Its \nsignificant natural resource endowment, focus on heavy industry, and \nits most important resource, the innovative and hard-working people of \nUkraine, can combine to transform the country into a successful \neconomic player in the world. Ukraine has taken significant steps to \nalleviate the natural strains that a country experiences when changing \nfrom a centralized to a free-market economy. These economic problems \nare similar to those now being experienced by many of the other \ncountries of the Commonwealth of Independent States.\n  Under the guidance of the International Monetary Fund, Ukraine is \nworking to halt hyperinflation and to achieve other beneficial goals, \nsuch as securing an efficient and cost-effective source of energy for \nthe country. President Kuchma's plan of tight fiscal and monetary \npolicies, price liberalization, foreign trade liberalization, and \naccelerated privatization appears to be the right economic track for \nUkraine. The recent partnership signed with the European Union is \nanother step in the right direction. It will give Ukraine most-favored-\nnation status and other trade advantages, and opens the possibility of \na free trade agreement after 1998. \n\n[[Page S 12632]]\n\n  Ukraine's actions in the area of national and regional security are \nalso encouraging. The government is to be congratulated for its efforts \nto rid Ukrainian soil of nuclear weapons. Ukraine has faithfully \nfollowed guidelines for the elimination of nuclear weapons from its \nborders under the START I treaty and other similar agreements. It is \nalso heartening to know that Ukraine has ratified the Non-Proliferation \nTreaty. And, in joining the Partnership for Peace program for NATO \nmembership, Ukraine has positioned itself to become a member of the \nstrongest military alliance the world has ever known.\n  Ukraine's transition to a democratically governed free-market economy \nhas not been without its problems. But these strains are natural in \nsuch a progression. In the face of such turmoil, Ukraine has shown \nstrong leadership by pledging itself to adhere to the principles of the \nHelsinki Final Act. This will insure that whatever problems Ukraine may \nencounter in the future, they will continue to be an example of respect \nfor civil and human rights in the region.\n  The people of Ukraine deserve our admiration and support for the fine \nwork they have done in such a short period of time. I know that the \nUkrainian-American community here in Michigan is in the front ranks of \nsuch support. We will all be watching Ukraine closely this next year as \nit works to finalize a new constitution.\n  This is truly an historic time for Ukraine, one in which it is \npossible to witness the citizens decide for themselves what kind of \ngovernment and what kind of future they want for their country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12631-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ``LOST YEAR, LOST PEACE''\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, one of the gravest injustices \nperpetrated by the American government in our more than two centuries \nof history was in February 1942, when we told 120,000 people who lived \nin the States of California, Oregon, and Washington that they had 1 to \n3 days to sell all their property and put everything they own into one \nsuitcase and they would be taken to camps.\n  Almost all of these 120,000 people were Japanese-Americans. A few \nwere actually citizens of Japan.\n  Gary Matsumoto, a national correspondent for NBC, had an op-ed piece \nin the New York Times about his family's experiences.\n  Our colleague in the House, Congressman Norman Mineta, was moved from \nCalifornia to a detention camp.\n  Not one person, among all those 120,000, had been charged with any \ncrime.\n  My reason for paying special attention to this is that I grew up in \nthe State of Oregon. My father was a Lutheran minister there. When this \noccurred my father made a statement on a local radio station, KORE, \nthat it was wrong to treat American citizens in this way. My mother \nalso recalls that he wrote a letter or two to the editor of the local \nnewspaper, though I have no recollection of that.\n  What I do know is that we received some phone calls and experienced \nsome minor unpopularity. I was 13 years old at the time, and I would \nlove to relate to my colleagues in the Senate that I stood up and \ndefended what my father did, but I did not. I remember him explaining \nit to my brother and me, why it was wrong. But I was embarrassed by \nwhat my father did and wished he had not done it, perhaps a typical \nreaction for a 13-year-old. But now, as I look back on my father's \nlife, it is one of the things I am proudest of him for. He was active \nin what we then called race relations and was always responsive to the \nneeds of people. Up until the last few weeks before he died, he was a \nvolunteer every Thursday morning at a facility for the mentally \nretarded. But perhaps nothing my father did makes me prouder of him \nthan standing up for Japanese-Americans when it was not popular to do \nso.\n  I ask that the Gary Matsumoto op-ed piece be printed in the Record, \nand I urge my colleagues to read it.\n  The material follows:\n\n                         Lost Years, Lost Peace\n\n                          (By Gary Matsumoto)\n\n       For millions of Americans, this week's anniversary of V-J \n     Day conjured up memories, celebrations and passionate \n     embraces. My parents were reminded of barbed wire and dust.\n       They shared the fate of 110,000 Japanese-Americans living \n     in California, Oregon and Washington after the bombing of \n     Pearl Harbor. Amid anti-Japanese hysteria and irrational \n     fears of treason, all were expelled from their homes and \n     exiled to concentration camps.They were told it was for their \n     own safety. The Constitution was forgotten.\n       My father, Kimitsu Matsumoto, was 15 years old and lived in \n     Santa Maria, Calif. In the fall of 1942, he, his older \n     sister, Imiko, and my grandmother were put aboard a dimly lit \n     railroad car and whisked out of Los Angeles. For nearly 400 \n     miles, they sat despondently, wondering if they would ever \n     see home again.\n       The Government sent them to the Gila River Relocation \n     Center, a desolate tract on the Pima Indian reservation in \n     Arizona.\n       My father, being young, could adjust to the situation. He \n     and friends made the best of it. They marked out baseball \n     diamonds in the desert. Cactuses became football goal posts.\n       They sang around campfires, danced on weekends and \n     participated in talent shows.\n       My Aunt Imiko, who was 22 in 1942, has darker memories. She \n     answered the door when F.B.I. agents arrived before dawn to \n     arrest my grandfather. Later, she delivered a shaving kit to \n     him, standing her ground when a young G.I. lowered his rifle \n     and threatened to run her through with his bayonet if she \n     come any closer to the prison gate.\n       My grandfather spent the spring and summer of 1942 in a \n     detention camp in Bismark, N.D., before being reunited with \n     his wife and children in the Arizona desert. They lived in \n     crude barracks with cinder block floors. Guard towers were \n     equipped with machine guns and searchlights.\n       In the summer, the temperature reached 125 degrees, and the \n     place would stink of roof tar. When the wind blew, clouds of \n     suffocating dust would blanket the camp. For these fastidious \n     people, the dust was a ceaseless affliction that symbolized \n     their ruin.\n       My grandparents missed the small cafe the family had run. \n     My father missed the tortillas stuffed with beans he had \n     bought from Mexican friends at school. My aunt missed her \n     boyfriend, who had been drafted into the Army before the war \n     broke out. (She eventually married him.)\n       My grandmother and grandfather had come to America in the \n     late 19th century seeking opportunities that they could never \n     know in Japan's stultifying, feudal society. They reared \n     their children, born in California, to love Fords, meat loaf \n     and the New York Yankees. After Pearl Harbor, they not only \n     lost their homes, they lost the sense that they belonged.\n       My mother's family, who lived in Loomis, Calif., lost much \n     more. They were sent to a camp, called Amache, in \n     southeastern Colorado near the Kansas border. Before my \n     grandmother left California, doctors warned that she could \n     die in Colorado's altitudes: Amache was very high. Her blood \n     pressure was high, and the air was thin. After several \n     strokes, she was bedridden. For three years, my grandfather \n     nursed her, first in the barracks, later in the camp \n     hospital, where he would sleep on the floor beneath her bed. \n     She died in the camp five days after the war ended, leaving \n     seven children.\n       On V-J Day, Aug. 14, 1945, most interned Japanese-Americans \n     thought their ordeal would soon be over. But for them the war \n     did not end so tidily. The last relocation camp did not close \n     until March 20, 1946.\n       Some people, especially the elderly, were afraid to leave. \n     With their livelihoods destroyed and their children \n     scattered, they reluctantly gave up the security of life \n     behind barbed wire. When a family from the Amache camp \n     returned to California, their shed was dynamited and shots \n     were fired into their home.\n       What people forgot was that a Japanese-American regiment \n     that fought in Europe was among the most decorated military \n     units in the war. Japanese-Americans also served in the \n     Pacific.\n       After the war, both sides of my family found shelter in \n     Chicago from the virulent racism festering at that time on \n     the West Coast. But they have never lost the fear that \n     another cataclysm would provoke the Government to come for \n     them again.\n       A generation removed from the war, I have never fully \n     shared that concern. Then I look at my baby daughter--part \n     Swiss, part German and Irish, but with a decidely Asian cast \n     to her eyes--and I wonder.\n       This year, a memorial was erected at the Gila River camp. \n     Except for the concrete slabs where the barracks once stood, \n     all that remains is the dust. But for my family and \n     successive generations of Japanese-Americans, Gila River is a \n     place in the heart, a wound that never quite heals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12632-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12632-S12633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENTS 104-16, 104-17, AND \n                                 104-18\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Res. 22\n\n       Whereas there was international concern expressed at the \n     Rio Conference of 1992 about conservation of the seas;\n       Whereas 1998 has been declared the ``International Year of \n     the Ocean'' by the United Nations in an effort to alert the \n     world to the need for improving the physical and cultural \n     assets offered by the world's oceans;\n       Whereas the theme of Expo '98 is ``The Oceans, a Heritage \n     for the Future'';\n       Whereas Expo '98 has a fundamental aim of alerting \n     political, economic, and public opinion to the growing \n     importance of the world's oceans;\n       Whereas Portugal has established a vast network of \n     relationships through ocean exploration;\n       Whereas Portugal's history is rich with examples of the \n     courage and exploits of Portuguese explorers;\n       Whereas Portugal and the United States have a relationship \n     based on mutual respect, and a sharing of interests and \n     ideals, particularly the deeply held commitment to democratic \n     values;\n       Whereas today over 2,000,000 Americans can trace their \n     ancestry to Portugal; and\n       Whereas the United States and Portugal agreed in the 1995 \n     Agreement on Cooperation and Defense that in 1998 the 2 \n     countries would consider and develop appropriate means of \n     commemorating the upcoming quincentennial anniversary of the \n     historic voyage of discovery by Vasco da Gama: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the United States should fully participate \n     in Expo '98 in Lisbon, Portugal, and encourage the private \n     sector to support this worthwhile undertaking.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/05/senate-section/article/S12633-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                STAR PRINT--REPORT ACCOMPANYING S. 1147\n\n  Mr. WARNER.
