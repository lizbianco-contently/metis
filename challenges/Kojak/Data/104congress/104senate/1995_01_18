Mr. President, I just make the announcement for my \ncolleagues that the time of the two leaders has been reserved, and we \nwill have routine morning business until 12 noon, with Senators \npermitted to speak for not to exceed 5 minutes each, with the following \nexceptions: Senator Thomas for up to 10 minutes, Senator Inhofe for up \nto 10 minutes, and Senator Campbell for up to 10 minutes, I guess.\n  At 12 noon, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1, the \nunfunded mandates bill. Pending is still committee amendment No. 11.\n  A cloture motion was filed on Tuesday. Therefore, a cloture vote will \noccur tomorrow. All first-degree amendments should be filed at the desk \nno later than 1 p.m. today.\n  I just say generally for the information of Members, we are not \nmaking any progress on this bill. It is obvious that the people \nwatching or not even watching know that we have been on this bill 3 \ndays and not much has happened. That is the way the Senate can work, \nand certainly I have been in the position of slowing things down.\n  But, obviously, there is a slowdown in progress. If we do not make \nany progress between now and 1:25 p.m. on this bill, it would be my \nintention to recess the Senate maybe for the rest of the day so the \nJudiciary Committee can complete action on the balanced-budget \namendment, because I assume there will be an objection to the Judiciary \nCommittee meeting during the session of the Senate.\n  If my colleagues are willing to permit the Judiciary Committee to \nmeet, obviously we would not have to recess the Senate. So I hope that \naccommodation might be forthcoming.\n  But with about 30, 40, or 50 amendments, there is no way this bill \ncan be completed prior to the State of the Union Message next week, and \nthat is my hope. I know President Clinton would very much like us to \nmove quickly on the Mexico matter, which is not foreign aid, I might \nsay. It is a loan guarantee. As far as I am concerned, that effort is \nright behind the unfunded mandates bill. So I suggest maybe the \nPresident might want to urge some of his colleagues on the other side \nto cooperate on this bill.\n  I think it has broad bipartisan support, supported by nearly every \nGovernor in America, every mayor, every county official, every public \nofficial, and the private sector, and it is something that could be \npassed in 1 good day of debate.\n  There are legitimate amendments, as there always are. But we will \ndispose of the bill one way or the other. We would like to accommodate \nour colleagues on the other side who plan a retreat on \n[[Page S1018]] Friday. If we can obtain cloture tomorrow, maybe we can \nwork that out with the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/18/senate-section/article/S1017-5", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I was listening intently as the majority \nleader expressed a concern over the lack of progress that we are \nmaking; and certainly we are not making progress.\n  I also listened intently yesterday to the very distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia, as he quoted history and he quoted many of our \nFounding Fathers, concerning the subject at hand of unfunded mandates.\n  I have felt that unfunded mandates are the product of an assertive, \ngreedy Government that has arrogantly injected itself into the \ndictatorial position that was feared most by our Founding Fathers.\n  And, you know, we deal with these subjects as if they are \ncontemporary subjects, Mr. President, and they are not. Because in all \nof these subjects that we have been discussing that might be associated \nwith the Contract With America, but certainly those things that 70 to \n80 percent of the Americans want, our Founding Fathers dealt with these \nissues. They dealt with term limitations. It was their intent to have a \ncitizens legislature for people to have to live under the laws that we \npassed. And, of course, we discussed that under the accountability \nbill, and such things as the budget balancing amendment.\n  It was Thomas Jefferson who came back and said:\n\n       If I could have made one improvement in the Constitution, \n     it would have been to severely limit the abilities of our \n     Government to incur debt.\n\n   And now we are looking at unfunded mandates, which, I think, at the \ncrux of unfunded mandates is the 10th amendment to the Constitution. \nCertainly, James Madison was very eloquent in his discussion of the \n10th amendment.\n  Just so that I do not misquote it, I will read it. The 10th amendment \nprovides that:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectfully, or to the people.\n\n  When you stop and remember what our Founding Fathers came over here \nto escape, it was, in fact, tyranny. So many of the problems that we \nare looking at in a contemporary way were addressed in the past.\n  I remember so well, if you think back in the history of this country, \nas was discussed by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nyesterday, we remember that here we were, a handful of farmers and \ntrappers over here, and we took on the greatest army on the face of \nthis Earth, knowing that we were signing our own death warrants to do \nso, but knowing it was worth it to escape tyranny. That was what it was \nall about when that tall redhead stood in the House of Burgesses and \nsaid:\n\n       We are not weak if we make a proper use of those means \n     which the God of Nature has placed in our power. Three \n     millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and \n     in such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by \n     any force which our enemy can send against us.\n\n  Patrick Henry was saying that we are escaping the tyranny that we \nleft behind in a foreign country.\n  Now, where have we come today? Right back to that same tyranny. And \nwhile it is not a contemporary debate, it is now being debated \ncontemporarily.\n  I think if you look around and you see of all of those items in the \nContract With America, this is the one that transcends all ideological \nlines. It transcends all party lines and interests. This is something \nthat all of the American people are for.\n  I listened to the Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], I believe \nit was a couple of days ago, and she said it so well about what \nhappened out in San Francisco back when she was the mayor.\n And while Mrs. Feinstein and I--perhaps there are no two Senators \nfurther apart ideologically. We certainly agree we have one thing in \ncommon in our backgrounds. We were both mayors of major cities in \nAmerica at the same time. In fact, Mr. President, we were on the board \nof directors of the U.S. Congress of Mayors at the same time. No one is \ngoing to say, by any interpretation, the U.S. Conference of Mayors is a \nconservative operation.\n\n  Yet, what was our major concern 15 years ago, when Mrs. Feinstein and \nI were both mayors of major cities? It was unfunded mandates. If fellow \nSenators will talk to any of the municipal leagues around America and \nask them what is the major problem they are facing in their towns, as \nwell as their cities and States, they will not say crime, they will not \nsay welfare; they will say it is unfunded mandates.\n  We wonder how we got in this situation. It reminds me a little of the \ntwo skeletons in the closet. One rattled to the other and said, ``How \ndid we get in here?'' And the other said, ``I don't know. If we had any \nguts, we would get out.'' I think it is time to get out. I think we got \nin because of the propensity of Members of Congress to, in hopes of \ngetting people something and not having the money to pay for it, find a \nway to do it, and that is to force somebody else to pay for it. That is \nexactly what is happening.\n   If we look around--I can take you to the State of Oklahoma, in \nOklahoma City alone. Keep in mind, in our infinite wisdom, we passed \nall these bills. In Oklahoma City, in order to comply with the Clean \nWater Act, the conservative estimate is $3 million for that city; to \ncomply with the transportation regulations, and these were the \nreflective road signs, the metric conversions, and those things, that \nwould be $2 million over a 5-year period; land use regulations, \nlandfills, recycling, $2.5 million; the Clean Water Act, they cannot \nproximate it, but it is well over $2 million.\n  Go to a smaller town or city, such as Broken Arrow, OK: Clean Water \nAct, storm water regulations, $100,000. A person may say, what is that? \nIn Broken Arrow, OK, that is a lot. They are going to have to give up a \npolice officer to comply with that mandate that came from the Federal \nGovernment. Waste water treatment regulations, $125,000. Safe drinking \nwater regulations, $40,000. EPA regulations, solid waste, $32,000. Fair \nLabor Standards Act, $30,000.\n  In my city of Tulsa, I checked and brought up to date the figures \nthat were there back when I was mayor of Tulsa, the Clean Water Act, \n$10 million; Safe Drinking Water Act, $16 million; solid waste \nregulations $700,000; lead-based paint, $1 million. It goes on and on \nand on. I just listed $35 million worth of mandates that are imposed \nupon three cities in the State of Oklahoma.\n  Now, those are direct costs. We get into indirect costs when we look \nat other laws that were passed. The Davis-Bacon Act--when I was elected \nmayor of the city of Tulsa, we had to make some additions. What do we \ndo about our capital improvements, because they are in dire need; we \nwere rotting out from within. So I had to go out on the line, and for a \nconservative to do this, it was a very difficult thing, Mr. President. \nBut I passed a 1-cent sales tax increase for capital improvements; and \nit passed.\n  In order to do this, we calculated, by having to comply with the \nDavis-Bacon Act, how much more it costs the taxpayers of this city of \nTulsa, OK. What could we have done without the Davis-Bacon Act: 17 \npercent more in capital improvements, 6 more miles of roads and \nstreets, 34 more miles of water and sewer lines, and we could have \nhired 500 more people.\n  I read in the Reader's Digest just the other day something I will \nshare with Members. In Philadelphia, for example--and this is in \nDecember's Reader's Digest--electricians must be paid $37.97 an hour on \nDavis-Bacon projects, while private contractors pay an average of \n$15.76. In Oakland, carpenters get $28 an hour on federally funded \nprojects, and they work for $15 an hour in the private sector. Many are \npaying the \n[[Page S1019]] price indirectly, and paying dearly, for the price of \nthe mandates.\n  I replaced a very distinguished former Senator, David Boren, when I \nwas elected to the U.S. Senate this past year.\n David Boren--he is a Democrat and I am a Republican--was and is today \none of my closest friends. I can remember in 1966, Mr. President, we \nwere elected to the State legislature. We came up here, and three of us \nbecame very intimate friends: David Boren, myself, and a guy named \nRalph Thompson, who is now a Federal judge, whose name has been \nmentioned very prominently as someone who might be a member of the U.S. \nSupreme Court someday.\n\n  We came up in 1967, almost 30 years ago. What was our mission? On the \nfirst trip when we came to Washington, the mission was to protest the \nmandates of Lady Bird's Highway Beautification Act of 1965.\n  Lastly--I do not want to go over my time, and I am afraid I am \napproaching that now--I will say what will happen if we do not do it. \nWhat is going to happen if we do not pass this bill that everyone, \nvirtually everyone, in America is for? If we do not do it, it will be \ndone for us. Just to the south of the State of the Senator from \nColorado, in New Mexico, in Catron County, in frustration with dealing \nwith the U.S. Forest Service, they enacted the U.S. Constitution as a \ncounty ordinance and put the Federal Forest Service on notice to show \nup at the county supervisors meeting to get permission to impose \nmandates.\n  Recently, in Walter Williams' column, he talks about the fact that \nCalifornia has joined Colorado, Missouri, Hawaii, and Illinois in \nasserting 10th amendment rights demanding that the Federal Government \ncease and desist all mandates and interferences exceeding those \ndelegated by the Constitution. Similar resolutions have been passed in \n12 other States.\n  Mr. President, that is a total of 17 States. Just nine more States, \nand that will be a majority of those States. So I will conclude, and \nsay that this is something that we will have to start discussing in a \nserious vein and actually bringing to a vote. I cannot think of \nanything that is more significant that we will be dealing with than \nthis issue.\n  As the Reverend Mark Dever said in his prayer, opening the session \ntoday, we want unity of purpose for which we are elected. Without \noverly dramatizing, I would say we must free our States and counties \nfrom the bondage to which they have been subverted.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, before I make comments, I would like to \nassociate myself with the comments of my friend, the Senator from \nOklahoma, with whom I have had the privilege of serving for the last 8 \nyears here in the U.S. Capitol.\n  He brings out certainly another example, and we have heard one after \nanother, about the punitive action of the Federal Government in forcing \nStates to comply with unfunded mandates.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Campbell pertaining to the introduction of S. 234 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe).

Mr. President, I would like to comment this morning on an \nissue that I think is important to us and to this country, and that is \nthe balanced budget amendment. Although we have been discussing over \nthe past several days the unfunded mandates bill, the question of a \nbalanced budget has come up. There is a relationship, and I understand \nthe relationship.\n  Certainly, if I were a local government official and we were talking \nabout a balanced budget amendment I would want the protection of an \nunfunded mandate bill so that the Federal Government would not shift \nthe responsibility of payment to local government.\n  But the balanced budget amendment goes beyond that, it seems to me. \nIt is one of the fundamental changes that needs to take place in the \nFederal Government so that decisions in the future will be different. \nIf we are really talking about change, some of the procedural changes \nthat are being discussed now need to happen and they need to happen \nsoon.\n  We have already done the accountability of the Congress. That is \nexcellent. There is no reason why the people here should not live under \nthe same rules that they apply to others. We need a balanced budget \namendment to give us some discipline for fiscal responsibility. We need \nto do that. We need to have a line-item veto. I have had some \nexperience in the House where you have an item that simply does not \nbelong in a bill. It is in the highway bill and it is a museum for \nLawrence Welk, but you cannot touch it because the rules do not allow \nfor that to happen. So you need a line-item veto.\n  We need term limitations. These are the kinds of fundamental changes, \nbut I want to talk today about the balanced budget amendment.\n  It has to do with shaping the form of the Federal Government over a \nperiod of time. It has to do with the question of whether we will have \nfiscal responsibility or whether we do not. There has been a good deal \nof dissent on an issue which most people say they are for, and now we \nfind an increasing number of people who begin to find reasons why they \nare not for it.\n  The local Hill paper says: ``Balanced Budget Amendment Is a \nCharade.''\n  I do not believe that. I think that is wrong. Let me talk about some \nof the issues.\n  First of all, it is a fundamental question and the question should be \ndivided. The question is: Do you think it is fiscally or morally \nirresponsible to spend more than you take in? Do you think it is \nfiscally irresponsible to spend more than you take in? Is it morally \nirresponsible to shift the debt to our children, grandchildren and \ntheir children?\n  The answer is, yes, of course it is fiscally irresponsible; of \ncourse, it is morally irresponsible. That is the basic question. The \nanswer is not, ``Yes, it is irresponsible if it doesn't hurt too \nmuch,'' or, ``Yes, I would like to do it if it doesn't pinch us a \nlittle bit.''\n  The answer is, ``Yes, it is irresponsible to continue to do what we \nhave been doing for 40 years.'' That is the first question.\n  The second question then is how do you do it? The second question is, \nover a period of time, how do you do it? It does not matter to me \nparticularly whether it takes 5 years or 7 years or 10 years, if we are \non a glide path that holds us toward a balanced budget.\n  The second one we hear constantly is we do not need an amendment. We \nnow have all the tools that are necessary to do it. The fact is, \nevidence does not support that. We have not had a balanced budget for \n25 years. I think we have had two in 50 years. There is not evidence \nthat this Congress can balance the budget, is willing to balance the \nbudget or does balance the budget and, indeed, we need some discipline \nto cause that to happen. Talking about it does not cause it to happen.\n  The Director of OMB on the TV said, ``Well, we have all the tools we \nneed.'' Maybe so, but tell me how well it has worked. It has not \nworked. So we do need some discipline. We need some discipline to cause \nthe Members of Congress to balance the budget.\n  Should it have more discussion? I heard the other day,\n   someone said, ``Well, it needs to be discussed.'' It has been \ndiscussed for at least 10 years. We voted on it several times. We voted \non it in the House; we voted on it in the Senate. It is not a puzzle. \nIt is not a difficult one to decide on the basic issue of whether a \nGovernment should be responsible enough to not spend more than it takes \nin. We have had lots of discussion.\n\n  Some say it is a gimmick. Some say it is bumper-sticker politics. Let \nme tell you something, it works in 48 States. I served in the Wyoming \nlegislature. It works there. We have a constitutional provision that \nyou cannot spend more than you take in. It works. There is no question \nabout whether it works. It is not a gimmick. It provides the kind of \ndiscipline to force the \n[[Page S1020]] members of the legislature to set priorities, and that \nis what a legislature is all about. Without that kind of discipline, it \ndoes not happen.\n  It is pretty simple. In the Wyoming legislature, and 48 others, when \nyou get in the appropriations committee, of which I was a member, you \nsay, ``Look, we are spending more than we have to spend.'' You have to \nmake some changes and you do that. It is not mystic; it is not magic. \nIt is just the discipline that causes that to happen.\n  Some say, ``Well, judges will be setting it.'' Not so. It is not true \nin the States. The States do not have judges setting budgets. That will \nnot happen.\n  Some say, ``Well, we have to have an outline before we can be for it. \nWe have to know what you are going to cut.'' There is no way that you \nknow what you are going to cut in 7 years or 10 years.\n  The first question is, Is it responsible to balance the budget? The \nsecond question is, How do you do it?\n  And if you really believe that it needs to be done, you do it. Raise \nrevenues? Of course. I am not for that, but that is possible. And if \nyou are willing to pay for it, you put a cost-benefit ratio. You can do \nthat. If you are committed to a balanced budget, however, you will find \nthe way.\n  Those who say, ``We do not need the tools, we already have them,'' \nthey have to do the same thing if they are going to balance the budget. \nThey say, ``We are going to balance the budget, we don't need a \nbalanced budget amendment.'' You have to make the same cuts to do it \neither way. What is the problem with having discipline? What is the \nproblem with going to the States and saying to the State legislatures, \n``We have a balanced budget to the Constitution. You have a chance to \nvote.'' People want to be involved in government.\n  The administration says we are already cutting the deficit; we do not \nneed it. The fact is that most of the deficit cut in the last 2 years \nhas been the bookkeeping deficit, and the only real change in policy \nthat has reduced the deficit has been an increase in taxes. The fact \nis, we spent more last year than we spent the year before. But we \nraised taxes and we did reduce the deficit, and I am pleased with that. \nBut most of it was a bookkeeping change from the S's and Medicaid. \nSome of it was an increase in taxes. We have not balanced the budget. \nThe projection is the deficit is going back up.\n  We hear a lot about the cuts that are needed. The fact is, we will be \nspending substantially more at the end of 7 years than we spend now. It \nis not a question of cuts. It is a matter of reducing the growth, and \nthat is where we are.\n  So a balanced budget amendment, it seems to me, is the responsible \nthing to do. Balancing the budget is the responsible thing to do. If I \nheard something in this election in 1994 in Wyoming it is, ``We want \nresponsible government; we have too much government; it costs too \nmuch,'' and the balanced budget amendment is the discipline that we \nneed to set priorities.\n  You have to spend within your budget in your family.

Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, yesterday I \ntestified before the House Ways and Means Committee on an issue of \ngreat importance to me: The Minnesotans, whom I represent in the U.S. \nSenate, and every overburdened American taxpayer. The issue is middle-\nclass tax relief.\n  Two years ago while serving in the House, I introduced the idea of a \n$500 per child tax credit in my families-first legislation, coauthored \nby Congressman Tim Hutchinson, of Arkansas.\n  Our arguments then were simple: Taxes were too high; the burden of \ntax increases fell disproportionately on the middle class; and big \ngovernment was forcing more workers out of the working class and into \nthe welfare class.\n  Consider the facts: Most middle-class American families pay more in \nFederal taxes than they spend for food, clothing, transportation, \ninsurance, and recreation combined.\n  Since World War II, Federal income and payroll taxes have increased \nfrom 2 to 24 percent of the median income of a family of four. Despite \nthis, while Congressman Hutchinson and I were making the case for tax \nrelief, Congress was in the midst of passing the 1993 Clinton tax \nproposal--the largest tax increase in American history.\n  Far from providing tax relief for the middle class, the Clinton \nproposal actually increased their tax burden, making it more difficult \nfor the middle class to care for themselves and for their children. The \nmessage from Washington was clear: Give us your money and we will solve \nall your problems.\n  But the American voters said ``no'' to this message in November and \ndelivered one of their own. And that was ``let us keep our money.''\n  Today, the arguments for tax relief have not changed. Taxes are still \ntoo high, the tax burden still falls too heavily on the middle class. \nThe big difference, however, is that this year--with this Congress--we \ncan do something about it.\n  We promised tax relief, and now we have to deliver. And as I said in \nmy testimony yesterday, we have to do it for what country western \nsinger Garth Brooks calls the ``hard hat, six-pack, achin'-back, flag-\nwavin', fun-lovin' crowd,'' because these are the people who work hard \nevery day, care for their children, pay their bills and finance the \ngrowth of big government with their hard-earned tax dollars. For years, \nthey have watched their paychecks grow smaller while Washington grows \nbigger. And last November they spoke out loud and clear. They voted for \nchange in the way things were done in Washington. They voted for less \ngovernment and lower taxes. They voted for a balanced budget. And, yes, \nthey voted for a $500 per child tax credit.\n  But even now, the old barons of Washington and the long-time \ndefenders of big government still do not get it. They do not understand \nthat every dollar Washington spends is one less dollar that taxpayers \ncan spend. And worst of all, they do not understand that it is not the \nGovernment's money to begin with. They just do not get it. But the \npeople do, and that is what counts.\n  And so what are we going to do about it? Well, the answer is simple: \nLet the taxpayers keep their money. And the way to begin this process \nis to pass the families first $500-per-child tax credit.\n  The families first tax credit means $25 billion annually to taxpayers \nacross America--$500 million to Minnesota alone. And 90 percent of the \nbenefits of the tax relief goes to families making annual incomes of \n$60,000 or less.\n  It is the largest, fairest, most progressive way of providing tax \nrelief for families, and it lives up to our Government and our \ncommitment of reducing the size of the Federal Government. By cutting \nGovernment spending to pay for middle-class tax relief, families first \nis the strongest response that we can send to the American people that \nwe heard their message, that we accept their mandate, and we will \ndeliver on our promises.\n  Mr. President, what we do in this Congress will be judged by the \nmiddle-class Americans who voted for us last November. And, Mr. \nPresident, what we do in this Congress, in this Chamber, will determine \nthe makeup of the next Congress. Republicans made a commitment to the \ntaxpayers, and I urge my colleagues to uphold that commitment as we \ncontinue to fight for the middle class and as we fight for fairness.\n  I yield back the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/18/senate-section/article/S1020-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1020-S1021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 GREENVILLE MIDDLE SCHOOL--A CLASS ACT\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, the newspaper USA Today recently initiated \nan ongoing series of articles spotlighting schools and educational \nprograms in the country that are both innovative and successful.\n  The first venture to be included in the series was the Builders Club \nat \n[[Page S1021]] Greenville Middle School in Greenville, AL.\n  I want to congratulate the teachers involved in this unique \ncommunity-service program and all the students at Greenville who \nparticipate in the Builders Club. They are setting an example that \nschools all over the Nation can follow.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the USA Today article on the Builders \nClub be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the USA Today, Jan. 4, 1995]\n\n                   Service Club Builds Good Citizens\n\n                           (By Tamara Henry)\n\n(This is the first in an ongoing USA Today series titled Class Acts, a \n    look inside some educational ventures across the USA that work \n                            remarkably well)\n\n       Greenville. AL.--To the 175 students at Greenville Middle \n     School, splinters, needle pricks and scissor cuts are marks \n     of valor--the price paid to serve the community.\n       On this day, approximately two dozen students are gathered \n     in teacher Judy Tindal's classroom to make Christmas \n     ornaments as appreciation gifts for community leaders.\n       ``Ouch,'' yells 11-year-old Laine English, struggling to \n     thread a needle needed to sew lace over a ball of cotton.\n       Her friends giggle.\n       ``There's the real fun over there, burning your fingers,'' \n     she deadpans, pointing to a group adding wings and halos to \n     the covered cotton balls.\n       ``That's right!'' agrees Amanda Myrick, II. ``Here's where \n     I burned myself with the hot glue gun.''\n       The students are all Members of the Builders Club, a 5-\n     year-old service organization funded by the state and \n     actively supported by the local Kiwanis Club. The middle \n     school is one of 23 public school systems in Alabama \n     participating in a statewide community service effort such as \n     this.\n       Nationally, thousands of school systems have what are \n     popularly called service learning programs. They promote the \n     notion that education is not complete until classroom studies \n     are used to solve real-life problems.\n       Activities run the gamut, from an Alternatives to Violence \n     high school program in Washington, D.C., to the creation of \n     an ecosystem in the desert in rural eastern Oregon by \n     elementary school pupils.\n       With its Builders Club Greenville has one of the largest \n     service learning projects in the state. Unlike a lot of extra \n     curricular activities that require top grades or special \n     skills, the Builders Club is open to all middle school \n     students willing to work on different projects during breaks \n     and at lunch, as well as after school.\n       Greenville students have 10 ongoing projects, including \n     frequent visits to nursing homes and development of a 5-acre \n     nature trail. The goal is to teach students about leadership, \n     loyalty, character and service, ``which is what they \n     absolutely have to have in order to be productive citizens,'' \n     says Judy Manning community education coordinator for Butler \n     County Schools, who spearheaded the group.\n       ``Children who are involved are more productive \n     academically,'' says superintendent Jimmie Lawrence. ``The \n     more involved kids are, the better they feel about \n     themselves. Self-esteem improves. They are better adjusted, \n     happier and have fewer disciplinary problems.''\n       Manning says the program's success is proven by its \n     membership numbers.\n       ``If they didn't enjoy it, they wouldn't join it. You can't \n     make middle school kids do anything they don't want to do,'' \n     she says.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/18/senate-section/article/S1020-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n    A TRIBUTE TO NANCY STILSON ON HER RETIREMENT FROM THE REDSTONE \n                     SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION CENTER\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Ms. Nancy \nStilson, Chief, Documents Reference Librarian at the Redstone \nScientific Information Center on the occasion of her retirement from \nGovernment service.\n  Ms. Stilson began her Government service career in Huntsville at \nRedstone Arsenal 41 years ago. She has worked in the documents section \nof the Redstone Scientific Information Center throughout her career. \nHer knowledge of the weapon and missile systems developed for the U.S. \nArmy have ranged from those developed in the early 1950's up to the \npresent time. Ms. Stilson has the respect and admiration of her \ncustomers who are scientists and engineers for the U.S. Army Missile \nCommand. Indeed Ms. Stilson, through her experience, has the equivalent \nof a Ph.D. in missile technology as her customers can attest. When \nscientific and technical information is needed, Ms. Stilson has been \nthe ``one stop shop'' for such information. Ms. Stilson has provided \nscientific and technical information to those designing, building, and \nfielding the Army's weapons and missile systems. In fact, if you could \ndesign an illustration of the components of the missile system, Ms. \nStilson would figure prominently in the section dealing with technical \ninformation. Through her career she has served both distinguished \nscientists such as Dr. Warner Von Braun, as well as bench scientists \nand engineers creating the nuts and bolts of missile components. During \nMs. Stilson's tenure, the scientific and technical library community \nadvanced to the capability of supporting the highly technical and \ncomplex Army that exists today. She heavily influenced the evolution of \nthe international collection of missile and rocketry that exists at the \nArmy's premier technical library, the Redstone Scientific Information \nCenter.\n  Mr. President, it is my pleasure to congratulate Nancy Stilson on her \nretirement and to thank her for many years of dedication and service to \nthe men and women of the U.S. Army.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/18/senate-section/article/S1021-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1021-S1022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                                 HAITI\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to report today on a visit I made to \nHaiti 2 weeks ago. It was a very brief visit, but I came away from it \nprofoundly moved.\n  I saw people, lots of people. Haiti, one of our closest neighbors, is \ncrowded to bursting with people. It has the highest population density \nin the Western Hemisphere.\n  And most of these people are poor, incredibly poor. Haiti's \nunemployment rate must be 50 percent. The people have no jobs, so they \njam the streets. They are struggling to survive on a few cents a day. \nIn the vast Cite Soleil slum, they line up to get water from truck-\nsupplied tanks--if and when the truck comes to deliver the water. \nGarbage and sewage are everywhere. Disease, including AIDS, is a \npervasive threat.\n  And yet, Mr. President, in the midst of all this suffering, I found \npeople anxious to shake my hand, to smile, and to say ``thank you.'' \nThank you? Why would they thank me, a foreigner surrounded by soldiers \nand policemen?\n  Mr. President, they were thanking me because I am an American. They \nwere thanking me because we, the American people, have given them the \nthing that is even more valuable than food to eat.\n  Mr. President, we have given the Haitian people security. For the \nfirst time in 3 years, the Haitian people do not have to cower in \ncorners fearing that they will be assaulted by thugs or dragged off to \nbe tortured. For the first time in 3 years, they are free to go into \nthe streets, laugh, dance, celebrate freedom. For the first time in 3 \nyears, they are free to go and tear down with their bare hands those \nyellow buildings--one of which I visited--from which they used to hear \nthe screams of people being tortured.\n  And why are they free? Because there are soldiers of the U.S. Army \n10th Mountain Division patroling the streets of Port-au-Prince and Cap \nHaitien. There are units of the United States Special Forces patroling \nthe streets of towns and villages throughout the interior of Haiti. The \nHaitian soldiers and police who used to terrorize them are being weeded \nout. And there are international police monitors from countries like \nBangladesh and Argentina and Jordan as well as the United States spread \nacross the country to work with and monitor the actions of Haitian \npolice and make sure that people no longer have to fear for their basic \nsecurity and rights.\n  Mr. President, last fall, I, along with many of my colleagues here, \nagonized over sending troops to Haiti. We wanted to help them escape \nfrom the hell that Raoul Cedras and his cronies had created for them. \nAfter all, if we would not defend human rights right next door, where \nwould we defend them? But it was not clear what would happen, and we \nall appreciated that there were risks.\n  Last Thursday, we received a jolting confirmation of the risk. We \nlearned of the death of Sfc. Gregory Cardott. I want to salute Sergeant \nCardott. He died in the finest tradition of the men and women of our \nArmed Forces, doing his duty, serving his country, contributing to \nmaking the world a better place for all of us to live. I want to \nexpress deep condolences and respect to \n[[Page S1022]] his wife Darlene and their two daughters, Elise and \nErica.\n  At the same time that we mourn Sergeant\n   Cardott, however, Mr. President, I believe we need to honor his \nmemory by recognizing that he died in a good cause. We are doing good \nin Haiti. We are improving people's lives.\n\n  Everyone I spoke to in Haiti confirmed it:\n  President Aristide asked me specifically to convey to you and my \nother fellow Senators the gratitude of the Haitian people for the \nAmerican intervention.\n  A Vermont soldier told me ``I'm proud of what we are doing in Haiti. \nThese people were desperate and we have given them hope.''\n  Most eloquent of all, in Cite Soleil, I saw a little boy, barefoot \nand in rags, pick up a shiny Swiss Army knife that Ray Kelly, the \nAmerican chief of the International Police Monitors, had dropped. I \nexpected him to run away with it. What did he do? He started shouting \nand running around among the policemen searching for the one who had \ndropped it, and returned it to Ray. What a wonderful affirmation of the \ngoodwill that our troops are earning for the United States in Haiti.\n  And, Mr. President, I believe that our intervention in Haiti has the \npotential to yield dividends elsewhere as well. By reinstalling a \ndemocratically elected President, Haiti has moved us one step closer to \na goal that we just recently have come very close to achieving: a \nWestern Hemisphere that is fully democratic. Unfortunately, though, \ndemocracy remains fragile in a number of our Latin American neighbors. \nMany people throughout Latin America, both advocates of democracy and \nits enemies, are watching Haiti for signals as to the resolve of the \nUnited States and our partners in the Organization of American States. \nBy defending democracy in Haiti, I believe that the United States and \nits international partners are reinforcing democracy throughout the \nhemisphere.\n  Mr. President, we have the makings of a success here, but the job is \nnot done. Haiti has a long way to go yet to entrench the rule of law, \nensure respect for democracy and human rights, and embark on \nsustainable economic development.\n  The security situation, while quite good compared to what we had \nfeared at the outset, remains tenuous. Many of the perpetrators of \nrepression remain free, not only because identification and \napprehension is not always easy but also because Haiti's judicial \nsystem is in such a shambles that it is not capable of trying those \naccused of crimes. Particularly in the more remote towns and villages \nof the country where the multinational force is unable to maintain a \nconstant presence, some of the old repressive elements continue to \nwield influence.\n  Since the multinational force is not large enough to eliminate this \nthreat completely, the Haitians are placing a high priority on \ncontinuation of the international security presence until they can \nfield a reliable, reformed police force of their own. Virtually \neveryone, both Haitian and American, with whom I spoke in Haiti \nexpressed fear that withdrawal of that presence before the Haitian \nGovernment has had time to train its police force would result in \nreassertion of control by the antidemocratic elements. President \nAristide asked me to convey to my fellow Senators his appeal that the \nU.S. Congress not require such a withdrawal.\n  In addition to security, Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about \nthe state of the Haitian judicial system. It does no good to arrest \nthose suspected of crimes if you do not have judges and prosecutors to \ntry them, courts in which to try them, and jails in which to put them \nif they\n are convicted. Haiti at the moment has none of these. People have to \nbe trained. Facilities have to be built and equipped. I am pleased that \nUSAID is in the process of launching a comprehensive effort to fill \nthese gaps. We are hoping that the Canadians and the French and other \ndonors will also join in. I also hope that President Aristide and his \ngovernment will take all steps necessary to ensure that this vital \neffort yield results rapidly.\n\n  At the same time that I support assistance to Haiti, however, Mr. \nPresident, I believe we also need to set realistic limits on that aid. \nWe need to forewarn the Haitians and our partners in the international \ndonor community that we will not put American troops at risk for very \nlong, that our pockets are shrinking, not expanding, and that there is \nmuch that Haiti needs that we will not be able to do. I disagree \nstrongly with those of my colleagues who have suggested that Haiti is a \nhopeless cause and that trying to help it at all is a waste of money \nand time. We can make a difference and we are making a difference, and \nI believe we would be representing the American people poorly if we \nsuspended that effort now and gave up the progress that we have made. \nBut we do need to prioritize. We cannot do it all.\n  Mr. President, the United States will in the course of the next 3 \nmonths hand over responsibility for maintaining security in Haiti to \nthe U.N. Mission in Haiti [UNMIH]. Consistent with our leadership role, \nan American will command UNMIH and the United States will provide half \nof its troops, but the United Nations will fund it. This will reduce \nsubstantially the ongoing risk and cost of the Haiti effort to the \nUnited States and its troops. In addition, the administration assures \nme that they are working closely with the Haitian Government to ensure \nthat training of the new Haitian police force will proceed rapidly so \nthat UNMIH itself can be terminated. This will eliminate the largest \nelement in the Haiti assistance program.\n  Mr. President, let me summarize the conclusions that I have drawn \nfrom my trip to Haiti. There are three:\n  First, the American intervention in Haiti has been successful in \nproviding security and thus hope to the Haitian people, and we would be \ndoing Sergeant Cardott and the other troops who risked their lives in \nthat effort an enormous disservice to terminate our effort now. \nParticipation in UNMIH is a good way to maintain the effort while \nreducing the cost.\n  Second, we cannot solve all of Haiti's problems, but there are some \nthat can only be solved with United States leadership. Specifically, \nonly we can lead a U.N. effort to maintain security in Haiti until the \nHaitian Government fields a retrained police force of its own. We must \nalso lead the effort to train that new police force. Finally, we must \nlead the effort to create a judicial system capable of defending \ndemocracy and human rights in Haiti.\n  Third, we must make clear to the Haitians and our partners in the \nassistance effort that United States participation is going to decline \nrapidly over time and that the Haitians must equip themselves as \nquickly as possible to take responsibility for their own affairs.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I want once again to salute the men and \nwomen of our Armed Forces serving in Haiti. They are doing a great job \nfor their country. In Haiti 2 weeks ago, thanks to them, I felt very \nproud to be an American.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/18/senate-section/article/S1021-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1022-S1023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                              ROGER MORIGI\n\n  MR. THURMOND. Mr. President perhaps once in a generation, one person \nwill emerge as a master artisan, a person whose vision, skills, and \ncreations not only inspire others, but set that artist apart from all \nothers practicing the craft. Until this past Wednesday, we were \nfortunate to have such a person, Mr. Roger Morigi, living in the \nMetropolitan area. His many sculptures and carvings not only paid \nhomage to the United States, but have been seen and enjoyed by \nliterally millions of people.\n  Mr. Morigi was a part of what is literally a vanishing breed of \nartists--stone carvers, individuals who create monuments to people and \nideas through the medium of rock. Not surprisingly, Mr. Morigi was a \nnative of Italy, the home of some of history's greatest artists, and a \ncountry where sculpting has always been an appreciated and valued art \nform. Born in Como and schooled in Milan, Mr. Morigi emigrated to New \nHaven, CT, where he and his father practiced their craft.\n  In the following years, Mr. Morigi became an accomplished artist as \nhe worked on projects in New Haven, New York City, New York State, \nNorth Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, West Virginia, and South \nCarolina. It was right here though, in the District of Columbia, where \nMr. Morigi spent most of his adult life and where his works are most \nprevalent. The U.S. \n[[Page S1023]] Supreme Court Building, the U.S. District Court \nBuilding, the Commerce Building, the Department of Justice Building, \nand the Department of Agriculture Building are just a few of the places \nwhere Morigi's works appear. Perhaps some of Mr. Morigi's most \nimpressive work is a part of the ornately decorated National Cathedral, \nwhere he worked and created stone carvings for almost three decades. \nOne of the most prominent carvings, that of Adam, is a part of the \ncathedral's main entrance and Morigi said of that work, according to \nthe Washington Post, ``I finished where God began.''\n  With each project he completed, not only did Mr. Morigi create a \npiece of artwork, he improved his skills and knowledge, which helped \nhim to earn the title of ``master stone carver emeritus'' and to be \ncharacterized by some as the ``greatest carver of the 20th Century''. \nPerhaps more importantly, he used his talents to craft pieces that \nbeautified and paid a lasting tribute to his adopted homeland, the \nUnited States. While this great artist will be missed, his creations \nwill ensure that he is never forgotten. My sympathies go out to Mr. \nMorigi's wife, Louise; and children, Francis and Elayne.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/18/senate-section/article/S1022-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

The clerk will report the pending business.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1) to curb the practice of imposing unfunded \n     Federal mandates on States and local governments; to \n     strengthen the partnership between the Federal Government and \n     State, local and tribal governments; to end the imposition, \n     in the absence of full consideration by Congress, of Federal \n     mandates on State, local, and tribal governments without \n     adequate funding, in a manner that may displace other \n     essential governmental priorities; and to ensure that the \n     Federal Government pays the costs incurred by those \n     governments in complying with certain requirements under \n     Federal statutes and regulations, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Committee amendment No. 11, beginning on page 25, line 11, \n     pertaining to committee jurisdiction.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We now return to the pending question, which \nis the committee amendment on page 25, line 11.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, for the past week, the U.S. Senate has \nrenewed debate on the issue of unfunded Federal mandates. Senate bill \n1, which curbs unfunded Federal mandates, is a fundamental change in \nthe way we do business in the Congress and it is a fundamental change \nin our relationship with State and local governments.\n  As I mentioned when I introduced S.1, Congress has gotten away from \nthe fundamentals as envisioned by our Founding Fathers. We shouldn't be \nhere to dictate to the States. We are to be here on behalf of our \nStates--representing and protecting the interests of each sovereign \nState.\n  Mr. President, each of the States, and more than 87,000 other \nmunicipalities are anxiously and carefully following this debate on \nunfunded mandates and more importantly, the 10th amendment, as it \nunfolds here on the floor of the Senate.\n  But they're not just watching the debate; they are following our \nlead. In my home State of Idaho, the State legislature is ready to \naddress the issue of unfunded State mandates. Our new Governor, Phil \nBatt, pledged to stem the flow of unfunded mandates from the State onto \nIdaho's cities and counties.\n  Legislation has now been introduced to do just that, and this \nafternoon, Mr. President, the Idaho State Senate's Local Government and \nTaxation Committee will hold it's first hearing on Senate bill 1003, \nIdaho's Community Regulatory Relief Act introduced by State Senator Rod \nBeck.\n  Governor Batt and Senator Beck should be applauded for recognizing \nthat we not only must improve the partnership between Federal and State \ngovernments, but also between State and local governments.\n  Mr. President, I would also add that this morning, the Idaho State \nSenate passed a joint memorial--Senate Joint Memorial No. 102--similar \nto resolutions and memorials passed by several other States which calls \non the Federal Government to observe the 10th amendment to the \nConstitution and to ended mandates that are beyond the scope of its \nconstitutionally delegated powers. Our distinguished majority leader, \nSenator Dole, has pledged to help this body remember the 10th \namendment, and each week the Senate is in session he will insert the \n10th amendment into the Congressional Record.\n  Again, Mr. President, our efforts here in Congress to own up to our \nresponsibilities and to stop shifting our burdens onto States and local \ngovernment are not going unnoticed. I'm proud to be a part of this \ngreat movement to restore trust in this institution, to enhance our \npartnership with States and local governments, and to see the States \nestablishing similar partnerships with cities and counties.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my suggestion \nthat there is an absence of a quorum, I will retain the floor so that \nwe can proceed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator suggesting the absence of a \nquorum?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, may I make a parliamentary inquiry before \nthe quorum?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Idaho withhold his \nsuggestion of the absence of a quorum so that the Senator from \nCalifornia may make a parliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Yes, I would withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would just like to know exactly where we \nare because I was intending to offer a second-degree amendment to one \nof the committee amendments. I wanted to make sure that would still be \nin order at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has the floor. \nAmendments to the committee amendment are in order.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n   [[Page S1025]] Mr. President, now that we have both managers on this \nbill, I would like to proceed and lay out what course of action we \nwould like to follow. What I will be doing is seeking a unanimous-\nconsent agreement so that the pending amendment before us can be laid \naside.\n  The reason that I will make that request is because a motion to table \nthat last night was not successful. During the hours since then, \ndifferent concerned Senators have been discussing what sort of \nmodifications might be made to that amendment language. Since there has \nbeen no agreement at this time, it will be my request that we lay that \naside so we can then take up the next pending committee amendment which \nwould be before us. We would dispense with that committee amendment so \nthat we can keep moving. So that is going to be my intent.\n  Again, as I just confer with the other manager, I would again suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been suggested. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition while there is \na lull in the action on the pending legislation to talk for a few \nminutes about the pending issues before the Judiciary Committee on \npossible legislation regarding the antitrust exception which might have \nan impact on the current baseball strike.\n  I believe that it is highly unlikely--virtually impossible--for the \nCongress of the United States to act on an antitrust exemption to have \nany meaningful impact on the pending strike and, therefore, urge in the \nstrongest possible terms that both parties return to the negotiating \ntable to work in a collective bargaining sense to end the strike and \nbring baseball to the playing field this spring.\n  I have had long reservations about the antitrust exemption as it \napplies to baseball, as it applies to other major sports, like \nfootball, which has an antitrust exemption for revenue sharing, and \nparticipated more than a decade ago, in 1982, in extensive hearings \nwhen the Los Angeles Raiders, then the Oakland Raiders, were proposing \na move. And those hearings were very important and raised some of the \nsame considerations which are now pending on the baseball strike.\n  As we have moved forward in the consideration of the complex issues \non the antitrust exemption, my view has been to retain the exemption as \nit impacts on the Pirates, which are a major factor in Pittsburgh, and \na major constituent interest of mine. If we eliminate the antitrust \nexemption, we will have bedlam with respect to franchise changes. I \nnotice my colleague Senator Gorton nodding in agreement because of the \nimpact on the Seattle baseball team.\n  One thing is certain, Mr. President, and that is that it is highly \nunlikely, I am almost certain, that Congress is going to act with any \nspeed, and I think that Congress should not act, should not get \ninvolved in the midst of a labor dispute, where there are very, very \nserious issues, to try to affect the outcome of that labor dispute. At \nthe present time, the Judiciary Committee is totally involved in the \nconsideration of the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. \nAnd on the Senate floor we are involved in very complex legislation on \ntaking away mandates by the Federal Government which are not paid for. \nThere is a very, very heavy agenda on economic issues, budget issues, \ntrying to reduce the size of Government, trying to reduce spending, and \nthe consideration of tax cuts, so that far behind on the back burner is \nthis issue of changing the antitrust exemption.\n  My comments this morning are prompted, in part, by this banner \nheadline in the Philadelphia Inquirer this morning: ``Phillies \nPresident Blasts Union, Hinting at Player Defections.''\n  Bill Giles is president of the Philadelphia Phillies, and he is a \nvery, very mild-mannered man. I cannot remember a headline on Bill \nGiles speaking out in such emphatic terms. What he is saying bears \ndirectly on my comments, where he makes the statement that ``The union \nhas spent most of their energy in Washington trying to do away with our \nantitrust exemption instead of negotiating and trying to grow the \ngame.''\n  I have been in frequent contact with Mr. Don Fehr, head of the union, \nasking him what help I could be or what help the Senate could be in a \nconstructive way in trying to bring the strike to a close. I first made \nthat contact with Mr. Fehr last summer before the strike started on \nAugust 12. And at the same time period, I talked to the acting \ncommissioner, Bud Selig, and the officials of both the Philadelphia \nPhillies and Pittsburgh Pirates, my two home State teams, to see what \nhelp we could be. The antitrust exemption came up briefly last fall on \nthe Judiciary Committee calendar, and it was voted down, I think, \nlargely because of a sense that the Congress and the Senate should not \nget involved in a pending labor dispute. The issue in Pittsburgh is \nespecially touchy at the present time because the Pittsburgh Pirates \nare up for sale, and the Pirates have been kept in Pittsburgh by a \nconsortium of hometown business people who have bought the Pirates, to \nkeep it in Pittsburgh. That is a difficult matter because the Pirates \nare losing so much money, which is a source of the controversy today \nwhich has led to the strike. The Pirates have had a prospective buyer, \nJohn Rigas, of Coudersport, PA. I have been trying to be helpful in \nmeeting with officials of the Pittsburgh Pirates to see if that sale \ncould be effectuated. That sale is going to be held up because of the \nuncertainty of what is going to happen in the strike and to the \nantitrust exemption.\n  Obviously, I speak as only one Senator, one member of the Judiciary \nCommittee. I think that given the complexity of the Judiciary Committee \ncalendar, and given the complexity of the Senate calendar, and the \ncomplexity of the House calendar, it is as close to a certainty as \nanything can be that there is not going to be legislation coming out of \nthe Congress between now and April on the antitrust exemption. There \nare too many things ahead of it. If it did come to the floor, I think \nmany would agree with my position that the Congress ought not to \nintervene to try to alter--ought not to change the level playing field. \nThat is an expression we use very frequently about our debates on many \nsubjects, but it is certainly applicable not to change the level \nplaying field when we talk to the baseball effort.\n  What the Phillies' president has had to say on one end of my State, \nand what is happening with the Pirates at the other end of my State, \ntrying to sell the team to keep it in Pittsburgh, I hope that the \nparties will go back to the bargaining table and will settle the \ndispute so that we can have baseball this spring, and not to look to \nthe Congress to try to intervene, which is not our place and is so \nhighly unlikely on the current state of the record. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/18/senate-section/article/S1025-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1025-S1028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNFUNDED MANDATE REFORM ACT\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 31\n\n     (Purpose: To prevent the adoption of certain national history \n                               standards)\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, what is a more important part of our \nNation's history for our children to study--George Washington or Bart \nSimpson? Is it more important that they learn about Roseanne Arnold, or \nhow America defeated communism as the leader of the free world?\n  According to this document--the recently published ``National \nStandards for United States History''--the answers are not what \nAmericans would expect. With this set of standards, our students will \nnot be expected to know George Washington from the man in the Moon. \nAccording to this set of standards, America's democracy rests on the \nsame moral footing as the Soviet Union's totalitarian dictatorship.\n  Mr. President, this set of standards must be stopped, abolished, \nrepudiated, repealed. It must be recalled like a shipload of badly \ncontaminated food. Today, before our children are asked to spend their \nevenings studying Bart Simpson instead of Benjamin Franklin's discovery \nof electricity, these standards must be abolished.\n  My amendment will stop this set of standards from becoming a guide \nfor teaching history in America's classrooms. In order to stop this \nperverted idea in its tracks, and to ensure that it does not become, de \nfacto, a guide for our Nation's classrooms, it must be publicly and \nofficially repudiated by this Congress.\n  That is precisely what this amendment seeks to do.\n  These standards are ideology masquerading as history. These standards \nwould have us reinvent America's history. They are terribly damaging, \nand they constitute a gross distortion of the American story from its \nconceptual foundations to the present.\n  America's story is both triumph and tragedy, but mostly triumph, of \nflawed yet unprecedented accomplishment. But in this teachers' and \ntextbook manual it becomes a sordid tale ``drenched in dark \nskepticism,'' as a Wall Street Journal editorial put it, emphasizing \nwhat is negative in America's past, while celebrating only politically \ncorrect culture and causes.\n\n\n               (I) The Standard Project's Initial Charter\n\n  The history standards project began as a response to the alarming \nilliteracy of our Nation's children about their own, national history. \nCitizens of a pluralistic, democratic society must have\n a deep, historically based understanding of our liberties' origins and \ninstitutions, and appreciate the corresponding responsibilities \nessential for our survival as a nation, as a people.\n\n  Such an appreciation is dependent on a mastery of basic American \nhistory. The founding truths of this country may have been self-evident \nto the Founders, but as studies have demonstrated again and again, they \nare not genetically transmitted.\n  William Bennett in his book, ``The De-Valuing of America,'' \nunderscores the urgency of our problem in his call for ``true reliable \nnational standards.'' He cites the Finn/Ravitch study ``What Do Our \nChildren Know?'' that revealed 43 percent of our high school seniors \ncould not place World War I between 1900 and 1950. More than two-thirds \nof them did not know even the half-century in which the Civil War took \nplace. And more than 75 percent were unable to place within 20 years \nwhen Abraham Lincoln was President.\n  One-third of all high school students tested in 1986 did not know \nthat the Declaration of Independence marked the American colonists' \nbreak from England. Sixty percent did not know that the Federalist \nPapers was written to urge ratification of the Constitution, and 40 \npercent could not say even approximately when the Constitution was \nwritten and ratified. Only three students in five were able to \nrecognize a definition of the system of checks and balances that \ndivides power among the three branches of our Federal Government.\n  If, as Lincoln believed, the liberty and prosperity of a nation such \nas ours is dependent on the ``mystic chords of memory,'' then we are \nindeed, as William Bennett's 1981 national literacy report evidenced, \n``A Nation at Risk.''\n\n\n                  (ii) we didn't get what we paid for\n\n  In 1992, when UCLA's National Center for History in the Schools won \nthe bid to produce national guidelines for American and World history \ncurricula, they were given three basic tasks:\n  First, to develop guidelines by which to determine the most important \nhistorical material for students to learn;\n  Second, to develop a balanced and objective document; and\n  Third, to develop a consensus process that would consider many \nperspectives from many different sources.\n  After 2 years and more than $2 million of the American taxpayers' \nmoney, the history project has failed to reach any of these goals.\n  Let members examine a sample of some of the outrageous examples found \non almost every page of these documents. As we look at this\n material, we should keep in mind that President Bush and all the \nNation's Governors, at the national educational summit in \nCharlottesville, VA, in 1989, recommended the development of national \nstandards based upon what was most worth knowing.\n\n\n(iii) these proposed standards do not concentrate on what is most worth \n                                knowing\n\n  Examples:\n  First, George Washington makes only a fleeting appearance in the \nstandards. He is never described as our first President.\n  Second, the Constitution: The Constitution is not mentioned in the 31 \ncore standards, although the standards mention the Depression three \ntimes.\n  Third, central figures and events in American political, cultural, \nand scientific life are either barely noted--in a 300 page book--or \nthey simply disappear from the story of America's past. Important \nhistorical issues, such as the development of the role of Congress in \nour Federal Government are not discussed. Under these standards, Paul \nRevere and his midnight ride will never capture the imagination of our \nchildren. Ben Franklin's discovery of electricity will not encourage \nyoung scientists to seek out their own discoveries that can change the \nworld.\n  Fourth, significant historical figures pivotal to America's past, \nsuch as Daniel Webster and Robert E. Lee, vanish. Titans who exemplify \nscientific progress in American history are also omitted from the \nstandards. With these standards in place, our children will not learn \nof Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, the Wright brothers, or Albert \nEinstein. Americans who changed the entire world for the better will \ncease to exist.\n  As Robert Park of the American Physical Society has noted, the only \nreference to science in the standards is as an activity from which \nwomen have been excluded. Nothing else about the \n[[Page S1027]] history of science is apparently worth mentioning.\n  While the standards ignore people such as Webster, deemphasize George \nWashington and the founding of America, ignore our political heritage, \nand abandon our accomplishments in technology--there is no shortage of \ncelebratory information of the politically correct inclusive variety.\n  Thus, American students in the standards are asked to ``assess the \nsurvival strategies and construct historical assessments of people such \nas Prudence Crandall, Prince Hall, and Speckled Snake.'' They are asked \nto ``analyze the reflection of values in popular TV shows'' such as \nRoseanne and the Simpsons.\n  Where are the priorities in the standards?\n  Given the limited amount of time our kids have to master the basics \nof their Nation's history, are these information fragments more \nimportant than George Washington and the Constitutional Convention?\n\n\n              (IV) preemptive strike at critics back home\n\n  Do not misunderstand me. I certainly believe it is important to tell \nthe whole story of America. Our history should be inclusive. It should \nstudy previously neglected groups and individuals who made real \ncontributions to our common heritage. It should examine our Nation's \ntragedies--the sub-human treatment of Native Americans, the crime \nagainst humanity over which we fought our bloodiest war to abolish, the \nbattle for women's rights, Jim Crow and the great sacrifices made by so \nmany during the civil rights movement of the 1960's, the ongoing battle \nfor the complete realization of our Nation's founding first principle, \nthat all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator \nwith certain unalienable rights--all these are parts of our history \nabout which our children should learn.\n  But let us disabuse ourselves of the modern conceit that this great \nfirst principle was a 1960's innovation. I think of George Washington's \nletter to a Hebrew congregation in which he compares America's right to \nreligious freedom with the, at best, begrudging religious ``tolerance'' \nof other nations.\n\n       It is now no more that toleration is spoken of as if it \n     were the indulgence of one class of people that another \n     enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural right, for, \n     happily, the government of the United States, which gives to \n     bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires \n     only that they who live under its protection should demean \n     themselves as good citizens. * * * May the children of the \n     Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit \n     and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants, while every \n     one shall sit safely under his own vine and fig tree, and \n     there shall be none to make him afraid.\n\n  Proponents of this manual will tell you that the proposed American \nhistory standards devote more than 40 pages to colonial and early \nnational periods. What is emphasized in those 40 pages, however, is the \nseparate histories of different groups based on race, ethnicity, \ngender, and class, at the expense of what is most important for \nstudents to know--the building of a nation, of ``a people'', and the \nconstitutional development of the American Republic, still the envy and \nthe prototype for emerging democracies around the world.\n\n\n                     (V) politically correct drivel\n\n  The standards suggest that students ``analyze Pontiac's speech to the \nFrench on the reasons for making war in 1763, and compare his reasons \nwith those of Opechancanough in 1622 and Metacomet (King Philip) in \n1676. No doubt an interesting question for a graduate\n seminar, but is that something every child in America should learn?\n\n  Mr. President, Americans not yet familiar with this monument to \npolitical correctness will be astonished to learn that at the same time \nthat the standard focus on such arcane issues, they fail to discuss \nwhat are perhaps the most important documents in American \nconstitutional history.\n  America's constitutional achievement: The Federalist papers, Nos. 10 \nand 51, which explain why checks and balances are crucial to our \nliberties, are omitted altogether. Madison, Hamilton, Jay are never \nidentified as the Federalist papers' authors. In fact, the only \nreference to the Federalist papers is a brief mention of No. 84. This \nis appalling. Today the Federalist papers are among the most important \nteaching documents used by civic educators in the new democracies of \nCentral and Eastern Europe. It is ridiculous that the authors of these \nnational standards in American history, in 300 pages, could not find \nroom for the most eloquent articulation of our entire constitutional \nsystem ever written.\n\n\n  (VI) the proposed national standards are not balanced and objective\n\n  The few belief examples will have to suffice but I invite you to \npursue all 300 pages at your leisure.\n  The cold war; Both the American history standards and the world \nhistory standards present this historical battle for the hearts and \nminds of the human race as just another conflict between two \nsuperpowers. Never mind that the Soviet Union murdered 65 million of \nits own people, its rulers forever justifying any and all ``means,'' at \nthe same time that Americans were debating constitutional rights of due \nprocess for every citizen, while at the same time providing a shield \nfor the independence of free nations around the world. Americans and \nfree people around the world believed these differences were worthy of \nthe lives of their sons and daughters, sacrificed in the hills of Korea \nand jungles of Vietnam for the cause of freedom. But this great contest \nfor minds and lives is ignored in their standards. There is no mention \nof the contending ideologies. The enormous sacrifice of American \ntaxpayers, particularly during the Reagan administration to bring the \nSoviet monster to its knees is a matter of indifference to these \nstandard netters.\n  And yet there are 19 references to McCarthyism, is though this \nregrettable but relatively short episode in our story is the central \nreality of the cold war. This is outrageous ideological distortion, \nrendering the victory of the free world under U.S. leadership \nessentially irrelevant.\n  The standards describe the nature of this sacrifice in the way:\n\n       The swordplay of the Soviet Union and the United States \n     rightfully claims attention because it led to the Korean and \n     Vietnam wars as well as the Berlin Airlift, Cuban Missile \n     Crisis, American interventions in many parts of the world (no \n     mention of Soviet staged revolutions and mass murders in its \n     client states, or of any ``intervention'' at all).\n\n  What would all those desperate prisoners still locked within Castro's \npolice state say about this equating of American and Soviet ends in the \ngreat battle of our century?\n  The standards actually refer to ``the U.S.S.R.'s desire for security \nin Eastern Europe'' as something normal and of understandable national \ninterest. Tell that to the Balts, Czechs, Poles, and Hungarians, \nRumanians, and others.\n  American immigrants: The world standards refer to the immigrants who \ncame to the United States during the 19th century as ``intrusive \nEuropean Migrants''--page 234. This might be the first effort by \nhistorians to put the millions of Scandinavians, Jews, Italians, \nGreeks, Poles, Czechs, Hungarians who went through Ellis Island, and \nthe earlier arrivals, the Irish, Germans, and other pioneer immigrants, \ntogether and in a negative light. The American standards emphasize the \ndiscrimination many immigrants faced in the United States, but nowhere \nin the document is there any discussion of the great success story of \nthe descendants of European, Asian, African, and Hispanic immigrants in \ntheir new country.\n  Poverty in America: The section on the history of debate over the \nextent of poverty in the United States asks students to read Michael \nHarrington, an advocate of the Great Society Federal antipoverty \nprograms, but never suggest that students read critics of the program's \nbig Government approach, such as Thomas Sowell, George Gilder, and \nMilton Friedman. Those scholars simply do not exist.\n  The world history guidelines whitewash the less attractive historical \nbackgrounds of many non-Western civilizations. In fact, Western \ncivilization is buried as a relatively minor element of the world we \nlive in today. For example, Aztec achievements are lauded, but human \nsacrifices are ignored. It may as well have never happened. By \ncontrast, extensive examinations of Western imperialism are both legion \nand repetitive.\n  The world history standards warn against ethnocentricm and bias, but \nthe only examples given are of Western \n[[Page S1028]] ethnocentricity and Western bias. Thus Greek images of \nthe Persians are described as ``ethnocentric'' and students are asked\n to read John of Plano, a 13th century papal emissary, on the Mongal \nthreat and analyze his social and cultural biases about the Mongols.\n\n  The world history standards fail to note that although slavery ended \nin the West during the 19th century, at the cost of the blood of \nhundreds of thousands of sons of the intrusive European immigrants, \nslavery continues to exist today as it has for millenia in the non-\nWest, according to official United Nations reports.\n  These world history standards do not compare and contrast political \nsystems in the West and the non-West during the 19th and 20th \ncenturies.\n  Thus, teachers are not encouraged to compare Western democracies with \nAsian and African despotism. Nor are post-1989 students encouraged to \nconsider the Communist ideal versus the historical reality. Why not \ncompare the Soviet Socialist experiment with the American story in the \n20th century, or contrast Lenin's reign of terror with Washington's \nleadership? Too unimportant to consider seems to be the view of these \nstandard makers.\n  Our students need to know the theoretical foundations of our \nliberties. They need to learn why the dictatorship of the proletariat \nfailed in its promised bliss.\n  The world history standards assert that students should be able to \nassess the accomplishments and costs of Communist rule in China during \nMao's Great Leap Forward of 1958. Current estimates of the costs are 30 \nmillion murders of Mao's own fellow citizens. Why not ask students to \nanalyze the Great Leap Forward itself, rather than to suggest that its \naccomplishments may have been worth its costs? A truly suitable \nactivity? Read Jung Chaing's ``Life and Death in Shanghai,'' a record \nof the arrests, mock trials, endless imprisonment, the beatings, the \ninnocent children murdered--all in the name of social progress during \nMao's Cultural Revolution.\n  As recently reported in the Nation's newspapers, apologists for this \nproject will tell you this is ``work in progress.'' Nothing to be \nalarmed about. Changes can be made.\n  Mr. President, this does not look like work in progress. Nothing in \nits content, nothing in its introductory chapters indicates that it is \nto be modified. It is a finished project.\n  At the present time, there are 10,000 copies of the United States, \nworld, and K-4 history standards in circulation. These copies are in \nuse throughout the educational world. In some cases they are already \nbeing used as curriculum guidelines. They are in the hands of textbook \npublishers, curriculum writers, and other education experts. Funded by \ntaxpayers money, UCLA has been selling the standards books--$18 for \nindividuals and $24 for groups--and they are making money.\n  Last Saturday, an apologist for the project was quoted in the\n   Washington Post saying, ``We shouldn't try to throw out the entire \nbarrel just because there are a few bad apples in it.''\n\n  Do not believe it. It is the opinion of Lynn Cheney, who herself \nauthorized this project as Chairman of the National Endowment of the \nHumanities; Dr. Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, a professor of history and \nwomen's studies at Emory who was on the project's National Council, \nGilbert Sewall, director of the American Textbook Council, also on the \nproject's advisory board; and many others directly involved from its \nconception that these standards are beyond any hope of salvaging--much \nto their own great disappointment as much of their personal time and \nefforts were offered to the cause.\n  I agree. These standards must be junked in total.\n  The problem is not one of mere detail. The problem is in its \nphilosophical foundations. Those foundations are fundamentally anti-\nWestern, and anti-American in their conceptual framework. The \ncorrection of a few of the worst excesses will not remove that anti-\nAmerican, anti-Western formulation at its base. And it is a most \nserious problem. Whether or not the standards are certified by the \nstill to be created Goals 2000 NESIC Board, according to Gilbert Sewall \nand many others, the way in which the textbook establishment works, \nthis manual, having the extraordinary prestige of being the first \nnational curriculum guide, will become, de facto, official if not \nstrongly repudiated. As Dr. Sewall has stated, ``It will be the first \ndraft of the next generation of textbooks.''\n  Right now, there are 10,000 copies of these standards being \ncirculated among leading American educators. Like the infamous \nexploding Pinto, these manuals pose a horrendous threat to the vitality \nand accuracy of American history education, and they must be recalled.\n  Mr. President, I have been in favor of national standards. Although I \nhad serious reservations, I added my vote to Goals 2000. The \ndevelopment of this ideologically driven, anti-Western monument to \npolitically correct caricature is not what the Congress envisioned, nor \nis it what the American people paid for. The purpose of this amendment \nis therefore publicly to repudiate its continued use and stop its \nfurther influence. Should such a project ever be taken up again, and I \nam not at all sure it should be, in light of this experience, it must \nbe undertaken by scholars with at least a passable understanding of and \ndecent respect for this country and for its roots in Western \ncivilization.\n  On the eve of the Civil War in March 1861, in his first inaugural \naddress, Abraham Lincoln reminded the troubled country of the \nimportance of our shared and common past:\n\n       Though passion may have strained, it must not break our \n     bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching \n     from every battlefield and patriot grave, to every living \n     heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet \n     swell the chorus of the union, when again touched, as surely \n     they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\n\n  The proposed national standards in American history are designed to \nand will destroy our Nation's mystic chords of memory, so eloquently \ninvoked by Lincoln 130 years ago.\n  Those mystic chords of memory are already perilously frayed. Study \nafter study demonstrates the wounding absence of a shared knowledge of \nour Nation's history. These standards would only serve to deepen that \nwound, and so they must be rejected.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to address the pending \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, if one is not aware of the history of \nthis issue over the past decade or so, this amendment might seem like \none that we ought to concentrate on and seriously consider.\n  It brings up the issue of educational standards, but it takes our \nattention away from the basic reasons for the development of the Goals \n2000.\n  When these goals were developed by the Governors in 1989, it came as \na result of a 1983 report called ``A Nation at Risk.''\n  That report was released by the Secretary of Education at the time, \nTed Bell, who served as Secretary of Education during the Reagan \nadministration. It described serious deficiencies in our educational \nsystem. Those results have been verified by many studies including the \nsomewhat recent Work Force 2000 report which pointed out very \nimportantly and very critically that this Nation is not presently \nprepared to compete in the international market and will be less so in \nthe future.\n  Here are some of the problems that created the demand for Goals 2000. \nToo many of our people right now do not even graduate from high school. \nBut much more seriously is that only half of those who presently \ngraduate have what is considered an acceptable basic education. Even \nmore troubling is the fact that two-thirds of that half are \nfunctionally illiterate to one degree or another. They do not have the \nbasic skills necessary to handle an entry level job. This means that \nour school system turns out millions of young people each year needing \nremedial education before they can effectively help us compete in the \nworld economy.\n  The purpose of ``A Nation at Risk'' was to raise awareness that our \nNation was facing a serious crisis. The standard of living had been \nslipping for the past decade or more and would continue to slip if we \ndid not raise the quality of our education.\n  In the late 1980's, the business community was concerned that \neducational reform was not being implemented, even after President Bush \nhad convened the national education summit and the Nation's Governors \nhad created the goals which, with the input of Congress, are now \nreferred to as Goals 2000.\n  The need for progress on this issue was important to the business \ncommunity. I remember very well the first meeting I had in my office as \na new Senator and as member of the Education Subcommittee with a group \nof this Nation's top CEO's whose firms were involved in international \nventures. I expected that they might come to me and say, ``We have to \ndo something about capital gains.''\n  They did not. They said that we must fully fund Head Start. If the \nUnited States did not make sure that everyone had the advantage of \npreschool training, early childhood education, and other compensatory \nprograms, we would not produce the kind of high school graduates who \nwould be able to compete internationally.\n  Our educational failures impact the business community, especially in \nthose areas of graduate education which are so critical to our \ncompetitive edge in high-technology fields. Right now, about 40 percent \nof the slots for graduate schools in critical areas of science, \nengineering, and mathematics go to foreign students because they are \nmore competitive for those slots.\n  That used to be fine, and I remember in my own State we had many \nforeign students who went to graduate school and ultimately worked for \nIBM. These days, unfortunately, foreign graduate students are not \nstaying here. They are not returning the advantage of their skills and \nknowledge to our industries. They are all going home. In other words, \nwe are sending about 40 percent of graduates from our schools, which \nare the best in the world, to work for our competitors.\n  I wished to raise this specter because this is the kind of problem \nwhich national standards should address. When we passed Goals 2000, we \nset forth a set of voluntary national goals and standards. In addition \nto the original goals proposed by President Bush and the 50 Governors, \nwe expanded upon the goal for math and science competitiveness and \nadded such subjects as history and arts.\n  What we are talking about today is the beginning of a process of \ndeveloping standards which are necessary for our ability to compete in \nthe international economy. I would hate to think we will begin debating \nsubjects which are important but unrelated to the more important issue \nof competitiveness and thereby disparage our national and worldwide \nstandards.\n  Recently, members of the business community spoke about job training \nbefore the Labor Committee and said that we must enforce worldwide \neducational standards for our people can become qualified for the work \nforce of the future. If people do not understand the requirements, they \nwill continue presuming that the standards which we have been \nutilizing, the ones which we feel are an acceptable education, are \nquite all right.\n  People fail to realize that students in Taiwan graduate 2 years ahead \nof our students in science and math. In addition, studies show that not \nonly are we removed from the list of top nations in science and math \nachievement, but that we are at the bottom of the heap.\n  My point is that we must concentrate on why the Goals 2000 bill was \ndeveloped. It was deemed necessary to improve the standard of living of \nthe Nation: To improve our standards and our competitiveness. While it \nis important for us to stay informed about recommendations for \nimportant subjects such as history, I am concerned that we will begin \nto forget why we are here, and that is to save the Nation.\n  I will introduce a second-degree amendment at an appropriate time \nwhich will address the concern of my good friend, the Senator from \nWashington, regarding the development of certain standards at the UCLA \nCenter for History in Schools, those standards \n[[Page S1030]] which have raised considerable controversy. But we must \nremember that those standards have not been adopted by anyone, and they \nare not in a form to be adopted. In fact, the panel which would approve \nthem has not even been named yet. So we are prematurely criticizing \nsomething which is not even ready to be adopted.\n  But more importantly, the amendment requires that anything \nmeritorious or relevant or acceptable that is in those standards should \nnot be used. Now, I am not sure whether that means the acceptable \nelements could be proposed and later approved, or not. The amendment \ndoes not say. It simply states that the standards cannot be used and \nthat no more money can go to them.\n  Therefore my amendment will leave in the final paragraph of the \namendment of the Senator from Washington, which states the concern \nabout how we adopt the history standards, but will remove that part \nwhich states that we should simply throw away everything that has been \ndone in this area and prohibits the information from being used.\n  Out of a very substantial number of examples in the history \nstandards, only a very few have provoked great controversy. Therefore, \nI will speak again later, when I offer my amendment. But I just want \neveryone to realize that the critical goal is to have an educational \nsystem second to none which will keep the United States competitive in \nthe next century by providing the necessary skilled work force.\n  I will also mention the cost of doing nothing and the cost of trying \nto do away with these standards. Right now, over $25 billion each year \nare spent by our businesses on remedial education because of the \nfailures of our school system. In addition, we have about a half a \ntrillion dollars loss in the economy due to illiteracy, imprisonment, \nand the many other social ills that result from educational shortfalls. \nThis is an extremely important issue, and I hope that we will remain \nfocused on the primary issue of developing a more competitive nation \nfor the future.\n  Mr. President, I must oppose the amendment offered by my colleague \nfrom Washington. The amendment, which has not been subject to any \nhearings or review by the committee of jurisdiction, prohibits the \nNational Education Goals Panel and the National Education Standards and \nImprovement Council from certifying any voluntary national content \nstandards in the subject of history.\n  As my colleagues may recall, under the Bush administration grants \nwere awarded to independent agencies, groups, and institutions of \nhigher education to develop worldclass standards in all the major \nsubject areas.\n  The history standards were developed by the UCLA Center for History \nin Schools with the contribution of hundreds of individual teachers, \nscholars and historians. The standards, which have just recently been \npublished, have raised concern among some readers. Criticism has \nfocused not on the standards themselves but upon the examples of \nactivities for students in each grade level. Of the thousands of \nexamples, not more than 25 were considered controversial. However, upon \nreceipt of public input and criticism the Center for History in Schools \nis reviewing and altering its work. This, in fact is, and should be, \nthe appropriate process and primary purpose of public commentary.\n  But, I am not here to defend the specific content of these \nstandards--that is best left to teachers, educators, and parents. \nInstead, I am concerned that this amendment has much broader \nimplications.\n  At issue is not so much the specific substance of these standards. \nIndeed, the standards have neither been endorsed by any Federal body \nnor, for that matter, even been finalized. Rather, the issue is whether \nor not we have in place a process for developing world class standards. \nI cannot overstate the importance of this matter. Countless reports \nhave outlined that our country is falling behind in international test \ncomparisons because our children have not learned the necessary skills \nin order to compete successfully.\n  A recent survey of Fortune 500 companies showed that 58 percent \ncomplained of the difficulty of finding employees with basic skills. \nThe chief executive officer of Pacific Telesis reported: Only 4 out of \nevery 10 candidates for entry-level jobs at Pacific Telesis are able to \npass our entry exam, which are based on a seventh-grade level.\n  It is no longer enough for Vermont to compare itself to the national \naverage. Comparing one State with another is like the local football \nteam believing itself to be a champion of national stature because it \nbeat the cross town rival. No, we must compare ourselves with our real \ncompetitors--the other nations of this global marketplace. To date, it \nappears that they are quickly outpacing us in many pivotal areas.\n  I have had meetings upon meetings with the chairmen and CEO's of \nmajor U.S. corporations to urge me to support the development of high \nacademic standards. Why? Because the status quo in our schools has \nfailed. Too many of our graduates finish school without knowing the \nthree R's, much less more rigorous content standards. For our country \nto remain competitive, it is essential that our schools prepare our \nfuture work force for the demands of the 21st century. Unfortunately, \nuntil we present our students with challenging content standards that \ngoal will not be realized.\n  Instead, estimates indicate that American businesses may have to \nspend up to $25 billion each year just for remedial elementary math and \nreading instruction for workers before they can train them to handle \nmodern equipment. Not only does this drain critical funds from our \ncorporations but it dramatically affects our ability to compete in the \nglobal marketplace.\n  For the past decade the average wage has gone down. The standard of \nliving is slipping and wealth is accumulating only at the top.\n  Until we are able to prepare our children for the future we will have \nfailed ourselves, the next generation and this country. The first step \nto success is establishing strong academic standards so that our \nchildren leave school ready for the work force or for postsecondary \neducation. Remedial education should not be the main function of our \ninstitutions of higher education or our businesses and corporations. By \npreparing our students while they are in school, we will reduce the \nneed for catchup courses so many of our graduates now have to take.\n  We have a process in place to get our children ready for the 21st \ncentury. That process includes reforming our school and creating high \nbenchmarks for students. That process is done through the National \nCouncil on Education Standards and Improvement. NESIC will be a 19-\nmember council composed of professional educators, representatives of \nbusiness, industry, higher education, and members of the public. The \ncouncil is authorized to certify voluntary national education standards \nand pass their recommendations to the goals panel for final approval. \nThe role of the council is to certify that the standards developed in \neach subject area are credible, rigorous and have been developed \nthrough a broad-based process.\n  NESIC provides a mechanism for ensuring that standards remain \nnational rather than Federal. If this duty was not being performed by \nsuch a council, the responsibility for certifying national voluntary \nstandards would fall squarely upon the shoulders of the Secretary of \nEducation--which would positively result in greater Federal \ninvolvement.\n  This body is a separate entity created to oversee the certification \nof voluntary national standards. It has absolutely no oversight \nauthority over States. In other words, States are not required to agree \nwith the voluntary national standards, they are not required to accept \nor incorporate any portion of the national standards or even \nacknowledge existence of standards.\n  Yet such a national council is essential to States and local schools \nto assist them in weeding out and reviewing voluntary standards. \nWithout such an entity, each State will have to undertake that review \nby itself. To do that 50 times over simply does not make sense. \nClearly, the recommendations of the council are not binding on States. \nThe council's certification process is simply a Good Housekeeping seal \nof approval to assist States in determining which standards are \nrigorous and competitive.\n  For us to step in and derail this process makes no good sense. By \npassing \n[[Page S1031]] this amendment and legislating a Federal override of \nNESIC's responsibility we not only jeopardize the whole independent \nnature of NESIC, we also jeopardize the process of creating tough \nacademic standards. I don't think we have that luxury.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, if I may enter into this debate for a \nmoment from a little different angle. I have enormous respect for the \nSenator from Vermont, who has just spoken with great dedication to the \nissue of education. He has devoted a great deal of time to the issue, \nboth when he was in the other body as a Member of Congress and since he \nhas been in the Senate and is now chairman of the Education \nSubcommittee of the Labor Committee.\n  I also can understand where the Senator from Washington is coming \nfrom in his concerns about the model national history standards which \nhave been developed with Federal funds. However, as the Senator from \nVermont has pointed out, they have not been adopted or certified as \nnational standards yet.\n  There has been a lot of controversy about these standards as they \nhave been proposed--controversy which, I may say, could have been \nanticipated. I was troubled when we first started down the path of \nproviding Federal funding for the development of national standards. I \nwould like to note that standards in various subject areas have been \ndeveloped by professionals in the field, not by Federal employees as \nsome may think. However, where Federal moneys are involved, there is \noften misunderstanding about the nature of the Government's \ninvolvement.\n  I am sure that developing these standards was very difficult for \nthese professionals. It is far easier to develop standards, say in the \nfield of mathematics or science, because there is more preciseness in \nboth of those fields. When you get to history, however, so much \nrevolves around a teacher's interpretation of the material that they \nmay have in front of them. So I think when you get into particular \nareas of study like history, that it becomes much more difficult to \ndevelop standards on which there is going to be agreement. Whether it \nis with the particular standards we are discussing now or a totally \ndifferent set of standards, I think you would find just as many people \nwith concerns about them.\n  Although these are voluntary standards, as has been repeatedly \nemphasized whenever we have had these debates, this is a point which \noften gets lost. One reason I opposed the Goals 2000 legislation which \nwas enacted last year is that it took Federal activities in this area \nyet another step further by including an authorization for a national \ncouncil to review and endorse the national standards.\n  There is certainly a difference between voluntary national standards \nand mandatory Federal standards--but this is a distinction which is \ngenerally lost when such standards are put forward, particularly when \nthey are likely to come before a group such as the national council \nwhich is charged with reviewing them. As one who believes strongly that \nthe strength of our education system lies in its local base and \ncommunity commitment, I have not felt it wise to expand Federal \ninvolvement into areas traditionally handled by States and localities.\n  I will support the Gorton amendment due to my concern about Federal \ninvolvement in national standards, even voluntary ones. At the same \ntime, I believe the real issue is far broader than the current \ncontroversy over the history standards. Prohibiting a federally \nauthorized council from certifying a particular set of voluntary \nstandards is not the real answer. The real problem is that we have \nestablished in legislation such a group--the National Education \nStandards and Improvement Council, or NESIC--in the first place.\n  In the near future, I will be introducing legislation to repeal \nNESIC. My legislation would get the Federal Government out of the loop \nin an area which I believe is best handled by States and localities. \nMany of our States are already developing standards that the teachers \nand educators in the field of history feel is important for the schools \nin their States. But those States do not need to have a Federal seal of \napproval for those standards, voluntary or not. That is why I believe \nwe may be missing the heart of this debate.\n  Nevertheless, I think the Senator from Washington has addressed a \nreal concern regarding the model national history standards that have \nbeen developed with Federal funds.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak against the Gorton \namendment. I think the Gorton amendment fails to recognize the immense \namount of work that has gone into trying to put this country on a road \nto having and pursuing higher national standards, higher standards in \neducation throughout the country. This is work that has primarily been \ndone by the Governors of this country. I will point out that it began \nin Charlottesville, when President Bush was there with our 50 Governors \nsome 5 years ago.\n  Today, the National Education Goals Panel is made up primarily of \nGovernors. There are eight Governors on this panel, there are two \nadministration representatives, and there are four representatives from \nCongress. But clearly the Governors are those who set up the National \nEducation Goals Panel. They are the ones who have led the way for this \ncountry to pursue national education goals and standards.\n  The Governors who currently serve on that are an extremely \ndistinguished group: Governor Romer, Governor Bayh, Governor Fordice of \nMississippi, Governor Hunt, Governor Engler, Governor Carlson, Governor \nEdgar, and Governor Whitman of New Jersey. They are a very \ndistinguished group of Governors.\n  The amendment of Senator Gorton, in my view, would be an insult, if \nwe were to pass this amendment, given the current state of \ndeliberations by the National Governors and by the National Education \nGoals Panel on national standards. Essentially, this amendment says the \nNational Education Goals Panel shall disapprove some proposed standards \nwhich have not even been presented for consideration before the panel \nas yet. It completely puts the Congress in the position of preempting \nthe National Education Goals Panel.\n  It further puts us in the business of preempting the National \nEducation Standards and Improvement Council, which has not even been \nestablished. The members of that group, NESIC for short--that is the \nacronym that has been applied to this National Education Standards and \nImprovement Council--have not even been appointed. Yet, we are here \nbeing asked to adopt legislation directing this unappointed panel not \nto certify certain standards which have not yet been presented to them \nsince they are not in existence.\n  It strikes me that this is the height of arrogance on the part of \nCongress, to be stepping into an area where we have not had the \nleadership. Just to the contrary, the Governors have had the \nleadership. And we are saying by this amendment, if we adopt it: Do not \ntake any action to approve standards. You, the Governors and the other \nmembers of this panel, disapprove these proposed standards that have \nnot yet even been presented to you. And second, if and when we get a \nNational Education Standards and Improvement Council appointed, they \nare also directed not to certify any standards along the lines that \nhave been proposed.\n  I certainly agree that there are major problems with the national \nstandards that were proposed on history. I do not think that is the \nissue that is before us today. This whole business of getting standards \nin history is something which was started by the former administration, \nduring the Bush administration. I recall the then Chair of the National \nEndowment for Humanities, Lynne Cheney, let the contract at that time \nto have these national standards developed. She has also, I would point \nout, been the main spokesperson objecting to the standards that have \ncome back, or the proposed standards.\n  My reaction is that clearly she is right, that there are problems \nwith what has been proposed, and we need to change what has been \nproposed or, on the contrary, we need to get some \n[[Page S1032]] other standards adopted in the area of history before we \ngo ahead.\n  But we are not in a position in my opinion as a Congress to be \ndirecting the National Education Goals Panel, made up primarily of \nGovernors in this country, directing them as to what action to take or \nnot to take on specific standards at this point.\n  The whole standards-setting process I believe has been a very \nhealthy, forward looking, progressive effort in this country, and it \nhas been bipartisan. It was bipartisan when it was started in the Bush \nadministration with the Governors. It has remained so since then.\n  I have the good fortune of serving on a council that was established \nby the Congress to look at the whole issue of whether we should have \nnational standards. That council came up with a report which said the \nhigh standards for student attainment are critical to enhancing \nAmerica's economic competitiveness, the quality of human capital, and \nthe knowledge of skills. The knowledge and skills of labor and \nmanagement helps determine a nation's ability to compete in the world \nmarketplace. International comparisons, however, consistently have \nshown the academic performance of American students is below that of \nstudents in many other developed countries. The standard setting \nprocess was a reaction to our concern in this area, and it is a \nreaction which the Governors took the lead in because of the primary \nresponsibility for education has always been at the State and local \nlevel, and should remain there.\n  But we found in that council that I served on--this is a quotation \nfrom the report they came out with:\n\n       In the absence of demanding content and performance \n     standards, the United States has gravitated toward having a \n     de facto minimal skills curriculum.\n\n  That is what the Governors were trying to deal with in the standard \nsetting process. We should not allow our concern about some specific \nset of proposed standards which have not even been presented to the \nNational Education Goals Panel for approval yet but we should not allow \nour concern about those specific standards to deflect us from the long-\nterm objective of having standards, and holding ourselves accountable \nto reaching those standards. They are voluntary standards. They ought \nto be voluntary standards. But still they are standards. They are \nstandards for which we believe certain benchmarks are appropriate. And \nclearly I believe that the standard setting process is an extremely \nimportant part of improving the American education system.\n  It would be a tragedy for us to step in before the first set of those \nstandards have been presented to the National Education Goals Panel for \napproval and pass legislation directing how the National Education \nGoals Panel and the Governors who make up the majority of that group, \nare to dispose of standards.\n  So I hope very much that we will defeat the Gorton amendment. I know \nSenator Jeffords has an alternative which I will plan to support and \nspeak for at that time. But I hope very much that the Congress does not \noverreach and try through this amendment that has been presented by the \nSenator from Washington to usurp the authority which I think has \nrightfully been seen as resting with the Governors of this country.\n  I thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Washington.\n  To my mind, this amendment is an unwarranted governmental intrusion \ninto what is basically a private effort. It also constitutes \nmicromanagement to a degree that is neither wise nor necessary.\n  First, the national standards that are being developed, whether in \nhistory or any other discipline, are purely voluntary. This was made \nclear in the Goals 2000 legislation and reinforced in the \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  Second, the voluntary standards do not have to be submitted to either \nthe National Education Standards and Improvement Council or the \nNational Goals Panel. That, too, is voluntary. If the organization that \ndeveloped the standards wants to submit them, they may do so at their \nown volition. It is not required.\n  Third, certification is nothing more than a Good Housekeeping Seal of \nApproval. It carries no weight in law, and imposes no requirements on \nStates or localities. They are free to develop their own standards, and \nmay use or not use the voluntary national standards as they wish.\n  Fourth, the history standards in question are proposed standards. \nThey have not been finalized. Quite to the contrary, representatives \nfrom the National History Standards Project have met with critics and \nhave indicated their willingness to make changes in both the standards \nand the instructional examples that accompany the standards. Their \ncommitment is to remove historical bias and to build a broad base of \nconsensus in support of the proposed standards.\n  Fifth, make no mistake about it, these proposed standards were not \ndeveloped in secret or by just a few individuals. They are the product \nof over 2\\1/2\\ years of hard work. Literally hundreds of teachers, \nhistorians, social studies supervisors, and parents were part of this \neffort. Advice and counsel was both sought and received from more than \n30 major educational, scholarly, and public interest organizations.\n  Mr. President, I strongly believe that we should not interfere with a \nprocess that is still in play. We should not inject ourselves in a way \nthat might impede both the important work being done in this area and \nthe effort to develop a broad base of consensus. Accordingly, I would \nurge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and to support instead the \nsubstitute to be offered by the Senator from Vermont.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton]. In fact, I ask unanimous \nconsent at this point that I be added as an original cosponsor of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I support this amendment because it puts the Senate on \nrecord opposing the national standards for U.S. and world history \nwhich, while not endorsed by any Federal agency, were developed with \nFederal tax dollars first issued in 1991. While not a Federal mandate \nin that sense, they are voluntary, nonetheless, I rise to speak in \nopposition to them because they carry the imprimatur of the Federal \nGovernment, and have the capacity to broadly affect the course of \neducation and the teaching and understanding of history by succeeding \ngenerations of our children, the American children.\n  Mr. President, I should make clear, as I believe the Senator from \nWashington has made clear, that I support the idea of setting national \nvoluntary standards to upgrade our education and to give us something \nto aim for. But I must say that the standards that were produced, the \nnational standards for U.S. and world history that are at the core of \nwhat this amendment is about, were a terrific disappointment and may \nundercut some of the fundamentals, the core values, the great \npersonalities and heroes of America and Western civilization and world \nhistory. By doing so, we put our children at risk of not being fairly \nand broadly educated.\n  While the hope of those involved at the time that these standards \nwere authorized, which goes back some years, was clearly to encourage \nState and local educators to raise standards in the teaching of history \nto elementary and secondary school students, the draft proposed is full \nof the kind of valueless, all-points-of-view-are-equally-valid nonsense \nthat I thought we had left behind--and I certainly believe we should \nleave behind--in the teaching of our children.\n  The history that many of us who are older learned in school obviously \nhad its failings. It was not as inclusive as it should have been in \nmany ways. But at least it provided core information about who we are \nas a nation and how our world and our Nation have progressed over time.\n  Mr. President, we have a lot to be proud of in American history. \nThis \n[[Page S1033]] great idea of America grew out of the Enlightenment and \nwas established--now more than 200 years ago--by a courageous, \nprincipled, and patriotic group of Founders and Framers who were not \ncasual about what they were doing.\n  They were motivated by an idea, by a set of values, and it is part of \nour responsibility as this generation of adults, let alone as this \ngeneration of elected officials and national leaders, to convey that \nsense of our history--about which we have so much to be proud--to our \nchildren.\n  First, in the interest of truth, because the American idea is a \nunique idea and has dramatically and positively affected the course of \nworld history since the founding of this country--not just the course \nof world history in a macro sense, in a cosmic sense--it has positively \naffected, in the most dramatic way, the course of the lives of millions \nof Americans and millions of other people around the world who have \nbeen influenced by the American idea and by American heroes. And we \nought not to let that be disparaged. We ought not to let that \nuniqueness, that special American purpose, be lost in a kind of \n``everything is equal, let us reach out and make up for the past \nexclusions in our history'' set of standards.\n  So to me this is consequential. I guess the social scientists tell us \nthat our children should think well of themselves if we expect them to \ndo good things; that they have to have a good self-image. They mean \nthis in the most personal sense of how parents raise children, how \nsociety gives children an impression of themselves. I say that in a \nbroader sense of citizenship, our country has a responsibility, \nhonestly and accurately conveying some of the blemishes as well as the \ngreat beauty of our history, to give our children a sense of self-worth \nas Americans. And part of that is respecting the great leaders in \nAmerica that have gone before.\n  Mr. President, these draft standards are, alternatively, so \noverinclusive as to lose major events in American and world history, \nmajor participants, leaders, heroes in American and world history, in a \ntumble of information about everybody and everything. And then, on the \nother hand, they are oddly underinclusive about important events, \npeople and concepts. Robert E. Lee, Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein, \nJonas Salk, and the Wright Brothers, just to name a few, appear nowhere \nin these standards.\n  Thomas Edison, whose most memorable invention has become the very \nsymbol of a good idea--the light bulb--is not mentioned. Albert \nEinstein, whose extraordinary contributions to our sense of the \nphysical universe, let alone beyond, who changed our understanding of \nour existence in so many dramatic ways--not mentioned. The Wright \nBrothers, whose courage and boldness and inventiveness, steadfastness--\nwith the development of airplanes, flight--has dramatically affected \nthe lives of each of us and of society--not even mentioned in these \nstandards.\n  In another way, in the world history standards, slavery is mentioned \nbriefly in reference to Greece. The only other discussion of slavery \nconcerns the transatlantic slave trade.\n Slavery, to the world's shame, existed in many cultures over many \ncenturies, and those examples are not mentioned.\n\n  The Holocaust in Nazi Germany received significant attention, as it \nshould. But the death, persecution, and humiliation in a cultural \nrevolution in China go by with barely a whisper. There is nothing in \nthe cold war section of these standards, this experience that dominated \nthe lives of most of us in this Chamber from the end of the Second \nWorld War to 1989, when the Berlin Wall collapsed. The section on the \ncold war does not give the reader, the student, the teacher, the sense \nthat that conflict involved principles at all, involved ideals. It \ndescribes it, in my opinion, solely as a contest for power. There is no \nindication that we were fighting a battle for democracy--not just a \nsystem, a way of government, but a way of government that has a \nparticular view of what humans are all about, and a particular view \nthat is rooted, I think, in the idea and the principle that people have \na Creator. We say it in our founding documents, ``that all men are \ncreated equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain \ninalienable Rights,'' not a casual accident of nature, but a conscious \nact by a Creator. Democracy is on the one hand, and totalitarianism is \non the other, which denies all of that. The cold war is described \nblandly and revealingly in one sentence as ``the swordplay of the \nSoviet Union and the United States.'' Inadequate, to put it mildly; \ninsulting, to put it more honestly and directly.\n  We do not need sanitized history that only celebrates our triumphs, \nMr. President. But we also do not need to give our children a warped \nand negative view of Western civilization, of American civilization, of \nthe accomplishments, the extraordinary accomplishments and \ncontributions of both.\n  I recognize that the Federal Government is not talking about forcing \nthese standards on anybody. These standards were always intended to be \nvoluntary, and I recognize that the standards we are talking about are \nnot final. They are in a draft form. But the standards, by virtue of \ntheir being developed with Federal funds, have the unavoidable \nimprimatur of the Federal Government. Ten thousand of these are \navailable throughout America. It is a very official-looking text. I, \nfor one, worry that some well-meaning official of a local school \ndistrict will get hold of it and think this is what we in Washington \nhave decided is what the teaching of American and world history ought \nto be all about. In fact, I have been told that text book publishers \nare waiting to see what happens next with these standards so they can \nmake their own plans as to whether to adopt the draft standards \nwholesale. In fact, I have heard also that some school districts are \nclose to adopting them.\n  I think it is particularly appropriate that my colleague from \nWashington has chosen this bill about mandates and Federal involvement \nin our society for us to speak out, to make sure that no one \nmisunderstands these standards, to hope that teachers, parents, and \nstudents will understand the ways in which some of us feel they are \ndeficient, and that, as the business of setting such standards goes \nforward from here, they will be developed with a better sense of \nbalance and fairness and pride.\n  History is important. We learn from it. It tells us who we are, and \nfrom our sense of who we are, we help determine who we will be by our \nactions. The interest in these standards, in some sense, confirms the \nimportance of history. And what I am saying, and what I believe Senator \nGorton is saying, is that we should celebrate the vitality of that \ninterest in history by starting over to develop standards that more \nfairly reflect the American experience, not to mention world history, \nand to particularly give better and fairer attention to the positive \nand optimistic accomplishments and nature of the American people.\n  I thank the Chair, and I congratulate my friend from Washington for \ntaking the initiative on this matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just make one additional point. I \nheard my good friend from Connecticut and my friend from Washington.\n  I think it is particularly ironic that this amendment is being \nconsidered on the so-called Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995. This \nbill that is being considered before the Senate today, the bill that is \nproposed to be amended, says in its preface:\n\n       To curb the practice of imposing unfunded Federal mandates \n     on State and local government; to strengthen the partnership \n     between the Federal Government and State and local and tribal \n     governments; to end the imposition, in the absence of full \n     consideration by Congress, of Federal mandates on State, \n     local and tribal governments.\n\n  Mr. President, we did try to defer to the States when we set up the \neducation goals panel in the legislation, the Goals 2000 legislation, \nlast year. We established that panel with eight Governors, four State \nlegislators. And those 12 who represent the States would be offset by \nsix representing the National Government, two from the administration \nand four Members of Congress.\n  Now we have taken this 18-member panel, the National Education Goals \nPanel, set them up and given them the responsibility to review \nproposals that \n[[Page S1034]] are made for national standards. And here in Senator \nGorton's amendment, we are proposing to step in before any standards \nhave been presented to them and to legislatively prohibit them from \nadopting a set of as yet unproposed standards.\n  Now this is a Federal mandate, it is a mandate by this Senate, by \nthis Congress to that National Education Goals Panel, made up primarily \nof State government representatives, and telling them what they shall \nand shall not do.\n  I, quite frankly, think it is insulting to the Governors, who are \ngiving of their very valuable time to serve on this National Education \nGoals Panel, for us to be rushing to the Senate floor and passing \nlegislation of this type before they have even been presented with \nanything in the National Education Goals Panel.\n  I am one of the two Senators that serves on the National Education \nGoals Panel. I represent the Democratic side. Senator Cochran \nrepresents the Republican side. We have not had a meeting to discuss \nthese proposed standards. In fact, the proposed standards have not even \nbeen put on the agenda to be discussed at future meetings, and yet the \nSenate is considering going ahead and adopting an amendment by the \nSenator from Washington which says, ``Notwithstanding any other \nprovision of law, the National Education Goals Panel shall disapprove'' \nthese standards in whatever form they ever come to us.\n  Mr. President, I have no disagreement with my friend from Connecticut \nabout the substance of the proposed standards that have been developed \nunder the funding of the National Endowment for Humanities and the \ncontract that Lynne Cheney let when she was in that position. I agree \nthere are some serious problems there. But let us defer to that group \nprimarily representing States and allow them at least to do some of \ntheir work before we step in and dictate the result. Particularly, let \nus not dictate the result as an amendment to a bill which is designed \nto end the imposition of Federal mandates on State, local and tribal \ngovernments.\n  I think it is the height of irresponsibility for us to proceed to \nadopt this amendment at this stage. I really do think those Governors \nand State legislators who are serving on that National Education Goals \nPanel deserve the chance to do the job which they are giving of their \nvaluable time to do before we step in and try to overrule them and \nsecond-guess something which they well may decide not to do. I have no \nreason to think they are less patriotic or less concerned about a \nproper depiction of U.S. history than we here in the Senate are. And I \nthink we should give them a chance to do the right thing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, first, I should like to say with respect \nto my friend and colleague, the Senator from Connecticut, that it is \nalways a pleasure to deal with him on the same side of an issue just as \nit is very dangerous to disagree with him and attempt to prove a case.\n  But as I have listened to the case presented against this amendment \nby three of my colleagues, one of my own party and two of the other, it \nseems to me that they argue in an attempt to have it both ways. Each of \nthem was a strong supporter of Federal legislation, Goals 2000, which \nwas designed to come up with national standards for the teaching of \nvarious subjects in our schools. Each of them, as far as I can tell, \napproved of spending some $2 million of Federal taxpayer money to \nfinance a private study which resulted in these national standards.\n  But when it comes to our debating these highly controversial and I \nfirmly believe perverse and distorted standards for world and American \nhistory, we are told we should butt out; we, the Congress of the United \nStates, should have nothing to say about national standards for the \nteaching of American history. Or, in the alternative, the Senator from \nNew Mexico says it is too early because they have not been adopted yet.\n  Would his argument be different if this commission had in fact \nadopted these standards? Well, of course not. His argument would be \neven stronger that we should have nothing to do with this process. Far \nbetter to express the views of Members of this body, and I hope of the \nHouse of Representatives, on a matter which is of deep concern to many \nof our citizens before some potential final action has been taken than \nto wait until afterwards.\n  But, Mr. President, this volume does not look like a rough draft. \nNothing in this volume, for which we have paid $2 million, indicates \nthat it is only tentative, it is subject to huge revisions. This is a \nset of standards which without regard to whether or not it is approved \nby a national entity has already been distributed in some 10,000 copies \nto educational administrators and interested people all across the \nUnited States which already has behind it the force of being a national \nproject financed with national money.\n  I believe it more than appropriate that this technically nongermane \namendment should be added to a bill on mandates, the bill we are \ndiscussing here today. While the Goals 2000 entity, the National \nEducation Standards and Improvement Commission, cannot enforce its \njudgments on the States, they will certainly be given great weight by \neach of these States. And that council is a Federal entity. It may well \nbe made up of some Governors as well as some Members of this body and \nsome legislators and the like, but it is a national body created by the \nCongress with a national purpose.\n  Nothing in my amendment, in which the Senator from Connecticut has \njoined, tells any Governor or State educational administrator that he \nor she cannot accept this book today, lock, stock, and barrel, if he or \nshe wishes to do so.\n It does say that a Federal entity will not certify it as worthy of \nconsideration as a guide for the teaching of American history. In that \nsense, each of these people is part of a national entity created by the \nCongress with a Federal purpose. Not only is it appropriate for Members \nto instruct such a group, I believe it to be mandatory.\n\n  We created the group. If it is our view that this is, in fact, a \nperverse document that should not be the basis for teaching American \nhistory, now is the time we should say so. Not after it has been \nadopted by several States. Not after it has been adopted by this \nnational organization, but right now.\n  Opponents cannot duck behind the proposition that somehow or another \nthey are taking no position. By voting against this amendment, they are \ntaking the position that it is perfectly appropriate for these \nstandards to be presented to the States of the United States as the way \nin which to teach the history of the United States of America.\n  The very individual, Lynne Cheney, then Chairman of the National \nEndowment for the Humanities, who came up with much of the financing \nfor this, finds these standards to be totally outside of what she or \nthe Endowment expected or participated.\n  And the critics are not from some narrow group in the United States. \nThey represent the broadest possible mainstream of American thinking. \nFormer Assistant Secretary of Education, Chester Finn, now at the \nHudson Institute, called these history standards ``anti-Western,'' and \n``hostile to the main threads of American history.'' Elizabeth Fox-\nGenovese, professor of history of women's study at Emory University \ndeclared ``The sense of progress and accomplishment that has \ncharacterized Americans' history of their country has virtually \ndisappeared'' from these standards.\n  The president of the Organization of History Teachers, Earl Bell, of \nthe University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, called the world history \nstandards ``even more politically correct than U.S. history \nstandards.'' Charles Krauthammer, writing in the Washington Post, said \nthat these proposed standards reflect ``the new history'' and ``the \nlarger project of the new history is to collapse the distinction \nbetween fact and opinion, between history's news and editorial pages. \nIn the new history, there are no pages independent of ideology and \npower, no history that is not political.'' Herman Beltz, history \nprofessor at the University of Maryland said ``I almost despair to \nthink what kids will come to college with. I'm going to have to teach \nmore basic things about the Constitution \n[[Page S1035]] and our liberal democracy.'' Albert Shanker, president \nof the American Federation of Teachers, described the original draft of \nWorld History Standards as ``a travesty, a caricature of what these \nthings should be--sort of cheap shot leftist view of history.'' \nFinally, of course, Lynne Cheney said ``the World History Standards \nrelentlessly downgrade the West just as the American history standards \ndiminish achievements of the United States,'' both calling into \nquestion ``not only the standard-setting effort but the Goals 2000 \nprogram under which these standards became official knowledge.''\n  In U.S. News & World Report, John Leo wrote:\n\n       This won't do. The whole idea was to set unbiased national \n     standards that all Americans could get behind. Along the way \n     the project was hijacked by the politically correct. It is \n     riddled with propaganda, and the American people would be \n     foolish to let it anywhere near their schools.\n\n  Mark my words: To vote against this amendment is to vote approval of \ncertifying a set of books, in this case entitled ``National Standards \nfor United States History,'' paid for by the American taxpayer, \nsubmitted to a Federal organization for its approval. I want to repeat, \nwe do not tell any school district or any State that if it wants to \ntreat this as a bible that it is forbidden to do so. All we do is to \ntell an organization we created that it is not to certify these \nstandards. That they are unacceptable. That they denigrate the Western \nand the American experience, ignore the most important achievements of \nour history, and that if the Federal Government wants to do this job it \nought to start over and do it again with people who have a decent \nrespect for American history and for civilization.\n  I am a Senator who, unlike my distinguished colleague who sits next \nto me here, the junior Senator from Kansas, who voted in favor of Goals \n2000 and in favor of national standards. And like others now seriously \nmust question my own judgment in doing so, if this is the kind of \nproduct which is going to arise out of that process.\n  I believe very firmly that if we are to have national standards, if \nwe are to have support not only of this Congress but of the American \npeople for national standards in education and various subjects, we \nmust do much better than this. Not later. Not a year from now. Not 3 \nyears from now. This is the time to say, ``This doesn't measure up.'' \nIt does not reflect the American experience. It is not an outline of \nwhat we should be teaching our children about the history of this \ncountry, and for that matter, the history of the world.\n  The vote, like it or not, is on whether or not you agree or disagree \nwith what has been produced here. Turn down this amendment, we are \ntelling this national council ``everything is OK; approve it, and go \nright ahead.'' Accept the amendment and we will have a positive impact \nnot only on the teaching of our American history but of future \nstandards in other subjects which are still incomplete. We may yet be \nable to save the true goals of Goals 2000.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, could I ask the Senator a question as to \nhis intent in the future, if the Senator would yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask my colleague from Washington, Mr. \nPresident, if it would be his intent every time a standard is developed \nfor consideration, that we in the Congress would pass legislation for \nor against that before the goals panel got a chance to consider it?\n  Mr. GORTON. My answer to the Senator from New Mexico is that is a \nvery good question, to which the answer is ``no.''\n  I sense that educational goals are likely to fall into two \ncategories, one of which is more likely to be controversial than the \nother. Some of the standards in other areas--for mathematics, for \nexample, or for the teaching of physics--will, I think, be very \nunlikely to be found controversial or be driven by ideology.\n  In the case of a set of standards which come from a narrow \nperspective, a narrow political perspective, it is certainly possible \nthat there will be future debates, as there ought to be. I think the \nfuture debates are more likely to be driven by public reaction to these \nstandards than they are by the preferences of individual Members of the \nSenate. This Senator was made aware of the standards by the blizzard of \ncriticism which they created almost from the day that this book was \npublished.\n  Now, by the fact that so many traditional historians in the United \nStates find them so terribly objectionable, my deep hope, I say to the \nSenator from New Mexico, as a member of this national commission, will \nbe that a decent respect for American traditions in the future in this \nand in the study of other kinds of social services on the part of those \nacademics who generally dominate their writing such standards, will \nresult in no action at all on the part of the Congress, because while \nthere may be elements of controversy and particular standards, that \ncontroversy will not reach the fundamental basis of the very philosophy \nor ideology out of which they arise.\n  So I hope that this is not only the first time that we take up a \nsubject like this, but the last time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just ask one additional question. \nThe education goals panel, to which we are here giving instructions \nprohibiting them from taking certain action, is scheduled to meet a \nweek from Saturday here in Washington, with Governor Bayh--I believe he \nis the new Chair of the education goals panel.\n  What is the Senator intending to do by this action, by this vote, by \nthis amendment? What is he intending to tell that group of Governors, \nand others who sit on that panel, about what their responsibilities are \nfor considering standards in the future? Should they wait until we get \nsome reading from the Congress as to whether or not there has been too \nmuch public concern?\n  I am just concerned that we are setting a precedent which essentially \nmakes their job irrelevant or their role irrelevant if we are going to \nhave public debates in the Congress and pass mandatory legislation \ndictating how they are to proceed every time a new set of proposals \ncomes forward.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I say to my friend from New Mexico, there \nis hardly an important commission or entity or agency in the United \nStates whose controversial decisions or operations do not create \ncontroversy or debates on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  We are elected by the people. We have strong views on particular \nsubjects. Of course, frequently, well beyond this particular council, \nwe are going to have debates on ideas which other people, appointed by \nthe President or appointed by us, deal with.\n  As the Senator from New Mexico well knows, there is not the slightest \ndoubt that we will be engaged in a debate sometime later this year on \nthe future of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and Members will \nattack and defend the way in which Federal money is spent by that \nindependent organization, as it is by a myriad of other organizations.\n  As for the meeting a week from Saturday of this particular \nCommission, I would be astounded if this amendment were the law by \nthen. Certainly the speed with which we have dealt with this unfunded \nmandates bill so far hardly indicates that it is going to be through \nthis body and the House of Representatives, the differences between the \ntwo settled, on the President's desk and signed by the President by a \nweek from Saturday.\n  So I suspect that legally, at least, that Commission will be \nperfectly free a week from Saturday to take whatever action it wishes.\n  I strongly suspect that many of those who are elected to positions in \ntheir own States and are appointed members of this Commission may have \nreached the same conclusion that I and others have at this point, and I \nstrongly suspect that they will give great weight to the way in which \nthis vote comes out. But they are going to give that great weight \neither way.\n  If we vote in favor of this amendment, even though it has not become \nlaw, I think that will greatly influence that council in rejecting \nthese standards. By the same token, if we turn down this amendment, my \nopinion is that many members of that council will, in effect, say the \nCongress has approved these standards and they ought to go ahead and do \nso themselves.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n   [[Page S1036]] Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. GORTON. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued the call of the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise to speak about where we are at this time with this bill, to \nmake the point that I have been basically on my feet since 12 noon \ntrying to offer a very important and timely amendment that has \nbipartisan support, that is about an issue of great importance to the \npeople of this country because, indeed, it is about law and order in \nthis country.\n  On December 30, there was a horrible shooting in Massachusetts at a \nhealth care clinic.\n  The following day there was a shooting in Virginia, at a health care \nclinic. Obviously, at that time, the U.S. Senate, this 104th Congress, \nhad not taken its place here and we were unable to respond, as I know \nwe would have in a timely fashion, to condemn the violence and to call \non the Attorney General to take the appropriate action to ensure the \nsafety of those innocent people at those clinics around this country. \nAs soon as I got back here I made a number of calls to Democrats and \nRepublicans and I put together a resolution which currently has 21 \ncosponsors, some of them from the Republican side of the aisle.\n  I knew that this Senate had a lot of important business, but I also \nbelieved in my heart we would take 60 minutes or 30 minutes, or some \ntime to go on record, speaking out as Americans--not Republicans, not \nDemocrats--Americans speaking out against that violence.\n  I was very hopeful when I heard the majority leader, the new majority \nleader, Senator Dole, speak out on national television, condemning the \nviolence and saying that he was appalled at the violence. I said to \nmyself, we will have bipartisan support so we can go on the record in \nthis U.S. Senate. I know my Republican friends have a contract, a \nContract With America or for America--or on America, some people call \nit--and they believe in that contract. Some of the things in there are \ngood. A lot of it is awful, in my opinion. And they are on a timetable \nto move that through.\n  But I have to say that, while I believe the bill before us is very \nimportant--and I say to the occupant of the chair I know how much he \nworked, so hard on this unfunded mandates bill. I myself come from \nlocal government. I had to deal with the most ludicrous mandates in the \n1980's that you could believe. I would love to be able to get a bill \nbefore us that does not go too far, that is sensible. And I want to \nwork toward that end. I have a number of amendments that deal with it.\n  But I thought, as reasonable men and women, we could respond to a \nterrible problem we have in our country, and I was very heartened when \nI had bipartisan support. The Senator from Maine and I worked in a \nbipartisan fashion to speak to the majority leader, to speak to the new \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee. This goes back many days ago. Can \nwe not set aside the bill for a very short time, the unfunded mandates \nbill, to take up this resolution in a bipartisan spirit and move on?\n  I waited. I was very patient, because I really wanted to get this \ndone in the appropriate spirit of cooperation. The manager of the bill, \nsomeone I have grown to respect and admire and like, has been very open \nwith me. I have to say the majority leader himself has continued the \ndialog with me. However, he has informed me that he does not want this \nto be pursued; that he will block my every effort to offer this as a \nsecond-degree amendment to the committee amendments in the hope that I \ncan work out an agreement with some of those on the Republican side of \nthe aisle who objected to this coming forward.\n  I have to say, both sides of the aisle put out what we call a hotline \nhere to advise Senators that this was a proposal, and on the Democratic \nside there was no objection. There was objection on the Republican \nside. The majority leader would like to work this out.\n  I have read my amendment over. There was one phrase in it that I \nagreed we could change. I offered to make that change.\n I have to tell you, I think the amendment as it stands is very \nreasonable. It only has a small resolved clause:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the United States \n     Attorney General should fully enforce the law and recommend \n     to Congress any further necessary measures to protect persons \n     seeking to provide or obtain or assist in providing or \n     obtaining reproductive health services from violent attack.\n\n  I cannot imagine any reasonable person opposing that ``resolved'' \nclause. I have looked at it again and again. We are calling on the \nAttorney General to fully enforce the law and recommend to Congress any \nfurther necessary measures needed to protect decent people.\n  I think it is important to note that there have been over 1,600 \nincidents of arson, bombing, vandalism, and assault against \nreproductive health care clinics and the people who work there since \n1977. This is not a problem that has started yesterday. Last year, \nthere were over 130 incidents, 50 reports of death threats to doctors \nand other clinic workers, 40 incidents of vandalism, 16 incidents of \nstalking, 4 acts of arson, 4 murders, and 3 attempted bombings. That is \nwhat is going on in America.\n  I think we should be able to agree in a bipartisan fashion to a very \nsimple statement that we call on the Attorney General to fully enforce \nthe law and to come back to us if she thinks other measures should be \ntaken. My goodness, we are not asking for more dollars here. We are not \nasking for anything more than the law be fully enforced and that, if \nfor some reason, more needs to be done, that we be told about it.\n  I want to hold up, here, a poster which is a sample of what is being \ndistributed across America today. It is a ``wanted'' poster, with \npictures and names of physicians. The language is frightening. ``Wanted \nfor killing unborn babies in the South Bay.'' This is from California. \nThe language is violent language, and I hope that the people behind \nthese kinds of posters will rethink their language.\n  I know they are committed to an issue that they feel deeply about. I \ndefend their right to peacefully protest. As a matter of fact, if they \nwere not able to do that, I would join them in that fight, I believe so \nmuch in America and freedom of speech. But I do think, again, we have \noften used the example: We have freedom of speech, but when we yell \n``fire'' in a crowded theater, perhaps it is going to lead to something \nhorrible.\n  This is leading to something horrible, to people being killed. I have \nmet the families of these physicians who have been murdered. They lost \ndads and they have lost moms. I met the families of the volunteers who \nhelped the women trying to obtain their health care, one of them a \nretired military person, shot down dead trying to protect women \nexercising their rights. So when you say, ``How can a doctor deliver \nbabies one day and kill them the next,'' you have to think about the \nwords that you are using.\n  I hope that we will come together on all sides of this issue and \nrecognize that we resolve our problems here in America, not the way \nthey do it in Bosnia, not the way they do it in Haiti, not the way they \ndo it in Russia, but by fighting for laws that we think are right. And \nby the way, we passed one of those laws, and we did it in a bipartisan \nway. But it seems to me that as we went on record then, we should go on \nrecord now.\n  Since 1982 the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has \ninvestigated 148 clinic bombings and arson causing $12 million in \nproperty damage. Doctors working in clinics go to work every morning \nhaunted by murderers. They have their homes picketed and their children \nfollowed to school. At one time one of the organizations mounted a \nnational campaign called ``No Place to Hide'' complete with ``Abortion \nBusters Manual on How to Attack.'' They placed doctors' names and \naddresses on ``wanted for murder'' posters, distributed fliers listing \nthe \n[[Page S1037]] times, dates, and places for picketing medical clinics \nand physicians' homes and churches. And other groups put out a handbook \ncalling it a ``How-to Manual of Means to Disrupt and Ultimately Destroy \nSatan's Power to Kill Our Children.'' The book provides 99 covert ways \nto stop abortion. It advocates ``Super Glue'' for jamming locks on \nclinic doors, cutting off water power, breaking windows, spray painting \nwalls, and expresses ways to use muriatic acid--I have talked to people \nwho worked in clinics who are aware of this--including injecting it \ninto the clinic ceilings and ventilating systems.\n  The book also has a recipe for homemade plastic explosives and \nsuggestions on how to make a bomb threat and techniques for uncovering \nunlisted phone numbers and addresses. In a section of the book claiming \nto be an interview, a member of this organization says, ``I ask you \nwhat would you do if your very own child was scheduled for execution in \nthe morning.'' And the answer comes back in this book: ``One, blow the \nplace to kingdom come; and, be there with all the guns and ammunition \nin the morning just in case.''\n  I cannot believe we cannot take an hour's time out on a bipartisan \nresolution like this simply calling on the Attorney General to do all \nshe can do enforce the law, the law that we passed in a bipartisan \nfashion. I have been so willing to cooperate with the majority leader, \nand to his credit he has been very direct with me, I will say that. But \nI have been blocked from offering this.\n  I do not ever remember blocking anyone from the other side from \noffering an amendment. I really might fight their amendment. I might \nargue against their amendment. But I never tried to block their ability \nto offer an amendment. I am very saddened that this is where we are. I \nthink the American people must wonder. We are debating mandates. That \nis good. But that mandate law is going to take a while to be put in \nplace. It will create a huge bureaucracy. You should be ready for it. I \nmean, that mandates bill will have bills make more stops than the local \nbus on the way to becoming a law. And we will debate that.\n  But this amendment is merely a sense of the Senate that puts the \nSenate on record in a bipartisan way. All we are saying is, ``Attorney \nGeneral, enforce the law. Enforce the law even if you need to come back \nand tell us what else you have to do.''\n  We know one American who killed Dr. John Britton and his volunteer \nescort James Barrett outside of the clinic in Florida. He claimed it \nwas justifiable homicide. This Senate cannot sit back. I know we move \nslowly, but these incidents occurred at the end of December. We have \nyet to go on record. I think that is wrong. I think that is horribly \nwrong.\n  So, Mr. President, I look forward to being able to get this \nresolution before the body. And I will continue to stay here as long as \nit takes so that this Senate goes on record in a bipartisan way and \nsays this killing, this violence is wrong, and says in a bipartisan way \nwe call on the Attorney General to do all she can to protect those \nclinics.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President. I will be brief.\n  I would like to thank the Senator from California for her words on \nthe floor of the Senate. As I understand it, this is a sense of the \nSenate. It is the sense of the Senate that the U.S. Attorney General \nshould fully enforce the law and recommend to the Congress any further, \nnecessary measures to protect persons seeking to provide, or obtain or \nassist in providing or obtaining, reproductive health services from \nviolent attack.\n  Might I ask the Senator, is this what she wants the U.S. Senate to go \non record for?\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator will yield, that is correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I just would like to say to people in \nthe country, citizens around the country, that quite often--I have only \nbeen in the Senate now for 4 years; that puts me in my first term--but \nquite often what we could be doing, the deliberative body that we are, \nis while we are working on a piece of legislation when there are \ncompelling issues before us, then we bring amendments out that we think \nare important whereby the Senate takes a position on an extremely \nimportant question.\n  I have to say, given the murders that have taken place in this \ncountry recently--and murder is never legitimate--the amendment of the \nSenator from California is extremely important. I think people should \nknow that basically what has happened here is that she is blocked from \noffering her amendment.\n  Mr. President, for the life of me, I do not understand why we could \nnot bring this amendment out on the floor, why it could not be a sense \nof the Senate passed. I think it is a terribly important amendment. It \nis a sense of the Senate, but it is an amendment that says that all of \nus, Democrats and Republicans alike, care fiercely about law and order \nand care fiercely about protecting people's constitutional rights, that \nwe are opposed to murder, that we are willing to take a strong position \non this.\n  So I thank the Senator for her amendment. I hope that we will be able \nto bring this to the floor and have an up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. President, if there are no other Senators seeking recognition or \ninterested in speaking right now, I would be pleased to yield the \nfloor. Otherwise, I would like to suggest the absence of a quorum. I \nwould like to see whether I cannot get an amendment to the floor. But \ncould I, first of all, suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we set \naside the pending committee amendment and call up the committee \namendment on page 33 so that I can offer an amendment to that \namendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I object for the time being.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, just so my colleague from Oklahoma and \nothers following will know what I am trying to do here, like the \nSenator from California, I am anxious to get on with amendments. My \nunderstanding was that the committee amendment on page 33, if we could \nput aside this committee amendment and move to that committee \namendment, I might be able to offer an amendment to that amendment.\n  I do not think it is an amendment that is controversial. I am trying \nto get an amendment up on the floor which deals with the whole issue of \nwhether or not as a part of how we look at accountability committees \nwould not be required, if they were going to file reports, to have a \nchild-impact statement. So it is an amendment that is straightforward. \nI am prepared to agree to a time limit. It is an extremely important \namendment. That is the amendment I am trying to bring to the floor.\n  I gather that my colleague from Oklahoma has not changed his view on \nthis matter. Mr. President, I have tried with all my might, and I am \nblocked from bringing up the amendment at this point. I am anxious to \nget going with amendments and a discussion, and I hope soon there will \nbe some sort of break in this impasse.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, what is the legislation before us now? \nExactly what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Dole amendment to the Gorton amendment.\n  Mr. GLENN. The Dole amendment would modify the----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Dole amendment is an amendment to the \nGorton amendment.\n  Mr. GLENN. Second degree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GLENN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  [[Page S1038]] Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Washington, which addresses the issue of national \nstandards in the area of U.S. history and world history.\n  This amendment is very appropriate in light of the discussions which \nhave recently occurred and the presentation which has been made now by \nthis national standards proposal.\n  The question which is before us really is: Is it appropriate for the \nFederal Government to be in the business of setting national standards \nwhich, although voluntary in name, in actual fact may end up being \nstandards that will be used throughout the country and will inevitably \nbe enforced upon many school districts in this country?\n  Once you have a group which has been funded by the Federal Government \nto the tune of $2 million, producing a set of national standards in any \ncurriculum activity, it is inevitable that those standards will be used \nby local groups within activist educational communities to try to force \nthat curriculum on local school boards and local school districts. In \nfact, I think it is logical to presume that once a national standard \nhas been set and defined by some group which has received the \nimprimatur of the Federal Government, you will see that that standard \nis aggressively used as a club to force local curriculums to comply \nwith that national standard.\n  This is something that concerned me greatly when we took up the issue \nof Goals 2000, and I argued aggressively at that time that it was a \nmistake to set up this national school board called NESIC. By setting \nup that national school board you were essentially creating a situation \nwhere the term ``voluntary'' was actually illusory. You would end up \nwhere the Federal Government would start defining what would be in the \ncurriculum of the local school districts, and they would have to comply \nwith that not only because local educational activists would start \nlitigating for compliance and claiming that local school districts \nwhich were not in compliance were therefore not teaching properly, but \nalso because of the fact that funding from the Federal level will \ninevitably, at some point, be tied into whether or not local school \ndistricts are complying with these national standards.\n  In fact, when we took up the elementary and secondary school bill, \nthat was the exact attempt that was made. It was fought off here in the \nSenate by those of us who were members of the conference committee, and \nit did not end up being the final law. But it was an aggressive attempt \nmade to apply to local school districts national standards in the area \nof opportunity to learn, and those national standards were going to be \nenforced on the local school districts by using the funding mechanisms \nof the Federal Government as a club to require compliance.\n  And so now we have a curriculum exercise coming again from the \nnational level which will inevitably, in my opinion, lead to a top-down \ndirective as to how a curriculum should be structured in this country. \nThere are a lot of problems with that, but there are especially a lot \nof problems with that when the curriculum which is designed, and which \nis being put forward by the national organizations, is so biased and so \neditorial in comment.\n  This is a curriculum which spends very little time addressing the \nsubstance of history and the facts of history and spends a great deal \nof time presenting the editorial comment on history and a revisionist \nview of history. As has been mentioned before, within these standards, \neight times we see the American Federation of Labor mentioned. We see \nSenator McCarthy mentioned 19 times. Ku Klux Klan is mentioned 17 \ntimes. Granted, the American Federation of Labor did have a major \nimpact on American history, and Joseph McCarthy had an impact--passing \nat best--on American history. The Ku Klux Klan was a representative of \na reprehensible period in our history. But if you are going to put that \nmuch time into those types of activities, why and how could you \npossibly ignore the mention, as has been pointed out here, of the \nundertakings of people like the Wright Brothers, Thomas Edison, Albert \nEinstein? It does not really get into the issue of who the combatants \nwere in World War I, or the factual events that created the War of \n1812, and what the battle of New Orleans was all about, for example.\n If you want to take a historical event that ought to at least be \npointed out in our history books, that allowed for the opening up of \nthe entire West. It would not have occurred without it. That list goes \non and on.\n\n  Then in the area of discussing how we as a culture came together, the \nfact that we are a Western-based culture appears to be something that \nthis historical standard which is being promoted here tries to ignore, \npossibly even reject, and certainly undermines, as it spends an \nincalculable amount of time pressing the logic that should be taught as \nbeing the logic of Muslim scholars and scholars who really have very \nlittle relevance to what is the core culture of the American society, \nwhich is Western, whether you like it or not; that is what we come \nfrom. You cannot really understand America's heritage unless you \nunderstand our Western culture. You also cannot understand our \nGovernment, or the way we function, unless you at least have passing \nknowledge with people like Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and even \nhistorical figures like Paul Revere, and the people who fought for the \nSons of Liberty in Boston. Yet, these individuals who played a fairly \nsignificant role in defining our course in history as a Nation are \nvirtually ignored.\n  History is about individuals, whether you like that or not. History \nis about individuals. Individuals have a major impact on the course of \nour lives. The study of major individuals within history is necessary \nif you are going to understand the course of history.\n  You cannot possibly understand 20th century world history unless you \nunderstand Adolf Hitler, or Joseph Stalin, or Lenin. You cannot \nunderstand American history unless you look at people like Daniel \nWebster and what he did, or Thomas Edison and what he did, or Albert \nEinstein and what he represented, or the Wright Brothers and what they \nrepresented.\n  Yet, this new curriculum would essentially ignore the concept that \nindividuals matter and would base its thought process on a revisionist \nview of what history is and how individuals impacted it.\n  The proposal, as it comes forward, for all intents and purposes, \nignores the cold war as a confrontation of ideology. The Soviet system, \nwhich was an outgrowth of Marxism, does not even discuss the concept, \nfor all intents and purposes, that it was the United States culture of \nfreedom, of individuality, of individual rights going up against a \nculture of totalitarianism, of collectivism, and of the usurpation of \nthe individual and the replacement of individual rights with the right \nof the State. That confrontation, over which this country spent \nbillions of dollars and lost many, many American lives is, for all \nintents and purposes, passed over as a casual event, an event that is \nnot of enough significance to spend a great deal of time on or an event \nwhich is caricatured through the representations of somebody like \nJoseph McCarthy.\n  The rewriting of history, I believe, we found throughout various \ncultures is extremely risky. A culture that lies to itself about what \nits history was, tries to undertake revisionist history and teaches its \nchildren revisionist history, is a culture that is going out on thin \nice. This was seen in most recent examples in this century in the \nSoviet history system or in the Chinese history system as it presently \nexists today or, of course, in the German history system of the 1930's \nand early 1940's where, essentially, people who have a political \nphilosophy--totally repugnant, of course, in our terms, but it was a \npolitical philosophy--defined history in terms of their political \nphilosophy.\n  One cannot look at this book which has been proposed on American \nhistory and not conclude that what we have here is a group of folks who \nwanted to define American history in the terms of their political \nphilosophy. They have, it appears, only a passing interest in factual \nhistory; virtually no interest, actually, in factual history; and a \ndeep interest in cultural history, but it is a cultural history which \nthey are \n[[Page S1039]] going to define in their terms and under their \nprocedure. OK, if they want to view history that way, that is their \ndecision. If that is the way these folks who have decided to rewrite \nAmerican history wish to view our times and the times of our ancestors, \nthat is their decision. But the problem here is that they are taking \nthat view of the world and they are putting it upon educational systems \nthroughout this country by having it nationalized and having it receive \nthe imprint of appropriateness, the seal of correctness, through \nFederal financing and what will probably be Federal activity through \nthe national school board, NESIC.\n  And that is what is wrong with it. It is not only incorrect history, \nin my humble opinion--and I guess people can disagree with that--and \nvery much revisionist history and politicized history and editorialized \nhistory, but it is also an attempt to take that editorial viewpoint and \nsubject school districts throughout this country to it by designating \nit as the correct history.\n  Well, I do not believe that the Federal Government should be in the \nbusiness of defining the correct history. And I certainly do not feel \nit should define the correct history for the State of New Hampshire or \nfor the school systems within my State. And I especially do not \nappreciate it when that correct history is so grotesquely biased in its \npresentation.\n  There was some discussion earlier by a Senator as to the effect of \nthe drafting of this even if it is not endorsed by NESIC. I think we \nneed to look at that, because this is the first exercise of this nature \nthat has come forward.\n  I am extremely concerned that, because of the nature of the community \nof historians who dominate the intellectual process of defining our \nhistory in this country, we are going to find that this correct history \nwill become the standard of the new textbooks.\n  Anybody who has had the experience of dealing with American history \ntextbooks knows that they go in sort of fads. They go through periods \nof one textbook being in and the next textbook being appropriate. And \nbecause textbooks are so expensive for school systems and so expensive \nto produce, they tend to be single entities that become very big best \nsellers and dominate the curriculum within the school systems.\n  My concern is that what we have created here is the ability of an \ninsidious monster. I guess all monsters are insidious,\n but this one is especially so because, as a practical matter, what we \nhave created here is the core of what I suspect textbooks are going to \nlook to. Because if you are a textbook creator and a writer or \npublisher, you are going to say you want to pick the course of least \nresistance and the easiest approach. You are going to say, ``Well, here \nis the Federal Government that spent $2 million to produce this \ncultural treatise. Why should I go out and reinvent the wheel? I am \njust going to take over what has been done by the Federal Government. \nAfter all, it has been done by the Federal Government, so who could \never argue with me,'' I, the publisher, ``if I undertake the \nrepublication of this document basically in the form it was produced?''\n\n  And so we have created a situation where, I suspect, inevitably the \ncore elements of this cultural document will end up being part of the \ntext in a textbook initiative which will be promoted across the \ncountry, and it will have been done at taxpayers expense and at our \nhistory's cost. And that will be unfortunate.\n  I hope that the publishers of this country who produce our textbooks \nwill take note of the debate on this floor and sense the significant \nconcern that is being expressed here about the quality of the \nworkmanship of this product, because it is not good quality and it does \nundermine the teaching of history in this Nation, in my opinion.\n  So I wish to associate myself with the comments of the Senator from \nWashington.\n  I also wish to associate myself with the Senator from Kansas when she \ncame to the floor earlier and stated that she intended to offer an \namendment to repeal NESIC and end this national school board \nexperiment. It should never have been proposed in the first place. It \nwas a mistake and we should terminate it right now. The Federal \nGovernment does not have a role in this area, and it certainly should \nnot be putting taxpayers' dollars at risk in this area.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I thank my friend from New Hampshire for \nhis eloquent support.\n  During the period of time this was actively debated between myself \nand the distinguished Senator from New Mexico and others, he and I have \nreached an agreement, which I find to be most constructive.\n As a result of that agreement, I intend in just a moment to ask \nunanimous consent to modify the Dole second-degree amendment, to modify \nit in a manner which would turn it from a statute to a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution.\n\n  Since technically if the committee amendment to strike is ultimately \nadopted it will all fall. In any event, the most important, the vital \npart of what we are doing is really to express the views of this Senate \nto this National Education Standards and Improvement Council.\n  It will do so in the fashion that I asked for. We will have a vote on \nit. The vote will be far more one-sided than it would have been on the \noriginal amendment, and I have every confidence that the National \nStandards Council will listen to what the Senate has to say. If it does \nnot, any Member is free to bring up the subject at any future time. \nThis will also help the progress of the underlying bill, S. 1, itself.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 139 to Amendment No. 31, as Modified\n\n  Mr. GORTON. With that in mind, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Dole second-degree amendment be modified in the fashion which \nI have already sent to the desk.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I do not \nbelieve I will object, but I want to clarify this.\n  Ordinarily, a person who puts in the amendment would modify his own \namendment. Is this something the Senator has worked out with the \nmajority leader?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I answer my friend, it is the second-\ndegree amendment to my original first-degree amendment that was \nprepared by the majority leader as a courtesy to me. I have worked it \nout with his office and he agrees to it.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 139), as modified, to amendment No. 31, is as \nfollows:\n\n       Strike all after ``SEC.'' and insert:\n\n\n                    ``  national history standards.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--It is the sense of the Senate that the \n     National Education Goals Panel should disapprove, and the \n     National Education Standards and Improvement Council should \n     not certify, any voluntary national content standards, \n     voluntary national student performance standards, or criteria \n     for the certification of such content and student performance \n     standards, on the subject of world and United States history, \n     developed prior to February 1, 1995.\n       ``(b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       ``(1) voluntary national content standards, voluntary \n     national student performance standards, and criteria for the \n     certification of such content and student performance \n     standards, on the subject of world and United States history, \n     established under title II of the Goals 2000: Education \n     America Act should not be based on standards developed \n     primarily by the National Center for History in the Schools \n     prior to February 1, 1995; and\n       ``(2) if the Department of Education, the National \n     Endowment for the Humanities, or any other Federal agency \n     provides funds for the development of the standards and \n     criteria described in paragraph (1), the recipient of such \n     funds should have a decent respect for the contributions of \n     western civilization, and United States history, ideas, and \n     institutions, to the increase of freedom and prosperity \n     around the world.''\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to comment and thank my \ncolleague from the State of Washington for his willingness to work with \nme to modify this amendment. I have devoted considerable time and \neffort to the National Education Goals Panel and I appreciate Senator \nGorton's understanding of my concerns about the role of that Panel and \nespecially about preserving the national character of the Panel and its \nwork. In adopting \n     [[Page S1040]] this amendment we are expressing displeasure \n     with the current version of the national history standards, \n     but we are also saying two very important things:\n  First, that the U.S. Senate is not interfering with the National \nEducation Goals Panel doing its work and performing its duties under \nthe law; and\n  Second, that the U.S. Senate is not interfering with the appointment \nof the work of the National Education Standards and Improvement Council \nor the performance its duties under the law.\n  I think these are important points to make as we take this action.\n  Again, my thanks to Senator Gorton for his courtesy and understanding \nwith respect to this very important issue.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I want to commend Senator Bingaman of New Mexico, for his \nsuccessful effort to modify the Gorton amendment. The modified \namendment expresses a sense of the Senate but does not bind the panel \non which Senator Bingaman serves. We have asked that panel to serve as \nindependent persons bringing their own experiences and talents to an \nimportant task. They should not be dictated to by Washington if we wish \nthem to sue their best judgment and to usefully spend their valuable \ntime. The modification allows for that independent functioning to \ncontinue. I particularly commend Senator Bingaman for his energy in \nachieving the modification and to Senator Gorton for agreeing to modify \nhis original language.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senator Gorton's \namendment. I do not oppose the principle that national standards in \nhistory for the Nation's schools should respect our country's roots in \nWestern civilization. I completely agree with that concept. It is \nvitally important that our students learn that the foundations of our \ndemocracy owe a great debt to our European ancestors.\n  The National Center for History in the School is the group that \nreceived the contract to develop the history standards. It has a sole \nsource contract awarded by President Bush's Director of the National \nEndowment for the Humanities, Lynn Cheney. The Center agreed with \ncritics, and it will revise the standards and reissue them this next \nspring.\n  But this amendment represents extreme congressional interference in \nthe work of the National Education Goals Panel. This distinguished and \nindependent group was created by President Bush, Governor Clinton, and \nother Governors after the Education Summit in 1989. Last year, in the \nGoals 2000 Act, Congress endorsed the Goals Panel and gave it statutory \nauthority to review any standards that were voluntarily submitted to \nit.\n  A process of certification for voluntary national and State standards \nwas established by Congress last year in title II of the Goals 2000 \nAct. It provides a process for a through and objective review and \ncertification of the standards.\n  The distinguished Americans serving on the panel have been assigned \nthe responsibility of making judgments on the criteria for \ncertification and on the overall determination as to whether a specific \nset of standards should be certified.\n  The Panel includes Senators Bingaman and Cochran, Congressmen \nGoodling and Kildee, Governors Jim Edgar of Illinois, John Engler of \nMichigan, Daniel Fordice of Mississippi, Evan Bayh of Indiana, Jim Hunt \nof North Carolina, Roy Romer of Colorado, and Christine Todd Whitman of \nNew Jersey. Secretary of Education Richard Riley is also a member of \nthe panel.\n  The amendment says, in effect, that the Senate does not trust the \njudgment of these distinguished officials serving on the panel to carry \nthrough their responsibilities and determine whether history standards \nare appropriate.\n  In approving the Goals 2000, Congress took great care to assure that \nthe important and sensitive process of certification would be carried \nout in a careful and thoughtful way. We should let the panel do its \nwork and I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I believe a rollcall has already been \nordered on this second-degree amendment. Also, if there are no other \npersons that wish to speak, I am ready to have a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, would the distinguished Senator add my name \nas a cosponsor to his amendment?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would do so now, as I have forgotten \nanother matter. I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia be added as a cosponsor to the amendment as \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask that this Senator be added as a \ncosponsor to the amendment as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the senior \nSenator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] be added as a cosponsor to the original.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I believe all Senators who wish to \naddress this particular issue have done so. It would be in order, so I \nsuggest we go forward with the vote at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment numbered 139, as modified. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered. The Clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 99, nays 1, as follows:\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 23 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--99\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--1\n                                     \n\n       \n     Johnston\n       \n  So the amendment (No. 139), as modified, to amendment No. 31, was \nagreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been suggested. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection has been heard.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if I might have the attention of Mr. \nKempthorne and the managers on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend. The Senate is not in \norder.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I note in both committee reports, the report \nby \n[[Page S1041]] the Committee on Governmental Affairs and the report by \nthe Budget Committee, the following language--page 12 of the committee \nreport from the Committee on the Budget; page 15 from the committee \nreport of the Committee on Governmental Affairs. Let me read this. Then \nI want to make an\n inquiry.\n\n  Mr. President, I read as follows. I will presently read from the \nreport of the Committee on the Budget, page 12:\n\n       This section provides two new Budget Act points of order in \n     the Senate. The first makes it out of order in the Senate to \n     consider any bill or joint resolution reported by a committee \n     that contains a Federal mandate unless a CBO statement of the \n     mandate's direct costs has been printed in the Committee \n     report or the Congressional Record prior to consideration. \n     The second point of order would lie against any bill, joint \n     resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that \n     increased the costs of a Federal intergovernmental mandate by \n     more than the $50,000,000, unless the legislation fully \n     funded the mandate in one of three ways:\n       1. An increase in direct spending with a resulting increase \n     in the Federal budget deficit (unless the new direct spending \n     was offset by direct spending reductions in other programs);\n       2. An increase in direct spending with an offsetting \n     increase in tax receipts, or\n\n  And this is the one I wish to ask Senators to pay close attention to.\n\n       3. An authorization of appropriations and a limitation on \n     the enforcement of the mandate to the extent of such amounts \n     provided in Appropriations acts.\n       The Committee notes that ``direct spending'' is a defined \n     term in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control \n     Act. The Committee also intends that in order to avoid the \n     point of order under this section, any direct spending \n     authority or authorization of appropriations must offset the \n     direct costs to States, local governments, and Indian tribes \n     from the Federal mandate.\n\n  Notice, ``If the third alternative is used''--in other words, \nauthorization of appropriations--if that alternative is used, ``a \nnumber of criteria must be met in order to avoid the point of order.''\n\n       First, any appropriation bill that is expected to provide \n     funding must be identified. Second, the mandate legislation \n     must also designate a responsible Federal agency . . .\n\n  Let me read that again. Let me read that paragraph again.\n\n       Second, the mandate legislation must also designate a \n     responsible Federal agency that shall either: implement an \n     appropriately less costly mandate if less than full funding \n     is ultimately appropriated . . . or declare such mandate to \n     be ineffective.\n\n  This is page 12.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Page 12. OK.\n  Mr. BYRD. The report of the Committee on the Budget.\n  The same language is in the other committee report but upon different \npages. Page 12, right at bottom.\n\n       To avoid the point of order, the authorizing committee must \n     provide in the authorization legislation for one of two \n     options:\n       1. The agency will void the mandate . . .\n\n  Now, this is the executive branch agency. I hope Senators will get \nthis.\n\n       The agency will void the mandate if the appropriations \n     committee at any point in the future provides insufficient \n     funding to states, local governments, and tribal governments \n     to offset the direct cost of the mandate.\n       2. The agency [meaning an instrument of the executive \n     branch] can provide a ``less money, less mandate'' \n     alternative, but this alternative requires the authorizing \n     legislation to specify clearly how the agency shall implement \n     that alternative.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that this body should pass worrisome \nprovisions such as this, that may lead to greater litigation and \nfurther complicate the issue. I understand that this provision--and I \nhope that I can verify this by one or both managers on both sides of \nthe aisle--I understand that this provision was not in S. 993; am I \ncorrect? Of last year?\n  Mr. GLENN. Yes, that is correct. That is not in S. 993.\n  Mr. BYRD. So this was not in the bill of last year. But it is \nsomething that is new now, as it has come to the floor in the bill that \nis before us and is referenced in both committee reports: The Budget \nCommittee and the Committee on Governmental Affairs. It seems to me it \nis incumbent on the Senate to eliminate this provision until such time \nas the issue is more fully debated.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Is it the Congressional Budget Office, or what \nexecutive agency is that referred to on page 12?\n  Mr. BYRD. It does not name the agency. It is obviously--to me--not \nthe Congressional Budget Office. It says, ``responsible Federal \nagency.'' To me, it is referring to an executive branch agency, some \nagency in the executive branch.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Then is it not the case that we are into the separation \nof powers? We have a case where we could not avoid the executive, and \ncertainly the executive cannot legislate by mandating the end of a \npiece of legislation.\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely. Absolutely.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Repealing the legislation, in essence, by--what does it \nsay, mandating--``void the mandate?'' How do you void the mandate \nwithout legislation? So they have the executive agency legislating? Is \nthat the case?\n  Mr. BYRD. That is the way I read it. The agency here overrules----\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. As the distinguished Senator has correctly, in my judgment \npointed out, this is a separation of powers issue.\n\n       The agency will void the mandate if the appropriations \n     committee at any point in the future provides insufficient \n     funding to states, local governments, and tribal governments \n     to offset the direct cost of the mandate.\n       2. The agency can provide a ``less money'' less mandate \n     alternative. . . .\n\n  Here we have a Federal agency, an executive branch agency that can \nnullify the action of the Congress. In essence, it can repeal a law of \nthe Congress or it can modify it. I am disturbed about that. I would \nlike to hear----\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. Yes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, on page 12, as you read this, you will \nnote that it does state in parentheses--and this is very important, \n``pursuant to criteria and procedures also provided in the mandate \nlegislation.''\n  In other words, we do not leave this at the discretion of an agency. \nThe agency itself will be determined by the authorizing committee. They \nwill so state, which Federal agency will be dealing with this.\n  In that legislation also, I say to the Senator, they will choose one \nof those two options. If they choose the option that states that should \na subsequent appropriations bill not provide full funds, then that \nauthorizing committee in its legislation is going to specify to that \nagency the criteria upon this scaling back. If they were to choose the \nother option, which is should the subsequent appropriations bill not \nprovide the funds, then, again, based on the criteria as outlined by \nthe authorizing committee, under those directions that agency would \nthen so state. But it would be, again, at the direction of the \nauthorizing committee in legislation that would then have to be passed \nby Congress.\n  It does not in any way leave that to the discretion of the Federal \nagency.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, why do we leave it in the hands of a Federal \nagency to determine whether or not a mandate should be nullified or \nshould be modified?\n  Why should a Federal agency determine on the basis of ``less money, \nless mandate''? Why should not the legislative branch do this? Why not \nrequire that an agency seek the approval of the Appropriations \nCommittees and suggest a reprogramming? That is done from time to time. \nBut why turn a decision of this sort--it is a final decision--over to \nan executive branch agency? It seems now we are setting up a procedure \nhere that stands in direct conflict with the provisions of article I, \nsection 1, the very first sentence of the U.S. Constitution, which \nvests all legislative power in the Congress of the United States.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I yield.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. President, the triggering mechanism is on the fund amount. In \nother words, if they choose the option that it is to provide the funds \nthrough a subsequent appropriations bill, and that appropriations bill \nprovides full funds, then again there is no further recourse except to \nimplement and mandate.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. If that authorizing committee chose the option that \n[[Page S1042]] said, in the event it does not provide full funds, that \nis the threshold, and if that subsequent appropriation does not hit \nthat threshold, then that Federal agency can in fact do a scaleback. \nBut it is based upon language by the authorizing committee. The \nauthorizing committee directs the criteria for that scaleback. It does \nnot leave it up to the discretion of the agency.\n  Mr. BYRD. Why not eliminate these two paragraphs, eliminate the risk \nof litigation, eliminate the risk of running afoul of the Constitution \nin respect to the separation of powers? This troubles me. Why have \nlanguage in the bill that would open up further litigation? If we truly \nintend to limit or to rescind future Federal mandates and not fully \nfund them, then I believe such actions should be taken by the Congress.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thought for a moment that the Senator from Idaho had \nexplained this to me. But in looking it over again, I have difficulty \ngetting the sequence of events as to how this is going to happen and in \nwhat sequence. It says that the third alternative here--that is, the \nauthorization for appropriations--a number of criteria must be met in \norder to avoid the point of order. First, any appropriations bill that \nis expected to provide the funding must be identified. So far so good. \nSecond, the mandated legislation must also designate a responsible \nFederal agency. That is fine. We can designate the agency that will \nimplement the mandate, that shall either, one, implement and \nappropriate a less costly mandate if less than full funding is \nultimately appropriated, or--this is really a big ``or''--declare such \nmandate to be ineffective.\n  Does that mean that we are authorizing after we have imposed a \nmandate and provided the funds--it says ``or'' allow that agency to \ndeclare the mandate ineffective. So they could, if they decide, as I \nread this--and I want to be corrected because this is an immensely \ncomplex bill. Does this mean that agency, if they find that we have not \nfully funded that mandate, could provide for a less costly method of \nimplementing it? And I assume we have designated them and given them \nthe authority on the front end. The bill is already passed and we have \ngiven them the authority to come up with a less costly method of \nimplementing the mandate or declaring it inoperative. Am I reading that \ncorrectly?\n  Mr. BYRD. That is the way I read it. I think we are opening up a \nPandora's box here, if we are going to provide authority to an \nexecutive branch agency to modify or to nullify a mandate if the \nAppropriations Committees of the Congress do not provide the full \nappropriations. It seems to me we are saying that an executive branch \nagency can have the authority to void the entire mandate, or to \ndetermine how much of the mandate shall go into effect; ``less money, \nless mandate.''\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from \nArkansas, in his sequencing scenario, the authorizing committee in its \nlanguage would determine which option it chooses. If it chooses the \noption that states that in the event that subsequent appropriations do \nnot provide full funding, then it so states that mandate will not \nbecome effective. That is at the direction of the authorizing \ncommittee. So that is a separate issue here. If, however, that \nauthorizing committee chooses the other option, which is that in the \nevent full funding is not provided in a subsequent appropriation, then \na Federal agency is directed--directed by the authorizing committee--to \nscale back that amendment. But the criteria for the scaling back again \nare included in the language of the authorizing committee.\n  Let us say the executive agency is carrying out the direction of \nlegislative branch. It is carrying out the direction as specified, and \nit does not leave these decisions to the discretion of that executive \nagency.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. If I may comment on that very last sentence, this says \nthat if the appropriation is less than the amount this agency \ndetermines to be needed to fully implement the mandate, you are giving \nthat agency two options as I read this. They can either cut the mandate \nto some extent, modify it to make the money fit the mandate, or, as I \nstarted out a moment ago, or declare the mandate to be ineffective.\n  I think the Senator and I both are reading this the same way now. \nWhat I am really suggesting is that this is a tremendous discretion \nthat we are handing to the executive branch to declare that we either \nhave not funded it fully and, therefore, they are going to cut it, or \nthey are just going to torpedo it altogether.\n  Now, why would we want to give the agency that kind of authority? \nObviously, we feel the mandate is important or we would not have passed \nthe bill.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may yield for \nthe purpose of the colloquy between and among other Senators, including \nmyself, without my losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Again, I appreciate that.\n  Mr. President, to the Senator from Arkansas, I can only reiterate \nwhat the process is. The authorizing committee, of necessity, has had \nto work closely with the appropriate appropriations committee. There \nhas been communication, so that there is, based on that communication, \nbased upon the progress of that bill, the authorizing committee knows \nif in fact the money will be appropriated. They will know that it is \neither a yes or no issue. So, again, they will choose the option. It \ndoes not allow--does not allow--the executive agency to make that \ndetermination as to whether or not they just rule that there is not \nenough money, so we are going to wipe it out, because the authorizing \nagency has that power, and they initiate that power in the language of \nthe authorizing committee, which is then passed by Congress.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me make one observation. I am not going to pursue \nthis and belabor it any further. But as I read this language here, \nSenator Chiles used to say ``the mother tongue is English,'' and this \nis the way I read this English. The sequence would be that the \nauthorizing committee would authorize appropriations. I assume that the \nauthorizing committee would either say such sums as shall be necessary, \nor if they have a CBO figure, what it is going to implement that, they \nwould authorize that amount to be appropriated. The Appropriations \nCommittee on which I sit would subsequently decide, also based on what \nCBO says it would cost to implement the mandate, and the figure might \nbe different than the one the authorizing committee used when they \npassed the authorizing legislation.\n  But assume for the purposes of our argument that the authorizing \ncommittee says it will take $100 million to implement this mandate; the \nAppropriations Committee comes along, as we usually do several months \nlater, to discuss whether we want to appropriate this $100 million or \nnot, because it may be that CBO by that time has said--let us assume \nfor the purpose of argument--it will only take $90 million. So we \nappropriate $90 million. This Federal agency down here--as I read this, \nit says that if they find that our appropriation is not sufficient, \nafter we have made our very best estimate on it, used the best \ninformation we could get from CBO, or somebody else, the agency down \nthere says, well, you flunked, you did not appropriate enough money; \nthis is going to cost $130 million to implement this, or $150 million.\n  Mr. BYRD. It might be years later.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. It could be. It could be any time in the future.\n  Mr. BYRD. Because it is every year we are talking about.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Certainly. So they say that because you goofed, we are \ngoing to take it upon ourselves to vastly reduce the mandate, no matter \nhow critical it might be--it might be asbestos, water well pollution, \nor whatever, and they can say we are going to either severely reduce \nthe requirement on the cities, counties, and States, or, two, we are \nnegating the mandate. Now you are giving them an option, Senator. Even \n[[Page S1043]] though we may have appropriated $90 million, to say that \nis not enough to get the water hot, so we are negating the entire \nmandate. Is that a fair reading of it?\n  Mr. BYRD. That is the way I read it.\n  Mr. GLENN. There were a number of changes from S. 993 which we \nbrought out of committee last year. A lot of changes were made in S. 1. \nMost of them, I was part of. This particular change was not in S. 993, \nand I was not part of this.\n  Let me address this a little different way. The point made is a very \ngood one. The point, basically, is that we are giving away our \nlegislative authority when we say to an agency: You have authority to \nvoid something. I think that was probably a poor choice of words in \nthis. What we were trying to cover in these two parts, I believe--and I \nask my friend from Idaho to correct me if I am wrong--was to say where \nthe authorizing committee put in a certain amount that in our best \njudgment was going to take care of this and then there were no \nappropriations followed up for it, then what happens? Well, what we \nshould have said was that the agency will not be responsible for \ncarrying out the enforcement of this mandate instead of saying the \nagency has the authority to void what the Congress has done--in that \ncase, where there is no money. That is in the first case. So I think \nthe void-the-mandate language was probably a poor choice of words in \nthis. It was not intended to pass along legislative authority over to \nan agency.\n  No. 2 says, OK, we authorize certain things in committee to take care \nof this mandate, but the appropriators did not have all that money. But \nthey said maybe it would have required $100 million. They say, well, we \njust do not have that; you have $60 million to carry this thing out. In \nthat case, the agency can provide an alternative of less money, of less \nmandate, but this alternative requires the authorizing legislation to \nspecify clearly how the agency shall implement that alternative. In \nother words, we would give scaled-back advice if that is necessary. So \nI think the one that the distinguished colleague from West Virginia \ncites here, the voiding the mandate, was probably language that should \nnot have been in there to begin with. I think it would have been better \nif we said if there is no money, then the agency is not required to \ncarry out the mandate. That would not pass authority, to void a \nlegislative act of the Congress over to an agency.\n  Mr. BYRD. Under the Constitution, only the Congress has the power to \nenact laws, and only the Congress can appropriate moneys. If there is a \nneed to rescind or to repeal or to modify, why does the legislative \nbranch not do that? Why turn that over to some unelected bureaucrat--\nand this is no disparagement of bureaucrats, because we have to have \nthem--why turn that over to an unelected bureaucrat, who is given no \npower under the Constitution? I am one who believes that the Congress \ncannot give away power that is vested in the Congress, and the Congress \nonly, by the Constitution.\n  Mr. GLENN. If the Senator will yield, let me make an analogy here. I \nthink we do this all the time, if it is taken in the light just stated.\n  Mr. BYRD. We delegate certain authority.\n  Mr. GLENN. Then we say there are no appropriations to carry it out. \nFor instance, we require by law a nuclear cleanup in this country. So \nwe say the agency is supposed to go out there--the Department of \nEnergy--and make an assessment of all these places and do a nuclear \ncleanup. They are supposed to do the best job possible. In some places \nwe will not have money appropriated to do that. The authorization is \nstill there. And in some places we will partially fund that operation. \nThat does not mean that the authorization should come back to Congress \nand be changed. It just means that the authorization is still there, \nbut we have not been able to provide enough money to do it. So we say, \n``Do what you can.''\n  Mr. BUMPERS. If I may make an observation, then I will withdraw from \nthis colloquy. This would have been much better, in my opinion--and I \nwould want to think about it because there are probably better \nsolutions--but if the language of this bill had said: At such time as \nthe designated Federal agency--or if at any time the Federal agency \ndetermines that the appropriated amount is insufficient to fully comply \nwith the mandate, to execute the mandate, such agency shall report \ntheir findings to the Congress forthwith for such determination as the \nCongress chooses to make. Would that not solve it?\n  Mr. BYRD. Right.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I believe, I say to my friend from \nArkansas, that, as you have just stated it, in essence that is what we \nhave provided here.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is correct. We should not give our \npower away. But we do not. We make that determination. We make that \ndetermination. If the funds are not there, we, the Congress, have \nstated that that mandate will not take effect. We, the Congress, have \nstated----\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am reluctant to interrupt the Senator, but that is not \nthe way I read it. We give the agency the right to say that they do not \nhave to implement that mandate. If they find there is less money than \nis necessary to carry out the mandate, you give them the option of \nreducing the mandate or torpedoing the mandate. That is what the \nSenator from West Virginia and I are both objecting to.\n  Mr. BROWN. Will the distinguished Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Senator.\n  I think both the Senator from Arkansas and the Senator from West \nVirginia are to be commended for raising this point and calling the \nSenate's attention to it. I think it is a valid point of concern worth \nlooking at.\n  As I look on page 23 of the bill, the bill deals specifically with \nthis provision and it is one of the three options that is laid out. \nThese have already been noted by the distinguished Senators. One, the \nalternative of Congress that it has been paid for; two, the option of \nraising the funds and paying for them, the one you all have called our \nattention to; and the third alternative, where they authorized the \nspending and then developed options.\n  One of the things of great comfort to me is the specific language, \nbecause what it calls for is Congress itself to set out the procedures \nthat the agency must follow. And let me quote, because I think it is \nthe language that we will be concerned with.\n  Under (III), it says:\n\n       Identifies the minimum amount that must be appropriated in \n     each appropriations bill referred to in subclause (II), in \n     order to provide for full Federal funding of the direct costs \n     referred to in subclause (I); and\n       (IV)(aa) designates a responsible Federal agency and \n     establishes criteria and procedures under which such agency \n     shall implement less costly programmatic and financial \n     responsibilities of State.\n\n  And so on.\n  In other words, it is Congress specifically that is charged with and \nmust set the procedures and set the guidelines. Under (bb), it says:\n\n       Designates a responsible Federal agency and establishes \n     criteria and procedures to direct that, if an appropriation \n     Act does not provide for the estimated direct cost of such \n     mandate as set forth under subclause (III), such agency shall \n     declare such mandate to be ineffective . . .\n\n  An so on.\n  I think this is very comforting because it makes it clear here there \nis no delegation of power; that the decision as to what the procedures \nare is set forth by Congress, that the decision as to what the criteria \nare is set forth by Congress.\n  In the constitutional law on this area of improper delegation, I \nthink it is very comforting and very reassuring to this Senator \nbecause, as long as Congress is the one that sets the procedure, as \nlong as Congress is the one that sets the criteria, as long as Congress \nis the one that sets the standards, then the delegation is proper under \nthe case law.\n  On the other hand, if this language should fail to be in there, if \nCongress had not taken on the responsibility of setting the criteria \nand procedure, then indeed we would have a constitutional question.\n  I, for one, appreciate the point being raised. If the Senators have \nfurther questions about it, I will be happy to respond with specific \nconstitutional cases where the matter has been considered.\n   [[Page S1044]] But I am at least reassured, as I look at the \nlanguage on page 23 and page 24, that the fact that Congress \nspecifically sets the procedures and criteria gives us the comfort \nlevel we need.\n  Mr. BIDEN. May I ask the Senator from Colorado a question on that \npoint?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield for that purpose.\n  Mr. BIDEN. As I read Morrison versus Olson and other separation of \npowers cases, the fact is that the judgment made by the Supreme Court \nas to whether we can or cannot delegate authority, any branch in the \nFederal Government may or may not delegate authority, relates not to \nwhether they have set up procedures, but relates to whether or not the \ndelegation of authority goes to the essence of the function of that \nbranch.\n  For example, we could not set in motion here, even if we wanted to, \nby legislation, a proposal that said the President of the United States \nof America shall, under the following circumstances, not only nominate \nbut in fact confirm a Federal judge. We could not do that. We could lay \nout in great detail the circumstances under which a President could \ntake over the whole responsibility of putting someone on the bench, and \nthat would be an unconstitutional delegation of power under the \nseparation of powers doctrine.\n  Now, I would be very, very interested, because I know, and I mean \nthis sincerely, how learned my friend is in the law. But I have made \nthe serious mistake of teaching constitutional law on this subject for \nthe last five semesters, and I have been forced to read all these \ncases. I am not suggesting that I have the book on this issue, but I am \nsuggesting to you I have read no case where there is the ability for \nsomeone to conclude from reading the case that you can, if you set out \nproper procedures, delegate authority which is essentially legislative \nor for the President. The President could not turn around and say, ``By \nthe way, I, by Executive order, from now on am asking the U.S. Senate \nto name who will be nominated for the Court and also move forward and \nconfirm those persons.'' He could not do that.\n  Now, again, I know everybody does not want to prolong the debate, but \nI think this is a critical question, and one that the Senator from \nArkansas and the Senator from West Virginia, I believe, have suggested \nis easily reconcilable.\n  For example, as I read the Budget Act, you could, in fact, have done \nwhat they did in the Budget Act. The Budget Committee retains the \njudgment of whether or not they will, in fact, conclude that something \nis within or beyond the budget resolution. They do not delegate it to \nan alphabet agency. They do not delegate it to another branch of \nGovernment.\n  So I would be very anxious--and I am not trying to put the Senator on \nthe spot--but I would be very anxious to hear now the case law that he \nthinks sustains his position, or give him time to do that. And this is \nnot meant by way of just trying to be obstreperous or to embarrass. I \ntruly do not know of any cases that sustain the assertion made by the \nSenator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Let me thank my distinguished friend from Delaware.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I continue to hold the floor and I ask the \nChair for that right.\n  I yield for the purpose of the colloquy.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Senator for accommodating a dialog on this \nsubject.\n  I want to mention that I think my distinguished friend from Delaware \nmay sell himself short. He indicates he has taught constitutional law \nfor only 5 semesters. I personally have served on the Judiciary \nCommittee, where he has been chairman for eight semesters. I do not \nknow how much other legal education he has engaged in, but I, at least, \nhave found him quite informative and quite thoughtful in this area--\noccasionally correct, as well--in his judgments as we move forward, and \nI think always helpful as we look into this.\n  Let me suggest to my friend that if indeed what were suggested here \nwould be to delegate a legislative function to these agencies, then I \nwould be in wholehearted agreement with him. I think it is quite clear \nthe intent of this bill and I think it is quite clear under the \nconstraints we must follow that we can only delegate enforcement of \npolicy decisions, not the function of legislating itself.\n  And while I hope the sponsors of this bill, which includes myself, \nwill be open to any reasonable suggestions in this area, I must say, \nfrom looking at it, at least my conclusion is that the language we see \non pages 23 and 24 is very helpful in that area, because it not only \nincludes Congress being required to set forth procedures, as my \ndistinguished friend referenced, it also includes specific language \nrequiring Congress to set forth the criteria on which this judgment \nmust be made.\n  So I think it is quite clear from the language that this is not a \ndelegation of legislative authority. It is simply a requirement that \nthey enforce criteria and procedures set down. I want to reiterate my \nhope that if there is an improvement in language we would consider it \nand look at it. I think the point is very valid. In terms of recitation \nof a constitutional law in this subject and specifically the cases, I \nthink that is a valid request, a reasonable one, and I would be happy \nto include that in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I yield.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I know the Senator from West Virginia had \nthe floor, and I would be guided by whatever he wishes. I can come back \nto this later or we could continue, whatever the Senator suggests. I \nhave no preference in the normal order of things. I know there were \nother Senators here to speak on this and other issues, before me.\n  Maybe what I should do with the Senator's permission is gather up, \nsince I just walked on the floor and did not anticipate being involved \nin this debate, some of the case law to which I refer and come back and \nmaybe continue this debate if the Senator from West Virginia thinks \nthat is appropriate.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I hope the distinguished Senator will \ncontinue to elucidate on this point and enlighten the Senate so that we \nmay better understand how to approach this matter.\n  I do not want to continue to hold the floor. The Senator from South \nCarolina is seeking the floor, also.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a brief comment?\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. GLENN. The agency will void the mandate, the red-flagged \nlanguage, to the Senator from West Virginia. And rightly so, indicating \nwe would be passing our authority off to an agency when we should not \ndo that.\n  Now, if we come back and look at the actual language in the bill, it \nis not written quite that way. On page 24, in that second section, \nstarting in the middle of the page, it says basically that the \nauthorizing committee will designate a responsible Federal agency and \nestablish criteria and procedures to direct that if an appropriations \nact does not provide for the estimated direct costs of such mandate as \nset forth under subclause 3, such agency shall declare such mandate to \nbe ineffective.\n  It does not say it voids it. It does not pass legislative authority, \nthe way I interpret that, but it just states the obvious. If there is \nnot an appropriation to cover this, that the mandate becomes \nineffective as of October of the fiscal year for which the \nappropriations is not equal to the direct costs of the mandate.\n  Mr. BYRD. Of course this may be 5 years, may be 10 years.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator yield just on that one issue?\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from West Virginia is raising a number of \nquestions including the constitutional delegation. But there is another \nproblem here. If an appropriations committee as many as 5 years or 10 \nyears later is not allowed under this language to determine that a \nlesser appropriation will do the job, it is bound by a previous \nauthorization bill that could be 10 years earlier, which made an \nestimate which may be absolutely a wild estimate. Five years later, 10 \nyears later. An appropriations committee does not allow under this bill \nto make a determination that a different amount, a lesser amount, would \nfully fund that mandate.\n  That is one of the many issues that is raised with this language. \nNow, there are other issues. There are specificity \n[[Page S1045]] issues. And the Senator from West Virginia is also \nputting his finger on a critical constitutional issue here. I will say \none other quick comment. This is the new language.\n  Mr. BYRD. It was not in the bill last year.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It was not in the bill last year. This was a language that \nwas in a bill introduced on a Wednesday night, which went to a hearing \non Thursday morning, which was intended to go to a markup on a Friday \nmorning which we had to plead for a delay of over the weekend for the \nmarkup to a Monday morning. When we made an effort to get a committee \nreport on this, we denied that committee report so that it could come \nto the floor the next day. This is the language that was not in last \nyear's report which is very new, novel, significant language.\n  Now, I repeat: I am someone who supported last year's bill. But I \nthink this goes too far and raises very significant questions which are \nworthy of real examination on the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Exactly, and we have a cloture motion which we are supposed \nto vote on tomorrow morning, which if adopted leaves us with 30 hours \nonly. And the Senator from Michigan may have 1 hour. That is all he can \nhave. This locks in, as the distinguished Senator from Michigan has \nstated, it locks in for the life of any new mandate, 5 years, 10 years, \n20 years, or whatever the CBO estimates for every future year.\n  This means that even if we find in some future year--5 years down the \nroad, 10 years down the road--the Senator from West Virginia may not be \nhere if it is 20 years down the road--that a mandate can be met for \nless money, we nevertheless must appropriate the minimum contained in \nthe bill that sets up the mandate for all future years.\n  If less is appropriated in any year, then the agency decides. We have \nan unelected bureaucrat who, perhaps, will make the decision under a \ndifferent administration or perhaps under a different administration, \nlast one or two administrations, different members of the \nAppropriations Committee, different members of the authorizations \ncommittee.\n We have an unelected bureaucrat making that decision.\n\n  I say that unelected bureaucrat is not only unaccountable to the \npeople, but if we leave it in the hands of the Congress, that is where \nit ought to be. Then the American people know whom to vote against. \nThey at least know whom to vote against if they do not like a mandate \nbeing cut back.\n  But under this process this amendment would put in place, to whom do \nthey complain if they do not like the mandate? To whom do they complain \nunder this process? Why do we not leave it in the hands of the \nCongress? That is where the Constitution puts the power under article \nI, the power to legislate. Article I, section 1. Article I, section 9, \npower to appropriate.\n  I am very concerned about this language, Mr. President. I should \nthink we ought to have more time to debate this point so that we can \nscrutinize it, focus on it, subject it to the microscope and be sure we \nmake a correct decision. With the cloture motion pending here, I have \nan amendment prepared that would strike this. It would strike it, \nstrike the language. If the cloture is invoked tomorrow, if we cannot \nreach a decision today, and cloture is invoked tomorrow, that is the \nonly amendment I can offer. I cannot offer an amendment, then, to \nmodify. I might be able to find a way but it would be very difficult to \noffer an amendment, then, that would modify and bring together language \nthat was beside the point by a meeting of the minds on both sides of \nthe aisle. We would be prohibited from doing that.\n  Why not eliminate all reference to appropriations committee here? Let \nthe authorizing committees pay for it out of their allocation. Or let \nthem, through the pay-go process, let them provide the money. Let them \nraise the taxes, or whatever is required, to meet the full funding. \nStrike all reference to appropriations. Let us out of it.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Again, there is a point I would like to make, Mr. \nPresident. The Senator stated that this locks us in.\n  There is nothing to preclude that in a subsequent year as we find \nthat perhaps, now, based on actual cost, those costs have changed. It \nis no longer based on estimate but actual cost; that Congress can \nrevisit that, because in keeping with the spirit of what the Senator \nfrom West Virginia has said, Congress speaks. We do not delegate. This \nmight cause us to revisit the mandates a little more often than every \n5, 10, 20 years, which is welcome news to our State and local partners.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, strike out all reference to appropriations, and then \nthe authorizing committees could review them every year if they want \nto.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Again, I know our friend from Utah has some good \ninformation on this issue that I hope he will be able to impart to the \nSenate.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial \nfrom today's New York Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 18, 1995]\n\n                      What's the Rush on Mandates?\n\n       Environmentalists and others whose interests are served by \n     Federal regulation have a name for the three main elements of \n     what promises to be a sustained Republican effort to \n     deregulate American society: the ``Unholy Trinity.'' The term \n     connotes both respect and fear. There is merit in all three \n     ideas. Yet critics fear that, taken together, they will \n     cripple a quarter-century of Federal efforts to protect \n     everything from the environment to worker safety.\n       The ideas grew out of Newt Gingrich's ``Contract With \n     America.'' One would require compensation when property \n     values are diminished by Federal regulation. A second would \n     subject regulations to independent cost-benefit analysis, \n     otherwise known as ``risk assessment,'' that could make it \n     more difficult for Federal agencies to carry out rules. The \n     third would make it harder for Congress to approve costly new \n     ``unfunded mandates''--obligations imposed on state and local \n     governments without the Federal dollars to pay for them.\n       These are seductive notions with big consequences. All will \n     need careful legislative handling. Unfortunately, that is not \n     happening with the first of the three to take legislative \n     form--an unfunded-mandates bill that began a fast-track trip \n     through Congress last week. The bill which contains sensible \n     suggestions and serious flaws, received only cursory \n     inspection by two Senate committees. It is now on the Senate \n     floor and will hit the House next week. That is much too \n     fast.\n       Unfunded mandates have long been a sore point with mayors \n     and governors, who say the cost of carrying out Washington's \n     agenda denies them flexibility. Under the proposed \n     legislation, any bill imposing a Federal mandate of more than \n     $50 million must include an estimate by the Congressional \n     Budget Office of its non-Federal costs. It must also include \n     the money to pay for the mandate.\n       A single legislator could block any new mandate that does \n     not meet these conditions. The objection could be overridden, \n     but only after separate votes to override in both houses. \n     Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, would raise the threshold by \n     requiring 60 votes to approve an unfunded mandate.\n       Forcing Congress to reach a higher level of accountability \n     cannot be a bad idea. That is why a bill of some sort is \n     certain to pass and why President Clinton is likely to sign \n     it. So what's to complain about? There are at least two big \n     flaws. First, the bill sets up a two-track system that would \n     discriminate against the private sector. Private companies \n     would still have to obey (and pay for) Federal mandates. \n     Unless Congress gave governments the necessary funds, they \n     could ignore them.\n       That could put private businesses at a competitive \n     disadvantage. Laws governing waste disposal, for example, \n     require expensive landfills to prevent contamination of the \n     underlying water table. Private waste-disposal companies \n     would still have to build and operate these landfills, but \n     state and local governments would not unless Congress \n     underwrote the costs. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which can \n     usually be counted on to support Republican initiatives, have \n     complained that the bill would severely skew the marketplace.\n       Some environmentalists suggest a compromise: Apply the \n     unfunded-mandates prohibition to strictly governmental \n     functions, like education and welfare; where mandates apply \n     to both private and public entities, both should pay. The \n     Clean Water Act, for example, imposes equally strict rules on \n     the discharge of both industrial and municipal wastes. Would \n     unfunded local governments now be free to pollute? That \n     unthinkable outcome is a real possibility under the \n     Republican bill.\n       Another big problem is that the bill applies to new law and \n     does not address the billions in unfunded mandates from old \n     law. That could have the perverse effect of discouraging \n     efforts to fix outdated legislation; any new law that imposes \n     unfunded mandates could run into a Congressional roadblock--\n     even though the new law represents a vast improvement over \n     its predecessor.\n       The bill before the Senate is a carelessly drafted answer \n     to legitimate complaints. \n     [[Page S1046]] Senators Carl Levin of Michigan and Joseph \n     Lieberman of Connecticut, Democrats who are sympathetic to \n     the measure, are using every parliamentary tactic in the book \n     to delay the bill until it is fixed. More power to them. A \n     bill that could reshape basic relations between Federal and \n     local governments, penalize the private sector and threaten \n     the environment should not be railroaded.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I promised the majority leader I would \nsuggest the absence of a quorum at the end of my statement. I want to \nkeep my commitment. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I do not want to forgo that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent--and then you can go ahead and \nobject because I am not trying to stop that. Sometime, somewhere I \nwould like to get recognized so I can speak. We will go ahead with the \nquorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I reserve the right to object.\n  Mr. BYRD. You cannot reserve the right to object.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will continue to \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may retain my \nright to the floor and allow the colloquy to continue among Senators \nHollings and----\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. There is no colloquy. I want to be recognized in my own \nright.\n  Mr. BYRD. I was trying to find a way the Senator----\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It is easy to do. Everybody else can be recognized. You \nall have been up here for days and weeks. I never have been recognized \non this score, and I would like to be recognized, but I will await my \nturn.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator from South Carolina was here before I was and \nsought the floor. I hope that he would seek recognition and get the \nfloor. But I had to keep my commitment to the majority leader. I yield \nthe floor. I hope the Senator from South Carolina will seek the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, may I get recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I was not privy to \nthe discussion that the majority leader had with the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, but what I would like to do is make a \nunanimous-consent request that the Senator from South Carolina be \nallowed to now speak, no amendments would be in order; that following \nthat, we could then allow a colloquy to continue on this issue raised \nby the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is quite obvious I would like to talk \nand without restriction, like any other Senator, like 100 of us here. I \ndo not have to get unanimous consent. I will await my turn after \namendments and after all of your rigmarole takes place. I do not think \nI have to go through my courteous friend, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Idaho, to be recognized. I will await my time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator from Idaho yield for a question----\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I will yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Without losing his right to the floor. I would like to \nask the Senator from Idaho, we are here, we have amendments to offer. \nThe bill is open for amendments. Why can I not offer my amendment?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I will be happy to respond to the Senator from Iowa. \nIt is because we are trying to work out an issue that deals with an \namendment from the Senator's side of the aisle. I have been told that \nwe are close, but because of the fact that a number of Senators on his \nside of the aisle are very concerned to protect that issue for a \nSenator from the other side of the aisle, we have not been able to get \nother approval to move forward on some of these amendments. That is the \nreality.\n  So until I am told we have resolved the issue on the Senator's side \nof the aisle, I felt that it was very healthy to have this discussion \nabout the bill itself. I think it helps all of us. So that is why, with \nall due respect. It is because we are concerned about a Senator on the \nother side of the aisle.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Might I further ask the Senator, is there an objection on \nthis side of the aisle then to anyone offering an amendment? Is there \nan objection that has been raised on this side of the aisle? I would \nlike to ask that question for the record, and if so, I would like to \nknow who.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will continue to call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, could we get some idea as to how much longer \nwe are going to have to sit here without the ability to offer an \namendment? Here time is running. It is 6 p.m. We have a cloture motion \nthat is supposed to be voted on in the morning and there are several \namendments. We have not had an opportunity to offer these amendments.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have one.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. In response to that, it is my hope that we are \nmomentarily away from being allowed to go forward with an amendment, \nwhich is from the Democrat side. And, again, as floor manager, knowing \nthe number of amendments that are there, waiting for action so we can \nfinally have the sort of dialog that we had a few moments ago on this \nbill, and lay it out there--I would love nothing more. That is what I \nhave been pushing for.\n  But again, I must say, with all due respect, because of legitimate \nconcerns--and I respect this--from Senators on your side of the aisle, \nto protect a Senator from your side who will be offering an amendment, \nI assume very soon, we have not been able to move forward with some of \nthe other amendments. That is the situation.\n  So I hope we are just moments away from a green light from the \nparties on both sides of the aisle on that amendment so we can proceed.\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I hope this is not going to be charged up to \nByrdlock.\n  I do not say this unkindly to the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I have the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator knows the Senate is a continuing body, \nexcept for now. I have never seen, in my brief 28 years, this nonsense. \nWhat he wishes and hopes for and everything else--do not give me about \nour side of the aisle and everything else--everybody takes their turn. \nThings take time to work out. We cannot move forward with this \namendment, or I could get recognized and talk.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I would suggest to my friend from South Carolina, \nwith a great deal of respect, that I have throughout this day been \nfloating and \n[[Page S1047]] suggesting unanimous-consent agreements to bring these \namendments to the floor. And there has been objection from your side.\n  So I think I have followed what is prescribed in the Senate rules, in \nthe spirit of trying to get the amendments. I would like nothing more \nthan to get these amendments out on the floor so we can debate them and \nvote on them.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, so the record may be clear, there have been \nno objections from this Senator today.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I do not find our side objecting. I find constantly the \nother side objecting. That is the whole point.\n  Mr. BYRD. This Senator is not objecting. I think the distinguished \nSenator from Idaho is doing the best he can. I think he is trying to \nfollow some injunctions placed on him from higher up. I cannot fault \nhim for that. But I wonder how much longer we are going to be remaining \nin this state of limbo. We cannot offer amendments. We cannot even get \nunanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and take up an \namendment by Mr. Hollings. Where is the problem? Why all the rush? This \nis what I have been saying all along.\n  I have been rather amused to see a new term in the legislative \nlexicon, ``Byrdlock.''\n  But is this Byrdlock? I hope this delay is not charged against \nByrdlock.\n  Why can we not debate the bill? Why can we not offer amendments? We \nhave a cloture amendment that is going to be voted on in the morning \nand scores of amendments waiting here.\n  If this is not putting the boot heel on the neck of the minority, \npray tell me what it is? What is this? Who has the lock on the Senate \nnow? The Senator from South Carolina has been sitting in his seat for \nan hour--or longer. After the last vote, he stood and sought \nrecognition. A quorum was begun and the effort to call it off was \nobjected to.\n  Then the distinguished majority leader came into the Chamber. I said \nI would like to call off the quorum call and make a statement. He said, \n``Well, will you put in a quorum--put us back in a quorum?''\n  I said yes. I did not know we were going to be locked out for the \nnext half hour or hour, or whatever it is.\n  I hope that we can get some idea of how much longer we are going to \nhave to sit here in a state of limbo, and not be able to offer an \namendment.\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield without losing his right to the \nfloor?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I do not want to keep the floor. I just want to make \nsure this delay is not charged up to Byrdlock.\n  Mr. GLENN. Let me explain this. About 5 hours ago, Senator Boxer \nsought the floor for an amendment. There was objection on the \nRepublican side to her bringing that up.\n  And she has continually sought the floor on this and tried to work \nthis out--tried to work out the differences with those who objected to \nher amendment on the other side.\n  It has to do with a statement and with legislation she wanted to make \nthat basically deals with abortion clinics and some protection and so \non into those areas. There were some people on the other side who had \nbeen negotiating this on behalf of five or six other Senators on the \nRepublican side. Because we are in a situation here where the committee \namendments are the things being considered, still technically on the \nfloor, only amendments to that are permitted. So she has been frozen \nout, as this arrangement has not been able to be worked out. She has \nthought a number of times this afternoon they had this worked out. She \nwas disappointed each time; it was not worked out.\n  We are told now, maybe after all, maybe it is now worked out so the \nlanguage in her proposal, her amendment, will now be acceptable to \nthose who disagreed with it on the other side.\n  In the meantime--because only one amendment could apply, under Senate \nrules, because it is the committee amendment en bloc that we have been \nworking on all this time--there have been continual amendments put in \nto keep her frozen out by the leadership on the other side.\n  That just is an explanation of exactly what has happened.\n  She feels, I believe now, that they perhaps are within minutes of \ngetting approval, I believe. I do not know whether that approval has \nbeen forthcoming or not. They were checking once again for about the \nsixth or seventh time in the last 4\\1/2\\ or 5 hours. That is how we got \nto where we were. I think we have been referring back and forth, one \nside to the other. I wanted to explain exactly what the situation was \nand how we got here.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GLENN. It is not my--Senator Byrd still has the right to the \nfloor. He retains the right to the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. No.\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n                 Amendment No. 141 to Amendment No. 31\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that States should not \n       shift costs to local governments, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley], for himself, Mr. \n     Chafee, and Mr. Dorgan, proposes an amendment numbered 141 to \n     amendment No. 31.\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of the pending amendment inserted the following:\n\n     SEC. 107. IMPACT ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Congress should be concerned about shifting costs \n     from Federal to State and local authorities and should be \n     equally concerned about the growing tendency of States to \n     shift costs to local governments;\n       (2) cost shifting from States to local governments has, in \n     many instances, forced local governments to raise property \n     taxes or curtail sometimes essential services; and\n       (3) increases in local property taxes and cuts in essential \n     services threaten the ability of many citizens to attain and \n     maintain the American dream of owning a home in a safe, \n     secure community.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Federal Government should not shift certain costs \n     to the State, and States should end the practice of shifting \n     costs to local governments, which forces many local \n     governments to increase property taxes;\n       (2) States should end the imposition, in the absence of \n     full consideration by their legislatures, of State issued \n     mandates on local governments without adequate State funding, \n     in a manner that may displace other essential government \n     priorities; and\n       (3) one primary objective of this Act and other efforts to \n     change the relationship among Federal, State, and local \n     governments should be to reduce taxes and spending at all \n     levels and to end the practice of shifting costs from one \n     level of government to another with little or no benefit to \n     taxpayers.\n\n     SEC. 108. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, the amendment I propose is an amendment I \ntalked about both with the majority and the minority staff. They \nunderstand that it is a simple sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It says \nvery simply that this is a bill that deals with unfunded mandates of \nthe Federal Government on the State government, and it would be the \nsense of the Senate that States should not apply unfunded mandates on \nlocal governments that lead to increased property taxes.\n  Mr. President, so far in this debate, we have focused primarily on \nthe unfunded mandates that the Federal Government is said to impose on \nthe States. However, I would like to take a moment to draw the Senate's \nattention to an equally important set of mandates. I am referring to \nthe unfunded mandates that Governors and State legislators impose on \nlocal governments and, more important, the burden that these mandates \nimpose on taxpayers.\n  Taxpayers' main concern is their total tax burden, not how this \nburden is divided among Federal, State, and local governments. As \nelected officials at every level can attest, cutting taxes and \nexpanding services are far preferable to the converse--especially if \nsomeone else picks up the tab. However, as we all know, the person who \nultimately picks up this tab is the taxpayer.\n  Mr. President, in order to address the burden that this form of cost \nshifting imposes on taxpayers, I have sent to the desk a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution in the form of an amendment to this bill. This \nresolution simply states that just as the Federal Government should \nnot, in the absence of careful consideration, shift costs to the \nStates, \n[[Page S1048]] the States should end the practice of shifting costs to \nlocal governments, which frequently has the effect of raising local \ntaxes.\n  When Governors and State legislators shift costs to local governments \nin an effort to cut taxes and balance their operating budgets, they are \nnot reducing the overall tax burden; they are merely changing the \ncollection point. Instead, what happens is that local authorities who \nhave no other source of revenue are forced to either raise property \ntaxes or cut services. As a practical matter, however, these services--\nsuch as fire, police, trash, and water services--are often essential to \nthe safety and well-being of our communities. Therefore, the effect of \ncost shifting by State governments is, all too often, to increase local \nproperty taxes.\n  These State-imposed mandates and the impact they have on taxpayers \nare by no means inconsequential. In New Jersey, the State imposes no \nless than 36 separate unfunded mandates on local governments. These \nunfunded State mandates cost New Jersey taxpayers over $150 million \neach year. In my State, as in many others, the main source of local tax \nrevenue is the property tax. In fact, local property taxes make up over \n98 percent of all local tax\n revenue in New Jersey. Therefore, for every dollar in costs that the \nState shifts to local governments, these governments are forced to \nraise property taxes by an equal amount.\n\n  In 1991, the cost of New Jersey's property taxes was over $1,250 per \nperson, not even per household. Since then, property taxes have only \ngone up. In fact, over the last 7 years, property tax collections in \nNew Jersey rose over 64 percent and, this last year, property taxes \nrose faster than during any year since 1990. The upshot is that in \nOrange, NJ, the average homeowner saw an $800 increase in property \ntaxes in 1994. Sadly, these homeowners were not alone. In Mansfield, \nthe average homeowner saw a $600 increase in her property taxes in \n1994. In Teaneck, the increase was $237; in Lyndhurst, $479; in Lodi, \n$100; in Dumont, $139; and in Alpine, the average homeowner paid over \n$1,000 more in property taxes in 1994 than in 1993.\n  Property taxes affect everyone: while homeowners pay them directly, \nrenters pay them indirectly. In addition, high property taxes \ndisproportionately affect those who are often the most at risk in our \nsociety. For many older citizens, especially those who live on a fixed \nincome, high property taxes threaten their ability to remain in their \nhomes. For many younger, middle-class families, high property taxes \noften mean that they must defer or abandon their dreams of owning a \nhome.\n  Ultimately, Mr. President, this resolution is about honesty and \nresponsibility. It is about honesty in how governments fund the \nservices that they provide. It's also about responsibility and the need \nfor government at all levels to take responsibility for its actions.\n  Government officials are loath to raise taxes. Yet, we also see \nproblems in our States that need to be addressed. The result, too \noften, is that we pass a law, and we pass the buck. Mr. President, I am \nnot passing judgment on specific mandates, at either the State of \nFederal level. In fact, many of these mandates have helped to ensure \nthe safety and well-being of our fellow citizens. Instead, I am simply \nstating that if government officials, at any level, intend to pass a \nnew regulation, they should be honest about the cost that this \nregulation will impose on taxpayers. They should not attempt to hide \nthe cost by shifting it downstream. Unfortunately, rather than being \nhonest and taking responsibility for their actions, too many government \nofficials appear to have signs on their desks that read, ``The Buck \nStops * * * Over There.''\n  In order to call attention to the need for government officials at \nall levels to fully consider the impact that cost shifting has on \ntaxpayers, I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I am joined in sponsoring this amendment by Senator \nChafee and others.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will be able to get a vote on this as the \npending business before the Senate.\n  I am prepared to move to a vote at any time. A Senator has the right \nto the floor when he is recognized, and I certainly would like to \nrespect the agreements that have been struck between the minority and \nthe majority. At the same time, when there was an open slot in the \namendment process, I took advantage of that amendment slot.\n  It is a very simple amendment, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I \nhope it will be adopted. I have checked with both the minority and the \nmajority, and it deals simply with the issue of State unfunded mandates \non local governments leading to higher property taxes.\n  Mr. GLENN. I will be glad to accept the amendment on our side of the \naisle.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. If the Senator will yield, we, too, will accept the \namendment on our side.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I ask for the yeas and nays. I want a rollcall vote on \nthis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think we have worked out an agreement. We \nwill have two votes back to back beginning at 7:15. The first vote will \nbe on the Bradley amendment. The second vote will be on the Boxer, et \nal., amendment. There will be 1 hour of debate on the Boxer amendment \nequally divided.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Bradley amendment be temporarily set \naside so the Senator from California may be recognized and that we have \nthose votes back to back at 7:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I would \nsimply like to make the point that it is the Bradley-Chafee amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if I might \ninquire of the majority leader, I understand he asked unanimous consent \nthat we have 1 hour of debate right now on the Boxer amendment and at \n7:15 vote on the Bradley amendment, then vote on the Boxer amendment \nright after that, and that when we get back to the bill it will be open \nfor amendments at that point in time?\n  Mr. DOLE. I think, in fact, I would rather have the votes start at \n7:30, if there is no objection. The first vote will be at 7:30 on the \nBradley-Chafee amendment and the second vote will be on the Boxer, et \nal., amendment. And then it is open for other amendments. There are \nnumerous amendments.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Is it the majority leader's intention to continue the \nSenate in session so we may offer amendments at that point in time?\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Reserving the right to object further, I do not intend \nto object. Could we order the yeas and nays on the Bradley amendment? I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I ask for the yeas and \nnays on the Boxer, et al., amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is not in order at this time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it may be in \norder to order the yeas and nays on the Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would the majority leader yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the majority leader's \nrequest?\n   [[Page S1049]] Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I shall \nnot. I ask the majority leader who is controlling the time on the \nRepublican side on the Boxer amendment?\n  Mr. DOLE. The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles].\n  Mrs. BOXER. Then I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Bradley amendment is temporarily set \naside.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 142 to Amendment No. 31\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the Attorney General \n  should act immediately to protect reproductive health care clinics)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration, pursuant to the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself, Mrs. \n     Murray, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Simon, \n     Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n     Lieberman, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Pell, Mr. \n     Inouye, Ms. Mikulski, and Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 142 to amendment No. 31.\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 108. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING PROTECTION OF \n                   REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CLINICS.\n\n       ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       ``(1) there are approximately 900 clinics in the United \n     States providing reproductive health services;\n       ``(2) violence directed at persons seeking to provide \n     reproductive health services continues to increase in the \n     United States, as demonstrated by the recent shootings at two \n     reproductive health clinics in Massachusetts and another \n     health care clinic in Virginia;\n       ``(3) organizations monitoring clinic violence have \n     recorded over 130 incidents of violence or harassment \n     directed at reproductive health care clinics and their \n     personnel in 1994 such as death threats, stalking, chemical \n     attacks, bombings and arson;\n       ``(4) there has been one attempted murder in Florida and \n     four individuals killed at reproductive health care clinics \n     in Florida and Massachusetts in 1994;\n       ``(5) the Congress passed and the President signed the \n     Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 1994, a law \n     establishing Federal criminal penalties and civil remedies \n     for certain violent, threatening, obstructive and destructive \n     conduct that is intended to injure, intimidate or interfere \n     with persons seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health \n     services;\n       ``(6) violence is not a mode of free speech and should not \n     be condoned as a method of expressing an opinion; and\n       ``(7) the President has instructed the Attorney General to \n     order--\n       ``(A) the United States Attorneys to create task forces of \n     Federal, State and local law enforcement officials and \n     develop plans to address security for reproductive health \n     care clinics located within their jurisdictions; and\n       ``(B) the United States Marshals Service to ensure \n     coordination between clinics and Federal, State and local law \n     enforcement officials regarding potential threats of \n     violence.\n       ``(b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the United States Attorney General should fully enforce \n     the law and protect persons seeking to provide or obtain, or \n     assist in providing or obtaining, reproductive health \n     services from violent attack.\n       ``(c) Nothing in this resolution shall be construed to \n     prohibit any expressive conduct (including peaceful picketing \n     or other peaceful demonstration) protected from legal \n     prohibition by the First Amendment to the Constitution.''\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I took the unusual step of having the \nclerk read this resolution in full because I think that it very clearly \nsays more than anyone could express, because it took a lot of time and \na lot of people's help, that there is no place for violence in our \nsociety and that we must come together as a U.S. Senate when such \nviolence occurs and speak with one voice.\n  The reason I have been so persistent for these past 2 weeks is \nbecause I feel it is essential that this U.S. Senate, the most \ndeliberative body in the world, the one with the most magnificent \ntraditions of debate, thought, of deliberation, that we take the time, \neven if it means setting aside some other business, to deal with an \nimmediate issue.\n  We are working on the unfunded mandates bill. It is very complicated. \nIt is very complicated. I happen to like the notion behind it. But as I \nlook at some of the bureaucracy that may be created as a result of it, \nI have some pause. As I look at whether or not illegal immigration \nmight be covered in it, I have some pause. As I look at its impact on \nchildren and pregnant women, the frail and elderly, on child \npornography laws, child abuse laws and child labor law, I have some \npause.\n  So it is a very complicated piece of legislation. But what is not \ncomplicated, Mr. President, to understand is that there is violence in \nour land and it takes many forms. If there is one area in which I \nbelieve I should make a contribution, it would be in the area of \nviolence in America--whether it is on our streets, whether it is in the \nhomes, whether it is in schools, wherever it occurs, including \nreproductive health care clinics. I have made many statements \nthroughout this day and last week and before that on the history of \nviolence at clinics. And so I have been pursuing a very clear sense of \nthe Senate that the Attorney General should act fully and enforce the \nlaw and protect the decent, law-abiding citizens of this land, who \nhappen to be in or around health care clinics.\n  I want to say that the manager of the bill, the Senator from Idaho, \nhas been most gracious to me. I want to say that he has understood \nquite clearly how deeply I felt about this issue, and he has made every \neffort to bring about a resolution to my problem which, clearly stated, \nwas I could not find a way, Mr. President, to bring this up before the \nbody until an agreement was worked out.\n  The majority leader, Senator Dole, was very straightforward with me. \nHe said, ``You need to work this out and then we will bring it up. But \nif you do not have an agreement with my side, we are not going to bring \nit up.'' Obviously, that set up somewhat of a problem for me.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles] and I want to \nthank the Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats] for working with me, with \nSenator Murray, and with many of the people who wrote the FACE bill, to \ncome up with an acceptable resolution, which has just been read to the \nU.S. Senate.\n  I want to particularly thank the cosponsors of my bill. The bill that \nI introduced was one of the first pieces of legislation condemning this \nviolence, which included three Republican Senators--Senators Snowe, \nChafee and Jeffords. I want to thank them very much. And I thank my \noriginal cosponsors who were there the day I introduced the bill, \nSenator Murray and Senator Feingold. The other Senators who are \ncosponsors are Senators Kennedy, Campbell, Simon, Lautenberg, Dodd, \nBaucus, Levin, Lieberman, Moseley-Braun, Harkin, Pell, Inouye, \nMikulski, Feinstein, Kerry, and Bradley. And today Senator Reid and \nSenator Wellstone were added to that list.\n  I am very proud that we have reached an agreement so that the will of \n25 Senators who believed in this enough to go on this bill will get \nsome attention.\n  At this time, I will yield to the Senator from Washington, Senator \nMurray, 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California, who \nhas been very persistent on this issue and deserves a great deal of \ngratitude and credit from all of us for insisting that we bring before \nus this very important sense of the Senate that speaks to the violence \nthat has been occurring at reproductive health care clinics in this \nNation.\n  We are all aware of the violence that has ravaged neighborhoods \nthroughout our Nation. And I have to tell you every time kids gather in \nmy kitchen or I talk to my next door neighbors or my parents, the first \nwords out of their mouths is not unfunded mandates or line-item veto, \nit is: ``What are you going to do about the issue of violence in this \ncountry?'' They tell me they fear walking in their neighborhoods, fear \ngoing to their schools, and they want to know what we are going to do.\n  Well, the campaign of terror that is being perpetrated against \ndoctors and patients in reproductive health clinics is a frightening \nexample of this violence. The message that this violence sends to our \nchildren--that the world is a frightening place--is intolerable. When \nthey see a gunman at a clinic, it reinforces in their minds that this \n[[Page S1050]] world is not a safe place. It is incumbent upon us as \nthe elected leaders in this Nation to tell our children that we will do \nall we can to make sure that their world is safe.\n  I read yesterday's Washington Post and was very struck by the article \nthat appeared. I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 17, 1995]\n\n         Clinic Killings Follow Years of Antiabortion Violence\n\n                (By Laurie Goodstein and Pierre Thomas)\n\n       Militant antiabortion activists have been waging a \n     protracted campaign of violence against women's health \n     clinics and the people who work in them over the past decade, \n     creating a climate of terror long before a gunman opened fire \n     last month at clinics in Massachusetts and Virginia.\n       The killings of two doctors, two clinic staff members and a \n     voluntary escort over the past 22 months have captured \n     national attention. But the tally of violence over the past \n     12 years includes 123 cases of arson and 37 bombings in 33 \n     states, and more than 1,500 cases of stalking, assault, \n     sabotage and burglary, according to records compiled by the \n     Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) and the clinics \n     themselves.\n       ``We have seen a consistent pattern, acknowledging the fact \n     that people are willing to go to any means for their cause,'' \n     said Ralph Ostrowski, chief of ATF's arson and explosives \n     division. ``In the past we would have acts of violence \n     directed at property. Now we see acts of violence directed at \n     people.''\n       Nearly all antiabortion leaders say they are aware of the \n     scope of the violence and have condemned it, and say no one \n     in their groups is associated with such tactics. They \n     describe the violence as an aberration.\n       ``There is not this collective soul-searching on the part \n     of our movement because we have been responsible and we have \n     been non-violent,'' said the Rev. Patrick Mahoney, director \n     of the Christian Defense Coalition. There are ``extremists in \n     every movement. . . . I think that extremists opposed to \n     abortion got frustrated, felt they were losing the battle and \n     felt it\n      was incumbent upon themselves to resort to violence.''\n       The Rev. Flip Benham, director of Operation Rescue, went \n     further and accused ``those in the abortion-providing \n     industry'' of committing most of the violence in an attempt \n     to discredit the antiabortion movement. He should he would \n     soon bring evidence to Washington that would undermine the \n     government's statistics.\n       However, ATF spokeswoman Susan McCarron said of the 49 \n     people prosecuted so far, ``We found that all expressed \n     antiabortion views. There is nothing in our cases that would \n     show it's providers or supporters of abortion that are doing \n     these acts, but we investigate all leads.''\n       Immediately after hearing the news of the killings last \n     month in Brookline, Mass., Cardinal Bernard Law, archbishop \n     of Boston, issued a statement asking for a moratorium on \n     protests at abortion facilities. But his plea has been \n     rejected by other prominent figures across the spectrum in \n     the antiabortion movement--including Benham, Cardinal John J. \n     O'Connor of New York and Judie Brown of the American Life \n     League.\n       Like many other antiabortion leaders interviewed, Benham \n     said he sees no connection between angry rhetoric and violent \n     action. ``This whole thing isn't about violence. It's all \n     about silence--silencing the Christian message. That's what \n     they want,'' Benham said of abortion rights leaders. ``They \n     screech and scream about us crying fire in a crowded theater. \n     And I agree it is wrong, unless there is a fire. If there's a \n     fire in that theater, we better call it that. Our \n     inflammatory rhetoric is only revealing a far more \n     inflammatory truth.''\n       In most cases, the violence has disrupted clinics where a \n     large portion of staff time is devoted not to abortions but \n     to routine women's reproductive health care--pap smears, \n     teaching and supplying birth control methods, and treating \n     sexually transmitted diseases. Phone calls to a dozen clinics\n      targeted by the violence found that six of them did not even \n     provide abortion services.\n       At the Women's Pavilion Clinic in South Bend, Ind., which \n     does perform abortions, in recent years somebody has hacked \n     holes in the roof with an ax, shot out the windows and sent \n     repeated death threats to gynecologist Ulrich Klopfer by \n     phone and mail, said Marni Greening, the clinic's director. \n     Meanwhile, protesters with a group called the Lambs of Christ \n     have regularly barricaded the doors and blockaded the \n     driveway, undeterred by repeated arrests.\n       In the early hours of Mother's Day 1993, someone connected \n     a hose to the clinic's outdoor spigot and fed it through the \n     door's mail slot, flooding the clinic's entry room. The \n     person or persons then poured in butyric acid, a nearly \n     indelible substance that smells like feces and vomit and \n     becomes more potent in water. The clinic had to shut down for \n     7\\1/2\\ weeks to get rid of the smell, Greening said.\n       The unrelenting and unpredictable nature of the violence \n     has produced a resolute fatalism among the staff. Klopfer \n     said he was shot at last week as he drove home from work. He \n     reported it to federal marshals, but, he said: ``If it's \n     going to happen, it's going to happen. I'm realistic enough. \n     Look at all the people shooting up the White House, and that \n     has a hell of a lot better security than I do.''\n       Owners of the Hillcrest Clinic in Norfolk, where John C. \n     Salvi III allegedly fired about 23 shots, sustained $250,000 \n     worth of damage in an arson case in 1984 and another $1,000 \n     in damage in a bombing in the next year. Staff members there \n     have stopped commenting about attacks.\n       At the Planned Parenthood clinic in Lancaster, Pa., clinic \n     director Nancy Osgood remembers a 3 a.m. phone call in \n     September 1993 when she rushed to the clinic in time to see \n     the brick building smoldering, gutted by fire. The Lancaster \n     facility does not perform abortions, although other Planned \n     Parenthood clinics do.\n       No suspects have been arrested in that arson, although \n     national abortion rights groups offered a $100,000 reward for \n     tips on this and other crimes. ``Finally we have national \n     leadership talking about this being domestic terrorism. We've \n     said that for years,'' Osgood said.\n       ATF agents have arrested 49 people\n        in 77 of the bombing and arson cases. Thirty-three cases \n     have been closed because they have exceeded the statute of \n     limitations. The 50 cases still under investigation \n     include an arson at the Commonwealth Women's Clinic in \n     Falls Church last July 31.\n       Damages range from $150 at a Brooklyn N.Y., clinic that was \n     the target of two Molotov cocktails in 1993, to $1.4 million \n     caused by an arson fire at Family Planning Associates in \n     Bakersfield, Calif., in September of the same year. The total \n     damage to property amounts to more than $12 million.\n       A federal task force of officials with the ATF, FBI, U.S. \n     marshals and lawyers from the Justice Department's criminal \n     and civil divisions was created in 1993, and stepped up its \n     efforts after Paul D. Hill shot to death two people at a \n     Pensacola, Fla., clinic last July. A grand jury is currently \n     hearing evidence in Alexandria.\n       Authorities are focusing on whether there is a national \n     conspiracy, although some officials privately note they have \n     not found evidence to support that at this stage in the \n     investigation. Several law enforcement officials say it is \n     more likely they will find separate conspiracies conducted by \n     small cadres of activists, as well as campaigns carried out \n     by individuals.\n       Some of the incidents match the description of tactics in \n     ``The Army of God'' manual that law enforcement officers \n     found buried in the yard of Rochelle ``Shelly'' Shannon, an \n     Oregon activist convicted of shooting Wichita doctor George \n     Tiller, and awaiting trial on eight counts of arson at \n     clinics in several states.\n       ``Annihilating abortuaries is our purest form of worship,'' \n     the manual says. It gives explicit instructions for home-\n     brewing plastic explosives, fashioning detonators, \n     deactivating alarm systems, and cutting phone, gas and water \n     lines.\n       Some federal investigators suspect that there is no \n     organized ``Army of God.'' They believe the manual has not \n     been widely distributed, but may have provided guidance in \n     several cases of arson, bombing and sabotage. The butyric \n     acid attack on the Women's Pavilion in South Bend precisely \n     matches tactics described in the manual.\n       After the recent shootings in Massachusetts, in which two \n     clinic receptionists were killed and five people\n      wounded, the Justice Department ordered federal officials to \n     record every threat against clinics and their staffs, and \n     began to enforce the civil provisions of the Freedom of \n     Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) law. Enacted last year, \n     the law makes it a federal crime to physically block \n     access to clinics, damage their property or injure, \n     interfere with or intimidate their staff or patients.\n       Last week a federal judge in Kansas City, Mo., used the \n     civil provisions of the FACE law to issue a temporary \n     restraining order against Regina Rene Dinwiddie for \n     threatening and intimidating staff and clients at the Planned \n     Parenthood of Greater Kansas City clinic.\n       Antiabortion protesters say the law is being used to limit \n     their freedom of speech. But federal officials are beginning \n     to crack down on the death threats that have become \n     increasingly common. There were about 400 death threats and \n     bomb threats logged in 1994 alone.\n       On Jan. 7, signs were found posted at four clinics in Long \n     Island saying, ``Danger: This is a War Zone. People are being \n     killed here like in Boston. You risk injury or death if you \n     are caught on or near these premises,'' said Karen Pearl, \n     executive director of Planned Parenthood of Nassau County.\n       The threats follow clinic staff members to their homes and \n     neighborhoods. Carolyn Izard, a nurse and clinic director at \n     Little Rock Family Planning Services in Arkansas, arrived \n     home one day to find her neighborhood was papered with fliers \n     calling her a ``death camp worker.''\n       ``It backfired on them,'' Izard recalled. ``I got calls \n     from neighbors that told me that they supported me 100 \n     percent and they were furious that this kind of brochure was \n     left on their doors for their children to see.''\n       Curtis Stover has seen a dramatic change in the protesters' \n     behavior in the 21 years he's performed abortions in Little \n     Rock. ``Before, all they would do is quietly carry placards \n     around and not do much,'' Stover said. Now, ``every other \n     sentence is full of \n     [[Page S1051]] the word `murder.' Patients come in and they \n     yell at them not to murder their babies. I've had picketers \n     tell me I was going to die by a certain date.''\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. In the first paragraph it says:\n\n       Militant antiabortion activists have been waging a \n     protracted campaign of violence against women's health \n     clinics and the people who work in them over the past decade \n     * * * The tally of violence over the pass 12 years includes \n     123 cases of arson and 37 bombings in 33 States, and more \n     than 1,500 cases of stalking, assault, sabotage and burglary, \n     according to records compiled by the * * *  ATF and the \n     clinics themselves.\n\n  I think it is high time this Senate goes on record that we do not \ncondone these acts of violence.\n  Women's health care providers across the Nation are facing bombings, \narson, kidnappings, and assaults. As they go to work each day, these \nhealth care providers must contemplate the possibility that an \nantichoice extremist will try to kill them. The shootings at clinics in \nMassachusetts and Virginia are only the most recent examples.\n  One doctor in my State of Washington wrote to me recently and said:\n\n       Every time I walked toward the building, I thought to \n     myself that some antichoice terrorist could have set a bomb \n     and that my life could be on the line. Fortunately, so far I \n     have been able to work unimpeded, but with every assault on a \n     clinic around the country, I worry about the safety of my \n     staff as well as that of my patients. The next time a gun is \n     fired, it could well hit a patient or staff member. The \n     psychological toll all this takes on clinic staff is \n     enormous, as you can well imagine.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to step back and view this issue as a parent. \nThat is how I view it. I have a young daughter and I cannot express the \nfear that I have that perhaps some day if the horrible should happen \nand my daughter is raped, that not only should she have to go through \nthe trauma of an abortion, but she would have to fear for her life when \nshe attempts to get access to safe health care.\n  The same article that appeared in the Washington Post yesterday has \nan important paragraph that we must also remember.\n  It says:\n\n       In most cases, the violence has disrupted clinics where a \n     large portion of staff time is devoted not to abortions but \n     to routine women's reproductive health care--pap smears, \n     teaching and supplying birth control methods, and treating \n     sexually transmitted diseases.\n\n  Let us remember that women go to these clinics for pap smears as \nwell. Their lives have been endangered, and we need to protect them.\n  Last year, Congress passed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances \nAct and the President signed it into law. The law outlaws clinic \nviolence while protecting lawful picketing and lawful protests not \naccompanied by force, threat of force, or physical obstruction.\n  Mr. President, I fully support our first amendment rights under the \nU.S. Constitution. However, with the Freedom of Access to Clinic \nEntrances Act we properly acknowledged that violence is not a mode of \nfree speech. It is time for all of us, no matter how we feel about the \nissue of abortion, to let our Nation know that we will not tolerate \nviolence as a means of protest.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this sense-of-the-Senate resolution urging \nthe Attorney General to fully enforce the law. And I urge my colleagues \nto support it as well. Again, I thank my colleague from California, \nSenator Boxer, and I yield back my time to the Senator from California.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would like to yield 10 minutes to \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Idaho for \nyielding me 10 minutes.\n  This is an important amendment, Mr. President, because it is a \nforceful condemnation against violence. It might be thought unnecessary \nto condemn violence because it is so obvious that violence is the major \nproblem in the United States today, with the crime wave, and the major \nproblem in the world with conflicts and wars going on all around the \nworld. But it is important to have this forceful condemnation against \nviolence, because people are standing up and saying that these acts of \nviolence, these acts of murder, are justifiable homicide, which is an \nabsolute absurdity under the law.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer has been a law enforcement \nofficer, an attorney general of Missouri. This Senator spent 12 years \nin the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office--4 years as an \nassistant, trying murder cases, robbery, rape, and arson cases, and \nthen 8 years as district attorney of an office which handled 30,000 \ncriminal trials a year and some 500 homicide cases.\n  There is no justification whatsoever for saying that murder is \njustifiable homicide when it is related to someone who performs an \nabortion.\n  Under the laws of the United States, Roe versus Wade and Casey versus \nPlanned Parenthood, there is a period during which this is lawful \nconduct, and how anyone can say that it is justifiable homicide is an \nabsolute absurdity.\n  I thank the Chair for nodding in agreement, because I make a point \nwhich is very obvious to anyone who has had any experience in law \nenforcement and, beyond that, to any thinking American. But in \nnewsprint today, stories are carried about people who make this \ncontention. And some of the public opinion polls show a response --one \npoll showed 3 percent of the people have this idea. It should be \nlabeled as emphatically as possible that it is an absurdity.\n  When the Senate of the United States speaks out, as I am confident \nthe Senate of the United States will speak out tonight, in condemning \nthis kind of violence, it will make an impact. This condemnation should \nring from every speaker in America who has an opportunity to speak out, \nfrom the President of the United States, to Members of the House, to \nMembers of the Senate, ministers, priests, and rabbis from the pulpit, \nand anywhere anyone can make a speech.\n  It is atrocious when you think of 130 incidents of death threats, \nstalking, chemical attacks, bombings, arsons, attempted murder, to say \nnothing of the four murders which have been perpetrated and the fear \nthat is being created at 900 health clinics around the country.\n  The point has been made, but it is worth reinforcing, that the \nmajority of activities at these clinics do not involve abortion at all. \nThe Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and Human Services, which I \nchair, will have a hearing on the range of medical services which are \nperformed. As already mentioned: Pap smears, mammograms, other health \nservices for women. These women are being terrified.\n  The resolution calls for the creation of task forces and coordination \nby U.S. Marshals Service; that is fundamental to help law enforcement, \nto have the agencies of the law work together.\n  There are substantial funds available at the present time; more than \n$1 billion available to local prosecutors on applications which would \nbe made. I think that the Department of Justice would look very \nfavorably upon applications which were made along this line.\n  There is also considerable funding in the crime bill to protect women \nagainst violence. So funds are available in additional amounts.\n  The final part of resolution, stating that, ``It is the sense of the \nSenate that the United States Attorney General should fully enforce the \nlaw and protect persons seeking to provide or obtain, or assist in \nproviding or obtaining, reproductive health services from violent \nattack,'' is just very, very fundamental.\n  Not that it is necessary, but there is an additional clause which \nprotects first amendment freedoms of expression.\n  I think Cardinal Law in Boston was right on target when he made a \nplea to desist from any conduct which could be remotely connected with \ninciting violence at these clinics. First amendment freedoms have to be \nprotected so that people can speak up.\n  I think that it is a very, very important statement to have this kind \nof a forceful condemnation against violence, especially in the context \nwhere so many people are absurdly talking about justifiable homicide.\n  I urge my colleagues to have the strongest conceivable vote in \nsupport of this important resolution.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield as much time as she may consume \nto \n[[Page S1052]] the Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski] who was a very \nearly sponsor of this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank Senator Boxer for yielding me time.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the Boxer sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution. I join Senator Boxer and the other cosponsors in \nexpressing our outrage at the recent killings of clinic workers in \nMassachusetts.\n  I wish to thank my colleague from California for offering this sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution. I am only sorry that we were not able to \nbring this to the floor in a more timely fashion. But her steadfastness \nin pursuing our right to speak up, speak out, and vote on this issue is \nreally to be a source of kudos to her.\n  When we come to the content of this resolution, we have to say that, \nsadly, this is not the first time we have come to the floor to express \nour outrage at senseless killing of health care providers. That is what \nwe are talking about--health care providers. We came to the floor when \nthe antiabortion extremist Paul Hill shot and killed Dr. Gunn. We were \nhere when Dr. John Britton and Lt. Col. James Barrett were brutally \nmurdered in Pensacola. And we are here again tonight to decry the \ndeaths of Shannon Lowney and Leanne Nichols and the five other \nindividuals who were seriously injured earlier this month.\n  The killing must stop, and it must stop now.\n  It is no longer simply a protest against abortion. Peaceful protests \nhave given away to extremism. Protest has turned to violence. This is \nnot the American way. The United States of America, through its \nConstitution, provides people the opportunity to speak out, to have \ndissenting views, and to do it in an atmosphere that is protected by \nlaw. But, unfortunately, that is not where we are now.\n  For those physicians and other people who work at the Planned \nParenthood clinics, doctors are being forced to wear bulletproof vests. \nThis is the United States of America. A doctor, instead of putting on a \nwhite lab coat, must put on a bulletproof vest to meet the compelling \nneeds of his patients; clinics are being forced to build fortresses to \nprotect their staff; patients are being forced to use escorts to get \ninto the clinics. And even with all of these precautions, the killings \ncontinue.\n  I cannot tell you how saddened I am by this. Women in this country \nare being sent a message that they risk their lives if they seek \nreproductive health care. Let me repeat that. In the United States of \nAmerica, women risk their lives if they seek reproductive health care. \nThat is an injustice.\n  Last year, this body adopted a rule of law--it was called the Freedom \nof Access to Clinic Entrances Act--to put an end to this violence. But \nthe success of this law now rests with the Attorney General. I believe \nshe has taken important steps to enforce this bill.\n  But the Attorney General must take all necessary steps to ensure that \nnot one more health care worker loses his or her life in a facility \nthat happens to perform abortions. The Attorney General must do all \nthat can be done to see that no more individuals are injured, maimed or \nmurdered. She must enforce the law so that individuals are protected \nfrom violent attack.\n Every effort must be made to stop the terrorism that reproductive \nhealth clinics and their staffs endure. The message must be clear: That \nthese attacks will be met with the harshest response. And the message \nmust be clear to the opponents of the freedom to choose, that this type \nof extremism will not be tolerated, and it is not American.\n\n  The violence has gone too far. It is time to return to civility, to \ndecency, to the principles on which this country were founded. A woman \nshould not be at risk of losing her life to get the health care she \nneeds.\n  Let me say this about protests. In the United States of America \npeople can protest. When we passed the Freedom of Access to Clinic \nlegislation, we ensured that nonviolent peaceful protests be allowed to \noccur. Mr. President, I am in politics because I was a protester, a \nnonviolent protester who organized her community out of the basement of \nSt. Stanislaus Church to protest the highway, a 16-lane highway, that \nwas going to sweep through my neighborhood, taking the homes of older \nEuropean ethnics, and the first black home ownership neighborhood in \nBaltimore.\n  So I know what it is like to be a nonviolent protester, to organize \npeople in a way that is joyful, exciting, creative. Know what we did? \nWe did not go out and beat a mayor up. We did not bomb the Secretary of \nTransportation. We held a festival. We held a festival to show what our \nneighborhoods were. And in that neighborhood where I now live and \ncommute from Baltimore every day, stands the neighborhood that I helped \nsave.\n  And by being a protester the people did not punish me. They rewarded \nme and sent me to the Baltimore City Council, from there, the House of \nRepresentatives, and then to be here in the U.S. Senate.\n  For everyone in the United States of America whose views I either \nagree or disagree with, I want to guarantee them the right of continued \nnonviolent protest. So the words of Gandhi, Martin Luther King, and \nthat methodology is there. We are acting like these are the Bull \nConnors of reproductive freedom. In the old days those who were against \ncivil rights bombed churches, killed children; Bull Connor turns the \nfire hoses on them. This is the same thing.\n  So, now, we have to stop that. We have to stop it with the law. Why \ndo women go to these clinics? Who goes? They are ordinary women, many \nof whom who have no health insurance. They have bad backs, they have \nvaricose veins, and they want to see a doctor. And their GYN is their \nprimary care physician. That is what they want to go there for, general \nprimary care, information about reproductive freedom, and some, because \nof either medical necessity or medical appropriateness, will have an \nabortion. That is why they go.\n  I call upon the religious leaders of this country to speak out \nagainst this. I call upon the Attorney General of the United States to \nenforce the law. Tonight I call upon the U.S. Senate to pass the Boxer \nresolution. Let us make sure that America is the land of the free.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMaine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. President, as someone who is deeply committed to ensuring choice \nand quality of women's health I certainly rise in strong support of the \namendment that has been offered by the Senator from California. I, \nfirst of all, want to also thank and commend the Senate majority leader \nfor ensuring the consideration of this amendment during the \ndeliberations of unfunded mandates. This issue is very timely. It is a \nmatter of life and death, when we consider what has happened in \nabortion clinics all over America. I am pleased we are able to consider \nthis resolution. I am sorry it is under the circumstances under which \nwe are considering it in light of what happened in Brookline, MA, with \nthe recent killings.\n  This amendment is appropriate because it expresses the sense of the \nSenate that the U.S. Attorney General should fully enforce the law. The \nAttorney General must use all the tools at her disposal to protect \npersons seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health services from \nviolent attacks. We have seen in recent months, regrettably and \ntragically, an alarming trend toward violence and terrorism against \nreproductive health clinics. Too often, those extremists who oppose a \nwoman's right to reproductive health have resorted to intimidation and \neven violence in order to prove their point. Peaceful civil \ndisobedience is one thing, but these acts have far crossed the line of \nacceptable behavior.\n  We are a nation that prides ourselves on our diversity, diversities \nof views, ideas, and values. As a nation of laws we simply cannot and \nwe simply will not tolerate cold-blooded murder. Nor can we tolerate \nbombings, vandalism, assault, bombings, arson, destruction of property, \nand the physical prevention of people from entering medical clinics.\n  Yes, we are a nation of diversity, and that diversity depends first \nand foremost on our adherence to the laws \n[[Page S1053]] made by our elected representatives of the people. It is \nthis fact that distinguishes our democracy from other forms of \ngovernment and that has contributed over time to our Nation's peace and \nprosperity.\n  Last year, as we all know in response to many of these tragic \nincidents, the 103d Congress considered, deliberated, and enacted the \nfreedom of access to clinic legislation. As a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, I was an original cosponsor and worked with many of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle in both bodies in this \ninstitution, in order to ensure that it became the law of the land.\n  This new law makes it a Federal offense to block the entrance to a \nmedical clinic offering reproductive services, and to use force or the \nthreat of force to intentionally interfere with or injure anyone \nattempting to obtain or provide reproductive services. The Supreme \nCourt has made clear that these rights of peaceful protest do not \nextend to threats and violence, as made clear in recent decisions. In a \n6 to 3 ruling last June the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Madsen \nversus Women's Health Center that restrictions of protesters were \nconstitutional, including the establishment of a buffer zone between \nthe clinic entrance and elsewhere.\n  In 1993, the court filed a unanimous opinion in the case of Wisconsin \nversus Mitchell, a hate crimes case. The Court held that physical \nassault was not among the forms of allowable ``expressive conduct,'' \nand decried violence as a form of civil disobedience. But the terrorist \nacts at medical clinics in the past months have crossed the lines of \npeaceful disobedience, and they mark the beginning of an alarming \ntrend.\n  According to the National Abortion Federation, 61 percent of \nnonhospital abortion providers report being the target of some form of \nharassment including personal harassment of themselves and of their \nfamilies away from the facility. From 1977 to 1983 there were 149 \nincidents of violence against health clinics. Since then, reproductive \nhealth providers have reported almost 1,500 acts of violence. Not \nalways shootings, not only in Norfolk and Brookline, but also \nkidnapping, burglary, arson, telephone threats, stalking, invasion, and \nvandalism.\n  In 1994 there were over 130 incidents nationwide of violence or \nharassment directed at clinics and the people who work there. In the \nhorrifying shootings of Brookline, MA, which resulted in the tragic \ndeaths of two women are clear indication that the violence is \ncontinuing. As many others have indicated here this evening, what kind \nof clinics have been targeted for the terrorist tactics? Clinics which \nprovide not just reproductive health services, but clinics which \nprovide essential pediatric care, prenatal care, childhood \nimmunization, diagnosis and treatments of STD's, contraceptive \nservices, mammograms, Pap smears and other forms of counseling for \nwomen. In fact, more than 90 percent of clinics provide these health \nservices in addition to reproductive health services.\n  In my home State of Maine, Mr. President, medical clinics and \nphysicians have been targeted. So far, thankfully, without the life-\nthreatening violence that occurred in Brookline.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 5 minutes allotted have expired.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield 3 additional \nminutes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Three physicians at the Penobscot Bay Women's Health \nCenter in Rockport, ME, decided to cease offering full services because \nof concern for the safety of patients and the staff after 3 years of \nprotests.\n  After a week of picketing and threats, Dr. Gregory Luck chose to \nclose the medical clinic in Falmouth, ME, offering a full range of \nwomen's health services that has been opened for more than 10 years, \nrather than risk violence against his patients and staff. Dr. Luck, in \nclosing his practice, said he could not guarantee the safety of his \npatients. Women, he said ``have been subjected to harassment \nirrespective of whether they planned to visit my office or any other \noffice and irrespective of what medical service they required,'' he \nsaid in announcing the decision.\n  As we have seen in U.S. News & World Report this week, it says \n``physicians under fire,'' having to wear bullet-proof vests, and \ncarrying guns and weapons to protect themselves, to provide for the \nsafety of their employees. It is regrettable in this country we have \nreached this point in time.\n  Mr. President, safe, affordable and accessible reproductive health \nservices are crucial to the well-being of women. We must send a message \nto would-be terrorists that violence and threats of violence and \nvandalism at these centers will not be tolerated and will be punished \nunder the fullest extent of the law.\n  Congress needs to act on behalf of the families and friends of those \nwho have tragically died because of their belief in a woman's right to \ndecent medical services. Congress needs to act on behalf of low-income \nwomen who depend on such clinics for their personal health needs, the \nrural woman who already faces burdens and barriers to access, but most \nimportantly, for all women and their families who depend on safe access \nto the health care that they need and that they deserve.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this very important amendment. \nAgain, I want to thank the Senator from California and the Senator from \nIdaho for yielding me this time.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will you inform me as to how much time I \nhave remaining on my the side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 17 remaining minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator from Illinois is interested, I can yield \nher 5 minutes at this time. I yield the Senator from Illinois up to 5 \nminutes at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I want to commend and congratulate \nSenator Boxer for this initiative, and I hope this body, in a \nresounding unanimous vote, makes it clear that we condemn in the \nstrongest terms the violence that has occurred, the extremism that has \noccurred, and the taking of innocent life as a form of protest by any \ngroup in this country.\n  The Congress, I believe, must send a clear, unequivocal signal that \nthis country will not tolerate the use of terror, violence, and murder \nto express disagreement with the current laws relating to abortion.\n  Whether one supports abortion or not--and I have made it clear and, \nin fact, my colleagues and I sometimes have a minor disagreement on \nthis point, that I do not personally support abortion. I do, however, \nin the strongest terms support the right of a woman to choose to have \nan abortion. I do not believe that it is the Government's role to \nintervene itself and interpose itself in so personal and private a \nmoral decision as to whether or not to carry a child to term. I believe \nthat that is an issue that women, of whatever stripe, have to maintain \nas a matter of fundamental constitutional liberty, and the Supreme \nCourt of the United States, in Roe versus Wade in 1973, agreed with \nthat point of view.\n  Within the parameters, it recognized a woman's right under the \nConstitution to control her body, a woman's right to choose to have an \nabortion. For those of us who are not pro-abortion but rather are pro-\nchoice, it becomes a distinction that is a very important one. It means \nthat Government must, on the one hand, keep its hands off women's \nbodies; Government must, on the one hand, continue to preserve the \nliberties and freedoms that women have to decide whether or not to be \nparents. But at the same time, Government has an obligation and a \nresponsibility to protect people in the exercise of their legitimate \nrights under the Constitution of this country.\n  That is what is at issue here: That we have legitimate rights that \nhave been established under the law in this country, and the question \nis whether or not in these United States the rule of law will \npredominate or whether or not we will allow ourselves to be dictated to \nand controlled by extremists and, indeed, extremists who become \nmurderers.\n  The murders that occurred most recently are horrendous, horrendous \n[[Page S1054]] acts. I believe every person of conscience should, in \nthe strongest terms, condemn that violence and condemn murder, \ncertainly as a way of expression. That is not an expression of one's \nfree speech. That is not anything but plain--it is what it is, which is \nmurder. We must always be clear that if we are concerned about life, if \nwe celebrate and want to protect life, then we have to stand four \nsquare with those who are exercising their right to live and exercising \ntheir rights under this Constitution.\n  And so since this country has the rule of law and not the rule of \nindividuals who will enforce their point of view from the barrel of a \ngun, since that is the rule of law in this country, I believe that in \nthis Senate it is appropriate to stand up for that right and for this \nSenate to express in the clearest terms that we condemn extremism, we \ncertainly condemn murder, and we condemn any effort to interfere with \nsomeone's exercise of rights they enjoy under the Constitution of this \ncountry.\n  Local police must make the enforcement of the Freedom of Access to \nClinic Entrances Act, which we passed last year in a bipartisan vote, \nan absolute priority of theirs. Our Justice Department, I believe, has \nevery obligation to look into the network of individuals who are \nextremists in this area and who could deprive Americans, and \nparticularly women, of their rights not only to choose abortion, but to \nchoose appropriate health care, to choose to get counseling, to choose \nto go to places where they can receive physical care for their \ncondition.\n  These clinics provide a lot of different services, as has been \npointed out by previous speakers. It is not simply a place where one \nmight go for abortion services. Indeed, if anything, one of the real \nconcerns is that these clinics may be less capable of providing \ncounseling against the transmission of AIDS, against the transmission \nof disease; that they will not be able to play the public health role \nthat they are uniquely situated to play because of the intimidation, \nbecause of the violence, and because of the extremism.\n  When that extremism reaches the fever-pitch point that it has now, I \nthink it is altogether appropriate for those of us in this body to \nstand up for the rule of law, to stand up for the right of women to \nchoose and to make their own decisions about their private health care, \nand to make it very clear that we condemn in the strongest terms the \nviolence that has occurred.\n  That is the purpose of the sense-of-the-Senate resolution that has \nbeen filed by Senator Boxer and of which I am a cosponsor, and that is \ncertainly the initiative behind this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I \ncall on all of my colleagues, whether you are pro-choice or pro-life, \nto support the Boxer amendment. Thank you.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment. The \nSenate must go on record unequivocally to condemn the use of violence \nagainst abortion providers, and to call on law enforcement authorities \nto do everything in their power to prevent such violence and protect \ncitizens from it.\n  The most recent deadly assaults occurred at two clinics in Brookline, \nMA, on December 30. Two women who worked as receptionists at the \nBrookline clinics had their lives brutally cut short. Five other people \nwere seriously wounded. My heart goes out to these victims and their \nfamilies.\n  This kind of vicious, hateful assault against women and health care \nproviders cannot be tolerated in any community in America. No effort \ncan be spared to make sure that these despicable crimes are not \nrepeated anywhere else.\n  Women must be able to seek reproductive health care without fear of \nviolent assault. Doctors should be able to practice their profession \nwithout wearing bullet-proof vests. Clinic staff should be able to go \nto work each day in safety.\n  Abortion is a constitutionally protected right, and it must be safe \nand accessible. Last year, Congress passed the Freedom of Access to \nClinic Entrances Act with broad, bipartisan support, and President \nClinton signed it into law.\n  That law gives the Attorney General the tools she needs to prevent \nviolence and obstruction and to punish such acts whenever and wherever \nthey occur with the full force of Federal law.\n  The Justice Department has already brought several enforcement \nactions under this law, and it is actively investigating other possible \nviolations. In addition, the Attorney General has directed U.S. \nattorneys around the country to coordinate a joint effort by Federal, \nState, and local law enforcement authorities to ensure that clinics and \nproviders in every community are adequately protected.\n  Some have suggested that the new Federal law is somehow responsible \nfor fomenting violence at abortion clinics, because it allegedly closes \noff peaceful picketing as an outlet for those with strongly held views \nagainst abortion. Any such suggestion is nonsense.\n  The clinic access law does not prohibit or punish peaceful picketing \nor any other expression protected by the first amendment. On the \ncontrary, it specifically permits it. What the act prohibits is \nviolent, threatening, obstructive, or destructive conduct--none of \nwhich has ever been protected by the Constitution. For that reason, all \nof the Federal courts that have reviewed the law since President \nClinton signed it last year have upheld it. Tough laws against clinic \nblockades and clinic violence are not the problem. They are the \nsolution.\n  I commend President Clinton and Attorney General Reno for their \nvigorous enforcement of the new Federal law, and for their commitment \nto work with State and local law enforcement authorities to protect \nclinics throughout the country. We must do everything in our power to \nguarantee public safety and prevent the use of violence against \npatients and providers.\n  It is a privilege to join Senator Boxer in urging adoption of this \namendment. I hope that every Member of the Senate will vote in favor of \nthis important measure.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am honored to join my colleague from \nCalifornia in proposing this important piece of legislation expressing \nthe outrage of this body over abortion clinic violence.\n  No matter what our views on abortion might be, I am sure that every \ndecent American mourns the senseless murders that have been committed \nat abortion clinics.\n  On the first day of this session, I rose to discuss the broad \nimplications of abortion clinic violence. I would like to reiterate \nsome of the points that I made at that time.\n  I am deeply saddened that my State has joined others that have seen \nthe horror and felt the pain of this senseless violence.\n  The Friday morning before New Years Eve, at 10 a.m., Shannon Lowney, \na 25 year old activist working as a receptionist at a clinic in \nBrookline, MA, looked up and smiled at a man who had just walked into \nher office. It was John Salvi.\n  He pulled a collapsible Ruger rifle from his bag--aimed it at \nShannon--and fired at point blank range. He killed Shannon and wounded \nthree others.\n  And now, in mourning her death, we ask ourselves: Who was Shannon \nLowney and what did her life show us?\n  Her friends called her ``Shanny'' and she was a caring, committed \nyoung woman who represents the best of her generation. She cared about \npeople. She tutored Spanish-speaking children in Cambridge, helped poor \nvillagers in Ecuador, worked with abused children in Maine, and last \nweek she finished her application to Boston University for a masters in \nsocial work.\n  She was one of those rare people who confronted injustice and acted \non her deep and abiding belief that we are all in this together--we are \ncommunity and each of us must accept our personal responsibility within \nthat community.\n  The irony and the tragedy is that--to John Salvi--Shannon's life \nmeant nothing--the good and decent life of someone who truly cared \nabout others was taken in the name of ``life''.\n  Mr. President, no matter what our views on abortion might be, I am \nsure that every decent American mourns the senseless murder of Shannon \nLowney and is touched by the loss of someone so young and so committed \nto working with others.\n  Contrast Shannon's life and her motives with the life and motives of \na \n[[Page S1055]] man like John Salvi--A man who killed one person and \nwounded five others and then left Planned Parenthood and walked a few \nblocks to the Preterm Health Services Clinic. He asked Lee Ann Nicols, \na 38-year-old receptionist engaged to be married this year, whether \nthis was the preterm clinic.\n  She said yes and he shot her from less than one yard away--killing \nher on the spot.\n  He then said, ``in the name of the mother of God'', aimed at Richard \nSeron, a lawyer working as a security guard, and shot him once in each \narm. He shot one other person, 29-year-old June Sauer once in the \npelvis and once in the back, and then he left.\n  Five people injured--two people killed.\n  And now we must ask: Who is John Salvi and what does his life show \nus?\n  On Christmas Eve Salvi delivered a sermon about the Catholic Church \nand its failure to see the true meaning of Christ. But what was his \nmotivation for cold-blooded murder?\n  Paul Hill, the Minister currently on Florida's Death Row, gives us \nsome insight into John Salvi's motivations. Hill gave us a chilling \nreason for killing a doctor and his assistant in Pensacola. He said \nthat ``the bible teaches us to do unto others as you would have them do \nunto you.\n  ``Therefore, killing a man who is about to kill an unborn child \nconstitutes killing in self-defense.''\n  To Paul Hill the murder was a justifiable homicide.\n  Mr. President, this syllogism lies at the heart of one of the most \ncorrosive dangers the world faces today.\n  There are religious teachings that offer justifiable reasons for \nkilling, but mainstream religions have always promoted tolerance over \nintolerance, and the only people who use religion to justify cold-\nblooded murder are religious fanatics.\n  But what happened in Brookline--what happened to Shannon Lowney and \nLee Ann Nicols--and the tragedy of their deaths--tells us that we can \nno longer dismiss these fringe elements of our society. We can no \nlonger let the good people fall victim to intolerance and fanaticism.\n  Yes, John Salvi read from the same Bible that Shannon and Lee Ann \ndid. The teachings and the words were the same, but their lives could \nnot have been more different. It is our task to remember that \ncommitment and dedication can be manifest in kindness and concern or \nthey can take the hideous form of fanaticism and hatred that motivated \nJohn Salvi to play God.\n  Mr. President. It is incumbent on all of us as a society to \nunderstand the danger that can be wrought by those who would interpret \nreligious teachings as a crusade against others and a justification for \ncold-blooded murder.\n  It is our task to understand that we live in dangerous times, and \nthat the easy availability of weapons in this society to people like \nJohn Salvi and Paul Hill has increased that danger, and increased the \nthreat to those who chose to show their commitment and their faith by \nhelping others build a better life for themselves and for their \nfamilies.\n  I believe it is time for both sides in the abortion issue to find a \nway to express their views without increasing the level of the rhetoric \nor the level of violence.\n  It is our task to sit down and talk to each other, and I commend my \nfriend and constituent, Cardinal Bernard Law, of the Archdiocese of \nBoston, for his efforts to bring both sides together. He has shown \nhimself to be an individual of courage in this regard. Even though he \nis strongly pro-life, he has called for an end to anti-abortion \nprotests in Boston.\n  And he is trying to bring everyone together in an unprecedented \nseries of negotiations. Cardinal Law is a leader whose tolerance, and \ndeep faith serves as an example to all of us.\n  What we achieve together can send a loud and clear message--to those \nwho would use their beliefs as justification for murder--that, though \nwe may not agree, we are still one people bound together not only by \nour faith and our commitments to our beliefs, but by the expression of \nour common interests through tolerance for our differences and a mutual \nrespect and understanding for each other.\n  But, make no mistake. The wrong response to these shootings would be \nto turn clinics into armed fortresses on the fringes of our medical \ndelivery system, further from those who choose to have the procedure.\n  Yes, we must protect workers, medical personnel, and patients, but we \ncannot allow an accepted medical procedure to be limited by the blind \nintolerance of a fanatical fringe.\n  So, Mr. President, if this constitutionally protected right is to be \npreserved, and if we are to truly pay tribute to women like Shannon \nLowney, then we need to protect the safety of those who seek the \nservices of these clinics.\n  When those shots rang out in Brookline, John Salvi took something \nvery precious from us. He took our freedom to believe and to express \nour beliefs as we choose. He took our freedom to act on our beliefs \nwithout fear of violence. We can never let that happen.\n  Mr. President, perhaps the most eloquent tribute to Shannon Lowney \ncame from the president of the Planned Parenthood League of \nMassachusetts. Nicki Nichols Gamble said, ``Shannon gave her life so \nthat others would be able to have better lives. She was an essential \nlink in the chain of women helping women. We will miss her desperately, \nand we will remember her, and we will see to it that her death will not \nbe in vain.''\n  Today and for many days to come we will mourn the deaths of Shannon \nLowney and Lee Ann Nicols. The people of my state are shocked and \noutraged at this senseless act of violence that took them from us, and \nI know that I speak for every member of the Senate in extending our \ndeepest condolences to their families and friends and to all the \nvictims of this tragedy.\n  The lesson, Mr. President, is ``tolerance'' and it is a lesson we \nwould do well to learn; and--if we do not learn it--we will have \ndishonored the memory of two young women from Massachusetts who lost \ntheir lives to intolerance in the name of God.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleague if there are any other \nspeakers that he knows of at this time on his side, and if there are \nnot, I will take about 5 minutes at this time.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, yes, I do believe that we have at \nleast one more Senator who will be coming to speak on the issue.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will yield myself 5 minutes, and then I \nwill yield back to my colleague so we can continue the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Illinois \nfor being here; for, yes, being one of the early cosponsors of this \namendment. I, frankly, do not know of any Senator who is pro-abortion. \nI do know many Senators who are pro-choice on both sides of this aisle. \nThat is why it is so important for reasonable people to come together \naround this issue, by the way, people who are pro-choice and people who \nare not, as the Senator from Illinois pointed out. There are times when \nwe can all come together. This is one of those times.\n  When I was asked about what life in the new Senate would mean for me, \nI responded to one reporter in this way. I said:\n  ``I think there will be many issues where reasonable Senators will \ncome together from both sides of the aisle, and it will not be a \npartisan issue in every case.''\n  And that reporter said: ``Give me an example.''\n  I said: ``Clinic violence, the gag rule, a woman's right to choose.''\n  This is something that cuts across our party. This is about the \ndignity of women and, therefore, the dignity of all of us, because all \nof us have mothers. Many of us have sisters, wives, and daughters, and \ntheir dignity is our dignity.\n  I am so pleased that after much discussion and debate, we were able \nto reach agreement on a very sensible resolution, I think one that each \nand every Member of this Senate can be proud to vote for.\n  I want to use a little time to go back to what is really happening in \nsome of the streets of our Nation. And I want to refer to a document \ncalled ``No Place to Hide,'' which is a campaign being launched by a \ngroup that calls \n[[Page S1056]] themselves ``pro-life.''\n And I would leave it up to others to decide if that is an appropriate \nterm.\n\n  They put out this leaflet, and I am going to read to you from part of \nit. It says in part, this is the ``No Place to Hide'' campaign.\n  And it is supposed to go after workers in reproductive health care \nclinics. It says:\n\n       Try to reason with the doctors, speaking from your heart \n     about the unborn child and the pain and anguish their mothers \n     go through. If they agree--\n\n  The doctors.\n\n       If they agree to stop killing children, ask them to put it \n     in writing.\n\n  Mr. President, when you use terms like this: Ask the doctors to stop \nkilling children, what is the message? Then they say:\n\n       Creative fliers similar to the enclosed wanted poster to \n     hand out to people entering the building where the doctors \n     have their practices.\n\n  Here is one of these wanted posters, showing the faces of these \ndoctors, and on the top it says, ``Wanted For Killing Unborn Babies.''\n  Now, it seems to me it is time for all Americans to come together and \nlisten to the words we are using.\n  I ask unanimous consent to place in the Record an article from the \nOakland Tribune dated January 6 at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  This is what they say in this article:\n\n       When you tell someone unstable, like Paul Hill--\n\n  Who killed two people in a clinic in Florida--\n\n       When you tell someone unstable, like Paul Hill, that \n     doctors at Planned Parenthood are murderers who destroy \n     innocent babies, you just can't wash your hands of it when \n     that unstable person kills someone. When your supporters \n     distribute posters saying, ``wanted dead or alive,'' with \n     doctors' names on them, you can't say it has nothing to do \n     with you when someone ends up dead. When you liken abortion \n     to the Holocaust, you are inviting your followers to take the \n     law into their own hands.\n\n  And then they quote one of the gentlemen involved in these \norganizations, and he said,\n\n       Anyone in the war zone has got to expect to be part of the \n     war that's going on.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for 2 additional minutes.\n\n       Anyone in the war zone has got to expect to be part of the \n     war that's going on.\n\n  Said this gentleman about the dead woman in Brookline.\n  So I say to you, Mr. President and my colleagues, I thank so much the \nSenator from Oklahoma working on the words of this resolution so we \nprotect everybody's rights--yes, the rights of the peaceful protesters \nto express themselves fully and completely as we point out in the FACE \nbill they have a right to do, and, yes, the rights of people seeking \nreproductive health care to have their lives protected. I say that we \ncannot ignore the words that are being used, and that, yes, in this \namendment we are calling on the Attorney General to fully enforce this \nlaw, to do everything she has to do.\n  In essence, I hope that by our speaking out tonight in a bipartisan \nfashion, the word will go out to the people in these organizations to \nthink very carefully, Mr. President, of the words they use and the \nthings that they print up showing doctors as killers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's additional 2 minutes have \nexpired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And to change their tactics.\n  I would at this time save the remainder of my time, which, if I am \ncorrect, is approximately 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would reserve that 5 minutes.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                       [From the Oakland Tribune]\n\n               Anti-Abortion Leaders Must Rein in Troops\n\n       The president can send a regiment of soldiers to guard \n     abortion clinics, and the women and men who work there can \n     arm themselves to the eyeballs. But violence at clinics is \n     not going to stop until leaders of the anti-abortion movement \n     exert strong moral leadership over their flock.\n       It sounds odd, doesn't it--telling anti-abortionists to \n     show morality. After all, isn't that what the anti-abortion \n     movement is all about? Its adherents hold the bedrock belief \n     that a fetus is an independent human being. When they stop an \n     abortion they believe they are saving life.\n       But you can't be ``pro-life'' and condone murder. Two \n     murders took place in Brookline, Mass, last week--the victims \n     were receptionists at places where abortions take place. An \n     anti-abortion activist from New Hampshire, John Salvi, has \n     been accused of the crimes.\n       Another anti-abortion crusader, Paul Hill, was convicted \n     last year of similar murders in Florida. There has been \n     violence at other clinics across the country.\n       Too many leaders of the anti-abortion movement have washed \n     their hands of these murders emanating from their midst. They \n     say, ``Tsk tsk. Isn't that a shame? But those people are \n     extremists. They have nothing to do with the mainstream anti-\n     abortion movement.''\n\n\n                              Frankenstein\n\n       We have news for anti-abortion leaders: Paul Hill, John \n     Salvi and the others like them in your movement have \n     everything to do with you. You create and nourish them with \n     your language and tactics.\n       When you tell someone unstable, like Paul Hill, that \n     doctors at Planned Parenthood are murderers who destroy \n     innocent babies, you can't just wash your hands of it when \n     that unstable person kills someone. When you supporters \n     distribute posters saying, ``wanted, dead or alive,'' with \n     doctors' names on them, you can't say it has nothing to do \n     with you when someone ends up dead. When you liken abortion \n     to the Holocaust, you are inviting your followers to take the \n     law into their own hands.\n       When the movement accepts people like Salvi, Hill or the \n     Rev. David Trosch in its midst then it has to accept \n     responsibility for their actions and their speech. Trosch is \n     the Roman Catholic priest suspended for declaring it \n     ``justifiable homicide'' to kill a doctor who commits \n     abortions.\n       A man like Trosch incites men like Hill to kill. ``Anyone \n     in the war zone has to expect to be part of the war that's \n     going on,'' Trosch said of the dead women in Brookline.\n       Not everyone in the anti-abortion movement is like Trosch, \n     of course. The bulk of people are sincere and well-meaning. \n     The Rev. Flip Benham of Operation Rescue National condemned \n     the attacks in Brookline. ``An eye for an eye, it doesn't \n     work that way,'' Benham said. But to an apparently increasing \n     number of anti-abortionists it does work that way. These \n     movement members see things as Trosch sees them. They see \n     those dead receptionists as grounds troops in a larger war \n     who have no meaning of their own.\n       Cardinal Bernard Law of the Boston Archdiocese wants the \n     killing to stop. After the Brookline shootings, he called for \n     an end to the violence and the demonstrations. He told those \n     who protest to search their souls.\n\n\n                            true leadership\n\n       That is moral leadership. Anti-abortion leaders should \n     search their souls indeed. Are they inciting people to Kill? \n     Is their language too provocative? Are their actions going to \n     lead to violence? Is there a better way to get where they \n     want to go without confrontation? Can they identify people on \n     the fringe before they harm others? Can they isolate those \n     people and get them counseling?\n       This is a time for leaders and everyone else in the anti-\n     abortion movement to take careful stock of what they stand \n     for. They got into this crusade to save lives. Their cohorts \n     are now taking lives. This is not the way it was supposed to \n     be.\n       Paul Hill said that one day soon his behavior--murder--\n     would be viewed as normal in the abortion wars, rather than \n     an aberration.\n       The only ones who can keep that ghastly reverie from \n     becoming reality are the men and women who lead the movement \n     that created Paul Hill. They need to take their considerable \n     moral energy and turn it inward, for now. It is time to \n     begin, today.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized for such time as \nnecessary, not to exceed 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, on this resolution, I have been working \nwith the Senator from California, and I appreciate her cooperation as \nwell as the cooperation of the Senator from Washington, Senator Murray, \nin trying to come up with a resolution that we can support. I am \ntalking about people of different views on different sides of the \nabortion question. I think we have come to agreement, and I appreciate \ntheir cooperation.\n  When we originally looked at the resolution as introduced, it left a \nlot to be desired, and my original thought was that we could not \nsupport it. Since then, I think we have made some improvements, and I \nmight just mention those. Originally the resolution stated \n[[Page S1057]] that ``persons exercising their constitutional rights \nand acting completely within the law are entitled to full protection \nfrom the Federal Government.''\n  Now, that might sound good. But we have left that out because it can \nbe misleading. Some people might misinterpret that, so now that is not \nincluded in the resolution. We offered to say that they would be \nentitled to ``equal protection,'' we did not reach an agreement on \nthat. So now that particular segment is not included.\n  Also, the original resolution stated that ``the Freedom of Access to \nClinic Entrances Act of 1994 imposes a mandate on the Federal \nGovernment to protect individuals seeking to obtain or provide \nreproductive health services.''\n  That is now deleted. It was deleted, in my opinion, for a good \nreason--because it is not correct. That is not what the original act \nstated.\n  In addition, we made a couple of other changes, and I think these as \nwell are positive changes. The sense-of-the-Senate resolution, as \nmentioned by the Senator from California, now deletes language that \nsays that ``the Attorney General should fully enforce the law and take \nany further necessary measures to'' protect persons, and so forth. And \nwe have eliminated that part--``and take any further necessary \nmeasures''--in addition to enforcing the law. I think that is an \nimprovement.\n  I appreciate also the Senator from California agreeing to the \nfollowing addition that was recommended by the Senator from Indiana, \nSenator Coats, which added the following. It says:\n\n       Nothing in this resolution shall be construed to prohibit \n     any expressive conduct (including peaceful picketing, or \n     other peaceful demonstration) protected from legal \n     prohibition by the First Amendment to the Constitution.\n\n  In other words, people still have the right of peaceful \ndemonstration, whether it be in front of an abortion clinic or other \nareas.\n  Mr. President, let me just state that I will support this resolution. \nMy original concern was that we were only condemning one type of \nviolence, the type of violence as it concerns abortion clinics. I \nhappen to be against all violence. I am not interested in the reason--\nin people murdering someone down at the convenience store or in front \nof a night club in the streets of Washington, DC or New York City or \nOklahoma or in California or in front of abortion clinics. I condemn \nthose people who committed the atrocities including killing or \nmurdering abortionists or someone murdering a 15-year old on the street \nbecause they want to wear his jacket.\n  I thought the resolution was inappropriate because it only condemned \nviolence against abortion clinics. I want to condemn that violence. I \nhappen to be on the pro-life side of this debate. But I think people \nwho are breaking the law by murdering other individuals are going too \nfar and they are actually hurting the cause that they supposedly are \ntrying to help, so I think we should condemn that violence. But I also \nthink we should condemn violence such as occurred in Alabama in 1993. A \npro-life minister and talk show host Jerry Simon was shot and killed by \na self-described Satan worshiper, Eileen Janezic, stating she did it \n``to please Satan.'' That case received almost no publicity. We have \nseen a lot of publicity concerning the murder where Paul Hill murdered \nan abortionist in Florida, and maybe rightfully so; it needed some \nattention. He was certainly wrong.\n  I might mention, Mr. President, he was convicted. He was convicted \nunder State law for murder and has now been sentenced to death. Some \npeople wanted to federalize all crimes, but I might mention murder is \nagainst the law in every single State in the Nation, as it should be, \nand States have the primary responsibility to enforce those laws, as it \nshould be. His trial has been completed, and he was found guilty. And \nhis sentence is the death penalty under State law. So again I wish to \ncondemn violence, but I also want to make sure that we do not \nfederalize so many cases.\n  It was also originally stated that there was so many thousand FBI \nagents and U.S. marshals and that they should do all they can to \nprotect abortion clinics. I might mention--and I think the resolution \nstates there are something like 900 clinics. They are called--well, \nthey are called clinics in the United States providing reproductive \nhealth services. They are abortion clinics. If you took the number of \nU.S. marshals--I think there is stated to be about 2,000 marshals and I \nguess their deputies--then each clinic could have a little over 2 \nmarshals per clinic. The marshals have something else to do. So I \nobjected to that section, as well.\n  So I appreciate the Senator from California deleting this. I \nappreciate the willingness of the Senator from California to modify the \nresolution. I think it is acceptable. I think it is important for the \nCongress to speak out and condemn violence but I think it is also \nimportant for us to speak out and condemn all violence. When we see \nteenagers killing teenagers; when we see drug epidemics run rampant \nthroughout this country; when we see the number of women who are being \nabused, the number of children who are being abused; when we see so \nmany significant crime problems throughout this country, I think we \nneed to do something, as well. Not just a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution.\n  So I am hopeful that this Congress will move and move expeditiously \non a significant crime enforcement package, one that will strengthen \nthe penalties that some of us tried to enact a year ago, one that will \nhave habeas corpus reform so we can have an end to the endless appeals.\n  So I hope this Congress will move and make some real, significant \nchange in order to limit crime this year, this Congress.\n  I thank my colleague and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey, Senator Lautenberg.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the sense-\nof-the-Senate amendment introduced by Senator Boxer.\n  Since 1984, there have been more than 1,500 acts of violence near \nabortion critics.\n  In the last 22 months, five innocent people have been shot to death \nat abortion clinics. Five men and women heartlessly slain by murderers \nwho call themselves pro-life.\n  In the past year, we have already seen two tragedies at abortion \nclinics. Less than 6 months ago, a doctor and his escort were shot to \ndeath on their way to work in Pensacola, FL.\n  Most recently, a 22-year-old man allegedly went on a violent spree, \nattacking abortion clinics in Massachusetts and Virginia, and killing \ntwo clinic workers in the process.\n  Mr. President, how many more innocent people must die before we as a \nsociety put a stop to this terror?\n  How many doctors will be gunned down for performing a legal medical \nprocedure?\n  How many receptionists will lose their lives simply because they work \nin the line of extremist gunfire?\n  Last year, President Clinton signed the Freedom of Access to Clinic \nEntrances Act, known as FACE. This law made it a Federal crime to \nblock, obstruct or intimidate a woman seeking reproductive health \nservices, or a doctor trying to perform them.\n  But it is now clear that the clinic access law alone will not be \nenough to protect our Nation's doctors and women.\n  Attorney General Reno announced in August that she would post U.S. \nmarshals outside of threatened clinics. That is also a step in the \nright direction, and I urge the Justice Department to review its \nefforts in this area.\n  I applaud the President's announcement earlier this month directing \nall U.S. attorneys around the country to form an immediate task force \nof Federal, State, and local officials to coordinate plans for security \nat all clinics in their jurisdictions.\n  And I applaud the President's efforts to improve communication \nbetween U.S. marshals and reproductive clinics to make sure they are \nprepared to inform the authorities of any potential threats.\n  But I ask the administration to continue pursuing a hard line against \nthe purveyors of violence and to take further protective measures until \neach \n[[Page S1058]] and every reproductive clinic in the United States is \nsafe for doctors, for employees, and for patients.\n  The women of this country deserve to go to the doctor without fearing \nthat they may never come home.\n  They deserve to receive reproductive services without harassment, \nintimidation or even worse, bodily harm.\n  And they have a right to undergo legal medical procedures without \nputting themselves, their families or their doctors in such unfair \njeopardy.\n  Let us send a strong message to all those who would use guns to \nexpress their views, a message that we are going to stand up for the \nwomen, doctors, escorts, and health care workers across the country \nuntil all Americans are safe, and all murderers are behind bars.\n  Mr. President, I will just take a couple of minutes to summarize \nwhat, I sense, is an attitudinal problem. We can talk all we want about \nstanding up against violence. But very often, the people who talk most \nabout violence and getting rid of it are those who support the \nproliferation of guns across our society. It is pretty hard to do away \nwith violence when there is almost a gun everyplace that you look, and \na failure to register those things.\n  When we talk about standing up against violence, there is an \nintimation that those who have the right to choose under our \nConstitution, confirmed by the Supreme Court, are themselves committing \nan act of violence, and that is where the process starts. The process, \nnot just of killing and assault, but intimidation, is one designed to \nthreaten people who decide that they want to make a different decision \nthan those on the other side.\n  In New Jersey, we have a doctor who offers abortion as part of his \nobstetrical practice, offers abortion if people want it. He has been \nshot at. He has been threatened. His family is constantly under threat. \nHe is so frightened by doing what he feels is right professionally, and \nyet he is unable to offer the kinds of services for which he has been \nlicensed by the State and by the profession.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 3 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Can I have 1 more minute, or if my colleague is out \nof time, I will conclude.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will yield 30 seconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Just to say this. If we are going to talk against \nviolence, it has to start when people violate the law, the law very \nclearly stated. I implore the President and the Attorney General to \nstand up and protect those institutions that offer people a choice in \nhow they want to conduct their lives. It is very simple.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank the Senator from \nCalifornia for her courage and for letting me participate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have a minute and a half remaining. I \nwonder if the Senator from Idaho would like to yield some time. I will \nretain that minute and a half just to close off debate at the end, if I \nmight.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is 14 minutes for the Senator from \nOklahoma, and a minute and a half for the Senator from California.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded for a parliamentary question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, to whose time is the time being charged \nfor the quorum?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I see. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and, Mr. \nPresident, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On whose time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. On the time of the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Is there objection? \nWithout objection, the clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 141\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDorgan, Senator Dole, and Senator Nickles be added as cosponsors to the \namendment, the Bradley amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, as I said earlier, this is a very simple \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator?\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I think the unanimous consent agreement \nallotted 1 hour for debate of the underlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was controlled by Senator Nickles of \nOklahoma and Senator Boxer of California.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be able to \nproceed for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, the amendment we are going to be voting \non at 7:30 is an amendment that simply says while we are debating \nFederal unfunded mandates on States, it is the sense of the Senate that \nthere should not be unfunded mandates from the States to the local \ngovernments of this country requiring increases in property taxes.\n  The fact is the property taxes are much too high in most States, and \nthere is a significant reason for that involving unfunded mandates from \nthe State government to the local government.\n  This simply allows the Senate to go on record saying that we do not \nwant high property taxes from unfunded mandates. There are many \nGovernors in the country who do not want any mandates from the Federal \nGovernment but they are not reluctant to apply unfunded mandates to the \nlocal governments. They are very clear on that.\n  I am very pleased to have Senator Chafee as a key cosponsor.\n  I yield the floor. If Senator Chafee wants to speak, I hope he will \ncome over for the remaining 30 seconds of my 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Robb be added as \na cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I must rise in opposition to the \namendment offered by the Senator from New Jersey. It is true that I \nstrongly support the idea that mandate costs should not be forced upon \nsubordinate units of government, and that the constitution of my home \nState of Michigan prohibits the imposition of unfunded mandates upon \nlocal units of government. My inability to support the amendment \naccordingly does not arise from any disagreement with the principle it \nexpresses. Rather, my opposition is grounded in larger principles of \nfederalism. A core principle of that doctrine is that certain matters \nsimply are beyond the ken of the Federal Government. To my mind, the \nproper allocation of mandate costs between State and local governments \nis one such matter. Thus, while I agree with the general principle \nexpressed in the Senator's amendment, I think we overstep our proper \nbounds when we tell State and local governments how to structure their \nrelationship.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, let me comment very briefly on the Sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution offered by Senator Bradley and me.\n  The resolution is, of course, not binding to the States. The last \nthing we want to do is attach a mandate to an unfunded mandates reform \nbill. Instead, we say plainly here that the States should given full \nconsideration to mandates they might pass onto their cities and towns. \nThat is all.\n  I mentioned last week on the floor how ironic it is that Governors \nhave asked us to provide relief in this area--while they themselves \nfrequently impose unfunded mandates on their counties, cities, and \ntowns. As we know, \n[[Page S1059]] cities and towns have no one to pass costs down to.\n  S. 1 introduces a clear mechanism for accountability at the Federal \nlevel. It would be inappropriate and unconstitutional for the Congress \nto install these same restrictions at the State level--yet--the theme \nunderlying S. 1 of increased accountability for mandates seems \napplicable.\n  Although my plan is to support S. 1, I have concerns about the lack \nof information in certain areas. for instance, do we know how many of \nthe mandates imposed upon cities and towns actually originate from the \nFederal Government? To my knowledge, there is no data base or tracking \nsystem to make this important distinction. However, we have clear \nevidence that State-issued unfunded mandates exist.\n  Mr. President, many States have exercised their authority to adopt \nlaws which are more stringent than what the Federal Government \nrequires.\n  For example, my own State of Rhode Island requires every city and \ntown to have an adult monitor on every school bus that carries children \nin the fourth grade and below. Did the Federal Government issue this \nmandate? No. Does the State provide the funds for this? No. The cities \nand towns must find the money in their own budgets.\n  I will conclude by noting that the Governmental Affairs Committee \nreport accompanying S. 1 states on page 3 that, ``* * * local officials \ndecry unfunded State mandates as much as they do unfunded Federal \nones.'' Since we cannot take direct action to remedy this, Mr. \nPresident, I would hope that the Senate could at least send the message \nthat we must be held accountable at all levels.\n  I am told that language similar to this was to be included in a \nmanagers amendment last year on S. 993. It is my view that the need for \nthis resolution still exists and so I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nremaining committee amendments be laid aside in order to consider a \nLevin-Kempthorne amendment regarding feasibility and that no other \namendment be in order prior to the disposition of the Levin-Kempthorne \namendment and no call for the regular order serve in place of the Levin \nKempthorne amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 143\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the infeasibility of the Congressional Budget \n Office making a cost estimate for Federal intergovernmental mandates, \n                        and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk in behalf \nof myself, Mr. Kempthorne, and Mr. Glenn, and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself, Mr. \n     Kempthorne, and Mr. Glenn, proposes an amendment numbered \n     143.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 19, insert between lines 10 and 11 the following \n     new clause:\n       ``(iii) If the Director determines that it is not required \n     under clauses (i) and (ii), the Director shall not make the \n     estimate, but shall report in the statement that the \n     reasonable estimate cannot be made and shall include the \n     reasons for that determination in the statement. If such \n     determination is made by the Director, a point of order shall \n     lie only under (c)(1)(A) and as if the requirement of \n     (c)(1)(A) had not been met.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, may I make a parliamentary inquiry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wonder, since I have 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining before \nthe vote at 7:30, I would like to protect that right to be able to give \nthat 1\\1/2\\ minutes closing of my argument if I might.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment responds to a lengthy \ndiscussion that we had yesterday about whether the bill should allow \nthe Congressional Budget Office to state when it honestly cannot \nestimate the direct cost of an intergovernmental mandate. The bill \ncontains a provision that allows the CBO to be honest with respect to \nits ability or inability to estimate private sector mandates. However, \nthere is no comparable language with respect to CBO's estimates for \nState and local governments. That was not inadvertent, as the committee \nreports indicate. But it was wrong. We made an effort in committee to \ncorrect it. We had no success.\n  The amendment we have before us adds such language, and it clarifies \nin those situations where the CBO cannot make an estimate that it may \nsay so, and that that will be true for intergovernmental estimates, not \njust for private sector estimates.\n  This amendment is important for a number of reasons. I commend the \nmanagers as well as my cosponsors for agreeing to it and thank them for \ntheir efforts in working this out.\n  This amendment would first provide for truth in legislating by \nallowing the CBO to tell us if they cannot estimate the cost of an \nintergovernmental mandate. This amendment retains a point of order in \nthe situation where the estimate cannot be made. The inability to \nestimate direct costs would continue to be a failure to provide a \nstatement on the estimated cost for purposes of subsection (c)(1)(A).\n  That was the situation that existed in last year's bill. The point of \norder which would remain where an estimate is impossible to be made is \na point of order which was allowed in last year's bill. The point of \norder, however, lies only with respect to the absence of a cost \nestimate. The point of order with respect to an authorization of \nappropriations would not lie because, practically speaking, it cannot \nlie. Without a CBO estimate, the mechanism in the point of order that \naddresses the authorization of appropriation and the subsequent \nappropriation process does not make sense.\n  This amendment, therefore, makes it clear that that portion of the \npoint of order in the bill in section (c)(1)(B) does not apply where \nCBO cannot make an estimate.\n  Section (c)(1)(B) includes that new point of order which was added in \nthis year's bill which was not in last year's bill. That point of order \nwould not lie in the event of an inability of the CBO to make the \nestimate.\n  I want to again thank Senator Glenn, Senator Kempthorne, Senator \nExon, and Senator Domenici for their help in making it possible for us \nto have this amendment offered and to hopefully succeed either tonight \nor tomorrow morning to have it adopted.\n  I thank the Chair. Again, I thank the managers of the bill.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, yesterday we did a colloquy on the CBO's inability to \nmake a reliable estimate of mandate costs. Senator Levin was concerned \nprimarily that the CBO be given the freedom to not make an estimate. I \nwas concerned that the Congress not provide a loophole which would \nfrustrate the very intent of this bill, which is accountability and \ninformed decisionmaking.\n  The purpose of the Levin-Kempthorne-Glenn amendment will be to \naccommodate both interests. If the CBO director cannot make an \nestimate, he or she shall so state it. But the failure of the CBO \nDirector to make an estimate will still trigger the point of order.\n  This will provide the Senate with the opportunity to debate issues \nconcerning the estimate and the funding decisions. It will be the will \nof the Senate at that point to either waive a point or not.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this addresses what we were discussing \nyesterday in a thorough discussion and it accomplishes what both of us \nneeded to have accomplished. So I appreciate the floor manager and \nSenator Levin.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if I could quickly ask the Senator from \nIdaho to yield for a question, I hope he would agree that the amendment \nexpressly states that the section (c)(1)(B) point of order would not \nlie in such an instance, only the (c)(1)(A) point of order.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. In response to that, Mr. President, there is only one \npoint of order, and it has two parts.\n   [[Page S1060]] Mr. LEVIN. The first part would lie and the second \npart would not lie. Is that correct?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. As a result of the Director making that statement; \nthat is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nCalifornia is recognized for 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that the vote \noccur at 7:32 so that the Senator retains 1\\1/2\\ minutes and so that \nthe manager on the Democratic side would have an opportunity for a 1-\nminute statement, or whatever he needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  I agree completely with Senator Levin. I think he has taken care of a \nproblem that we discussed at great length on the floor yesterday. We \nwent on and on about this. I will not try to repeat all of those same \narguments we made yesterday. I think it is ridiculous to require a \nreport where they can say they cannot make a report. Senator Levin has \nvery properly moved this amendment to take care of that problem. I \nsupport it fully. I urge my colleagues to vote for it.\n  It is my understanding that Senator Levin will want a rollcall vote \non this but that it will be put off until morning, and as part of the \nwrap-up by unanimous consent this evening.\n  I yield the floor so that our distinguished colleague from California \ncan get her time.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, based on that, I ask unanimous consent that there be a \nrollcall vote on this amendment, that it occur tomorrow prior to \ncloture vote, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the rollcall vote will be \nordered tomorrow.\n  The Senator from California is recognized for 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. After 2 weeks of \ntrying to do this, it comes down to a minute and a half. I want to use \nthat time to thank my colleague from Oklahoma for working so hard to \nget an agreement. I thank the majority leader. He was very direct with \nme from day one. I knew exactly where I stood. Sometimes it was not in \nsuch a great situation, but it turned out that we were able to air this \nissue.\n  I want to say that I agree with the Senator from Oklahoma that all \nviolence must be condemned. I have been on this floor condemning gun \nviolence, violence in the workplace, and domestic violence. I was one \nof the authors of the Violence Against Women Act and worked with my \ncolleague, Joe Biden, to make sure it became the law of the land.\n  Today I am here to talk about the violence to clinics. On December \n30, two young, innocent women that worked as receptionists in women's \nhealth care clinics were shot to death. The same killer shot up a \nclinic in Virginia. The President expressed outrage. The Attorney \nGeneral has instructed the U.S. attorney and the U.S. marshals to work \nwith clinics, and we say to the law enforcement officials it is the \nSenate's turn to act.\n  The resolution we propose is straightforward. The resolution, as it \nwas amended by the Senator from Oklahoma, expresses the sense of the \nSenate that the Attorney General shall fully enforce the law and \nprotect persons seeking to provide or obtain, or assist in providing or \nobtaining reproductive health services, from violent attack.\n  We did compromise on this legislation. I urge my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to send a very clear statement from this Senate that \nwe abhor the violence. It will stop; it must stop. We are a country of \nlaws.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank the Senator from California and the Senator from \nOklahoma for coming together on a very important resolution. There is a \nvast difference between nonviolence and violence, and that is the \npurpose of this resolution. In my view, it seems to me something that \nwe should all vote for. When someone violates the law, they violate the \nlaw. That is precisely what is being addressed.\n  The Attorney General should enforce the law. We should not expect any \nless. I have even gone so far as to say in public comments that I \nunderstand peaceful demonstration and I understand nonviolence. I \nsupport each. But some of these actions almost come out to terrorism.\n  I hope we will have a broad bipartisan vote for this special issue.\n  Mr. President, there will be no more votes after the second vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Bradley \namendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from New York [Mr. D'Amato] and \nthe Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without losing his right to the floor, fine.\n  What we were doing, we had an amendment that would be voice voted.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted by the \n     pending amendment insert the following new title:\n         TITLE ____--COLLECTION OF STATE AND LOCAL SALES TAXES\n\n     SEC. ____01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Consumer and Main Street \n     Business Protection Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. ____02. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) merchandise purchased from out-of-State firms is \n     subject to State and local sales taxes in the same manner as \n     merchandise purchased from in-State firms,\n       (2) State and local governments generally are unable to \n     compel out-of-State firms to collect and remit such taxes, \n     and consequently, many out-of-State firms choose not to \n     collect State and local taxes on merchandise delivered across \n     State lines,\n       (3) moreover, many out-of-State firms fail to inform their \n     customers that such taxes exist, with some firms even falsely \n     claiming that merchandise purchased out-of-State is tax-free, \n     and consequently, many consumers unknowingly incur tax \n     liabilities, including interest and penalty charges,\n       (4) Congress has a duty to protect consumers from explicit \n     or implicit misrepresentations of State and local sales tax \n     obligations,\n       (5) small businesses, which are compelled to collect State \n     and local sales taxes, are subject to unfair competition when \n     out-of-State firms cannot be compelled to collect and remit \n     such taxes on their sales to residents of the State,\n       (6) State and local governments provide a number of \n     resources to out-of-State firms including government services \n     relating to disposal of tons of catalogs, mail delivery, \n     communications, and bank and court systems,\n       (7) the inability of State and local governments to require \n     out-of-State firms to collect and remit sales taxes deprives \n     State and local governments of needed revenue and forces such \n     State and local governments to raise taxes on taxpayers, \n     including consumers and small businesses, in such State,\n       (8) the Supreme Court ruled in Quill Corporation v. North \n     Dakota, 112 S. Ct. 1904 (1992) that the due process clause of \n     the Constitution does not prohibit a State government from \n     imposing personal jurisdiction and tax obligations on out-of-\n     State firms that purposefully solicit sales from residents \n     therein, and that the Congress has the power to authorize \n     State governments to require out-of-State firms to collect \n     State and local sales taxes, and\n       (9) as a matter of federalism, the Federal Government has a \n     duty to assist State and local governments in collecting \n     sales taxes on sales from out-of-State firms.\n\n     SEC. ____03. AUTHORITY FOR COLLECTION OF SALES TAX.\n\n       (a) In General.--A State is authorized to require a person \n     who is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the State to \n     collect and remit a State sales tax, a local sales tax, or \n     both, with respect to tangible personal property if--\n       (1) the destination of the tangible personal property is in \n     the State,\n       (2) during the 1-year period ending on September 30 of the \n     calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the \n     taxable event occurs, the person has gross receipts from \n     sales of such tangible personal property--\n       (A) in the United States exceeding $3,000,000, or\n       (B) in the State exceeding $100,000, and\n       (3) the State, on behalf of its local jurisdictions, \n     collects and administers all local sales taxes imposed \n     pursuant to this title.\n       (b) States Must Collect Local Sales Taxes.--Except as \n     provided in section ____04(d), a State in which both State \n     and local sales taxes are imposed may not require State sales \n     taxes to be collected and remitted under subsection (a) \n     unless the State also requires the local sales taxes to be \n     collected and remitted under subsection (a).\n       (c) Aggregation Rules.--All persons that would be treated \n     as a single employer under section 52 (a) or (b) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be treated as one person \n     for purposes of subsection (a).\n       (d) Destination.--For purposes of subsection (a), the \n     destination of tangible personal property is the State or \n     local jurisdiction which is the final location to which the \n     seller ships or delivers the property, or to which the seller \n     causes the property to be shipped or delivered, regardless of \n     the means of shipment or delivery or the location of the \n     buyer.\n\n     SEC.____04. TREATMENT OF LOCAL SALES TAXES.\n\n       (a) Uniform Local Sales Taxes.--\n       (1) In general.--Sales taxes imposed by local jurisdictions \n     of a State shall be deemed to be uniform for purposes of this \n     title and shall be collected under this title in the same \n     manner as State sales taxes if--\n       (A) such local sales taxes are imposed at the same rate and \n     on identical transactions in all geographic areas in the \n     State, and\n       (B) such local sales taxes imposed on sales by out-of-State \n     persons are collected and administered by the State.\n       (2) Application to border jurisdiction tax rates.--A State \n     shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of \n     paragraph (1)(A) if, with respect to a local jurisdiction \n     which borders on another State, such State or local \n     jurisdiction--\n       (A) either reduces or increases the local sales tax in \n     order to achieve a rate of tax equal to that imposed by the \n     bordering State on identical transactions, or\n       (B) exempts from the tax transactions which are exempt from \n     tax in the bordering State.\n       (b) Nonuniform Local Sales Taxes.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in subsection (d), \n     nonuniform local sales taxes required to be collected \n     pursuant to this title shall be collected under one of the \n     options provided under paragraph (2).\n       (2) Election.--For purposes of paragraph (1), any person \n     required under authority of this title to collect nonuniform \n     local sales taxes shall elect to collect either--\n       (A) all nonuniform local sales taxes applicable to \n     transactions in the State, or\n       (B) a fee (at the rate determined under paragraph (3)) \n     which shall be in lieu of the nonuniform local sales taxes \n     described in subparagraph (A).\n     Such election shall require the person to use the method \n     elected for all transactions in the State while the election \n     is in effect.\n     [[Page S1062]]   (3) Rate of in-lieu fee.--For purposes of \n     paragraph (2)(B), the rate of the in-lieu fee for any \n     calendar year shall be an amount equal to the product of--\n       (A) the amount determined by dividing total nonuniform \n     local sales tax revenues collected in the State for the most \n     recently completed State fiscal year for which data is \n     available by total State sales tax revenues for the same \n     year, and\n       (B) the State sales tax rate.\n     Such amount shall be rounded to the nearest 0.25 percent.\n       (4) Nonuniform local sales taxes.--For purposes of this \n     title, nonuniform local sales taxes are local sales taxes \n     which do not meet the requirements of subsection (a).\n       (c) Distribution of Local Sales Taxes.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in subsection (d), a \n     State shall distribute to local jurisdictions a portion of \n     the amounts collected pursuant to this title determined on \n     the basis of--\n       (A) in the case of uniform local sales taxes, the \n     proportion which each local jurisdiction receives of uniform \n     local sales taxes not collected pursuant to this title,\n       (B) in the case of in-lieu fees described in subsection \n     (b)(2)(B), the proportion which each local jurisdiction's \n     nonuniform local sales tax receipts bears to the total \n     nonuniform local sales tax receipts in the State, and\n       (C) in the case of any nonuniform local sales tax collected \n     pursuant to this title, the geographical location of the \n     transaction on which the tax was imposed.\n     The amounts determined under subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall \n     be calculated on the basis of data for the most recently \n     completed State fiscal year for which the data is available.\n       (2) Timing.--Amounts described in paragraph (1) (B) or (C) \n     shall be distributed by a State to its local jurisdictions in \n     accordance with State timetables for distributing local sales \n     taxes, but not less frequently than every calendar quarter. \n     Amounts described in paragraph (1)(A) shall be distributed by \n     a State as provided under State law.\n       (3) Transition rule.--If, upon the effective date of this \n     title, a State has a State law in effect providing a method \n     for distributing local sales taxes other than the method \n     under this subsection, then this subsection shall not apply \n     to that State until the 91st day following the adjournment \n     sine die of that State's next regular legislative session \n     which convenes after the effective date of this title (or \n     such earlier date as State law may provide). Local sales \n     taxes collected pursuant to this title prior to the \n     application of this subsection shall be distributed as \n     provided by State law.\n       (d) Exception Where State Board Collects Taxes.--\n     Notwithstanding section ____03(b) and subsections (b) and (c) \n     of this section, if a State had in effect on January 1, 1995, \n     a State law which provides that local sales taxes are \n     collected and remitted by a board of elected States officers, \n     then for any period during which such law continues in \n     effect--\n       (1) the State may require the collection and remittance \n     under this title of only the State sales taxes and the \n     uniform portion of local sales taxes, and\n       (2) the State may distribute any local sales taxes \n     collected pursuant to this title in accordance with State \n     law.\n\n     SEC.____05. RETURN AND REMITTANCE REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A State may not require any person subject \n     to this title--\n       (1) to file a return reporting the amount of any tax \n     collected or required to be collected under this title, or to \n     remit the receipts of such tax, more frequently than once \n     with respect to sales in a calendar quarter, or\n       (2) to file the initial such return, or to make the initial \n     such remittance, before the 90th day after the person's first \n     taxable transaction under this Act.\n       (b) Local Taxes.--The provisions of subsection (a) shall \n     also apply to any person required by a State acting under \n     authority of this title to collect a local sales tax or in-\n     lieu fee.\n\n     SEC.____06. NONDISCRIMINATION AND EXEMPTIONS.\n\n       Any State which exercises any authority granted under this \n     title shall allow to all persons subject to this title all \n     exemptions or other exceptions to State and local sales taxes \n     which are allowed to persons located within the State or \n     local jurisdiction.\n\n     SEC.____07. APPLICATION OF STATE LAW.\n\n       (a) Persons Required To Collect State or Local Sales Tax.--\n     Any person required by section ____03 to collect a State or \n     local sales tax shall be subject to the laws of such State \n     relating to such sales tax to the extent that such laws are \n     consistent with the limitations contained in this title.\n       (b) Limitations.--Except as provided in subsection (a), \n     nothing in this title shall be construed to permit a State--\n       (1) to license or regulate any person,\n       (2) to require any person to qualify to transact intrastate \n     business, or\n       (3) to subject any person to State taxes not related to the \n     sales of tangible personnel property.\n       (c) Preemption.--Except as otherwise provided in this \n     title, this title shall not be construed to preempt or limit \n     any power exercised or to be exercised by a State or local \n     jurisdiction under the law of such State or local \n     jurisdiction or under any other Federal law.\n\n     SEC.____08. TOLL-FREE INFORMATION SERVICE.\n\n       A State shall not have power under this title to require \n     any person to collect a State or local sales tax on any sale \n     unless, at the time of such sale, such State has a toll-free \n     telephone service available to provide such person \n     information relating to collection of such State or local \n     sales tax. Such information shall include, at a minimum, all \n     applicable tax rates, return and remittance addresses and \n     deadlines, and penalty and interest information. As part of \n     the service, the State shall also provide all necessary forms \n     and instructions at no cost to any person using the service. \n     The State shall prominently display the toll-free telephone \n     number on all correspondence with any person using the \n     service. This service may be provided jointly with other \n     States.\n\n     SEC.____09.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This title shall take effect 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act. In no event shall this title apply to \n     any sale occurring before such effective date.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I understand the majority leader has said \nthere will not be any more rollcall votes tonight. Certainly, I am not \ngoing to try to keep the Senate for any prolonged period of time, but I \nthink it would be appropriate to begin debate on this amendment, about \nwhich I feel very strongly and which I think is a very important \nmeasure for the Senate to consider. But at some point I will \ndiscontinue the debate, and it is my understanding that tomorrow, if \ncloture should fail, this would be the pending amendment. So I do not \nwant to delay the Senate in getting out of here this evening.\n  I just want to say to my colleagues this is an amendment that will do \nmore for the States, frankly, in the short term than this entire piece \nof legislation.\n  In 1967, the Supreme Court said that the States could not impose a \ntax on a mail order catalog house because it would be a violation of \ndue process and the commerce clause. So that was the law of the land \nuntil 1992, when a case called Quill versus North Dakota was decided by \nthe Supreme Court.\n  That decision reversed the 1967 decision. It said, No. 1, we are \nchanging our mind about due process. It is no longer a violation of the \ndue process clause if the States elect to require out-of-State \ncompanies which send goods into their State to collect the applicable \nsales tax, or use tax. A use tax is effectively the same thing as a \nsales tax, but they call it a use tax because it is a tax on the use of \nthe product, not the sale of the product. No. 2, although imposing this \ntax collection burden on an out-of-State company constitutes a burden \non interstate commerce that is impermissible under current law, the \nCongress has the right to determine if that burden should be allowed.\n  So the primary problem that prohibited States in the past from \nlevying a sales tax or a use tax on mail order houses--due process--was \nremoved.\n  Now, I cannot say this often enough, for anybody who is hesitant \nabout the thrust of this amendment, that it does not impose a tax on \nanybody. The tax is already there. This amendment simply allows the \nStates the discretion of saying to the mail order houses: If you are \ngoing to ship goods into this State, \n[[Page S1063]] you are going to have to collect the use tax on those \ngoods.\n  Now, Mr. President, I do not know how many States will do it. Five \nStates do not have a sales tax so this amendment would have no impact \non those States. They would not levy a use tax on mail order products \nbecause they do not levy sales taxes on their own in-State products.\n  The reason this legislation is important is because virtually every \nState in the Union--45 of them to be precise--have a use tax now. It is \nlevied not on the mail order house but on the buyer of goods from the \nmail order house. If you order a sweater from L.L. Bean and you ship it \ninto Arkansas, even though L.L. Bean doesn't collect the applicable use \ntax, the State of Arkansas says that the purchaser of that sweater \nshall remit a use tax in the exact amount of the sales tax to the State \nrevenue department of my State.\n  So what you have is a lot of people who are getting a rude surprise \nbecause the States are beginning, more and more, to find these people \nwho are buying big ticket items. People are buying these big ticket \nitems and suddenly somebody from the State revenue department in \nFlorida or North Carolina knocks on the door and says, ``Friend, that \nboat you bought for $250,000, you owe us $12,000.'' We have letters \ngalore in our files from people who have had that rude surprise.\n  Now, admittedly, the States collect very little revenue out of this. \nAnd you know the reason they do not is because the people of your \nrespective States of West Virginia, Ohio, Idaho, and the rest of you, \ndo not know there is a use tax on the books.\n  Mr. President, what do you think mail order sales in this country \namount to? Just figure it out in your own mind. You open your mail \nevery day, and you are getting two, three, four times as many catalogs \nat your house every week as you used to get.\n  I will be happy to yield to the majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will permit us to \nconclude a couple of things and then, if he wants to continue, I have \nno problem with that. I would like to conclude a couple of things and \nthen give the floor back to the Senator. They want to adopt one \nunanimous-consent request. I would like to file a cloture motion, and I \nthink the Democratic leader wants to have a colloquy. Then I need to \nmake a statement with reference to rule XIX.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOLE. Is that all right with the Senator from Arkansas?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Absolutely, Senator.\n\n\n        Modification to Committee Amendment On Page 25, Line 10\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Arkansas very much. \nWe had this amendment worked out over a period of time here. It \naddresses a problem we had yesterday on the floor about committee \njurisdiction. It has been agreed to on both sides of the aisle. We are \nhappy to do it with a voice vote.\n  I send an amendment to the desk to modify the committee amendment on \npage 25, line 10, that the previous amendments offered to the language \nproposed to be stricken by the committee amendment be added to the \nmodification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, the \namendment is so modified\n  The modification to the amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 25, strike all after line 10 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(4) Determinations of Applicability to Pending \n     Legislation.--For purposes of this subsection, in the Senate, \n     the presiding officer of the Senate shall consult with the \n     Committee on Governmental Affairs, to the extent practicable, \n     on questions concuring the applicability of this section to a \n     pending bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or \n     conference report.\n       ``(5) Determinations of Federal Mandate Levels.--For \n     purposes of this subsection, in the Senate, the levels of \n     Federal mandates for a fiscal year shall be determined based \n     on the estimates made by the Committee on the Budget.''.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I have submitted this. I believe it is \nacceptable on both sides of the aisle. It takes care of a problem we \ndebated at long length yesterday on the floor. Does my colleague have \nany comment?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President I wish to thank the Senator from Ohio, \nthe distinguished floor manager. He is correct.\n  This is an issue that was of concern between the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee and the Budget Committee. Through the evening hours and this \nmorning, language has been worked out. I hope this is another clear \nevidence that we are finally moving forward on S. 1, so we can deliver \nunfunded mandate relief to the cities and States. The public sector \nrealizes the private sectors are partners on this.\n  We agree to this amendment.\n  Mr. GLENN. I urge acceptance of the amendment.\n\n\n      Vote On Committee Amendment On Page 25, Line 10, As Modified\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the committee amendment, as modified.\n  The committee amendment on page 25, line 10, as modified, was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Remarks Expunged From The Record\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, earlier today there was a statement made on \nthe Senate floor. I will not repeat the statement, which I think \nviolated rule XIX. So I would pose the following question, Mr. \nPresident:\n  If I had called the Senator from South Carolina to order for his \nremarks regarding the Senator from Idaho, was rule XIX violated?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will read from Riddick's, page 738:\n       A Senator in debate, who ``in the opinion of the Presiding \n     Officer'' refers offensively to any State of the Union, or \n     who impugns the motives or integrity of a Senator, or \n     reflects on other Senators, may be called to order under Rule \n     XIX.\n\n  It is therefore the opinion of the Chair that the rule was violated, \nrule XIX was violated.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I therefore ask unanimous consent the \noffending remarks be expunged from the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing none, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas. I will \njust take another minute. I think the Senator from South Dakota, the \nDemocratic leader, may want to have a discussion here.\n  I wanted to file another cloture motion. Before I did that, I wanted \nto recite precisely what has happened so the record will be made.\n  We began debate on S. 1 at 10:30 a.m. on Thursday, January 12. There \nwere 14 committee amendments reported. The normal process is to adopt \nthe committee amendments en bloc after opening statements.\n  We have never been able to adopt the committee amendments. In fact, \nwe have had to resort to tabling a few just to get the Senate moving. \nWe are now only on committee amendment No. 11 out of 14.\n  Cloture was filed Tuesday, January 17, with the hope we could still \nwork out a unanimous consent agreement that would provide for an \nexclusive list of amendments. After that, the list has gone up since \nyesterday--on the Democratic side from 30-some to 78, and it is \nclimbing; and I must say it has gone up on the Republican side, up to \n30. That is 108 amendments. Yesterday, we were talking about 40-some.\n  Our proposed agreement asks that all amendments must be offered by 6 \np.m. tomorrow, and my colleague, Senator Daschle, counteroffered that \nit be offered by 12 noon on Wednesday, January 25. Obviously, when you \nagree on anything that has to be offered, you have to have a pretty \ngood relationship or one person will offer an amendment and that will \nbe it, and no other amendment can be offered. It has worked in the \npast, and it still may. It has worked out.\n  But it seems to me if we are going to complete action on this bill \nanytime next week, I hope my colleagues will help invoke cloture when \nthe cloture vote occurs tomorrow morning.\n  There was some discussion earlier that if we did not adopt--or deal \nwith the so-called Boxer amendment, that \n[[Page S1064]] might prevent cloture from being invoked. That amendment \nhas been disposed of. It was a unanimous vote. It was worked out with \nSenator Boxer and Senator Nickles and supported by every Senator who is \npresent.\n  I hope we can invoke cloture tomorrow and get on with the amendments \nthat should be debated on each side. And, having said that, I am happy \nto yield to the Senator from South Dakota before I send the cloture \nmotion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me say I am disappointed that the \ncloture motion will be filed. I respect the decision of the \ndistinguished majority leader, but I remind our colleagues that only \nthree Democratic amendments have been considered. One amendment offered \nby the majority was debated by the body for over 3 hours this \nafternoon. And I might add it was a nonrelevant nongermane amendment. \nSo we have really not had much of an opportunity to debate many of the \nvery relevant, germane amendments that reflect the legitimate concerns \nexpressed by our colleagues over the course of the last several days.\n  Let me just go back, if I may for just a moment, to remind my \ncolleagues that this bill was introduced on Wednesday, January 4, with \nvery significant and important differences from S. 993, the unfunded \nmandates bill that was reported last year.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee held a hearing the next day, on \nJanuary 5. There was a markup in Governmental Affairs scheduled for \nFriday, January 6. Senator Glenn, the ranking member, on behalf of \nseveral Democrats, asked for time to prepare amendments and consider \nissues raised at the hearing. The chairman, Senator Roth, subsequently \nagreed to put the markup over to Monday, the following week, with the \nrequirement that all amendments be filed by Friday, January 6, at 10 \no'clock.\n  Our committee members complied with that request in good faith.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee then had a markup on Monday, \nJanuary 9, at 10 o'clock. Members were originally told the chairman \nwould oppose all amendments because the majority leader wanted to take \nthem up on the floor. So our committee members again, in good faith, \ncooperated and delayed offering many of the amendments in committee, \nbecause they had the expectation that these amendments would be \nproperly debated and considered on the floor. Democrats objected to \neliminating the committee from the legislative process. A markup was \nheld, and amendments were offered. All Democratic amendments were \ndefeated as a result of this dictate on a partisan vote, except for \nthree that were accepted by the chairman.\n  At the markup, members were told that there would be no committee \nreport. There were strong objections at the time, and, of course, the \nwhole controversy relating to the committee report has been very much a \npart of the debate on the floor over the last several days.\n  The Budget Committee held its markup at 2:30 that same Monday. At the \nrequest of the chairman, several Democratic members of the Budget \nCommittee agreed to withhold offering their amendments until the bill \nwas to be considered on the floor.\n  Committee members were then told there would be ample opportunity to \noffer these amendments on the floor, and Democratic members asked that \na Budget Committee report on S. 1 be filed. It was our understanding \nthat there would be a report filed. Of course, that did not happen as \nit was promised.\n  So, Mr. President, in summary, let me just emphasize, we have dealt \nin good faith all the way through this process. We had hoped that we \ncould have ample consideration of the bill in both the Budget Committee \nand the Governmental Affairs Committee--and that did not happen. We \nwere hoping that we could have a report before the bill came to the \nfloor--that did not happen. We were told we would have an opportunity \nto consider amendments on the floor--germane amendments in many cases--\nand that has not happened.\n  In good faith, I think, Senator Dole and I have attempted over the \nlast day to find an agreement--and that has not happened, either.\n  There is no filibuster going on here. In my view, and I think in the \nview of many of our colleagues, there are very legitimate concerns \nabout many of these issues.\n  The concerns have to be addressed prior to the time many of us feel \ncomfortable voting on final passage. It is my hope and expectation \nthat, if we had ample consideration of some of these legislative \nissues, there could be a favorable vote. But certainly, that is going \nto take a reasonable amount of time. I would hope that we could oppose \nthe cloture motion tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think one example is today we spent nearly \n4 hours during a recess to try to work out the Boxer amendment which \nhad to do with violence in women's clinics. It is a very important \nissue. It has nothing to do with this bill. And we spent the last 2 or \n3 days not discussing the amendments but discussing parliamentary \nprocedure and whether or not we can adopt the committee amendments, \nwhich generally is a matter of course.\n  This is a bill that has not changed a lot since last year. It has not \nchanged much since last year. Unless something happened across the \ncountryside that this Senator is not aware of, it is supported by the \nGovernors, the mayors, the city officials, township and county \nofficials, and all the others, as has been indicated by the Senator \nfrom Idaho in the debate.\n  The House will start action on this bill on tomorrow. They will \nprobably demonstrate, as they did in the congressional coverage, that \nthey can pass the same bill in an hour and 20 minutes that took us 5 \ndays because of so many amendments that were not germane. I would not \nsuggest that we want to be like the House. I am very happy to be the \nU.S. Senate, and am very happy to have been in the House years ago, \ntoo.\n  But it seems to me that we can bring this matter to a close. If \ncloture is invoked, all the germane amendments are going to be there. \nThey can be a debated, adopted and disposed of in one way or the other.\n  So I hope that tomorrow we can move on this bill. We may not. We have \none Senator with five relevant amendments; another three, relevant; two \nrelevant. We have the same on the Republican side; one Member with one \nor two relevant amendments, whatever they may be. But they add up to \n180 amendments. It is much like the tax bill. I have had a few tax \nbills on the Senate floor.\n  So I certainly will continue to work with the distinguished \nDemocratic leader. We want to accommodate our colleagues wherever we \ncan on both sides of the aisle. And we will continue to work to do \nthat.\n  I would be willing to ask right now that all the committee amendments \nthat have not yet been disposed of be agreed to en bloc. I ask \nunanimous consent that all committee amendments that have not yet been \ndisposed of be agreed to en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DOLE. It is an indication that we are not making progress.\n\n\n                           The Easter Recess\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I wanted to make one correction. We have had \ngreat difficulty with the Easter recess. I will take the blame for most \nof it. But a letter went out today saying thanks for the extra week. \nWhat extra week? It is not an extra week. We are not getting 3 weeks \noff. We are getting a week before Easter and a week after.\n  By the time the letter went out it had almost the entire month of \nApril. It is not going to happen. We will be out April 7 to April 24. \nThat is 17 days. We are going to be way behind the House. The House has \n3 weeks. We will be about 2 months behind the House by then at the rate \nwe are going.\n  So I hope we do not have to put out anymore. If we want a fine letter \non the Easter recess, we have already put out the hotline.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/18/senate-section/article/S1028-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1064-S1069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

The cloture motion having been presented \n[[Page S1065]] under rule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the \nmotion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on S. 1, the \n     unfunded mandates bill:\n         Bob Dole, William Roth, Dirk Kempthorne, Bill Frist, \n           Trent Lott, Chuck Grassley, Craig Thomas, Judd Gregg, \n           John Ashcroft, Ted Stevens, Conrad Burns, James Inhofe, \n           Paul Coverdell, Spencer Abraham, Christopher S.

One hour after the Senate convenes after 1 day \nof session.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I apologize to the Senator from Arkansas for \ntaking so long.\n  I say to my colleagues that at 11 o'clock tomorrow we will be back on \nS. 1. There will be 30 minutes equally divided between the Senator from \nMichigan and Senator Kempthorne and Senator Byrd. At the hour of 11:30 \nthe Senate will proceed to vote on the Levin amendment regarding \nfeasibility, and immediately thereafter we will proceed to a cloture \nvote on S. 1; and, we will waive the mandatory quorum under rule XXII \nB.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I thank my colleague from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I might just take 1 more minute to \ncomment about the importance of the vote tomorrow, I think it is very \nimportant that Senators understand the difference between germaneness \nand relevance. We have a lot of amendments pending that are very \nrelevant and that, under the strict rules of parliamentary definition, \nmay not be germane.\n  The distinguished Senator from Michigan has raised his point on a \nnumber of occasions during the debate over the course of the last \nseveral days. Senators need to be aware that in many cases, while an \namendment in question may directly affect this legislation, may be \ndirectly relevant, it may be ruled not germane.\n  So this is a very important vote tomorrow morning, and I hope \nSenators will take care as we consider the importance of our \nopportunity to raise these issues in a constructive way as we have been \ndoing the last several days.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the question was how much business is the \ncatalog industry doing in this country? The answer is almost $100 \nbillion a year and growing at a rate of 6 percent a year.\n  To judge by the number of catalogs coming into my house, they are \ngrowing much faster than that. So you might ask, No. 1, why should \nthese people bother with collecting a tax on behalf of the States where \nthey sell merchandise?\n  I used to be a small town merchant. I had a hardware, furniture, and \nappliance store. I even had a cemetery and practiced law as well. I did \nanything to try to feed my wife and three children.\n  My biggest competitor was not the guy down the street. It was the \nSears & Roebuck catalog. They do not do much catalog business anymore; \nI think maybe Sears does no catalog business now. But I can tell you \nthat offices of every Senator in the U.S. Senate has received \ncommunique after communique in the last 3 days saying, please support \nSenator Bumpers' amendment. They are from small town, main street \nretailers all across America because it is not just Wal-Mart and K-Mart \nthat are putting them out of business; it is the catalog business which \nenjoys a competitive advantage because they do not have to collect that \n5 to 8 percent sales tax.\n  What would this mean to your State? In my State of Arkansas, it would \nmean $19.6 million a year. In Illinois, $233 million a year; \nPennsylvania, $145 million; New York, $359 million; and California, \n$482 million.\n  Call our former colleague, Governor Wilson in California, and ask him \nhow he feels about this legislation. It is supported by the National \nConference of Mayors, the National Governors Conference, the National \nConference of County Executives. Who are we trying to help with S. 1? \nThe Governors, the mayors, and the county executives.\n  Mr. President, I used to be Governor of my State. These mandates \ndrove me crazy. It was a big issue with me 24 years ago when I first \nbecame Governor of my State.\n  I am not too crazy about this particular unfunded mandates bill, even \nthough I was a cosponsor of it last year, and I am not at all sure I am \ngoing to vote for this one. But be that as it may, if you were to ask \nsome Governors in their State, ``Would you rather have the right you \nwould get under the Bumpers amendment or the mandates bill?'' they \nwould take this legislation, because they are scared to death that this \nmandate legislation will never amount to anything.\n  And you might say, ``These people do not do business in your State, \nso why should they collect a sales tax there?'' But they do impose a \nburden on the States--they send 3.3 million tons of catalogs and \nsolicitations into the landfills of this country every year. And what \nis one of the biggest problems every mayor has? Why, the local \nlandfill. In a lot of jurisdictions in this country it costs $100 a ton \nto dispose of garbage. But it is not just the 3.3 million tons of \ncatalogs which mail-order companies send into the States. All the \npackaging that their merchandise comes in has to be disposed of, too. \nHow much are the catalog houses contributing to the mayors to help them \ndispose of these millions of tons of garbage? Not one red dime.\n  Mr. President, this is not designed to be punitive. It is designed to \nbe fair. In order to be fair, I want to say this: There are a few mail \norder houses in this country which collect sales taxes in every State \nwhere they send products. There is one very notable case of such a \ncompany--essentially an office supply house which does over $200 \nmillion in business a year. When they formed the company, they sat down \nin the boardroom and said, ``Shall we or shall we not collect sales \ntaxes on our sales and remit to the States?'' They decided, as good \ncitizens, they would collect a sales tax and remit it back to every \nState they shipped into. Do you know who the founder of that company \nwas? It was Senator Robert Bennett of the great State of Utah. He said \nto the Small Business Committee during a hearing last year that ``We \nthought it was the right thing to do.''\n  Mr. President, we have made this bill as simple and fair as we know \nhow to make it. No. 1, we only require mail order companies to file a \nreturn with the States every 3 months. No. 2, we set up a toll-free \ntelephone number at the State level so that any questions the catalog \nhouses have can be resolved free of charge. And we have exempted all \nbut 875 of the 7,500 mail order houses in the country, because we \nexempt every company which does less than $3 million in business a \nyear. Of the 7,500 mail order companies in this country, 6,675 of them \ndo not do $3 million a year. The mayors did not like it because I \nexempted them. But we thought it was fair to do so because this \namendment could create a slight administrative burden on small \ncompanies. So only 825 of the 7,500 catalog sales houses in this \ncountry are going to be affected by this bill.\n  Mr. President, sometimes the mail order houses say this is too \ncomplicated. I am not going to belabor it tonight, but tomorrow I am \ngoing to bring about a week's supply of catalogs that came into my \nhome, and I am going to show you why that argument that this is too \ncomplicated on us will not fly. The reason it will not fly is because a \nlot of them already collect use taxes in as many as 25 or 30 States. \nSenator Bennett's company says, ``Include sales tax unless you are from \nAlaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire or Oregon, which do not have \nsales taxes.'' And then look at what they say: ``If your order is less \nthan $10, include $2 for shipping charge. If your order is $10 to $25, \ninclude $2.50,'' and here is another chart that you have to look at \nwhen you order. So they themselves have very complicated catalogs \nsometimes. And it would be immensely less cumbersome if you simply \nsaid: ``Send with your order the local sales tax.''\n   [[Page S1066]] Mr. President, main street merchants are suffering \nbecause they are at such a competitive disadvantage. Let me tell you \none other thing. There are some out-of-State companies that really \ndrive local retailers up the wall. There are out-of-State companies \nwhich say, ``Go down to the local store, get the model number of the \nproduct you want, and call us toll free at this 800 number.'' You think \nthey do not say that? Look at this advertisement: ``Discount \nWallcovering. Shop the phone way. All brands, first quality, free \ndelivery. No sales tax (outside Pennsylvania).'' But here is the real \nclincher: ``Shop in your neighborhood. Write down the pattern number \nbook and then call Wallcovering, Inc.''\n  How would you like to be a wallcovering retailer and somebody comes \nin and goes through all your merchandise, picks out the number of the \nwallcovering they like and they said, ``Adios, see you later.'' They go \nhome, get on a 1-800 line and call this outfit and they say, ``Here is \nthe pattern I want, ship it to me with no sales tax.''\n  There are going to be a lot of Senators that vote against this \namendment. But there is not one Senator in the U.S. Senate in his heart \nof hearts that would not tell you that such a practice is grossly \nunfair.\n  Here is an ad by an outfit that is too small for anybody to read \nunless you are right on top of it, so I will tell you what it says. It \nis a company that sells boats, motors, fuel, water pump kits, \neverything from the world of boats to everything that makes a boat run. \nWhat do they do? They say, ``Nobody beats our deal.'' Up here in red it \nsays, ``No sales tax added outside of North Carolina.''\n  Mr. President, I hate to belabor the Record, and I am not going to do \nthe whole thing, but I want to read you a letter that I got from a \nperson in the state of California that was in the boat business, Long \nBeach Yacht Sales, Long Beach, CA.\n                                                 January 18, 1994.\n     Hon. Senator Bumpers,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business, Russell Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Attention: Mr. Stan Fendley, Tax Council: Thank you, in \n     advance, for your sponsorship of legislation regarding the \n     collection of interstate sales tax. This week we lost a \n     $240,000 deal as a result of a sales tax issue. The buyer \n     bought a boat in Oregon to avoid our local and state sales \n     tax. The vessel will be kept out of state for the required \n     period of time and will be subsequently brought into \n     California after the waiting period has elapsed. Based on our \n     local tax rate of 8.25% the resulting tax would have been \n     $19,800.\n       Not only did we (and the State) lose this deal, but we also \n     lost the time and expenses involved in upselling the customer \n     to a more expensive boat (from $140,000 to $240,000), sea \n     trialing the boat and providing extensive consultation \n     regarding the product. The customer thanked us but basically \n     said for $19,800 he would have to make an economic choice to \n     buy elsewhere.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Ray Jones, Owner.\n  He told them, ``I can buy it in another State and bring it into this \nState and save myself almost $20,000.''\n  Who in their heart of hearts in the U.S. Senate thinks that is fair?\n  So I say, this is not punitive, and I am not just pointing the finger \nat all of these people. Fingerhut out in Minnesota said they do not \nthink this would be much of a burden on them. L.L. Bean, in the State \nof Maine, said they did not think this would be much of a burden on \nthem, either. So I applaud them. I applaud them for their generous \nstatements and their citizenship. I do not blame them for not \ncollecting the applicable taxes. I would not collect them either if I \ndid not have to.\n  Mr. President, the thrust of this amendment is to give the States the \ndiscretion. This does not impose one single thing on the States. It \nsays to the States, ``You have the discretion of requiring the \ncollection of use tax on merchandise being shipped into your State so \nthat retailers in your State are competing on a level playing field \nwith out-of-State companies.''\n  Mr. President, until that fateful November 8, 1994, I was chairman of \nthe Small Business Committee. As chairman of the Small Business \nCommittee, and as a former small businessman, I have always championed \nthe rights of people to start a business, make Government as \nunobtrusive as possible, reduce the paperwork burden, reduce the \nregulatory burden, everything to give people an opportunity to grow and \nprosper.\n  When we held hearings on this bill last year, we had retailers from \nall over the country come and testify. We had a music store owner in my \nState talk about how many people came into his store, got the model \nnumber off the instrument they wanted, and went back home and ordered \nit.\n  The retail Main Street jewelry stores left in this country, you can \ncount them on one hand, because they cannot compete. Yet these are the \npeople we look to organize the Christmas parades in rural America. They \nare the people that every State depends on to pay sales taxes to \neducate their children. They are losing billions of dollars of sales \nevery year to this absolutely burgeoning catalog sales business and it \nis time we give the States an opportunity to do something about it.\n  Mr. President, in the morning I am going to do two things: I am going \nto read you some additional letters from retailers as to what they are \nputting up with out there. Second, I have a whole stack of catalogs. I \nam going to go through some of them and show you how complicated it is \nnow and how, if you adopt this amendment, you not only curry favor of \nthe mayors and Governors of this country, you probably lighten the \nadministrative burden on some catalog companies because they will only \nhave one tax rate to worry about in each State instead of many \ndifferent local rates.\n  Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I ask unanimous consent that \nthis amendment be set aside until we return to S. 1 tomorrow morning. I \nam not sure what the hour is.\n  Mr. President, when are we scheduled to return to S. 1 in the \nmorning?\n  Mr. President, I will withdraw that request.\n  Mr. COHEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I was home when I learned that the Senator \nfrom Arkansas was going to take the floor this evening and offer this \namendment. I had no prior notification that it was coming up this \nevening.\n  I can perhaps understand why the Senator from Arkansas would want to \nfile this amendment prior to the cloture vote tomorrow. This is \nprecisely what the majority leader was just talking about.\n  Here we have a bill dealing with unfunded mandates, and we have the \nminority leader saying, ``Well, we just want to amend it in a \nsubstantive way dealing with relevant and germane issues pertaining to \nunfunded mandates,'' and the first thing that happens is the Senator \nfrom Arkansas gets up and offers this amendment which has no particular \nrelevance to this bill.\n  It is an example of what I mentioned on the floor the other day. We \nare back at it again. No sooner do we go into a new session with a new \nCongress, with new hopes of perhaps moving legislation at a much more \nexpeditious fashion, at least, than we just have a series of amendments \nand more amendments that have nothing to do with the bill under \nconsideration.\n  Now that is consistent with the Senate rules. And the majority leader \nsaid he does not want to see a change in the Senate rules; keep the \nSenate as the Senate and not as the House.\n  But the American people ought to understand why it is we cannot move \nforward with legislation: because every individual Member has his or \nher particular amendment that they want to offer.\n  With respect to this particular amendment, this would reflect a major \nchange in existing law. There is no mistake about it. This would be a \nmajor change in existing law.\n  It is being offered without any hearings having been held in the \nFinance Committee--not one. And yet on the floor of the Senate, the \nSenator from Arkansas wishes to make this rather significant change. \nThe Small Business Committee, I am told, held one hearing on the issue. \nBut none in Finance which is the committee of jurisdiction.\n  Now the supporters of the amendment argue this is a matter of \nfairness for local retailers.\n  It is grossly unfair to ask mail order companies to collect taxes for \nover 6,000 jurisdictions. Do you really want to talk about putting \nburdens on people? Ask a mail order company to collect taxes for 46 \nStates. There are some \n[[Page S1067]] 6,000--just count them, 6,000--different taxes in this \ncountry that would have to be considered.\n  But the Senator from Arkansas says, ``Well, that is just too bad. We \nare going to impose that burden on these mail order companies.''\n  We have a Maine snack tax, to give you an example. It is virtually \nindecipherable to most Maine companies. I think it would be absurd--\nabsurd--to expect every fruitcake vendor in this country to understand \nit. But that is what the Senator's amendment would do.\n  Second, about 30 percent of all of the mail orders are paid not by \ncredit cards, but by check. So if the check is made out in the wrong \namount, any mail order company, L.L. Bean or any other company in the \ncountry-would have a difficult time collecting this particular tax if \nthe calculation is wrong.\n  Now the Home Shopping Network collects State and local taxes. They \nare made via credit cards, where the seller simply adds an appropriate \ntax to it.\n  The Senator from Arkansas has talked about the great advantage that \nis being held by these mail order companies over the local retailer. \nThe fact is, the local retailers also pay taxes to enjoy benefits that \nout-of-State companies do not.\n  As a matter of fact the out-of-State companies are not at a \ncompetitive advantage. They have to add the shipping cost. These are \ncosts that are added to the product. They have to do it on a single \nitem basis rather than in bulk, because when people call up and say, \n``Can we have the product?'' they have to order and pay the shipping \nand mailing costs, which far exceed the sales tax in many cases. That \nis an added expense the local retailer does not have to bear. So \nSenator Bumpers may talk about competitive advantage, but it does not \nexist. Mail order companies do not, let me repeat, do not enjoy a \ncompetitive advantage by not having to collect these taxes.\n  The States have numerous ways to handle the collection of their \ntaxes? In Maine, for instance, we assume that people in each income \ncategory have purchased a number of goods from out of State, and the \nState imposes a presumptive use tax. Maine has devised its own means of \ncollecting taxes for goods purchased across State lines through mail \norder. Why not let the States handle it without the Senator from \nArkansas mandating another rule, where no hearings have been held by \nthe committee on jurisdiction. It is an extensive change. We ought not \nto undertake it on this particular bill.\n  Mr. President, as I indicated, I was not aware that this was going to \nbe brought up this evening. But I understand why it was. Last year an \nagreement was nearly reached involving the voluntary collection of \nState use taxes. This was negotiated by the direct marketing \nassociation and the multistate taxes commission, federation of tax \nadministers, and small businesses. They tried to reach an agreement to \nreduce the 6,000 taxes down to maybe 46 so that within each State there \nwould be only one rate. Unfortunately, the agreement fell apart in the \nend.\n  This amendment is very significant and should not be offered to this \nbill. I support the majority leader, where he says it is time to file \ncloture. I hope that we do invoke cloture tomorrow. And to eliminate \nthose amendments including these types of amendments that are being \noffered tonight on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. President, I will have more to say tomorrow, but for the moment I \nwill yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I just want to comment for a minute or \ntwo, because I know the other Senator from Maine wishes to be heard.\n  No. 1, if I were a Senator from Maine I would be making the same \nspeech I just heard. The second biggest catalog sales house in the \nUnited States is L.L. Bean from the great State of Maine.\n  But there is another very cogent point I neglected to make in my \nopening comments, and that is the State of Maine collects the sales \ntaxes for every dime's worth of goods that L.L. Bean sells in the State \nof Maine. They do not collect 1 penny for the other 49 States. They are \nprobably in the half billion dollar range now, maybe much more than \nthat. They are the second biggest. I believe Lands' End in Wisconsin is \nthe biggest in the country.\n  So, No. 1, everybody should understand that under current law, law \nestablished in various Supreme Court decisions, any mail order house \nthat maintains a retail outlet in another State has to collect the \nsales tax for that State. J. Crew, they have retail outlets in Maryland \nand Virginia. Eddie Bauer has retail outlets in about 15 States. So \nthose companies must collect use taxes when their mail order \nmerchandise goes into States where they maintain retail outlets. It is \nonly when they do not have a retail outlet in a particular State that \nthey do not have to collect use taxes on the mail order goods sent into \nthat State.\n  To suggest that this does not give mail order houses a competitive \nadvantage when I just got through reading a letter about how this \ncompany in Long Beach, CA, lost a $250,000 sale because of a $20,000 \nsavings in the sales tax. Why, of course people price shop. I will fill \nthe record up tomorrow with cases just like it where people tried their \nvery best to make a sale, and they say thank you very much for telling \nus about it, we will go across the State line and buy the merchandise \nand bring it back in and save the money.\n  Mr. President, to say that this amendment is not germane to the \nUnfunded Mandates bill is something that defies imagination. With the \nUnfunded Mandates bill, we are talking about the burden that Congress \nhas been putting on the States of this Nation, ordering them how to \nbuild their landfills, how to fill the landfill, what their municipal \nwater supplies must do, every kind of environmental regulation we could \nput on them. They say ``we want you to start paying for it.''\n  The thrust of that idea is legitimate. I believe in it. It is a very \ncomplex issue. But this amendment says to the States, ``Those burdens \nwe have already placed on you, we will help you pay for that.'' And to \nsay that principle is not germane to this bill makes no sense. We are \nsimply saying we will help you pay for your landfill, if you, State and \nlocal government, want us to.\n  Let me repeat what I started off saying in the beginning: Maine, \nsince it already collects the sales tax from all the sales made off of \nL.L. Bean--and I misspoke earlier, Senator--it was Lands' End that said \nthey do not think this would be a burden.\n  L.L. Bean has not said that, to my knowledge.\n\n  But Maine has the best of all worlds. And I love Maine. I have the \nutmost respect for my colleagues from Maine. But they are collecting \nsales taxes on all the sales they make in Maine, but they do not \ncollect a red cent for the merchandise they send into other States \nthrough catalog sales. They do not pay for disposing of the catalogs in \nthe local landfill or the packaging they send the merchandise in. The \nSenator says that is not germane. That is what this bill is all about, \ntrying to help the States.\n  So, Mr. President, I cannot say it often enough, this amendment gives \nthe States the discretion. It does not require the States to do one \nblessed thing. It says if the States want to require out-of-State \ncompanies to collect use taxes, just as retail outlets in your State \nhave to collect sales taxes, the States can do it. It has only been \nsince 1992 when the Supreme Court ruled in Quill versus North Dakota, \nthat we could even debate this issue here.\n  Now, Mr. President, this is an idea that will not go away. It will \nhappen, sure as God made little apples. Maybe not on this bill, but it \nwill happen. And the sooner the people in this business understand \nthat, the better off we will all be. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment that \nhas been offered by the Senator from Arkansas, and I want to associate \nmyself with the remarks made by the Senator from Maine, [Mr. Cohen].\n  I guess in hearing the arguments presented by the Senator from \nArkansas tonight one would think this is a very simple matter. In fact, \nit would put national marketers and mail order companies as well as \nconsumers at a disadvantage, and certainly would hurt the thousands of \njobs that are provided by these companies.\n  There is no tax advantage for mail order companies, as the Senator \nfrom Maine indicated. They have to charge for postal rates, and many \ntimes these charges exceed the cost of local taxes \n[[Page S1068]] or State taxes. Also, mail order companies do not derive \nthe benefits from having their presence in a local community like many \nof the local merchants and, therefore, do not create additional costs \ndo a local community.\n  In a State like Maine, we have taken a very reasonable approach. What \nwe have done is require the taxpayer to play a flat rate on their tax \nreturn when they file it in April for the amount of the taxes they owe \nin out-of-State purchases. That is the requirement. Granted, it \nrequires a good-faith effort on the part of the taxpayers in Maine, but \nit has worked and it is a far better approach than applying this kind \nof a tax through a bill that has no relation to the issue before us in \nthe Senate.\n  This amendment would impose a major new burden on many companies \nthroughout the country without the benefit of hearings to explore the \nramifications of such a tax on mail order companies. We are not only \ntalking about the imposition of a tax, we are talking about compliance \ncosts, and those are not minimal, if you consider the fact that mail \norder companies would be required to cope with no less than 46 types of \nprocedures and exemptions from over 6,000 State and local tax rates. \nThe compliance tax alone would be 6.5 times greater for mail order \ncompanies than for local retailers who must only contend with one tax \nrate and one set of exemptions.\n  The Senator from Arkansas mentioned L.L. Bean. For L.L. Bean, that \nwould cost $500,000 per year for compliance, just in the administrative \naccounting and legal fees that would be involved, not to mention the \nfact that, of course, a blended tax rate would mean that for many \ncustomers, in fact, for probably half the customers, they would pay \nmore tax than they actually owe. So, of course, that would contribute \nto a loss of confidence and erode sales for the company. I suspect the \n100 million Americans who shop by mail order today would also find such \nan unfair tax scheme unjustifiable.\n  This amendment would have an economic impact on everyone. Jobs would \nbe lost in Maine and elsewhere in the country.\n  This is an unfair imposition, it is an unreasonable administrative \nburden when there are other approaches that can be taken and, in fact, \nare being pursued.\n  As Senator Cohen mentioned, there has been an approach taken by the \nindustry to look at resolving this matter in a way which could be fair \nto the industry without creating additional and onerous burdens, as \nwell as excessive costs far beyond the local taxes that they would be \nrequired to collect, and they are working on such an agreement.\n  I think we ought to encourage a negotiated settlement that would \nsatisfy both parties without unnecessarily burdening companies or \nconsumers and costing thousands of jobs all across this country.\n  The revenues raised under this proposal, according to the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, would be about $1.6 billion. But, in fact, it would be \nfar less than that when you deduct compliance costs. This amendment \nwould require States to audit out-of-State firms.\n It would certainly add costs to the States as well as to the mail \norder companies.\n\n  The Senator from Arkansas mentioned that this would benefit local \nmerchants and small businesses, but it is interesting to note that the \none organization that represents thousands of small businesses and \nmerchants all across America undertook a survey last year asking their \nclients whether or not they support such a collection by mail order \ncompanies. Only 25 percent said yes and 67 percent said no to such a \nmandate.\n  It is because they recognize that it would hurt many local economies \nacross America. It would cost jobs, and the administrative burden would \nbe a nightmare. It would be very difficult to comply with such a \nmandate and that the tax structure would be so complex that there would \nbe many mistakes in the process of calculation.\n  I hope that my colleagues in the Senate will oppose the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Arkansas because, clearly, it would not \nresult in the kind of benefits that he mentioned this evening and \ncertainly would result in the loss of thousands of jobs and additional \nregulatory costs. Now is not at a time when we can afford these \neconomic losses.\n  I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, has provided a statement which addresses constitutional \nissues raised earlier today by Senator Byrd with regard to the unfunded \nmandates legislation. He states in this statement that he is \n``unpersuaded that there would be any constitutional problem'' with the \nissues raised.\n  (At the request of Mr. Lott, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record:)\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have listened with care to what Senator \nByrd has said regarding what he sees as a constitutional question \nraised by one provision of this unfunded mandates legislation. I \nappreciate his thoughts on this issue. I am unpersuaded, however, that \nhe has identified a serious constitutional problem. Indeed, I am \nconvinced that a careful analysis will show that his concern is \nunwarranted.\n  In the first place, Senator Byrd's concern is not that a provision of \nS. 1 is facially unconstitutional but merely that it might possibly be \napplied in an unconstitutional manner. This same objection could be \nraised against virtually every law. The mere possibility that a \nprovision might be applied in an unconstitutional manner has never been \nregarded as sufficient to invalidate it. Otherwise, Congress could \nnever enact anything. In any event, if a problem with a possible \napplication of this provision were to arise in the future, that problem \nwould be raised by an implementing bill. It is that future implementing \nbill that would require reconsideration, not the bill currently before \nus. In other words, since the concern raised by Senator Byrd relates to \none manner in which the provision might be applied, that concern should \nbe raised if and when a later bill adopts that manner. In short, the \nconcerns raised by Senator Byrd are not suited to a facial challenge to \nthe provisions of this unfunded mandates legislation.\n  Second, even under the speculative possibility raised by Senator \nByrd, I am unpersuaded that there would be any constitutional problem \nwith the possibility that he raises. It is noteworthy that Senator Byrd \nis unable to cite even a single Supreme Court case--or any case from \nany court, for that matter--in support of his argument that the \nprovision he is concerned about presents constitutional problems. This \nis not surprising, for his argument is, I believe, unsustainable. \nCongress can act to sunset legislation through a variety of means. That \nit might do so through a mechanism that involves administrative \nagencies does not make that mechanism ipso facto constitutionally \nsuspect. In short, I see nothing in the provision at issue that \ninvolves any delegation of legislative powers to agencies, much less \nany unconstitutional delegation.\n  Third, it seems clear to me that Senator Byrd misunderstands the \nprovision that he is worried about. This provision specifies a \nrequirement that must under some circumstances be satisfied in order to \navoid having a point of order lie. Let's assume for the sake of \nargument that the requirement was constitutionally defective. All that \nwould mean is that the requirement could not be lawfully satisfied and \nthat a point of order would therefore lie. Were this the case, the \nSenate could decide whether or not to overrule the point of order.\n  Mr. President, some people will look for any excuse, however flimsy, \nto continue imposing burdensome unfunded mandates on States and \nlocalities. It is especially amusing that my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle who have championed a massive Federal bureaucracy are \nnow invoking an exaggerated, hyperrestrictive version of the doctrine \nthat Congress is limited in the powers that it can delegate to \nadministrative agencies. There is no merit to the argument, and no one \nshould hide behind it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss S. 1, the \nUnfunded Mandate Reform Act. Mr. President, in traveling throughout the \nState of Maryland, I have heard complaints of \n[[Page S1069]] local officials who have been forced to balance the \nneeds of their community against compliance with Federal regulations.\n  These local officials have raised valid concerns over the pressure to \nimplement mandates imposed by Washington with no funds to back it up. I \nbelieve we need to work as a partner with our cities, towns, and \ncounties--not as their adversary.\n  I support the validity of their concerns. I am on their side.\n  We need to have a better understanding about the costs of Federal \nmandates--on the public sector and private sector--and help our local \npartners meet those costs.\n  I am glad the Senate has finally begun the debate on this important \nissue. I believe the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act takes an important \nstep toward correcting many of the problems of the past.\n  This legislation will make Congress estimate the costs of new \nlegislation and regulations on State and local governments and the \nprivate sector, specify the means to pay for it, and reduce or \neliminate a mandate if adequate funding is not provided.\n  This bill applies only to new legislation. It does not effect any \nexisting law or program. Furthermore, this legislation exempts any law \nor regulation that enforces constitutional rights, establishes or \nenforces laws that prohibit discrimination, provides emergency \nassistance to State and local governments, pertains to national \nsecurity or treaty ratification and any bill designated as an emergency \nby the President and Congress.\n  While I wholeheartedly support these exemptions, as well as the \noverall intent of this legislation, I have a number of questions \nregarding its impact and applicability.\n  I am very concerned about this bill's impact on laws that are \ndesigned to protect public health and safety. Will this bill diminish \nthe Government's ability to protect public health and provide essential \npublic safety?\n  I am concerned about how this bill defines public and private and how \nit impacts future laws and programs. Could a mandate exempt the public \nsector while applying to the private sector? Could public schools be \nexempt from a mandate while Catholic or other religious day schools \nwould be forced to comply?\n  Would future emissions standards apply to UPS trucks but not MTA \nbuses?\n  I am concerned about how Federal agencies will have to implement the \ncomplex provisions of this legislation. For example, will Federal \nagencies be forced to rewrite regulations every year if funding levels \nchange?\n  I am concerned about confusion this bill may generate to State and \nlocal governments and the private sector.\n  I believe we need laws and regulations that are clear, enforceable, \nand universally applicable. I support the intent of this legislation \nand many of its provisions; at the same time I remain concerned over \nthe issues I have outlined. I believe these questions need to be \nanswered before the Senate adopts any unfunded mandates legislation.\n    regarding relationship between unfunded mandates and sound risk \n                               regulation\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I want to point out to my colleagues the \nconnection between S. 1, the unfunded mandates bill, and a matter that \nis close to my heart--the risk assessment and cost-benefit provision \nthat passed the Senate twice on the last Congress, only to die in the \nHouse. As my colleagues may recall, it passed by a vote of 95 to 3 on \nthe EPA Cabinet bill in 1993, and then, after significant revision, \npassed again on the safe drinking water bill in 1994 by a vote of 90 to \n8.\n  One of the best ways to reduce unfunded mandates--whether it be on \nState and local governments or the private sector--is to set aside the \nissue of funding and examine whether the mandate itself is sound. \nFederal regulations that do not address a significant risk in a cost-\neffective manner must be avoided, regardless of who pays. Put another \nway, the argument over who should pay for a mandate will be much easier \nto resolve if the mandate itself is as lean as possible to do the job.\n  Section 202 of S. 1 begins to get at this idea when it requires the \nFederal agency, when promulgating a regulation that will cost $100 \nmillion or more, to prepare a written statement providing ``a \nqualitative, and if possible, a quantitative assessment of costs and \nbenefits anticipated from the Federal intergovernmental mandate, such \nas the enhancement of health and safety and the protection of the \nnatural environment * * *.'' This is a certainly a good provision as \nfar as it goes.\n  But this problem will not be fully addressed until the Senate turns \nonce again to the subject of risk-based regulatory reform. I was \ninitially inclined to offer last year's risk amendment to this bill, \nbut I have been convinced to withhold so that we can consider possible \nimprovements to last year's risk provision.\n  Right now, Chairman Murkowski and I are working on legislation that \nwill build on last year's provision. We intend to introduce the bill \nsoon, hold hearings in the Energy Committee soon thereafter, and move \nto consideration of the bill on the Senate floor at the earliest \nopportunity.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/18/senate-section/article/S1064-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Zaroff, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/18/senate-section/article/S1069-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIUE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which were referred to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/18/senate-section/article/S1069-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mrs. KASSEBAUM, from the Committee on Labor and Human \n     Resources, without amendment:\n       S.

A bill to provide for the termination of reporting \nrequirements of certain executive reports submitted to the Congress, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                 The Reporting Requirements Sunset Act\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that would \nterminate the statutory requirement for all congressionally mandated \nreports, except for those required under the Inspector Generals Act and \nthe Chief Financial Officers Act, 5 years after its enactment. The \nReporting Requirements Sunset Act of 1995 is almost identical to \nlegislation (S. 1971) that I introduced in the last Congress. This bill \nwould also require the President to identify which reports he feels are \nunnecessary or wasteful in his next budget submission to Congress, a \nmeasure which will hopefully spur the Congress to swiftly dispose of \nthose specific reports.\n  This proposal is intended to address the growing problem of the \nthousands of reports the Congress is burdening the executive branch \nwith each year. Each year, Members of Congress add layer upon layer of \nonerous paperwork requirements upon executive branch agencies by \nmandating various reports. This problem has a very real and substantive \ncost to taxpayers in terms of wasting hundreds of millions of dollars, \nin addition to taking up untold number of work-hours by Federal \nemployees, and draining vast amounts of other agency resources that \ncould be far better utilized in more worthy endeavors.\n  The Vice President's National Performance Review determined that in \n1993 alone the Congress mandated that the Office of the President and \nexecutive branch agencies to prepare over 5,300 reports. This is a \nproblem that is reaching truly epic proportions of unnecessary and \nwasteful papershuffling.\n  I have based this legislation upon the official list of \ncongressionally mandated reports which is published each Congress by \nthe Clerk of the House of Representatives. It is the most comprehensive \ncompilation available. Let me give just a few examples of the type of \nreports I am talking about. Each year, the following are required to be \nsent to the Congress from Federal agencies: a report on activities \ninvolving electric and hybrid vehicle research; a report on the United \nStates-Japan Cooperative Medical Science\n Program; another on the number of customs service undercover \noperations commenced, pending, and closed; and finally, a report on the \ntransportation, sale, and handling of animals for research and pets.\n\n  Is the continued research, preparation, and production of these types \nof reports--and thousands more, all at taxpayers' expense--really \nnecessary? I think the answer is likely no, Mr. President, and I am \nconfident most people determined to reduce the size and cost of \nGovernment will agree.\n  This problem of foisting massive reporting requirements on Federal \nagencies is extremely expensive. The Department of Agriculture alone \nspent over $40 million in taxpayers money in 1993 to produce the 280 \nreports it was required to submit to the Congress. That is astounding, \nMr. President--$40 million in taxpayer dollars spent by a single \ndepartment on reports mandated by the Congress. At a time when our \ncountry is struggling to alleviate the burdens of the middle class and \nalso address the urgent needs of our citizenry, \n[[Page S1071]] this is an especially egregious waste of money.\n  Furthermore, this problem is getting worse with each passing year. \nThe GAO stated that in 1970, the Congress mandated only 750 recurring \nreports from Federal agencies. Now we have spiraled well past 5,300, \nand the GAO determined that ``Congress imposes about 300 new \nrequirements on Federal agencies each year.'' Clearly, Mr. President, \nthe wasteful blizzard of paperwork that Vice President Gore criticized \nis becoming an avalanche, and it's time for the Senate to take decisive \naction to remedy it.\n  This legislation would terminate the statutory requirement for all \ncongressionally mandated reports 5 years after it is signed into law, \nwith two specific exceptions. The reports to be exempted are those \nrequired under the Inspector Generals Act of 1978 and the Chief \nFinancial Officers Act of 1990. The Inspector Generals Act requires the \nCongress to be advised of activities regarding investigations into \nwaste, fraud, and abuse in Federal agencies; and the CFO Act requires \nagencies to provide financial information about their short- and long-\nterm management of agency resources.\n  I believe the reports required by these two laws are very important \nand merit continuation, and I also recognize that there are many other \nreports that my colleagues feel have great value because of the \ninformation they provide to the Congress. Such reports can simply be \nreauthorized at any time in the 5 years before this amendment would \nsunset them.\n  Mr. President, it's time we put an end to this cycle of waste and \nmisspent resources. The adoption of this legislation would be a strong \ncontribution toward downsizing Government as the American people are \ncalling on us to do. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation \nand remove the millstone of unnecessary and costly paperwork that \nCongress has hung around the neck of the Federal Government for too \nlong.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 234. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to exempt a \nState from certain penalties for failing to meet requirements relating \nto motorcycle helmet laws if the State has in effect a motorcycle \nsafety program, and to delay the effective date of certain penalties \nfor States that fail to meet certain requirements for motorcycle safety \nlaws, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n                     MOTORCYCLE SAFETY LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce legislation \nwhich will provide relief to 25 of those States that have been \npenalized by one such mandate. The Intermodal Transportation Act of \n1991 penalized States which did not pass laws mandating seatbelt and \nhelmet usage by October 1 of 1993. The penalties involve a required \ntransfer of scarce transportation and construction dollars to section \n402 safety programs. The penalties are assessed regardless of whether \nthe State already has the funds dedicated to safety programs and \nregardless of the State's individual safety record.\n  Like many of my colleagues, Mr. President, I am not opposed to safety \nprograms and I certainly support them. I am not opposed to the use of \nhelmets. On the contrary, I am opposed to the Federal Government \nblackmailing States, as many other Senators are. It is not a good \npolicy to force States to channel funds from one transportation \nactivity to another, using threats of withholding Federal money for \nthese programs.\n  This bill would give States the option of implementing their own \nsafety programs, which they can tailor to the specific needs of their \nindividual States. If they choose to design a safety program or already \nhave such a program in place, it would not be subject to the section \n153 penalties. They still would have the option of passing such laws if \nthey want it. In fact, it would not mandate that any States repeal \nexisting laws.\n  I believe encouraging and providing support to States and local \ncommunities to establish training programs would be a much more \neffective means of improving motorcycle safety on the roads and the \nhighways. The Federal Government should redirect their role to \nestablishing basic guidelines regarding the programs, rather than \nforcing States to dip from one transportation fund to another.\n  Mr. President, as the Senate has been debating the issue of unfunded \nmandates, I am introducing legislation that will provide options and \nrelief to the 25 States which have been financially penalized under the \nIntermodal Surface Transportation Act of 1991 for not having passed \nlaws mandating helmet use by the deadline of October 1, 1993. This is \nnot only a burdensome Federal mandate placed on the backs of State \nlegislatures, but also an erosion of civil liberties and personal \nfreedom.\n  Twenty-five States face penalties in fiscal years 1995, 1996, and \n1997. In accordance with ISTEA, they are required to transfer scarce \ntransportation and construction dollars to section 402 safety programs.\n  This shift will force States to spend 10 to 20 times the amount they \nare currently spending on section 402 safety programs. These penalties \nare assessed regardless of whether the State already has funds \ndedicated to helmet safety programs and regardless of the State's \nindividual safety record.\n  Initially, these States are being forced to shift 1.5 percent of \ntheir Federal highway dollars. This transfer effects three programs: \nthe National Highway System, the Surface Transportation Program, and \nthe Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program. Those \nStates which did not enact helmet laws by September 30, 1994, are \nrequired to shift 3 percent of their Federal highway funds from these \nimportant programs into safety programs.\n  My bill would repeal the section 153 penalties and, upon enactment of \nthis legislation, gives States until fiscal year 1996 to either pass \nhelmet laws, or establish motor safety programs, exempting those States \nwhich already have safety programs in place.\n  Mr. President, let me be clear. I am not opposed to people wearing \nhelmets. Quite the contrary. What I am opposed to is the Federal \nGovernment blackmailing States to pass laws. It simply is not good \npolicy to force States to funnel funds from one State transportation \nactivity to another. It should be pointed out that the money the \nFederal Government wants to redirect, is tax revenue already paid by \nState residents.\n  Safety education programs are desirable. That is the point of my \nbill. I firmly believe, and I'm sure my colleagues would agree, that we \nmust do everything we can to make our roads and highways safer.\n  My bill would give States the option of implementing safety programs, \ninstead of mandating the use of helmets and remove the section 153 \npenalties.\n  My own State of Colorado has no helmet law. The Colorado Legislature \nhas repeatedly shot down any attempt to implement one.\n  Colorado, however, has a motorcycle fatality rate almost 30 percent \nbelow the average for States with mandatory helmet laws. Of the top 12 \nStates with the best motorcycle safety records, only one has a helmet \nlaw. On the other hand, half of the 12 States with the worst safety \nrecords have helmet laws.\n  Comparing States with and without mandatory helmet laws as a whole, \nfigures show that for the 14-year period between 1977 and 1990, States \nwith mandatory helmet laws had 12.5 percent more accidents and 2.3 \npercent more fatalities than States that did not mandate helmet usage.\n  In the past decade, motorcycle fatalities have decreased 38 percent \nand accidents have plummeted 41 percent. These figures are particularly \nimpressive\n because the Federal Highway Administration estimates that the average \nvehicle miles traveled by motorcyclists has increased 85 percent since \n1975. These statistics are unmatched by any other category of road \nuser--passenger or commercial.\n\n  What can account for this decrease in accidents and fatalities? \nEvidence clearly indicates that the most effective way to reduce \nmotorcycle accidents and motorcycle fatalities is through comprehensive \neducation programs, as opposed to mandating helmet usage. Currently 42 \nStates have established and funded some sort of safety program.\n  The national average of motorcycle fatalities per 100 accidents is \n2.95. \n[[Page S1072]] States with rider education programs and no helmet laws, \nhowever, have the lowest average death rate, 2.56 fatalities per 100 \naccidents. States with mandatory helmet laws and no rider education \nprograms have a significantly higher rate of 3.09 fatalities per 100 \naccidents.\n  Police accident reports indicate that well over 45 percent of \nmotorcyclists involved in accidents did not have a motorcycle license, \n92 percent did not have any rider training, and over 50 percent had \nless than 6 months riding experience. Some 62 percent of the accidents \nand 50 percent of the fatalities involved riders between the ages of 17 \nand 26. Clearly, mandating helmet use will not address the real problem \nof rider inexperience and lack of training.\n  I believe that encouraging and providing support to States and local \ncommunities to establish motorcycle training programs would be a much \nmore effective means of improving motorcycle safety on our roads and \nhighways. The Federal Government should redirect its role to providing \nuniform national guidelines regarding these safety programs, rather \nthan mandating where the money to pay for them should come from.\n  I realize the motivations behind ISTEA and those who wish to force \nStates into passing helmet and seatbelt laws are doing so out of \nconcern for the safety of the traveling public, but I think their \nefforts are misguided.\n  Forcing States to pass laws, or throwing money at safety programs is \nnot the answer. Throughout my career in politics, I have always strived \nto protect the interest of States and communities by allowing them to \nmake the important decisions on how their affairs should be conducted. \nWhen Congress blackmailed the States regarding highway speed limits, I \nthought that was wrong. The same goes for helmet laws. I have stuck \nwith the philosophy that each State and each community should, to the \nbest of their abilities, be allowed to make its own policy decisions.\n  I own a motorcycle, that's no secret. Where helmets are required to \nbe worn, I wear them. Where they are not, I don't. I make no bones \nabout the fact that my dislike for the Federal mandate requiring States \nto pass helmet laws is in part inspired by my interest in motorcycling. \nBut, I also think personal freedom is an issue. I am prochoice. I do \nnot think the Federal Government should dictate to the States, or its \ncitizens, on matters of individual liberty. The choice of wearing a \nhelmet, or not doing so, should be left up to the individual--not \nforced by Government extortion. And those who contend that it is not \nsimply a personal responsibility because motorcyclists who choose not \nto wear helmets can become a ``public burden,'' are using faulty logic. \nIt would then follow that we should mandate helmets for skiers, \nhorsemen, skateboarders, and automobile drivers.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I want to strongly encourage my colleagues \nto reconsider the position Congress took in ISTEA in mandating that \nStates pass helmet and seatbelt laws. It is wrong to blackmail the \nStates into passing laws. And, if motorcycle safety programs are \ndesired, we should work toward establishing effective program \nguidelines, rather than force States to dip from one transportation pot \nto fill another.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 234\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose a \nvalue added tax and to use the receipts from the tax to reduce the \nFederal budget deficit and Federal debt and to finance health care \nreform; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n  THE DEFICIT AND DEBT REDUCTION AND HEALTH CARE FINANCING ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Deficit \nReduction and Health Care Financing Act of 1995. This bill would create \na 5-percent national value-added tax, with all revenues set aside in a \ntrust fund to finance deficit reduction and health care reform. Let me \nbe clear, I offer this bill under duress. But it is the only way I \nknow--in tandem with deeper spending cuts--to deal with the fiscal \nrecklessness that has gotten out of hand in this city.\n  It's time we stopped running government based on the promise of \npollisters and started thinking about performing for the people. Today, \nI propose a 5-percent national value-added tax without exemptions. The \nVAT is essentially like a national sales tax. Traditionally, there have \nbeen three principal objections to a VAT: First, it is regressive; \nsecond, it is too complicated; third, it raises too much money and \nwould cause waste. Let me address each of these objections in turn.\n  First, the issue of regressivity. I agree, but all taxes are \ninherently regressive. With a consumption tax, the more you consume, \nthe more you pay; the less you consume, the less you pay. The VAT does \nfall disproportionately on lower income brackets. But the VAT is not \nnearly as regressive as interest costs on the national debt. It is not \nnearly as regressive as the debt's inflationary impact on the economy, \nwhich disproportionately harms the poor.\n  Second, it is said that the VAT is too complicated. Well, it's \ncertainly not too complicated for the Japanese, the Koreans, and every \nmember of the European Economic Community. Moreover, we can draw on the \nlessons of these other countries as well as the experiences of the \nStates with sales taxes in order to minimize such complications.\n  Third, some say that a VAT would raise too much money. This is a \ndream. We will need ever dime raised by a 5- percent VAT, plus savings \nfrom additional steep spending cuts, in order to eliminate the deficit. \nEven then, it will take years to pay down the debt and to put \ngovernment back in the black.\n  A VAT will help us not only to eliminate the deficit but also to pay \ncash on the barrelhead for health reform. Additionally, moving to \nborder-rebatable taxes will contribute to eliminating our other great \ndeficit--the trade deficit. At present, our overseas competitors rebate \nto their manufacturers the VAT on all goods exported to the United \nStates; those manufacturers' other in-country taxes are relatively low. \nIn stark contrast, producers in the United States pay property taxes, \nincome taxes, excise taxes, Social Security taxes and much more; then, \nwhen their goods are shipped overseas, the importing country slaps a \nfat VAT tax on top of all those other taxes. This does tremendous harm \nto the competitiveness of U.S. products abroad. It makes it financially \nattractive to produce outside the United States, and represents at \nleast a 15-percent disadvantage in international trade. A U.S. VAT \nwould eliminate this disadvantage. With good reason, Lester Thurow of \nMIT says that ``the rules of international trade make you stupid if you \ndon't have a VAT.''\n  I have no illusions as to the political trauma involved in enacting a \nnew tax. \n[[Page S1073]] There is never a good time to raise a tax. But as we \ncontinue to wait for a propitious moment, our financial crisis worsens \nevery day. It's time to put government back on track with difficult \nbelt-tightening and and honest taxes. I propose a single, ultra-simple \nreform--a reform that would transform the reputation of Congress in the \neyes of the American people. That reform is to put the U.S. Government \non a pay-as-you-go basis.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HOLLINGS:\n  S. 238. A bill to create a legislative line-item veto by requiring \nseparate enrollment of items in appropriations bills; to the Committee \non Rules and Administration.\n\n\n      THE LEGISLATIVE LINE-ITEM VETO SEPARATE ENROLLMENT AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich would provide Congress and the President with an additional \nweapon to eliminate wasteful and unnecessary appropriations and thereby \nreduce the Federal deficit. This bill, a statutory, separate enrollment \nline-item veto, is identical to a measure previously considered by the \n99th and reported favorably by a bipartisan vote out of the Senate \nBudget Committee on July 25, 1990. During the 103d Congress, a similar \namendment offered by myself and Senator Bradley received the support of \n52 Senators.\n  Today, 43 States have, in one form or another, a line-item veto \nallowing the chief executive to limit legislative spending. As a former \nGovernor who inherited a budget deficit in a poor State, I can testify \nthat a line-item veto is invaluable in imposing fiscal restraints.\n  The fiscal problems of our Nation have been painfully documented. Our \nGovernment continues on annual deficit binges that have pushed our \ntotal deficit past $4.7 trillion. For years now, we have been toying \nwith freezes, asset sales, and sham summits, but the deficit and debt \ncontinue to grow.\n  The American taxpayer, as well as the Congress, have grown weary of \nthe smoke and mirrors and are past ready for new measures that will \nhelp to put our country back in the black. If every there was a problem \nthat needed to be attacked from every particular angle, it is this \ndeficit.\n  Mr. President, I welcome President Clinton's strong support for the \nline-item veto initiative and his continuing resolve to attack the \nburgeoning deficit monster. In order to hold him to that commitment, we \nshould send him into battle well armed. By restoring accountability and \nresponsibility throughout the appropriations process, the line-item \nveto would force Members of Congress and the President to stop fixing \nthe blame and start fixing the problem.\n  In order to provide greater flexibility in the legislative process, \nthis legislation provides that each item shall be enrolled as a \nseparate bill and sent to the President for his approval. Therefore, \neach item of an appropriations bill would be subject to veto or \napproval, just like any other bill, and the override provisions found \nin article I of the Constitution would apply in the case of a veto. An \nitem is defined as any numbered section and any unnumbered paragraph of \nan appropriations bill. The enrolling clerk would merely break an \nappropriations bill down into its component parts and send each \nseparately enrolled provision to the President.\n  Finally, this legislation also contains a 2-year sunset provision \nallowing for a reasonable testing period and requiring an evaluation of \nthe line-item veto's success. I have no question but that it will be \ndemonstrated to be a modest, but effective, method of restraining \nfiscal profligacy. I hope that Senators will join me in this effort, \nand I ask unanimous consent the full text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 238\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That (a) \n     the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 is amended by adding at \n     the end thereof the following new title:\n\n  ``TITLE XI--SEPARATE ENROLLMENT AUTHORITY LEGISLATIVE LINE ITEM VETO\n\n       ``Sec. 1101.

A bill to require certain Federal agencies to protect the \nright of private property owners, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                 private property owners bill of rights\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to address \nthe continued deterioration of individual property rights. \nEnvironmental regulations are increasingly interfering with the ability \nof private property owners to use and develop their land. Contrary to \npopular belief, protecting the property rights of individuals and \nprotecting our environment are not mutually exclusive principles.\n  All too often, I hear stories that landowners are being deprived of \nthe ability to build a house because the Corps of Engineers has \ndesignated their property as a wetland; or the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService has prohibited cultivation of land for fear it might jeopardize \nan endangered species. A landowner may even be required to pay \nexorbitant mitigation fees or fines in order to regain the use of their \nproperty. That is, of course, if they are lucky enough to regain the \nright to use their property.\n  Not only does the enforcement of such land use statutes abuse the \nrights of the property rights owners, but they impose the cost of \nenforcing these public goods on individual owners rather than the \npublic at large. If the land is regulated in the name of a public good, \nsurely we can distribute the cost among the public as well.\n  The mounting cases regarding regulatory takings necessitate \nCongressional action. The Domenigoni family experience is a good \nexample. Cindy and Andy Domenigoni are fifth generation farmers in \nRiverside County, CA. First cultivated in 1879, their farm has \ntraditionally been home to the Stephen's kangaroo rat, which was listed \nas an endangered species in 1988.\n  In 1990, Fish and Wildlife Service officials ordered them to stop \ncultivating their 800 tillable acres and warned them that disking this \nland would warrant their arrest. Punishment for disking land that had \nbeen cultivated for the previous 100 years would now result in jail \ntime, a $50,000 fine, or both.\n  As a result, the Domenigonis' land lain idle, producing no crops for \n4 years. They lost $75,000 in foregone \n[[Page S1074]] crops each year and incurred another $100,000 loss in \nbiological consultation fees, legal fees, and other costs associated \nwith fighting this regulatory taking.\n  Ironically, on November 1, 1993, shortly after devastating southern \nCalifornia fires destroyed thousands of acres of kangaroo rat habitat, \nFWS biologist John Bradley determined that the rats had left the area \nbefore the fire, because the years of leaving the fields fallow had \nmade the brush and weeds grow too thick for the rats.\n  I must say this kind of policy is reckless and haphazard. When \nelected to the Senate, we had to take an oath to uphold the \nConstitution of the United States. I do not believe confiscating the \neconomic value of ones property would be considered upholding the \nConstitution. Indeed, I believe most would agree that such action is \nnothing less than the taking of property without compensation.\n  In another case, Mr. and Mrs. Howard Heck were denied building on \ntheir 25 acres of land because a federally threatened plant species was \n``within 5 miles of the proposed project site.'' Mr. Heck has said, \n``We were proud to be Americans in a land where * * *  our children \nwere to have the opportunity to achieve any goal we wanted. Now we are \nashamed of our country and Government that allows the bureaucrats to \nsteal from its citizens * * *.''\n  I, too, am ashamed the Government in this Nation can effectively \nsteal the economic value of one's land and rob this elderly couple of \ntheir dignity and peace during their remaining years on this Earth.\n  In still another instance, a Corps field agent to the regional chief \nof enforcement signed a memo stating a particular family in Maine, \n``would be a good one to squash and set an example * * *.''\n  The Government of the United States of America has no business \n``squashing'' hard working Americans or plundering away their wealth. \nThe very reason the Constitution was established was to protect \nindividuals, not to harm them. The atrocities previously mentioned need \nto be addressed with a clearly defined policy for Federal agencies in \norder to stop the abuse of Government bureaucrats.\n  The two laws most responsible for imposing the heavy burden on \nproperty ownership are the Endangered Species Act and section 404 of \nthe Clean Water Act.\n  Although the intention of these acts is commendable, they have \ncreated perverse incentives for private property ownership. Individuals \nare reluctant to develop or build on land for fear the Fish and \nWildlife Service, the Corps of Engineers or the EPA will soon visit. A \nvisit from the IRS is more welcome than a visit from these Federal \nagencies.\n  The negative impact of these perverse incentives directly affect the \nhousing and agricultural industries as well as many others. Every house \nthat is not built and every farm that is not cultivated costs us jobs. \nNot only do the present policies crush an individual's hopes and \ndreams, but it hinders those still trying to achieve them.\n  As a result of the inequities in the current policies, Senator \nNickles and I are reintroducing legislation entitled the, ``Private \nProperty Owners Bill of Rights.'' This bill would insure that private \nproperty owners are protected by the Federal Government, its employees, \nagents, and representatives.\n  Our bill requires notice and consent from property owners before \nFederal agencies and their agents can enter a private property owners \nland for purposes of the Endangered Species Act or wetlands laws.\n  In addition, this legislation ensures that property owners rights are \nconsidered and respected when agency decisions or actions are taken \npursuant to these two laws by providing an administrative appeals \nprocess. The process calls for the owner to be given access to the \ninformation collected, a description of the way the information was \ncollected, and an opportunity to discuss the accuracy of the \ninformation.\n  Lastly, and most importantly, it requires the agency itself to \ndetermine whether a taking has occurred and if so to compensate the \nprivate property owner for the loss in fair market value of the \nproperty. A property owner who is deprived of at least 20 percent or \nmore of the fair market value of $10,000 or more is entitled to receive \ncompensation. The agency would be required to pay the fair market value \nof the property if purchased or the difference between the fair market \nvalue of the property without the restrictions and the fair market \nvalue of the property with restrictions.\n  I believe our legislation addresses the serious problem of property \nrights abuse. It will enhance the foundation necessary for contracts \nand commerce and in doing so, will foster an environment essential to \nachieving the American Dream.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and \nsupport this cause on behalf of every property owner in America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be listed as \noriginal cosponsors of this legislation: Senator Nickles, Senator \nBurns, Senator Hutchison, Senator Lott, Senator Packwood, Senator \nPressler, Senator Inhofe, Senator Thomas, and Senator Brown.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, of all the freedoms we enjoy in this \ncountry, the ability to own, care for, and develop private property is \nperhaps the most crucial to our free enterprise economy. In fact, our \neconomy would cease to function without the incentives provided by \nprivate property. So sacred and important are these rights, that our \nforefathers chose to specifically protect them in the fifth amendment \nto the U.S. Constitution, which says in part, ``nor shall private \nproperty be taken for public use, without just compensation.''\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, some Federal environmental, safety, and \nhealth laws are encouraging Government violation of private property \nrights, and it is a problem which is increasing in severity and \nfrequency. we would all like to believe the Constitution will protect \nour property rights if they are threatened, but today that is simply \nnot true. The only way for a person to protect their private property \nrights is in the courts, and far too few people have the time or money \nto take such action. Thus many citizens lose their fifth amendment \nrights simply because no procedures have been established to prevent \nGovernment takings.\n  Mr. President, many people in the Federal bureaucracy believe that \npublic protection of health, safety, and the environment is not \ncompatible with protection of private property rights. I disagree. In \nfact, the terrible environmental conditions exposed in Eastern Europe \nwhen the cold war ended lead me to believe that property ownership \nenhances environmental protection. As the residents of East Berlin and \nPrague know all too well, private owners are more effective caretakers \nof the environment than communist governments.\n  Yet the question remains, how do we prevent overzealous bureaucrats \nfrom using their authority in ways which threaten property rights?\n  Mr. President, today I rise to join my colleague Senator Richard \nShelby of Alabama in introducing legislation which will strengthen \nevery citizen's fifth amendment rights. Our bill, the Private Property \nOwners Bill of Rights, targets two of the worst property rights \noffenders, the Endangered Species Act and the wetlands permitting \nprogram established by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.\n  Mr. President, our bill requires Federal agents who enter private \nproperty to gather information under either the Endangered Species Act \nor the wetlands permitting program to first obtain the written consent \nof the landowner. While it is difficult to believe that such a basic \nright should need to be spelled out in law, overzealous bureaucrats and \nenvironmental radicals too often mistake private resources as their \nown. Property owners are also guaranteed the right of access to that \ninformation, the right to dispute its accuracy, and the right of an \nadministrative appeal from decisions made under those laws.\n  Most importantly, the Private Property Owners Bill of Rights \nguarantees compensation for a landowner whose property is devalued by \n50 percent or more by a Federal action under the Endangered Species Act \nor wetlands permitting program. An administrative process is \nestablished to give property owners a simple and inexpensive way to \nseek resolution of their takings \n[[Page S1075]] claims. If we are to truly live up to the requirements \nof our Constitution, Mr. President, we must make this commitment. I \nbelieve this provision will work both to protect landowners from \nuncompensated takings and to discourage Government actions which would \ncause such takings.\n  Mr. President, the time has come for farmers, ranchers, and other \nlandowners to take a stand against violations of their private property \nrights by the Federal bureaucracy. The Private Property Owners Bill of \nRights will help landowners take that stand.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I join my colleague from Alabama, \nSenator Shelby in introducing a bill which would protect individual's \nprivate property rights.\n  This bill, the Private Property Owners Bill of Rights, would provide \na consistent Federal policy to encourage, support, and promote the \nprivate ownership of property and to ensure the constitutional and \nlegal rights of private property owners.\n  Private property rights are protected by the fifth amendment of the \nConstitution. Yet, many laws have been encroaching further and further \non this right. The bill we are introducing today is very important to \nMontana because it makes the Federal Government respect and protect \nprivate property rights when enforcing the Endangered Species Act and \nthe Clean Water Act. Montana's private property owners have been \ngreatly impacted by these two laws.\n  In Montana a couple years ago, I saw a headline which read ``Judge \nSays Grizzlies Have `People Rights'.'' This article ran in an \nagriculture trade publication. The story was about John Shuler of \nChoteau who shot a grizzly bear in 1989 after he found three of these \nbears in his sheep pen. He originally fired the shot to scare the bears \naway, but when one bear charged him, he was forced to shoot that bear. \nFor those who may not be aware, the grizzly is protected under the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  The judge ruled that the Endangered Species Act's self-defense \nexception must meet the same requirements used in criminal law for \nhumans. The judge then ruled that since this rancher had stepped off \nhis porch, to protect his investment, he ``Purposefully placed himself \nin the zone of imminent danger of a bear attack''. According to this \njudge, the rancher didn't have the right to protect his property. \nFolks, that's wrong.\n  The Private Property Owners Bill of Rights would create an \nadministrative appeals process for affected property owners. And the \nbill establishes a framework so private property holders can seek and \nobtain compensation.\n  In addition, before a Government official can enter private land, \nthey must have consent from the land owner. If information is collected \non private property, this information cannot be used unless the private \nindividual has full access to the information and has the right to \ndispute the accuracy of the information. The bill also establishes the \nright to administratively appeal decisions regarding wetlands and \ncritical habitat of a listed species.\n  Montanans believe that protecting private property is of utmost \nimportance. And this bill reinforces the Government's responsibility to \nprotect property rights and will help get the Federal Government off \nthe backs of Montana's working men and women.\n  I believe strongly in every American's private property rights and \nthis bill should be signed into law.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Hatch, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Mr. Bennett, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Lott, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Mack, Mr. Johnston, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Burns, Mr. \n        Chafee, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Helms, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Craig Thomas, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, Mr. Santorum, and Mr. Pell):\n  S. 240. A bill to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to \nestablish a filing deadline and to provide certain safeguards to ensure \nthat the interests of investors are well protected under the implied \nprivate action provisions of the Act; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n          the private securities litigation reform act of 1995\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I introduce a bill on behalf of \nSenator Dodd, myself and 15 other Senators on both sides of the aisle \nwhich will return some fairness and common sense to our broken \nsecurities class action litigation system. The system as it currently \noperates encourages the quick filing of frivolous complaints by \nentrepreneurial class action attorneys, and costs businesses countless \namounts of time and money to defend against and settle these strike \nsuits. In cases of real fraud, the system often leaves injured \ninvestors with pennies on the dollar for their losses, while \nplaintiffs' lawyers take a substantial amount of the settlement. In \nshort, the current securities litigation system rarely benefits anyone \nexcept for plaintiffs' attorneys, and victimizes innocent companies and \ninvestors.\n  The list of companies that have been hit with frivolous securities \nsuits reads like the who's who of high growth, high-technology \nbusinesses. In fact, 19 of the 30 largest companies in Silicon Valley \nhave been sued since 1988. They are the backbone of our economy and the \nfoundation of our ability to compete in the new global marketplace. \nDuring 2 days of hearings on securities litigation conducted by Senator \nDodd back in 1993, we heard from CEO's who had been involved in \nfrivolous securities class actions first hand. Their testimony \nindicated that:\n  Companies get sued when their stock price drops.\n  Companies also get sued by shareholders for settling securities \nsuits.\n  Frivolous litigation is time consuming and distracts CEO's and other \ncorporate officers from economically productive activity.\n  Defending a securities lawsuit often is as costly as starting up a \nnew product line.\n  The general counsel for the Intel Corp. testified that if Intel had \nbeen sued when it was a start-up company, that such a suit probably \nwould have bankrupted the company before it invented the microchip. We \ncannot afford to allow the current system to snuff out this sort of \ninnovation.\n  Frivolous litigation also adversely affects investors by drawing \nscarce resources away from productive activity, which is then reflected \nin a company's stock price. Arthur Levitt, Chairman of the Securities \nand Exchange Commission, stated in testimony before the House in August \n1994, that ``when issuers and others pay substantial sums to deal with \nfrivolous lawsuits, significant costs are imposed on the process of \ncapital-raising and on business, costs that ultimately will be borne by \nall shareholders''.\n  Instead we must put a stop to the race-to-the-courthouse game played \nby plaintiffs' class action attorneys, in which they file lawsuits \nwithin hours of news that a company came up short on an earnings \nprojection or will be forced to delay the introduction of a new product \nline. Information provided to the Senate Securities Subcommittee by the \nNational Association of Securities and Commercial Law Attorneys \n[NASCAT] suggests that 56 percent of the class actions that they hand-\npicked to provide to the subcommittee were filed within 30 days of a \ntriggering event, like a missed earnings projection. Twenty-one percent \nof the cases were filed within 48 hours of the triggering. The stock \nprice drops and class action suits are filed quickly with little due \ndiligence done to\n investigate each of the elements necessary for a successful 10b-5 \ncase.\n\n  Many academics and those familiar with our securities class action \nsystem also agree that the securities litigation system encourages the \nfiling of frivolous suits. Jonathan Macey, a law professor at Cornell \nUniversity believes that most securities class actions are frivolous. \n``The facts show that every time a firm's share price drops by enough \nthat it's profitable for plaintiffs' lawyers to bring a lawsuit, they \ndo'', he said recently. Janet Cooper Alexander at Stanford University \nhas proven that most class actions are settled without regard to \nwhether the case has merit. Chairman Levitt has acknowledged that \n``virtually all securities class actions are settled for some fraction \nof the claimed damages, and some allege that settlements often fail to \nreflect the underlying merits of the cases. If true, this means that \nweak claims are overcompensated and strong claims are \nundercompensated.''\n  [[Page S1076]] In case you don't believe that class action attorneys \nare filing frivolous suits, take a look at the article the Wall Street \nJournal ran last week on January 11th. It provides an excellent example \nof the cookie-cutter complaints which often form the basis of these \nmillion dollar lawsuits. It documents a case against Philip Morris \nfiled within 48 hours of the company's announcement of a price cut on \none of its brands of cigarettes. The case was dismissed after the judge \nnoticed that the plaintiffs' attorneys had filed two separate suits \nwhich alleged that Philip Morris had engaged in fraud to create and \nprolong the illusion of their success in the toy industry. As you might \nwell know, Philip Morris doesn't make toys.\n  But this is how the current system works. Plaintiffs' lawyers race to \nthe courthouse, file frivolous suits without any research into their \nvalidity, and companies normally may pay something to make them go \naway. Because usually, plaintiffs' lawyers don't make the glaring \nmistake they made in the Philip Morris case and forget to delete the \nword toy from their complaint. Judges rarely dismiss these cases \nwithout such a blunder. Companies continue to get sued and are forced \nto settle frivolous cases. Our bill will eliminate these poorly \nresearched, kitchen sink complaints.\n  Plaintiffs' lawyers often sue not only the issuer company, but their \nofficers and directors, accountants, lawyers, and underwriters. These \ncases are brought under joint and severable liability, which means that \nany one defendant could be made to pay the entire judgment even if he \nor she was only marginally responsible. This increases the pressure to \nsettle even the most frivolous cases.\n  Our bill adopts the State law trend of imposing proportionate \nliability, liability according to relative fault. Our bill retains \njoint severable liability for the really bad actors, but provides \nproportionate liability for those parties only incidentally involved. \nHowever, our bill contains a provision which deals with the problem of \ninsolvent defendants and small investors. We believe that this \nprovision strikes the correct balance and returns fairness to the \nsystem.\n  Our bill also allows for alternative dispute resolution as an \nalternative to costly and time consuming litigation. One reason these \ncases settle regardless of the merits is that it costs so much to get \nthrough what lawyers call discovery, the process of exchanging \ninformation before a trial. By allowing for ADR, we hope to reduce \nthose costs. Our bill also requires specificity in pleading securities \nfraud, a requirement imposed on every other fraud action under rule \n9(b) of the Federal rules. This provision will reduce the number of \nfishing expedition lawsuits, like the one in the Philip Morris case.\n  Even in cases of real fraud, the current system allows investors to \nrecover on average about 6 cents on the dollar, while plaintiffs' \nlawyers take on average between 30 and 33 percent of the settlement \nfund. One plaintiffs' class action lawyer boasted in Forbes magazine \nthat securities class action cases are a great practice because there \nare no clients. Yet these clientless lawyers claim to be acting in the \nbest interests of the class.\n  Once a settlement is reached, the entrepreneurial lawyer with no \nclients becomes an adversary of the plaintiffs' class. The lawyers' \ninterest shifts to protecting the settlement. ``At its worst, the \nsettlement process may amount to a covert exchange of a cheap \nsettlement for a high award of attorney's fees'', according to John \nCoffee of Columbia University. Professor Coffee also has noted that \nplaintiffs' attorneys in many securities class actions appear to ``sell \nout their clients in return for an overly generous fee award''.\n  Under our bill, plaintiffs' lawyers will no longer be able to sell \nout their clients for huge fee awards. Our bill allows judges to \nappoint a plaintiff steering committee or guardian ad litem at the \nrequest of the class to ensure that the attorneys act in the best \ninterests of their clients. Clients, not lawyers, will be in charge of \nthe litigation, and will be able to make the important decisions like \nwhen to settle, when to dismiss their attorneys or when to proceed to \ntrial.\n  Our bill also eliminates pet plaintiff fees, bonus awards plaintiffs' \nattorneys pay to individuals to act as class representatives, \nregardless of the number of shares they own or the amount of their \nactual losses. These fees reduce the amount of recovery available to \nthe class as a whole and serve no purpose but to give attorneys an \navailable stable of plaintiffs willing to sue at a moment's notice in \nexchange for a big payoff. This practice undermines the fairness of the \nsystem and should be eliminated.\n  Out current securities class action system obviously is broken and \nneeds the types of reforms Senator Dodd and I have proposed in this \nbill. Too many cases are pursued for the purpose of extracting \nsettlements from corporations and other parties without regard to their \nmerits. The business community is powerless to deal with these suits, \nand companies settle rather than bet the company. These settlements \nyield large fees for plaintiffs' lawyers but compensate investors only \nfor a fraction of their actual losses.\n  We reject the notion that stock price volatility is fraud. \nPlaintiffs' lawyers must be made to stop, think, investigate, and \nresearch before they file these potentially devastating suits. Truly \ndefrauded investors must have greater control over their litigation and \nreceive a greater share of the settlement fund.\n  The spirit motivating this bill is the obligation that Chairman \nLevitt has identified: ``to make sure that current system operates in \nthe best interest of all investors. This means focusing not just on the \ninterests of those who happen to be aggrieved in a particular case, but \nalso on the interests of issuers and the markets as a whole''.\n  I would like to commend Senator Dodd for tackling the difficult \nissue. Under his leadership in the last Congress, we developed a \nsubstantial hearing record in the Securities Subcommittee and collected \nas many facts and opinions as we could. This bill is the product of a \ngreat deal of work and deliberation, and I want to express my gratitude \nfor the way he and his staff went about developing this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Wall Street Journal \narticle I mentioned earlier be printed in the Record. I also ask \nunanimous consent that a section-by-section description of the bill and \nthe bill text itself be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 240\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Litigation Abuses and Investor Control\n\n       Plaintiffs' lawyers often race each other to the courthouse \n     in order to be the first to file a case and win control over \n     the case and any resulting legal fees. In some instances \n     plaintiffs' lawyers and defendants tacitly agree to settle a \n     case for a small amount with little regard to whether the \n     case is strong or weak, in order to assure payment to \n     plaintiffs' \n     [[Page S1085]] counsel. In addition, lawyers have filed \n     securities cases without having a real client, or have sued \n     based simply based on a price drop, without bothering to \n     investigate whether any wrongdoing might have occurred.\n       The bill addresses these abuses by ensuring that investors, \n     not lawyers, decide whether to bring a case, whether to \n     settle, and how much the lawyers should receive. It also \n     contains provisions intended to ensure that lawyers look at \n     the facts before they sue:\n       The bill requires courts to appoint a plaintiff steering \n     committee or a guardian to directly control lawyers for the \n     class.\n       The bill requires that notices of settlement agreements \n     sent to investors spell out clearly important facts such as \n     how much investors are giving up by settling, and how much \n     their lawyers will receive in the settlement.\n       The bill requires that courts tie awards of lawyers' fees \n     directly to how much is recovered by investors, rather than \n     simply how many hours the lawyers billed or how many pages of \n     briefs they filed.\n       The bill establishes an alternative dispute resolution \n     procedure to make it easier to prosecute a case without the \n     necessity of slow and expensive federal court proceedings.\n       The bill requires that in order to bring a securities case \n     as a class action, the plaintiffs in whose name the case is \n     brought must have held either 1 per cent of the securities \n     which are the subject of the litigation or $10,000 worth of \n     securities. This should help stop a problem pointed to by \n     several courts, in which ``professional\n      plaintiffs'' who own small amounts of stock in many \n     companies try to bring class action lawsuits whenever one \n     of their investments goes down.\n       The bill clarifies how a lawyer should plead a securities \n     fraud claim. Plaintiffs' lawyers should have no trouble \n     meeting these standards if they have legitimate cases and \n     have looked at the facts.\n       These provisions should ensure that defrauded investors can \n     recover damages more quickly, with less of their recovery \n     drained off in lawyers' fees.\n\n\n            2. securities litigation and financial reporting\n\n       Certain professional, like accountants, are singled out \n     under the current litigation system simply because they are a \n     deep pocket. Their liability exposure under the current \n     system could drive them away from providing auditing services \n     to many companies, especially new companies and ``high tech'' \n     companies. The bill establishes a liability system for less \n     culpable defendants that is more fair and is linked to degree \n     of fault. Defendants who have acted egregiously would still \n     be fully liable. Plaintiffs who have a net worth of less than \n     $200,000 and lose more than 10 percent of their net worth.\n       At the same time, the bill establishes a self-disciplinary \n     organization for accountants under the direct supervision of \n     the SEC. This entity would be somewhat like self-regulatory \n     organizations such as the New York Stock Exchange or the \n     National Association of Securities Dealers. The net effect \n     should be a more direct and rational way of dealing with \n     ``bad apples'' in the accounting profession without punishing \n     the entire profession.\n       The bill also contains a provision which gives companies \n     more freedom to make forward-looking statements in good \n     faith. This responds to concerns expressed by many companies \n     that litigation ``chills'' voluntary predictive statements \n     about a company's future economic performance, even though \n     that is exactly the sort of information that is good for \n     investors and the market.\n\n\n                    3. enhancing deterrence of fraud\n\n       The bill extends the statute of limitations for implied \n     actions to five years from the date of the violation, or two \n     years after the violation was discovered or should have been \n     discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence. The \n     bill also incorporates pending legislation concerning the \n     responsibility of auditors to search for and report fraud. A \n     similar bill in the House is supported by the SEC and the \n     AICPA.\n                                                                    ____\n\nSection-by-Section Analysis of the Private Securities Litigation Reform \n                              Act of 1995\n\n\n                 title i--private securities litigation\n\n                         Section 1. Short Title\n\n       Section 1 provides that the title of this Act shall be the \n     ``Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the \n     ``Act'').\n\n         Section 101--Elimination of Certain Abusive Practices\n\n       Section 101 amends the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 \n     (the ``Exchange Act'') by adding new paragraphs to Sections \n     15(c) and 21 of the Exchange Act. Section 101 eliminates \n     certain litigation practices.\n       Subsection 101(a) amends Section 15(c) of the Exchange Act. \n     Subsection 101(a) prohibits brokers or dealers from \n     soliciting or accepting compensation from attorneys for \n     assisting them in obtaining the representation of any \n     customer of the broker or dealer in an implied action.\n       Subsection 101(b) amends Section 21(d) of the Exchange Act \n     to prevent distribution of funds disgorged pursuant to an \n     action by the Securities and Exchange Commission \n     (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') as attorneys' fees or expenses \n     unless otherwise ordered by the court.\n       Subsection 101(c) amends Section 21 of the Exchange Act and \n     adds seven new subsections. New subparagraph (i) of Section \n     21 requires that the named plaintiffs of the class action be \n     compensated in the same manner as other members of the class. \n     This provision is not intended to bar reasonable compensation \n     of such plaintiffs out of any common fund established for the \n     class for costs and expenses relating to representation of \n     the class, such as lost wages or out-of-pocket expenses \n     incurred due to deposition or trial testimony.\n       New subparagraph (j) requires a court to determine whether \n     an attorney who owns or has a beneficial interest in the \n     securities that are the subject of the litigation may \n     represent the class or whether such ownership or interest \n     constitutes a conflict of interest which would disqualify the \n     attorney.\n       New subparagraph (k) prohibits settlements under seal \n     except by motion of one or more of the settling parties if \n     those parties can show good cause why the court should file \n     under seal. ``Good cause'' exists only if publication of a \n     term or provision of the settlement would cause direct and \n     substantial harm to any person. This subparagraph is \n     necessary because it is not always possible to\n      determine the outcome of class action cases. Since class \n     action litigation is imbued with a public purpose, \n     information concerning the terms on which such cases are \n     settled should be publicly available in most instances.\n       New subparagraph (l) requires courts to determine \n     attorneys' fees as a percentage of the amount of damages and \n     prejudgment interest actually recovered by the class as a \n     result of the attorneys' efforts. The amount awarded to class \n     counsel cannot exceed a reasonable percentage of the amount \n     recovered by the class plus reasonable expenses. This \n     provision is intended to encourage courts to link the amount \n     of attorneys' fee awarded to the result achieved for the \n     class and the degree of skill and effort required to achieve \n     that result.\n       New subparagraph (m) requires proposed settlement \n     agreements distributed to the class to contain certain \n     information. Subpart (1)(A) requires that if the settling \n     parties agree on the amount of damages which the plaintiff \n     class would recover if the class prevailed in litigation, and \n     if they agree on the likelihood that the class could prevail, \n     the notice should contain a brief statement about the \n     potential damages per share, a statement concerning the \n     probability that the plaintiff would prevail on the claims \n     alleged, and a brief explanation of the reasons for that \n     conclusion. Subpart (B) requires that if the settling parties \n     do not agree on the amount of damages that would be \n     recoverable by the plaintiff on each alleged claim, or on the \n     probability that the plaintiff would prevail on the claims \n     alleged, the notice must contain a brief statement by each \n     party containing the elements specified in subparagraph (A), \n     concerning the issues on which the parties disagree. If any \n     of the settling parties or their counsel intend to apply to \n     the court for attorneys' fees or costs from any fund to be \n     established under the settlement, subpart (2) requires a \n     statement concerning the amount of fees and costs to be \n     sought by each such party or attorney, and a brief \n     explanation of the reasons for the application. Subpart (3) \n     requires the settlement agreement to contain the name, \n     address and telephone number of a representative of counsel \n     for the plaintiff class who will be reasonably available to \n     answer class members' questions on any matter contained in \n     the notice of settlement distributed to class members. \n     Subpart (4) permits the court, or a guardian ad litem or \n     plaintiff steering committee apointed by the court in \n     accordance with new Section 38 of the Exchange Act, to \n     require additional information in the notice sent to class \n     members.\n       New subparagraph (n) requires the court to submit to the \n     jury a written interrogatory on the issue of each defendant's \n     state of mind at the time of the alleged violation. This \n     provision applies only in actions in which the plaintiff, in \n     order to recover money damages, must prove that the defendant \n     acted with some degree of intent.\n       New subparagraph (o) requires that any plaintiffs who wish \n     to obtain certification as representatives of a class of \n     investors must collectively have owned during the period in \n     which the violations occurred the lesser of 1 percent or \n     $10,000 market value of the securities which are the subject \n     matter of the litigation. This requirement is comparable to a \n     rule of the SEC concerning the minimum holding required in \n     order to seek to place a shareholder proposal on an issuer's \n     proxy statement.\\1\\ However, that rule differs in that it \n     applies to shareholders who own the lesser of 1 percent of \n     the securities or $1,000 market value of the securities, and \n     it also contains minimum holding period requirements which \n     are not included in this bill.\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Class certification is a significant step in many \n     securities cases, because it places a small group of \n     investors in charge of claims asserted on behalf of a much \n     larger group. This may create an incentive for plaintiffs \n     with nominal claims to seek class certification as a means of \n     coercing other parties into settlement. Moreover, some cases \n     have called attention to investors who appear to buy small \n     amounts of stock in a number of companies with the apparent \n     intent of using those investments to mount class action \n     lawsuits.\\2\\\n       The purpose of this provision is to create a minimum \n     ``standing'' requirement for securities class actions in \n     order to ensure that \n     [[Page S1086]] the representatives of investor class members \n     are not individuals who have only a nominal interest in the \n     outcome of the litigation. This provision does not create any \n     obstacle to filing a lawsuit as a class action, but simply \n     addresses the standard for certifying a particular group of \n     plaintiffs as investor class representatives.\n\nSection 102--Alternative Dispute Resolution Procedure; Time Limitation \n                      on Private Rights of Action\n\n       Subsection 102(a) amends the Exchange Act by adding a new \n     Section 36, which creates an alternative dispute resolution \n     procedure for securities litigation under Rule 10(b) of the \n     Exchange Act. The section allows any party to offer to \n     proceed pursuant to any voluntary nonbinding ADR procedure \n     established or recognized by the courts within the time \n     period for answering the complaint, or, in cases certified as \n     class actions, within 30 days after a guardian ad litem or \n     plaintiff steering committee is appointed. The court may \n     extend the period for responding to an ADR offer for up to 90 \n     days to permit discovery.\n       If the courts recognize more than one type of ADR, the \n     parties may stipulate to the type of ADR to be used. If the \n     parties cannot agree, the court must decide within 20 days \n     which method of ADR the parties will use. If any party \n     engages in dilatory or obstructive conduct during the \n     response period, the court may extend the discovery period, \n     deny the party further discovery or impose reasonable fees \n     and costs upon the party.\n       Should any party reject an offer to proceed via ADR, or \n     refuse to abide by the result of an ADR proceeding, that \n     party can exercise its right to litigate the case in federal \n     court. However, the subsection requires the court to award \n     fees and costs against that party if the court enters \n     judgment against the party and the party asserted a claim or \n     defense which was not substantially justified. As with \n     Section 36(a), this fee-shifting provision would not apply to \n     a named plaintiff in a class action case if he or she had \n     never owned more than $1,000,000 of the securities that are \n     the subject of the dispute.\n       The purpose of this section is to create a stronger \n     incentive to use ADR in multi-party securities litigation. \n     Greater use of ADR should result in faster recoveries for \n     defrauded investors, and should also result in smaller \n     attorneys' fees for all parties.\\3\\\n       Subsection 102(b) adds a new Section 37 to the Exchange \n     Act. Section 37(a) creates a new limitations period for \n     implied private rights of action under the Exchange Act. The \n     subsection requires implied private rights of action to be \n     brought not later than the earlier of five years after the \n     violation occurred or two years after the violation was \n     discovered or should have been discovered through the \n     exercise of reasonable diligence. Subsection 38(b) requires \n     the new limitations\n      period to apply to all proceedings pending on or commenced \n     after the date its enactment.\n\n   Section 103--Guardians Ad Litem and Plaintiff Steering Committees\n\n       Section 103 adds a new Section 38 to the Exchange Act. \n     Section 38 requires courts to ensure that a plaintiff class \n     has adequate control over its attorneys by either appointing \n     a guardian ad litem when a plaintiff class is certified, or \n     creating a plaintiff steering committee in securities class \n     actions to give the class greater control over the lawsuit.\n       Section 38(a) requires courts to appoint a guardian ad \n     litem within 10 days of certifying a plaintiff class. The \n     guardian ad litem is to direct counsel for the plaintiff \n     class or perform such other functions as the court may \n     specify. The guardian ad litem is to be selected from one or \n     more lists submitted by the parties or their counsel. The \n     guardian's reasonable fees and expenses are to be apportioned \n     by the court among the parties. In doing so, the Court may \n     permit the guardian to recover his or her reasonable fees and \n     expenses from any fund established for the benefit of the \n     class, but the guardian is to recover reasonable fees and \n     expenses whether or not such a fund is established. This \n     should prevent any possibility that the guardian might have a \n     financial interest in supporting or opposing a settlement \n     offer. This provision also states that appointment of a \n     guardian shall not be subject to interlocutory review.\n       Section 38(b) permits the Court, as an alternative to \n     appointing a guardian ad litem, appoints a steering committee \n     of class members within 10 days after class certification, \n     with the same powers as a guardian. Appointment of the \n     committee is also not subject to interlocutory review.\n       Section 38(c) provides that the plaintiff steering \n     committee shall consist of at least 5 willing class members \n     who the court believes will fairly represent the class. \n     Committee members must have cumulatively held the lesser of 5 \n     per cent of the securities which are the subject of the \n     litigation, or securities which are the subject of the \n     litigation with a market value of $10,000,000. ``Securities \n     which are the subject matter of the litigation'' means \n     securities which were held during any time period when the \n     class alleges that fraud was committed against any class \n     members. The $10,000,000 market value can be measured at any \n     time between the time when the class alleges that violations \n     first occurred until the date the class is certified. If the \n     court determines that appointment of a committee which meets \n     these requirements is impractical, the court may appoint a \n     committee which meets a smaller percentage test or dollar \n     amount test which the court believes is reasonable.\n       Under subsection 38(c)(2), named plaintiffs may serve on \n     the committee, but may not comprise a majority of the \n     committee. Under subsection 38(c)(3), committee members shall \n     serve without compensation, but may apply to the court for \n     reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses from any \n     common fund established for the class. This differs from the \n     compensation scheme for guardians, who can receive \n     compensation for their services. The reason for this \n     distinction from guardians is two-fold: Committee members \n     should be sufficiently motivated to serve on the Committee by \n     their economic interest in the litigation and by their desire \n     to obtain justice for themselves and other class members. \n     Second, since the Committee involves a larger number of \n     people than a single guardian, compensating the Committee \n     would be substantially more burdensome on the class and on \n     other parties than would compensating a guardian.\n       Under subsection 38(c)(4), the committee would conduct \n     previously scheduled meetings with at least a majority of \n     committee members present in person or by electronic \n     communication. All matters must be decided by majority vote \n     of all members, except decisions on matters other than \n     whether to accept or reject a settlement offer or to hire or \n     fire counsel. Those decisions may be delegated to one or more \n     members of the committee or voted upon by members seriatim, \n     without a meeting. Subsection 38(5) allows any class member \n     who is not a member of the committee to appear and be heard \n     by the court on any issue in the case.\n       Section 38(d) enumerates the functions of guardians ad \n     litem and plaintiff steering committees. Guardians and \n     Committees have the same powers permitted to clients in other \n     litigation, including the power to hire and fire counsel, \n     reject settlement offers and accept settlement offers, \n     pursuant to some restrictions. However, counsel dismissed \n     other than for cause would be able to enforce any contractual \n     fee agreement or to apply to the Court for a fee award from \n     any common fund established for the class. Section 38(d)(2) \n     allows the committee to give preliminary approval to \n     settlement offers and to seek approval of the settlement by a \n     majority of the class if the benefit of seeking such approval \n     outweighs the cost of soliciting approval from class members.\n       Section 38(e) provides that any person who is appointed as \n     a guardian ad litem or member of a plaintiff steering \n     committee shall be immune from any liability as a result of \n     such service. This immunity includes liability for breach of \n     fiduciary duty, liability under any provision of the Exchange \n     Act or any other federal statute or rule imposing sanctions \n     for conduct in the course of litigation, or any other action \n     taken in the course of acting as a fiduciary. This immunity \n     would not apply to any action taken by the former guardian or \n     committee member following resignation or removal by the \n     court.\n       Section 38(f) clarifies that this section does not override \n     any other provision relating to class actions or the \n     authority of the court to approve final settlements, such as \n     under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n         Section 104--Requirements for Securities Fraud Actions\n\n       Section 104 adds a new Section 39 to the Exchange Act. \n     Section 39 specifies certain pleading requirements for \n     implied actions, as well as damage calculations to be \n     utilized in securities fraud suits. The overall purpose of \n     this section is to provide a filter at the pleading stage to \n     screen out allegations that have no factual basis, to provide \n     a clearer statement of the plaintiff's claims, and to provide \n     greater clarity about the scope of the case. This section \n     should not provide any barrier to meritorious cases, although \n     in some instances it may require attorneys for plaintiffs to \n     exercise greater care in drafting their complaint. By \n     requiring more specificity in pleading, the amount of motions \n     to dismiss and the amount of discovery should be reduced. For \n     plaintiffs with strong cases, this should encourage faster \n     recoveries with less expenditure for attorneys' fees.\n       Section 39(a), which applies to implied actions in which \n     the plaintiff may recover money damages only on proof that \n     the defendant acted with some degree of intent, requires the \n     plaintiff to allege in its complaint specific facts \n     demonstrating why the plaintiff believes that each such \n     defendant had such an intent. Blanket assertions of intent \n     unconnected to any facts would be insufficient.\n       Section 39(b) requires that a plaintiff who alleges that \n     the defendant made an untrue statement of a material fact or \n     omitted to state a material fact necessary to make statements \n     made not misleading must specify in the complaint each \n     statement alleged to have been misleading, the reason or \n     reasons why the plaintiff believes the statement was \n     misleading, and, if an allegation regarding such statements \n     is made on information and belief, the plaintiff must state \n     all information on which his or her belief is formed.\n       Section 39(c) clarifies that in implied actions based on \n     the ``fraud in the market'' theory, while the plaintiff need \n     not show that he or she specifically relied on any alleged \n     misstatement or omission, plaintiff has the burden of showing \n     that the misstatement or omission caused the loss. This means \n     that plaintiff must establish that it was the defendant's \n     misstatement or omission, rather than some intervening \n     factor, which established the market price at \n     [[Page S1087]] which the plaintiff purchased or sold the \n     securities in question.\n       Subsection 39(d) sets out an upper limit for damage \n     calculations to be used in cases of material misstatements or \n     omissions where the plaintiff claims to have bought or sold \n     based upon the ``fraud on the market'' theory. Plaintiff's \n     damages in these cases may not exceed the lesser of (i) the \n     difference between the price paid by the plaintiff for the \n     security and the market value immediately after dissemination \n     to the market of information which corrects the misstatement \n     or omission, or (ii) the difference between the price paid by \n     the plaintiff for the security and the price at which the \n     plaintiff sold the security after dissemination of correcting \n     information. The purpose of this provision is to provide \n     greater certainty about the upper limit of damage exposure \n     for cases in which the range of possible damage calculations \n     tends to be substantial, leading to complex battles between \n     expert witnesses over damage estimates. This provision also \n     takes into account the fact that plaintiffs' damages are \n     sometimes mitigated when the stock price recovers soon after \n     an adverse announcement.\n\n    Section 105--Amendment to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt \n                           Organizations Act\n\n       Section 105 amends Section 1964(c) of Title 18 of the \n     United States Code (the ``Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt \n     Organization Act'' or ``RICO''). Section 106 eliminates \n     private actions for securities fraud under the ``civil RICO'' \n     provisions of Title 18.\n                     title II--financial disclosure\n\n        Section 201--Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements\n\n       Subsection 201(a) requires the SEC, in consultation with \n     investors and issuers of securities, to consider adopting or \n     amending rules, or making legislative recommendations, \n     concerning criteria which the Commission finds are \n     appropriate for the protection of investors, and which \n     issuers may rely upon to ensure that their forward-looking \n     statements concerning their future economic performance will \n     be deemed not to violate the Exchange Act. This provision \n     also requires the Commission to consider rule-making or \n     legislative recommendations for procedures by which courts \n     shall timely dismiss claims based on forward-looking \n     statements of issuers of such statements meet any criteria \n     set by the Commission pursuant to this subsection.\n       Subsection 201(b) amends the Exchange Act by adding a new \n     Section 40. Under new Section 40(a), an implied private \n     action under the Exchange Act alleging that a forward-looking \n     statement concerning the future economic performance of an \n     issuer was materially false or misleading, the court would be \n     required to grant a stay of discovery concerning the claims \n     or defenses of a party if that party made a motion for such a \n     stay in accordance with Section 40(b). Section 40(a) also \n     sets out certain matters to be considered by the Commission \n     in developing any such rules or legislative recommendations.\n       Section 40(b) states that such a stay shall apply in \n     connection with any motion for summary judgment made by a \n     defendant asserting that the forward-looking statement was \n     within the coverage of any rule of the Commission concerning \n     such statements. However, Section 40(b) requires that \n     plaintiff have at least 60 days to conduct discovery before \n     such a summary judgment motion is made. Section 40(c) permits \n     the court to extend the time for plaintiff to conduct \n     discovery, or to deny a stay of proceedings, if the party \n     making the motion engaged in dilatory or obstructive conduct, \n     or if a stay of discovery would be substantially unfair to \n     the plaintiff or any other party.\n\n              Section 202--Fraud Detection and Disclosure\n\n       Section 202(a) amends the Exchange Act to create a new \n     Section 10A. Section 10A would codify certain auditing \n     standards for the detection of financial fraud by auditors, \n     and would require auditors to report directly to the \n     Commission any financial fraud discovered during an audit \n     engagement. This provision also would shield auditors from \n     private liability for the contents of such a report. This \n     provision is substantially similar to H.R. 574 and S. 630, \n     both titled the ``Financial Fraud Detection and Disclosure \n     Act.''\n  Section 203. Proportionate Liability and Joint and Several Liability\n\n       Section 203(a) amends the Exchange Act to create a new \n     Section 41. Section 41(a) specifies that this provision only \n     applies to the allocation of damages among persons who are or \n     may become liable in an implied right of action under the \n     Exchange Act.\n       Section 41(b) applies joint and several liability against \n     primary wrongdoers, persons who commit knowing securities \n     fraud, and those who control any primary wrongdoer or person \n     who commits knowing securities fraud. Section 41(b)(2) \n     defines the terms ``primary wrongdoer'' and ``knowing \n     securities fraud.''\n       In cases where more than one person is found to have \n     contributed to an act of securities fraud, subsection 41(c) \n     requires the finder of fact to determine the degree of \n     responsibility of each party. The finder of fact must specify \n     the plaintiff's total amount of damages, and the degree of \n     responsibility of each defendant, measured as a percentage of \n     the total fault of all those liable for the violation. In \n     determining the degree of responsibility, the subsection \n     requires the finder of fact to consider the nature and \n     conduct of each person and the causal relationship between \n     the conduct and the plaintiff's damages.\n       Subsection 41(d) creates a system of proportionate \n     liability for those who are not jointly and severally liable \n     under section 41(b). Section 41(d) holds such defendants \n     liable for their proportionate share of damages. If a \n     plaintiff is unable to collect the proportionate share of any \n     defendant's liability within six months after the final \n     judgment, subsection 41(d) reallocates the uncollectible \n     share. If the plaintiff is an individual with a net worth of \n     under $200,000, and his or her recoverable damages are more \n     than 10 per cent of that net worth, all of the remaining \n     defendants are jointly and severally liable for all of the \n     plaintiff's damages.\n       Otherwise, where damages are uncollectible from one or more \n     defendants, the defendants as to whom proportionate liability \n     applies will be liable for their proportionate share of \n     plaintiff's damages, plus the greater of (i) their \n     proportionate share of the uncollectible damages, or (ii) \n     five times the amount which that defendant gained from the \n     conduct which gave rise to the liability. If the defendant \n     did not obtain a direct financial gain from its conduct, and \n     the conduct giving rise to its liability consisted of \n     deficient services, the latter measurement would be five \n     times the defendant's gross revenues from its entire economic \n     relationship with any other entity involved in the violation \n     during the calendar years in which the defendant provided \n     deficient services. Under Section 41(d)(4) and (5), \n     defendants who become liable for another defendant's \n     uncollectible share would have a right of contribution \n     against the defendant\n      originally liable for the payment or any other person \n     responsible for the fraudulent conduct.\n       Subsection 41(e) prevents disclosure of the formula for \n     allocation of damages and the procedure for reallocation of \n     uncollectible shares to the jury.\n       Subsection 41(f) provides that a defendant who enters into \n     a settlement of an implied right to action is discharged from \n     any claim for contribution by any other potential defendants. \n     This subsection also clarifies that a settlement prior to a \n     verdict or judgment shall reduce the verdict or judgment \n     against other defendants by the greater of (i) the amount \n     that corresponds to the settling person's degree of \n     responsibility, and (ii) the amount paid to the plaintiff by \n     that person.\n       Section 41(g) clarifies that contribution shall be \n     determined based on the degree of responsibility of the \n     claimant and each person against whom a right of contribution \n     is asserted. Subsection 41(h) requires liable defendants to \n     bring contribution actions within six months after the date \n     that the judgment against the defendant becomes final unless \n     the defendant made additional payments of uncollectible \n     liability under subsection 41(d). In cases where the \n     defendant made additional payments, the defendant must bring \n     the contribution action within six months after the \n     additional payment was made.\n       Section 203(b) provides that Section 41 shall only apply to \n     actions commenced after the enactment date of this Act.\n\n          Section 204--Public Auditing Self-Disciplinary Board\n\n       Section 204 amends the Exchange Act and adds a new Section \n     13A. Section 13A creates a self-disciplinary board for public \n     auditors.\n       Section 13A(a) supplies definitions for key terms to be \n     used throughout the section.\n       Subsection 13A(b) requires the SEC to establish a Public \n     Auditing Self-Disciplinary Board (``Board'') within 90 days \n     after the date of the enactment of section 13A. The \n     Commission shall designate an entity to serve as the Board if \n     control of such entity is vested in members of the Board \n     selected under Section 13A(c) and if the entity meets other \n     enumerated criteria.\n       Subsection 13A(c) specifies that the Board will be composed \n     of three SEC-appointed members and four elected members. For \n     the appointed members, the Chairman of the SEC shall make the \n     initial appointments in consultation with other members of \n     the Commission within ninety days after enactment. After\n      initial appointments, the Board will appoint members to fill \n     vacancies in these three slots, subject to SEC approval.\n       For elected members, subsection 13A(c)(1), paragraph (B) \n     requires that within 120 days after the 3 initial Board \n     members are appointed, if an entity has been designated as \n     the Board under Section 13A(b), that entity shall conduct an \n     election of 4 initial Board members. The election shall be \n     conducted under interim election rules proposed by the entity \n     and approved by the 3 appointed members and the Commission. \n     If no entity has been designated by the Commission under \n     Section 13A(b), the 3 appointed members shall adopt interim \n     rules providing for the election of the 4 initial elected \n     members. In either event, the election of the 4 elected \n     members shall occur within 120 days after the appointment of \n     the 3 initial members, the initial election shall be by \n     persons who are certified public accountants and who are \n     associated with public accounting firms, and the persons \n     elected shall be subject to approval by the Commission. After \n     the initial elections, elections for the 4 elected member \n     slots must be by persons associated with public accounting \n     firms who are certified public accountants, and the persons \n     elected are subject to SEC approval.\n       [[Page S1088]] Subsection 13A(c)(2) requires that four \n     members of the Board, including the Chairman, must not have \n     been associated with a public accounting firm during the 10-\n     year period preceding their appointment. Three of the elected \n     members are required to be associated with a public \n     accounting firm registered with the Board.\n       Subsection 13A(c)(3) requires the Chairman of the Board to \n     serve on a full-time basis, unless the SEC otherwise \n     authorizes, and to sever all business ties with his or her \n     former firms prior to serving on the Board.\n       Subsection 13A(c)(4) requires that each member of the Board \n     will serve a four-year term or until a successor is \n     appointed, whichever is later. However, those members \n     appointed to fill a vacancy created by a member's departure \n     prior to the expiration of her term will only be appointed \n     for the remainder of the term. Pursuant to section 13A(c)(4), \n     initially selected Board members' terms will expire on a \n     staggered basis until all initial members have been replaced \n     by members appointed according to the terms of the section.\n       Section 13A(c)(5) requires the Board to propose and adopt \n     rules providing for the administration and operation of the \n     Board, including appointment and election of members, the \n     selection of a chairperson, and compensation of Board \n     members. The Board also must adopt rules concerning the \n     appointment and compensation of other employees, attorneys \n     and consultants deemed necessary and appropriate to carry out \n     the board's functions. The Board must create rules for the \n     registration of public accounting firms, and rules governing \n     the Board's duties.\n       Subsection 13A(d) provides the Board with power to assess \n     and collect registration fees and annual dues from each \n     public accounting firm registered with the Board. These fees \n     must be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of the \n     Board and permit the Board to operate on a self-financed \n     basis, and will be based upon the annual revenues of each \n     firm from accounting and auditing services, the number of \n     persons associated with the firm, the number of clients the \n     firm furnishes with accountant's reports, and other criteria \n     the Board establishes.\n       Subsection 13A(e) requires all public accounting firms \n     which furnish accountants reports with respect to documents \n     filed with the SEC to register with the Board within one year \n     after all members of the Board have been selected.\n       Each public accounting firm that performs such services \n     must apply for registration with the Board. Each application \n     must contain the names of all clients of the firm for which \n     the firm provides accountant's reports.\n       The application must also list financial information of the \n     firm for the most recent fiscal year, including assets, \n     liabilities and annual revenues from accounting and auditing \n     services, a statement of the firm's policies and procedures \n     with respect to quality control of its accounting and \n     auditing practice, information relating to criminal, civil or \n     administrative actions or disciplinary proceedings pending \n     against the firm or any of its members and any other \n     information the Board deems necessary or appropriate that is \n     reasonably related to the Board's responsibilities.\n       The registered firms must update their application \n     information annually. Finally, the subsection allows the \n     Board or SEC to exempt any firm or class of firms, \n     accountant's report or class of reports from any provision of \n     the section, if the SEC finds the exemption consistent with \n     the public interest, the protection of investors and the \n     purposes of the section. The Board may designate portions of \n     the filings as confidential and privileged.\n       Section 13A(f) sets out the duties of the Board. The Board \n     must establish fair procedures for investigating and \n     disciplining registered firms and persons associated with \n     them for violations of the Federal securities laws, their \n     rules and regulations, the Board's rules or professional \n     standards in connection with the preparation of an \n     accountant's report on a financial statement, report or other \n     document filed with the SEC.\n       Section 13A(f)(2) allows the Board to conduct an \n     investigation of any illegal act, practice or omission by a \n     registered firm or an associated person in connection with \n     the preparation of documents filed with the SEC.\n       Section 13A(f)(2), paragraph (B) empowers the Board to \n     require the testimony of any person associated with a firm \n     with respect to any matter the Board considers material or \n     relevant. The Board also can require the production of audit \n     workpapers or any other document possessed by a registered \n     firm or any associated person that the Board considers \n     relevant or material, including the books and records of the \n     firm to verify the accuracy of any document supplied. The \n     Board also has the power to request the testimony of any \n     person, including a firm's client, and the production of any \n     documents they possess that the Board deems material or \n     relevant.\n       Section 13A(f)(2), paragraph (C) provides that if any \n     person associated with a public accounting firm refuses to \n     produce documents or otherwise comply with a Board request, \n     the Board may suspend or bar the person from associating with \n     any registered firm or hand down any other sanction the Board \n     deems appropriate. The refusal of any registered public \n     accounting firm to produce documents or otherwise cooperate \n     with the Board also is cause for suspension or revocation of \n     the registration.\n       If the Board cannot complete or conduct its investigation \n     because of the refusal of any client to comply, Section \n     13A(f)(2), paragraph (D) requires the Board to report the \n     refusal to the SEC. The SEC then may designate one or more \n     officers of the Board to be granted nationwide subpoena \n     power. This Section also authorizes the Board to refer any \n     investigation to the SEC.\n       Section 13A(f)(2), paragraph (E) grants immunity to any \n     Board member who carries out an investigation or disciplinary \n     proceeding under this Section from civil liability arising \n     out of the investigation or disciplinary proceeding in the \n     same manner as any other federal Government employee in \n     similar circumstances.\n       Section 13A(f)(3) allows the Board to implement procedures \n     to determine if disciplinary measures should be taken against \n     a firm or its associated persons. In determining whether a \n     person or firm should be disciplined, the Board must bring \n     specific charges, notify the firm or associated persons of \n     the charges, give the parties an opportunity to defend \n     against the charges, and keep a record of such actions. Upon \n     a finding of a violation, the Board may impose any \n     disciplinary sanctions as it deems appropriate, including \n     those enumerated in subsection 13A(f)(3), part (B).\n       Section 13A(f)(3), paragraph (C) requires the Board to file \n     a written statement in support of a determination to impose \n     sanctions. The statement must set forth the illegal act or \n     practice, the specific law, regulation, Board rules or \n     professional standards violated, the sanction imposed, and \n     the reasons therefor.\n       Section 13A(f)(3), paragraph (D) prohibits any person \n     suspended or barred by the Board from willfully associating \n     with a registered firm without Board or SEC permission. Firms \n     may not knowingly permit suspended or barred persons to \n     become or remain associated with the firm without Board or \n     SEC approval.\n       Section 13A(f)(4) requires the Board to report sanctions to \n     the SEC, the appropriate foreign or state licensing boards or \n     any boards with which the firm or person is licensed or \n     certified to practice public accounting, and to the public. \n     The report must include the name of the firm or associated \n     person, a description of the acts, practice or omissions, the \n     nature of the sanctions, and any other information on the \n     circumstances of the disciplinary action as the Board deems \n     appropriate.\n       Section 13A(f)(5) concerns the discoverability and \n     admissibility of material related to the Board's disciplinary \n     process in civil litigation. It is intended to ensure that \n     the Board's disciplinary process does not interfere with \n     private actions for damages relating to conduct within the \n     Board's jurisdiction and, at the same time, that private \n     damages actions do not interfere with the Board's \n     disciplinary process. The intention of this section is that \n     plaintiffs should not be deprived of access to any material \n     that they can obtain from public accounting firms under \n     current law. Similarly, the Board itself, and materials \n     specifically created by others in connection with the Board's \n     disciplinary procedure, would be kept separate from the civil \n     liability system.\n       Section 13A(f)(5)(A) provides that except as provided in \n     subparagraph (B), all documents prepared, collected or \n     received by the Board and the deliberations of the Board in \n     connection with an investigation or disciplinary proceeding \n     are not subject to any form of compulsory discovery. This \n     subparagraph does not apply to information provided to the \n     Board that would have been subject to discovery from the \n     person or entity that provided it to the Board, but is no \n     longer available from that person or entity. This does not \n     limit the Board's authority to provide public access to \n     disciplinary proceedings.\n       Section 13A(f)(5)(B) provides that all documents prepared, \n     collected or received by the Board and the deliberations and \n     other proceedings of the Board in connection with an \n     investigation or disciplinary proceeding shall be \n     inadmissible in any state or federal court or any \n     administrative agency.\n       Section 13A(f)(5)(C) creates an exception to subparagraphs \n     (A) and (B) so that all information referred to in those \n     subparagraphs is available to the SEC and any other Federal \n     agency and admissible in any action brought by the Commission \n     or other Federal agency to the same extent it would be \n     available and admissible under current law. This information \n     shall also be available to state licensing boards under \n     certain circumstances.\n       Section 13A(f)(6) allows state licensing boards limited \n     participation in Board actions. When the Board institutes an \n     investigation it shall notify the State licensing board in \n     the States in which the public accounting firm or auditor \n     engaged in the act or failure to act that is the subject \n     matter of the investigation and invite the state licensing \n     boards to participate. If the state licensing board elects to \n     participate, it shall do so pursuant to rules established by \n     the Board.\n       If the State board disagrees with the Board's \n     determination, it may seek review of that determination by \n     the Commission pursuant to procedures that the Commission \n     shall specify by regulation. However, this Section prohibits \n     state licensing boards from instituting its own proceeding \n     until after the Board's determination has become final.\n       Section 13A(f)(6), paragraph (C) provides that if the State \n     board elects not to participate in the Board's investigation, \n     it shall not institute its own investigation or proceeding \n     [[Page S1089]] in the matter until after the Board's \n     determination has become final.\n       Section 13A(f)(6), paragraph (D) provides that if the Board \n     or Commission imposes a sanction upon a public accounting \n     firm or auditor, and that determination either is not \n     subjected to judicial review or is upheld on judicial review, \n     the state licensing board may impose a sanction on the basis \n     of the Board's report. Any sanction imposed by the state \n     licensing board on this basis shall be inadmissible in any \n     proceeding in any State or Federal court or administrative \n     agency except to extent provided in paragraph (5)(D).\n       Section 13A(f)(6), paragraph (E) provides that if no \n     sanction is imposed by the Board or the SEC, the state \n     licensing board may not impose a sanction if it chose to \n     participate in the investigation. If the State board chose \n     not to participate in the investigation, paragraph (5)'s \n     rules on discovery and admissibility apply to subsequent \n     State board proceedings. The Section also denies State boards \n     access to the record of the proceeding before the Board, and \n     that record is inadmissible in any State board proceeding.\n       Section 13A(g) requires the Board to promote a high level \n     of professional conduct among registered public accounting \n     firms, to improve the quality of audit services those firms \n     provide, and to protect investors and promote the public \n     interest.\n       Section 13A(g)(2) mandates that the Board require public \n     accounting firms subject to its disciplinary authority to be \n     members of a Board-certified professional peer review \n     organization. To qualify the peer review organization must \n     require a public accounting firm to undergo peer review at \n     least once every three years and publish the results of the \n     peer review. It must have standards relating to audit\n      service quality control that are acceptable to the Board. \n     Violation by a public accounting firm or auditor of a rule \n     of the peer review organization shall constitute grounds \n     for imposition of disciplinary sanctions and denial to the \n     public accounting firm or auditor the privilege of \n     appearing before the SEC.\n       Section 13A(g)(3) provides that all reports, memoranda and \n     other information provided to the Board for the purpose of \n     creating the procedures are confidential unless \n     confidentiality and privilege are expressly waived by the \n     proper parties.\n       Section 13A(h) gives the SEC oversight of the Board. \n     Section 13A(h), paragraph (1) requires the Board to file \n     copies of proposed Board rule changes or deletions with the \n     SEC pursuant to rules to be promulgated by the SEC, along \n     with a concise statement of the basis and purpose of the \n     proposed change. The SEC then must publish notice of the \n     change and give interested persons an opportunity to submit \n     comments. The Board cannot make changes without Commission \n     approval.\n       Not later than 35 days after the SEC publishes notice of \n     the change, or within 90 days if the SEC so designates, the \n     SEC must approve the change or institute proceedings to \n     determine whether the change should be disapproved. \n     Disapproval proceedings must include notice of the grounds \n     for disapproval under consideration and an opportunity for a \n     hearing. The proceedings must be concluded not later than 180 \n     days after the publication of notice and filing of the \n     proposed change. At the end of the proceedings, the SEC must \n     approve or disapprove the change or extend the time for \n     conclusion of the proceedings pursuant to subsection 13A(h), \n     paragraphs (1)(B)(ii) (I) and (II).\n       Section 13A(h)(1), paragraph (B)(iii) requires the SEC to \n     approve the change if it finds that it is consistent with the \n     Federal securities laws and disapprove it if it does not make \n     such a finding. The SEC may not approve a rule change until \n     the 30-day period after the notice of the proposed change is \n     filed, unless the SEC finds good cause to do so and publishes \n     its reasons.\n       Section 13A(h)(1), paragraph (C) allows a proposed rule \n     change to take effect upon filing with the SEC if the Board \n     designates it as constituting a stated policy, practice or \n     interpretation of an existing Board rule, establishing or \n     changing a due, fee or other Board-imposed charge, or \n     concerned solely with the administration of the Board. The \n     SEC may put a change into effect summarily if such action is \n     necessary to protect investors. The Board may enforce such \n     changes to the extent they are not inconsistent with the \n     Federal securities laws, their rules and regulations, and \n     applicable State and Federal law. The SEC may summarily \n     abrogate changes in the rules by the Board if it appears to \n     the SEC that such\n      action is necessary to the public interest, for the \n     protection of investors, or in furtherance of federal or \n     state laws.\n       Section 13A(h)(2) also allows the SEC to amend the Board's \n     rules if the SEC deems the action necessary or appropriate to \n     the fair administration of the Board, to conform its rules to \n     requirements of the Federal securities laws by following \n     certain procedures adopted from the Administrative Procedure \n     Act. The SEC must publish notice of the proposed rulemaking \n     in the Federal Register, give interested persons an \n     opportunity to comment, and incorporate the text of its \n     amendment to the rules of the Board with a statement of the \n     basis and purpose of the amendment.\n       The SEC also may adopt regulations pursuant to section 553 \n     of title 5 of the United States Code for rulemaking not on \n     the record. Amendments to the Board's rules by the SEC are \n     deemed Board rules and not rules of the SEC.\n       Section 13A(h)(3) requires the Board to promptly notify the \n     SEC if the Board imposes a final disciplinary sanction on a \n     registered firm or associated person. The Commission may \n     review the action on its own motion or the motion of any \n     aggrieved party filed within 30 days after the Board's notice \n     is filed with the SEC and received by the aggrieved party.\n       Section 13A(h)(4) requires the Commission to affirm the \n     Board's sanction, modify it or remand to the Board for \n     further proceedings if upon review of the sanctions, the SEC \n     determines that the firm or person engaged in the acts, \n     practices or omissions that the Board alleges, that such \n     acts, practices or omissions violated the Federal securities \n     laws, the Board's rules or professional standards, and such \n     laws are consistent with the purposes of the Federal \n     securities laws. If the SEC does not make such findings, it \n     must set aside the sanctions and remand to the Board if \n     appropriate. If the SEC finds that a sanction imposed by the \n     Board burdens competition unnecessary or inappropriate in \n     furtherance to the purposes of the Federal securities laws or \n     is excessive or oppressive, the SEC may cancel, reduce or \n     require the remission of the sanctions.\n       Section 13A(h)(5) requires the Board to comply with Federal \n     securities laws and its own rules and enforce compliance with \n     those laws and with professional standards. The SEC may \n     relieve the Board of any responsibility under Section 13A to \n     enforce compliance with the above laws or standards.\n       Section 13A(h)(6) allows the SEC to censure or limit the \n     activities, functions or operations of the Board if the SEC \n     finds that the Board violated or is unable to comply or has \n     failed to enforce compliance by a registered firm or \n     associated persons with any provision of the Federal \n     securities laws, the Board's rules or professional standards \n     of conduct. The SEC also may remove a Board member\n      from office if, after notice and opportunity for hearing, \n     the SEC determines that the member willfully violated any \n     provision of the Federal securities laws or the Board's \n     rules, abused the member's authority or failed to enforce \n     compliance with any professional standard of conduct by \n     any firm or associated person without reasonable \n     justification or excuse.\n       Section 13A(i) requires foreign accounting firms to \n     register with the Board if they furnish the same types of \n     services as domestic firms required to register under Section \n     13A. The SEC may exempt foreign firms from the provisions of \n     this section if exemption is deemed consistent with the \n     public interest and the protection of investors.\n       Registration pursuant to this subsection shall not be \n     itself provide a basis for subjecting foreign accounting \n     firms to the jurisdiction of the federal or state courts.\n       Under Section 13A(j), neither the Board, any member of the \n     Board nor any person associated with a public accounting firm \n     shall be subject to suit under any antitrust law for any act \n     of the Board of any failure to act by the Board. ``Antitrust \n     law'' means the Federal Trade Commission Act and each statute \n     defined by Section 4 thereof as ``Antitrust Acts'' and all \n     amendments to such act and such statutes and any other \n     federal Acts or state laws in pari materia.\n       Section 13A(k) provides that all audits of an issuer's \n     financial statements required under the Exchange Act shall be \n     in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. It \n     also clarifies that the Commission can modify or supplement \n     such standards, and that the Commission may defer to \n     professional standards promulgated by private-sector \n     organizations that are generally accepted by the accounting \n     or auditing profession.\n       Section 13A(l) declares that nothing in Section 13A impairs \n     or limits the SEC's authority over accountants, to set \n     standards for accounting or auditing standards or to take \n     action against any firm or associated person.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\See 17 C.F.R.

Two separate suits, \n     later consolidated with eight others, ``contained identical \n     allegations, apparently lodged in counsel's computer memory \n     of `fraud' from complaints that the defendants here engaged \n     in conduct ``to create and prolong the illusion of (Philip \n     Morris') success in the toy industry,'' he said.\n       Judge Owen also noted with disapproval that the original \n     suits, in which plaintiffs had sought class-action status, \n     were filed either on the day of Philip Morris's announcement, \n     known as Marlboro Friday, or the following Monday. He \n     expressed disbelief that shareholders of the tobacco, food \n     and beer giant would have landed on attorney's doorsteps so \n     quickly.\n       And he quoted from similar rulings by other judges, \n     including a 1991 ruling dismissing a complaint against \n     Citicorp that said, ``The complaint creates the strong \n     impression that when Citicorp announced a cut in dividends, \n     plaintiff's counsel simply stepped to the nearest computer \n     console, conducted a global Nexis search, pressed the `Print' \n     button, and filed the product as their complaint.'' Judge \n     Owen couldn't be reached for comment.\n       But Melvyn L. Weiss, a partner at one of the firms that \n     filed the Philip Morris suit, said the plaintiffs plan an \n     appeal. ``The law is very clear that an investor is entitled \n     to know all facts that they would want to know in making \n     their decision,'' he said. ``You can remain silent, but when \n     you speak, you have to tell the whole truth.'' The plaintiffs \n     had contended that New York-based Philip Morris led analysts \n     to believe that it wouldn't cut the price of its flagship \n     Marlboro brand.\n       ``I have enough of a reputation without going around filing \n     suits that I don't believe in,'' Mr. Weiss added. ``I would \n     never pursue a case like this, especially against a worthy \n     adversary, without a profound belief in the integrity of the \n     case.''\n       In addition to Mr. Weiss's firm, Milberg Weiss Bershad \n     Hynes & Lerach, other law firms representing the plaintiffs \n     were Abbey & Ellis and Barrack, Rodos & Bacine.\n       Nevertheless, Judge Owen isn't the only one worried about \n     class-action securities suits. Sens. Pete Domenici, a New \n     Mexico Republican, and Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut \n     Democrat, are expected to reintroduce a bill that would put \n     the brakes on some alleged abuses in securities litigation. \n     Its provisions include a higher legal standard for claiming \n     securities fraud and a nonbinding arbitration mechanism for \n     securities litigation.\n       ``In my opinion, it's most of them that are frivolous--not \n     just a lot, but most,'' said Jonathan R. Macey, a Cornell \n     University law professor who advocates having plaintiffs' \n     lawyers bid to work on such cases, with the money going to \n     the plaintiffs. ``The facts show that every time a firm's \n     share price drops by enough that it's profitable for \n     plaintiffs lawyers to bring a lawsuit, they do.''\n       John L. Coffee, Jr., a Columbia University law professor, \n     says ``some of the judges are very skeptical of particular \n     law firms'' because some of them bring so many shareholder \n     suits. He adds that ``about nine firms'' bring more than half \n     of the suits that are filed.\n       Federal judges sometimes try to dismiss shareholder suits \n     early on because they are so time-consuming, Prof. Coffee \n     said, but appellate courts have reined in any attempts to \n     broadly throw out securities suits.\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I introduce the Private Securities \nLitigation Reform Act of 1995. This bipartisan proposal is identical to \nthe legislation I introduced in the 103d Congress with my good friend \nSenator Domenici. eighteen of our colleagues are joining us as original \ncosponsors.\n  In the year since we last introduced this legislation, the process by \nwhich private individuals bring securities lawsuits has received \nenormous scrutiny. I am happy to say that as a result of this increased \nfocus in the media and in the investor and business community, the \ndebate has shifted. We are no longer arguing about whether the current \nsystem is in need of repair. The discussion is now centered on how best \nto fix it.\n  Even those who 1 year ago were unwilling to admit that the system \nneeded to be reformed, now concede that substantial changes are needed. \nIn my view, the fact that there is finally consensus about the need for \nsecurities litigation reform is enormously significant. Because this \nconsensus now exists, I believe we will see comprehensive legislation \nenacted this Congress. With the introduction of this bill, we begin the \nprocess to develop the best legislative solutions.\n  This bill is by no means the final word on the matter. In the last \nyear, hearings have been held in both Houses of Congress. Numerous \nstudies of have been completed, including a comprehensive report by my \nsecurities Subcommittee staff. Every word of the legislation has \nreceived in-depth analysis. In addition, there have been a number of \njudicial decisions which have altered the private securities litigation \nlandscape. The most significant of these was the U.S. Supreme Court \nDecision last year in Central Bank of Denver versus First Intereststate \nBank of Denver, which eliminated private liability for those who aid \nand abet securities fraud.\n  Many constructive suggestions have been made about ways to improves \nthe legislation. The fact that we have not incorporated these changes \nto last years proposal should not be taken as a sign that we are \nunwilling to modify our bill. We simply preferred to begin this year \nwhere we left off last year so as not to create additional controversy \nor confusion. I am eager to work with my colleagues to refine and \nperfect the proposal as it moves through the process. As I have stated \nbefore, I would be willing to address the Bank of Denver decision as \npart of our deliberations.\n  I cannot overstate how critical securities lawsuits brought by \nprivate individuals are to ensuring the integrity of our capital \nmarkets. As an important back-up to Government enforcement actions, \nthese private actions help deter wrongdoing. When the system is working \nwell, it helps to ensure that corporate officers, auditors, directors, \nlawyers and others properly perform their jobs. Private litigation is \nan indispensable tool with which defrauded investors can recover their \nlosses without having to rely on Government action.\n  Private securities litigation has evolved over the years mainly as a \nresult of court decisions rather than legislative action. The most \nimportant private right of action for defrauded investors has long been \nsection 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act. Private actions under \nthat provision were never expressly set out by Congress, but have been \nconstrued and refined by courts, with the tacit consent of Congress.\n  This lack of congressional involvement in shaping the contours of \nprivate litigation has created uncertainty about legal standards and \nunwarranted opportunities for abuse of investors and companies. Last \nCongress, my Securities Subcommittee held several days of hearing on \nsecurities litigation. These hearings documented a number of glaring \nproblems with the current system.\n  First, securities class action cases are vulnerable to abuses by \n``entrepreneurial'' lawyers who put their own interests ahead of their \nclients. Many critics charge that plaintiffs' attorneys appear to \ncontrol the settlement of the case with little or no influence from \neither the named plaintiffs or the larger class of investors.\n  For example, in one case which was cited to the subcommittee by a \nlawyer as a showcase of how the system works, the case was settled \nbefore trial for $33 million. The lawyers asked the court for more than \n$20 million of that amount in fees and costs. The court awarded the \nplaintiffs' lawyers over $11 million and lawyers for the company $3 \nmillion. Investors recovered only 6.5 percent of their recoverable \ndamages.\n  A second area of abuse is frivolous litigation. We have heard \ncomplaints from companies, especially in the high-technology sectors, \nthat they face groundless securities litigation days or even hours \nafter adverse earnings announcements. Courts have echoed this concern. \nAs the Supreme Court pointed out in Blue Chip Stamps versus Manor Drug \nStore:\n\n       [I]n the field of federal securities laws governing \n     disclosure of information, even a complaint which by \n     objective standards may have very little success at trial has \n     a settlement value to the plaintiff out of any proportion to \n     its prospect of success at trial so long as he may prevent \n     the suit from being resolved against him by dismissal or \n     summary judgment. The very pendency of the lawsuit may \n     frustrate or delay normal business activity of the defendant \n     which is totally unrelated to the lawsuit.\n\n  The net effect of private litigation under the Federal securities \nlaws has been to weaken the financial disclosure system on which our \ncapital markets depend. The accounting profession, which is at the \nheart of the Financial Disclosure System, has warned that because of \nthe doctrine of joint and several liability, accountants face potential \nliability which could destroy the ability of independent auditors to \nreview financial disclosure by companies.\n  We need to rationalize the current framework for assessing liability \nso it \n[[Page S1091]] is fairer and doesn't simply create an incentive to sue \nthose with the deepest pockets. Unlimited liability is simply not the \nmost effective deterrent of wrongdoing. We need to more directly police \nthe conduct of professionals like accountants and do so in a more \neffective manner.\n                         LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS\n\n  The bill contains three major initiatives to deal with these \nproblems:\n  First, it empowers investors so that they--not their lawyers--have \ngreater control over class action cases.\n  Second, it limits opportunities for frivolous litigation.\n  Third, it rationalizes the professional liability of accountants in \nexchange for stronger regulation.\n  In addition, the bill incorporates measures previously proposed in \nCongress to strengthen the obligation of auditors to search for fraud \nand to lengthen the statute of limitations for fraud actions.\n\n\n                        1. EMPOWERING INVESTORS\n\n  The bill addresses abuses of investors by their lawyers by ensuring \nthat investors, not lawyers, decide whether to bring a case, whether to \nsettle, and how much the lawyers should receive.\n  The bill requires courts to appoint a plaintiff steering committee or \na guardian to directly control lawyers for the class.\n  The bill requires that notices of settlement agreements sent to \ninvestors spell out clearly important facts such as how much investors \nare giving up by settling, and how much their lawyers will receive in \nthe settlement.\n  The bill requires that courts tie awards of lawyers' fees directly to \nhow much is recovered by investors, rather than simply how many hours \nthe lawyers billed or how many pages of briefs they filed.\n  The bill establishes an alternative dispute resolution procedure to \nmake it easier to prosecute a case without the necessity of slow and \nexpensive Federal court proceedings. This idea is very similar to a \nprovision in the products liability bill passed by the Commerce \nCommittee last fall, and like that bill it is intended to speed up the \nrecovery process for plaintiffs who have strong cases.\n  These provisions should ensure that defrauded investors are not \ncheated a second time by their lawyers. It also should help victims of \nfraud to recover damages more quickly, with less of their recovery \ndrained off in lawyers' fees.\n\n\n                        2. FRIVOLOUS LITIGATION\n\n  The bill requires that in order to bring a securities case as a class \naction, the plaintiffs in whose name the case is brought must have held \neither 1 percent of the securities which are the subject of the \nlitigation or $10,000 worth of securities. This should help stop a \nproblem pointed to by several courts, in which professional plaintiffs \nwho own small amounts of stock in many companies try to bring class \naction lawsuits whenever one of their investments goes down.\n  The bill clarifies how a lawyer should plead a securities fraud \nclaim. Plaintiffs' lawyers should have no trouble meeting these \nstandards if they have legitimate cases and have looked at the facts.\n  These and other reforms should end the race to the courthouse by \nlawyers eager to file a case without investigating the facts or finding \na real client.\n\n\n            3. securities litigation and financial reporting\n\n  The accounting profession has argued that accounting firms are \nunfairly singled out under the current litigation system simply because \nthey are a deep pocket. They claim that their liability exposure under \nthe current system could drive them away from providing auditing \nservices to many companies, especially new companies and high-\ntechnology companies.\n  The bill establishes a liability system for less culpable defendants \nthat is linked to degree of fault. At the same time, the bill \nestablishes a self-disciplinary organization for accountants under the \ndirect supervision of the SEC. This entity would be somewhat like self-\nregulatory organizations such as the New York Stock Exchange or the \nNational Association of Securities Dealers. The net effect should be a \nmore direct and rational way of dealing with bad apples in the \naccounting profession without punishing the entire profession.\n\n\n                    3. enhancing deterrence of fraud\n\n  The bill would extend the statute of limitations for implied actions \nto 5 years from the date of the violation, or 2 years after the \nviolation was discovered or should have been discovered through the \nexercise of reasonable diligence. The bill also incorporates pending \nlegislation concerning the responsibility of auditors to search for and \nreport fraud. A similar bill in past Congresses has been supported by \nthe SEC and the AICPA.\n  There is tremendous support for this legislation within Congress and \nfrom a large variety of private organizations. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to enact comprehensive reform as soon as \npossible.\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to work on a \nbipartisan basis with my colleagues Senator Dodd and Senator Domenici \nto cosponsor and renew my commitment to reforming securities \nlitigation.\n  This bill addresses the problem of bounty hunters racing to the \ncourthouse to be the first to file a lawsuit based on nothing more than \na change in stock price--and then coerce innocent businesses to settle \nthese lawsuits.\n  This bill eliminates the payment of bonus awards or bounties to \nrepresentative plaintiffs in class actions. It gives people who are \nharmed extra time to consider who really harmed them before they have \nto file their case at the courthouse, by extending the statute of \nlimitations to 2 years after the violation was or should have been \ndiscovered, and 5 years after the violation occurred. It also puts the \ninvestor in the driver's seat to control the litigation and recover \nmore of their damages.\n  My constituents have told me that some attorneys are paying stock \nbrokers and others a bounty in return for identifying who they should \nsue. High-technology companies, their accountants, and others are being \nlumped into these securities lawsuits that are filed at the courthouse \njust hours after a change in the stock price.\n  I am opposed to the race-to-the courthouse mentality that ends up in \nneedless lawsuits that have huge litigation costs for firms that should \nbe focused on creating jobs.\n  I want to see the courthouse door kept open for the little guy, but \nlet's get this bounty hunter law under control.\n  These needless lawsuits hit these firms through: expensive liability \ninsurance premiums; disruption to the lives of those people who have \nbeen drawn into the suit--and is a tremendous distraction from the \ncompany's achieving its mission, contributing to the economy, and \ncreating jobs.\n  I am concerned about these costs to the private sector, and to \ncommunities across America--and especially the costs to the high-\ntechnology community who are our hope for jobs in the 21st century.\n  I am hearing loud and clear that the current bounty hunter mentality \nis putting these jobs at risk.\n  Rather than creating jobs, these high-technology jobs are having to \nput their efforts and their dollars into expensive litigation and \ninsurance.\n  I know how the system works with these lawsuits. It doesn't matter \nwho's right or who's wrong. Both the guilty and the innocent end up \nsettling at some big cost, even if just to avoid the risk and to get on \nwith life.\n  So, the good guys cut their losses and the bad guys get off the hook.\n  I am pleased to work on a bipartisan basis with Senators Domenici and \nDodd and support this legislation that helps take care of the good \nguys.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. D'AMATO:\n  S. 241. A bill to increase the penalties for sexual exploitation of \nchildren, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n         THE PREVENTION OF SEXUAL EXPLOITATION OF CHILDREN ACT\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nPrevention of the Sexual Exploitation of Children's Act. There is a \nlarge and growing threat to the welfare and safety of our children \nbeing caused by the advent of the computer age. The ``information \nsuperhighway,'' while a boon to our standard of living and economic \ngrowth, also contains hidden dangers which must be addressed to protect \nour children from debauched sexual predators. The ``information \nsuperhighway'' \n[[Page S1092]] has become a safe haven for pedophiles to entice \nchildren into acts of sexual depravity with little chance of exposure. \nPedophiles and other sexual miscreants historically would position \nthemselves outside of schools, playgrounds, and other public areas \nwhere children would congregate in order to satisfy their own depraved \nappetites. Now through the use of bulletin boards, major on-line \nservices such as Prodigy, America Online, Compuserve, Internet, and a \nhost of other computer conduits, these individuals can ply their trade \nwith much less exposure to parental supervision or law enforcement. \nWhile many State and local authorities are addressing this problem, the \nuse of the ``information superhighway'' makes the role of the Federal \nGovernment even more critical. The use of the computer conduits allow \nfor the defendants to cross State, local and even international \nboundaries with impunity. These miscreants can be extremely violent and \ncause irreparable harm to the children they come into contact with. \nThis violence must be answered with stiff judicial penalties.\n  In addition to the physical depravity that is a direct result of the \ncomputer age, there has been a noted increase in pornographic material \ninvolving children being distributed and sold over computer lines. This \npornographic material not only acts as a stimulus to the pedophiles but \nthe simple possession of this material by people creates a demand for \nit, and these people should share in the responsibility of the \nexploitation of children by the pornography producers. This circular \nmotion of supply and demand fuels the proliferation of more and more \npornographic material.\n  My legislation will raise the judicial penalties which would deter \nthe proliferation of pornographic material available and remove the \ndefendants from society. By enacting harsher judicial penalties, \nCongress will be sending a strong message that our society will not \ntolerate these forms of criminal behavior.\n  I ask my fellow colleagues to join me in support of this legislation. \nThese violations are a growing concern both within the law enforcement \ncommunity and the family structure, and we must deal with them now.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation and additional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 241\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Computer \n     conduits, or the ``information superhighway'', is being used \n     extensively to entice children into acts of sexual depravity \n     by pedofiles and other deviants. These sexual predators will \n     often depict themselves as children and arrange a meeting \n     with their victims, with the child being sexually abused as \n     the ultimate outcome. In addition to the luring of children \n     through the ``information superhighway'', these conduits are \n     also being used to transport child pornography. The influx \n     and availability of the child pornography only prompt these \n     sexual deviants into further preying on our children.\n       Pedofiles and other sexual miscreants historically would \n     position themselves outside of schools, playgrounds and other \n     public areas where children would congregate in order to \n     satisfy their own depraved appetites. Now through the use of \n     bulletin boards, major on-line services, such as Prodigy, \n     America Online, Compuserve, Internet, and a host of other \n     computer conduits, these individuals can ply their trade with \n     much less exposure to parental supervision or law \n     enforcement. These deviants are often very violent and cause \n     the children irreparable harm.\n       This legislation will raise the judicial penalties which \n     would deter the proliferation of pornographic material \n     available and remove the defendants from society. By enacting \n     harsher judicial penalties, Congress will be sending a strong \n     message that our society will not tolerate these forms of \n     criminal behavior.\n       If you would like to help me stem this burgeoning problem \n     by cosponsoring the ``Prevention of Sexual Exploitation of \n     Children's Act'', please contact Greg Regan of my office at \n     4-8349.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Alfonse M.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ndeduction for the payment of tuition for higher education and interest \non student loans; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                    higher education tax relief act\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, earlier today, several of my \ndistinguished colleagues and I announced our intention to introduce \nanother important element of our Democratic plan to help middle-class \nAmericans who are squeezed between prices that are rising and incomes \nthat are not.\n  Today Senators Breaux, Kennedy, Reid, Rockefeller, Mikulski, Ford, \nDodd, Kerry, and I are introducing the Higher Education Tax Relief Act \nof 1995. This legislation will provide tax relief for middle-income \nfamilies who are trying to send their children to college or vocational \nor professional school, as well as to individuals who seek such \neducational opportunities.\n  As I have noted on many occasions, our highest priority in the 104th \nCongress is to strengthen the financial security of working middle-\nincome families. One of our greatest concerns is the increasing \ninability of many families to afford to send their children to college \nor vocational school.\n  Pressures on State budgets are forcing public colleges and \nuniversities to increase the tuition and fees they charge to new \nstudents. Many private institutions are trying to fill the student aid \ngap by taking on the task themselves, but they are finding it more and \nmore costly to do so.\n  Our legislation will provide a tax deduction of up to $10,000 for \ntuition and fees associated with attending public and non-profit \ncolleges and universities or vocational and professional schools. This \naspect of the proposal is identical to the tuition deduction advanced \nby President Clinton in his middle-class bill of rights package. We \nthink the President was right to focus on education in that package \nbecause it is one of the highest priorities--and biggest expenses--of \nmiddle-income families.\n  In addition, our tax deduction would be available up to the same \namount for interest incurred on student loans. Ever since the deduction \nfor student loan interest was eliminated in the Tax Reform Act of 1986, \nwe have heard an ever-louder cry from middle-income Americans that they \nwant it back. And for good reason. As more and more forms of direct \nstudent aid are eliminated, these families are having to incur debt in \norder to finance the costs of higher education, especially since their \nincomes simply are not rising commensurate with the cost of living.\n  The deduction we are proposing, whether taken for tuition and fees or \nfor student loan interest, is available to families with incomes of up \nto $100,000 per year or individuals with incomes of up to $70,000 per \nyear. Moreover, the deduction may be taken whether or not the taxpayer \nis in a position to itemize on his or her return, providing greater \nassurance that those at the lower end of the middle-income range will \nbenefit.\n  Our proposal provides a choice to middle-income Americans and \ncomplements the various forms of student aid currently available to \nthose with the lowest incomes. Middle-income taxpayers, most of whom no \nlonger qualify for other forms of student aid, may deduct amounts they \nare able to pay for tuition and fees at the time they or their children \nare attending an institution of higher education. If, however, they \nmust finance their own or their children's education, they may deduct \nthe interest on student loans later when they begin paying back the \nloans.\n  Mr. President, the Higher Education Tax Relief Act of 1995, along \nwith the President's tuition deduction proposal, identifies a major \ndifference between the Republican and Democratic views of middle-income \ntax relief. The Republican Contract With America does not contain tax \nrelief directed at helping middle-income families pay for education. In \nfact, it contains numerous measures that will further harm the ability \nof middle-income Americans to obtain the education they seek.\n  For example, one of the spending cuts contemplated by Republicans is \nthe repeal of the in-school interest subsidy for student loans. Right \nnow, the interest clock on many student loans does not start ticking \nuntil a student has finished college. The Republicans want to start \ncharging interest immediately. We believe that's an attack on middle-\nincome families who cannot afford to send their children to college \nwithout borrowing the money.\n  College already is too expensive for many families, and we shouldn't \nlimit the number who can afford it by raising the costs even more. \nDemocrats believe opportunities should be open to everyone willing to \nearn them with hard work. We believe education is necessary and should \nbe affordable to anyone who wants it--that we should not tax the income \nnecessary for middle-income families to send their children to college \nor vocational and professional schools.\n  These are Democratic values.\n  Let me point out that none of us introducing this legislation today \nhave any intention of increasing the deficit as a result of this \nproposal. We have asked the Joint Committee on Taxation to estimate the \ncost of this proposal and, at the appropriate time, we intend to offer \nways to pay for it.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a copy of our legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 242\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, a college education is a building block \nof the American dream. But with college costs rising, higher education \nis increasingly out of reach for many families.\n  President Clinton deserves credit for acting on this problem, and the \nlegislation we are introducing today will carry out the President's \nproposal to make college education more affordable for working \nfamilies. The bill provides a tax deduction of up to $10,000 a year for \ncollege tuition costs, and it restores the deduction for interest on \nstudent loans.\n  The deduction for tuition will be available for families earning up \nto $100,000 a year and individuals earning up to $70,000. It will be \navailable for tuition at traditional 4-year colleges and universities, \ncommunity colleges, and vocational and professional schools offering \njob training in a variety of fields.\n  The deduction for interest on student loans is equally important, and \nwill offer significant help to students who must borrow to go to \ncollege and who are struggling to pay off their loans and establish \nthemselves in the working world.\n  By contrast, the Republican contract proposes to cut over $10 billion \nin Federal financial aid for students over the next 5 years. In \nMassachusetts alone, that would mean a loss of over $100 million a \nyear. In reality, when you read the fine print, the Contract With \nAmerica is a contract against college education.\n  Families across the country know that education is the best \ninvestment they can make in their children's future. We must do more to \nease the burden of that investment, not make it harder for families to \nobtain it.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both side of the \naisle to ensure that this important legislation becomes law.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Rockefeller, and Ms. \n        Mikulski):\n  S.J. Res. 20. A joint resolution granting the consent of Congress to \na compact to provide for joint natural resource management and \nenforcement of laws and regulations pertaining to natural resources and \nboating at the Jennings Randolph Lake Project lying in Garrett County, \nMD and Mineral County, WV, entered into between the States of West \nVirginia and Maryland; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               the jennings randolph lake project compact\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation \ntogether with my colleagues Senators Byrd, Rockefeller, and Mikulski to \ngrant congressional consent to a compact entered into between the \nStates of \n[[Page S1095]] West Virginia and Maryland, with concurrence of the U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers, to provide for joint management and \nenforcement of laws and regulations pertaining to natural resources and \nboating at Jennings Randolph Lake. This legislation was approved by the \nSenate in the closing days of the 103d Congress, but was not considered \nin the House.\n  Jennings Randolph Lake is located on the north branch of the Potomac \nRiver in Garrett County, MD and Mineral County, WV. Construction of the \ndam, which created the lake, was authorized by the Flood Control Act of \n1962 and the project was specifically designed to improve the water \nquality of the Potomac River, reduce flood damage, provide water \nsupply, and opportunities for recreation. Completed in 1982, the dam is \none of the largest dams east of the Mississippi--approximately 6.6 \nmiles long, with a surface area of 952 acres and a drainage area of 263 \nsquare miles. Originally named Bloomington Lake, the project was \nrededicated in May 1987 in honor of former West Virginia Senator \nJennings Randolph.\n  The lake and surrounding area are extraordinarily beautiful and \ninclude some of the most picturesque countryside in the Nation. The \nlake and the north branch of the Potomac River below the dam support a \nrecreational trout fishery that is regarded as one of the best in \nAmerica. Other recreational opportunities including boating, downstream \nwhitewater rafting, hiking, and picnicing are drawing increasing \nnumbers of visitors to the lake. The Army Corps of Engineers currently \noperates and maintains five recreation sites at the project and the \nState of Maryland, in cooperation with the corps, is in the process of \ndeveloping a boat launch and support facilities on the Maryland side of \nthe project.\n  Unfortunately, the creation of the lake removed the natural boundary \nbetween West Virginia and Maryland and the meandering nature of the \nformer river and the depth of the lake have made it virtually \nimpossible to reestablish the precise location of the boundary. As a \nconsequence, enforcement of natural resources and boating laws and \nregulations on the lake has been tentative at best and at worst, \nnonexistent. As recreational uses of the lake continue to increase, it \nis anticipated that enforcement problems will become increasingly \ndifficult.\n  The compact legislation I am introducing today provides the State of \nWest Virginia and Maryland with concurrent jurisdiction over the \nproject area to enable them to jointly enforce natural resource and \nboating laws and regulations. This approach eliminates the need to \nredefine the boundary between the two States for law enforcement \npurposes. As required before congressional action can be taken, the \ncompact was approved by the respective legislatures of Maryland and \nWest Virginia in their 1993 legislative sessions.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will address the ongoing problems \nassociated with the management and enforcement of laws and regulations \nrelating to natural resources and boating at the Jennings Randolph Lake \nProject. It has been long awaited by both States and I urge its swift \nenactment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n                              S.J. Res. 20\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) historically, Federal programs have addressed the \n     Nation's problems by providing categorical financial \n     assistance with detailed requirements relating to the use of \n     funds;\n       (2) while the assistance described in paragraph (1) has \n     been directed at critical problems, some program requirements \n     may inadvertently impede the effective delivery of services;\n       (3) the Nation's local governments and private, nonprofit \n     organizations are dealing with increasingly complex problems \n     which require the delivery of many kinds of services;\n       (4) the Nation's communities are diverse, and different \n     needs are present in different communities;\n       (5) it is more important than ever to provide programs \n     that--\n       (A) promote more effective and efficient local delivery of \n     services to meet the full range of needs of individuals, \n     families, and society;\n       (B) respond flexibly to the diverse needs of the Nation's \n     communities;\n       (C) reduce the barriers between programs that impede local \n     governments' ability to effectively deliver services; and\n       (D) empower local governments and private, nonprofit \n     organizations to be innovative in creating programs that meet \n     the unique needs of their communities while continuing to \n     address national policy goals; and\n       (6) many communities have innovative planning and community \n     involvement strategies for providing services, but Federal, \n     State, and local regulations often hamper full implementation \n     of local plans.\n\n     SEC. 503.

OREGON OPTION PROPOSAL.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Federal, State and local governments are dealing with \n     increasingly complex problems which require the delivery of \n     many kinds of social services at all levels of government;\n       (2) historically, Federal programs have addressed the \n     Nation's problems by providing categorical assistance with \n     detailed requirements relating to the use of funds which are \n     often delivered by State and local governments;\n       (3) although the current approach is one method of service \n     delivery, a number of problems exist in the current \n     intergovernmental structure that impede effective delivery of \n     vital services by State and local governments;\n       (4) it is more important than ever to provide programs that \n     respond flexibly to the needs of the Nation's States and \n     communities, reduce the barriers between programs that impede \n     Federal, State and local governments' ability to effectively \n     deliver services, encourage the Nation's Federal, State and \n     local governments to be innovative in creating programs that \n     meet the unique needs of the people in their communities \n     while continuing to address national goals, and improve the \n     accountability of all levels of government by better \n     measuring government performance and better meeting the needs \n     of service recipients;\n       (5) the State and local governments of Oregon have begun a \n     pilot project, called the Oregon Option, that will utilize \n     strategic planning and performance-based management that may \n     provide new models for intergovernmental social service \n     delivery;\n       (6) the Oregon Option is a prototype of a new \n     intergovernmental relations system, and it has the potential \n     to completely transform the relationships among Federal, \n     State and local governments by creating a system of \n     intergovernmental service delivery and funding that is based \n     on measurable performance, customer satisfaction, prevention, \n     flexibility, and service integration; and\n       (7) the Oregon Option has the potential to dramatically \n     improve the quality of Federal, State and local services to \n     Oregonians.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Oregon Option project has the potential to improve \n     intergovernmental service delivery by shifting accountability \n     from compliance to performance results and that the Federal \n     Government should continue in its partnership with the State \n     and local governments of Oregon to fully implement the Oregon \n     Option.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                      McCAIN AMENDMENTS NOS. 48-50\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. McCAIN submitted three amendments, intended to be proposed by \nhim, to the bill S. 1, supra;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Consumer and Main Street \n     Business Protection Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. ____02. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) merchandise purchased from out-of-State firms is \n     subject to State and local sales taxes in the same manner as \n     merchandise purchased from in-State firms,\n       (2) State and local governments generally are unable to \n     compel out-of-State firms to collect and remit such taxes, \n     and consequently, many out-of-State firms choose not to \n     collect State and local taxes on merchandise delivered across \n     State lines,\n       (3) moreover, many out-of-State firms fail to inform their \n     customers that such taxes exist, with some firms even falsely \n     claim that merchandise purchased out-of-State is tax-free, \n     and consequently, many consumers unknowingly incur tax \n     liabilities, including interest and penalty charges,\n       (4) Congress has a duty to protect consumers from explicit \n     or implicit misrepresentations of State and local sales tax \n     obligations,\n       (5) small businesses, which are compelled to collect State \n     and local sales taxes, are subject to unfair competition when \n     out-of-State firms cannot be compelled to collect and remit \n     such taxes on their sales to residents of the State,\n       (6) State and local governments provide a number of \n     resources to out-of-State firms including government services \n     relating to disposal of tons of catalogs, mail delivery, \n     communications, and bank and court systems,\n       (7) the inability of State and local governments to require \n     out-of-State firms to collect and remit sales taxes deprives \n     State and local governments of needed revenue and forces such \n     State and local governments to raise taxes on taxpayers, \n     including consumers and small businesses, in such State,\n       (8) the Supreme Court ruled in Quill Corporation v. North \n     Dakota, 112 S. Ct. 1904 (1992) that the due process clause of \n     the Constitution does not prohibit a State government from \n     imposing personal jurisdiction and tax obligations on out-of-\n     State firms that purposefully solicit sales from residents \n     therein, and that the Congress has the power to authorize \n     State governments to require out-of-State firms to collect \n     State and local sales taxes, and\n       (9) as a matter of federalism, the Federal Government has a \n     duty to assist State and local governments in collecting \n     sales taxes on sales from out-of-State firms.\n\n     SEC. ____03. AUTHORITY FOR COLLECTION OF SALES TAX.\n\n       (a) In General.--A State is authorized to require a person \n     who is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the State to \n     collect and remit a State sales tax, a local sales tax, or \n     both, with respect to tangible personal property if--\n       (1) the destination of the tangible personal property is in \n     the State,\n       (2) during the 1-year period ending on September 30 of the \n     calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the \n     taxable event occurs, the person has gross receipts from \n     sales of such tangible personal property--\n       (A) in the United States exceeding $3,000,000, or\n       (B) in the State exceeding $100,000, and\n       (3) the State, on behalf of its local jurisdictions, \n     collects and administers all local sales taxes imposed \n     pursuant to this title.\n       (b) States Must Collect Local Sales Taxes.-- Except as \n     provided in section ____04(d), a State in which both State \n     and local sales taxes are imposed may not require State sales \n     taxes to be collected and remitted under subsection (a) \n     unless the State also requires the local sales taxes to be \n     collected and remitted under subsection (a).\n       (c) Aggregation Rules.--All persons that would be treated \n     as a single employer under section 52 (a) or (b) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be treated as one person \n     for purposes of subsection (a).\n       (d) Destination.--For purposes of subsection (a), the \n     destination of tangible personal property is the State or \n     local jurisdiction which is the final location to which the \n     seller ships or delivers the property, or to which the seller \n     causes the property to be shipped or delivered, regardless of \n     the means of shipment or delivery or the location of the \n     buyer.\n\n     SEC.____04. TREATMENT OF LOCAL SALES TAXES.\n\n       (a) Uniform Local Sales Taxes.--\n       (1) In general.--Sales taxes imposed by local jurisdictions \n     of a State shall be deemed to be uniform for purposes of this \n     title and shall be collected under this title in the same \n     manner as State sales taxes if--\n       (A) such local sales taxes are imposed at the same rate and \n     on identical transactions in all geographic areas in the \n     State, and\n       (B) such local sales taxes imposed on sales by out-of-State \n     persons are collected and administered by the State.\n       (2) Application to border jurisdiction tax rates.--A State \n     shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of \n     paragraph (1)(A) if, with respect to a local jurisdiction \n     which borders on another State, such State or local \n     jurisdiction--\n       (A) either reduces or increases the local sales tax in \n     order to achieve a rate of tax equal to that imposed by the \n     bordering State on identical transactions, or\n       (B) exempts from the tax transactions which are exempt from \n     tax in the bordering State.\n       (b) Nonuniform Local Sales Taxes.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in subsection (d), \n     nonuniform local sales taxes required to be collected \n     pursuant to this title shall be collected under one of the \n     options provided under paragraph (2).\n       (2) Election.--For purposes of paragraph (1), any person \n     required under authority of this title to collect nonuniform \n     local sales taxes shall elect to collect either--\n       (A) all nonuniform local sales taxes applicable to \n     transactions in the State, or\n       (B) a fee (at the rate determined under paragraph (3)) \n     which shall be in lieu of the nonuniform local sales taxes \n     described in subparagraph (A).\n\n     Such election shall require the person to use the method \n     elected for all transactions in the State while the election \n     is in effect.\n       (3) Rate of in-lieu fee.--For purposes of paragraph (2)(B), \n     the rate of the in-lieu fee for any calendar year shall be an \n     amount equal to the product of--\n       (A) the amount determined by dividing total nonuniform \n     local sales tax revenues collected in the State for the most \n     recently completed State fiscal year for which data is \n     available by total State sales tax revenues for the same \n     year, and\n       (B) the State sales tax rate.\n\n     Such amount shall be rounded to the nearest 0.25 percent.\n       (4) Nonuniform local sales taxes.--For purposes of this \n     title, nonuniform local sales taxes are local sales taxes \n     which do not meet the requirements of subsection (a).\n       (c) Distribution of Local Sales Taxes.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in subsection (d), a \n     State shall distribute to local jurisdictions a portion of \n     the amounts collected pursuant to this title determined on \n     the basis of--\n       (A) in the case of uniform local sales taxes, the \n     proportion which each local jurisdiction receives of uniform \n     local sales taxes not collected pursuant to this title,\n       (B) in the case of in-lieu fees described in subsection \n     (b)(2)(B), the proportion which each local jurisdiction's \n     nonuniform local sales tax receipts bears to the total \n     nonuniform local sales tax receipts in the State, and\n       (C) in the case of any nonuniform local sales tax collected \n     pursuant to this title, the geographical location of the \n     transaction on which the tax was imposed.\n\n     The amounts determined under subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall \n     be calculated on the basis of data for the most recently \n     completed State fiscal year for which the data is available.\n       (2) Timing.--Amounts described in paragraph (1) (B) or (C) \n     shall be distributed by a State to its local jurisdictions in \n     accordance with State timetables for distributing local sales \n     taxes, but not less frequently than every calendar quarter. \n     Amounts described in paragraph (1)(A) shall be distributed by \n     a State as provided under State law.\n       (3) Transition rule.--If, upon the effective date of this \n     title, a State has a State law in effect providing a method \n     for distributing local sales taxes other than the method \n     under this subsection, then this subsection shall not apply \n     to that State until the 91st day following the adjournment \n     sine die of that State's next regular legislative session \n     which convenes after the effective date of this title (or \n     such earlier date as State law may provide). Local sales \n     taxes collected pursuant to this title prior to the \n     application of this subsection shall be distributed as \n     provided by State law.\n       (d) Exception Where State Board Collects Taxes.--\n     Notwithstanding section ____03(b) and subsections (b) and (c) \n     of this section, if a State had in effect on January 1, 1995, \n     a State law which provides that local sales taxes are \n     collected and remitted by a board of elected States officers, \n     then for any period during which such law continues in \n     effect--\n       (1) the State may require the collection and remittance \n     under this title of only the \n     [[Page S1104]] State sales taxes and the uniform portion of \n     local sales taxes, and\n       (2) the State may distribute any local sales taxes \n     collected pursuant to this title in accordance with State \n     law.\n\n     SEC.____05. RETURN AND REMITTANCE REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A State may not require any person subject \n     to this title--\n       (1) to file a return reporting the amount of any tax \n     collected or required to be collected under this title, or to \n     remit the receipts of such tax, more frequently than once \n     with respect to sales in a calendar quarter, or\n       (2) to file the initial such return, or to make the initial \n     such remittance, before the 90th day after the person's first \n     taxable transaction under this Act.\n       (b) Local Taxes.--The provisions of subsection (a) shall \n     also apply to any person required by a State acting under \n     authority of this title to collect a local sales tax or in-\n     lieu fee.\n\n     SEC.____06. NONDISCRIMINATION AND EXEMPTIONS.\n\n       Any State which exercises any authority granted under this \n     title shall allow to all persons subject to this title all \n     exemptions or other exceptions to State and local sales taxes \n     which are allowed to persons located within the State or \n     local jurisdiction.\n\n     SEC.____07. APPLICATION OF STATE LAW.\n\n       (a) Persons Required To Collect State or Local Sales Tax.--\n     Any person required by section ____03 to collect a State or \n     local sales tax shall be subject to the laws of such State \n     relating to such sales tax to the extent that such laws are \n     consistent with the limitations contained in this title.\n       (b) Limitations.--Except as provided in subsection (a), \n     nothing in this title shall be construed to permit a State--\n       (1) to license or regulate any person,\n       (2) to require any person to qualify to transact intrastate \n     business, or\n       (3) to subject any person to State taxes not related to the \n     sales of tangible personnel property.\n       (c) Preemption.--Except as otherwise provided in this \n     title, this title shall not be construed to preempt or limit \n     any power exercised or to be exercised by a State or local \n     jurisdiction under the law of such State or local \n     jurisdiction or under any other Federal law.\n\n     SEC.____08.

IMPACT ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.\n\n       (A) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Congress should be concerned about shifting costs \n     from Federal to State and local authorities and should be \n     equally concerned about the growing tendency of States to \n     shift costs to local governments;\n       (2) cost shifting from States to local governments has, in \n     many instances, forced local governments to raise property \n     taxes or curtail sometimes essential services; and\n       (3) increases in local property taxes and cuts in essential \n     services threaten the ability of many citizens to attain and \n     maintain the American dream of owning a home in a safe, \n     secure community.\n       [[Page S1105]] (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of \n     the Senate that--\n       (1) the Federal Government should not shift certain costs \n     to the State, and States should end the practice of shifting \n     costs to local governments, which forces many local \n     governments to increase property taxes;\n       (2) States should end the imposition, in the absence of \n     full consideration by their legislatures, of State issued \n     mandates on local governments without adequate State funding, \n     in a manner that may displace other essential government \n     priorities; and\n       (3) one primary objective of this Act and other efforts to \n     change the relationship among Federal, State, and local \n     governments should be to reduce taxes and spending at all \n     levels and to end the practice of shifting costs from one \n     level of government to another with little or no benefit to \n     taxpayers.\n\n     SEC. 108.

Mr. President, I want to express my support for \nSenator Boxer's amendment to S.1, which asks the Attorney General to \nact immediately to protect womens' health care clinics.\n  The shootings last month at two clinics in Massachusetts and one in \nVirginia remind me of the problems we have experienced in my home State \nof Montana. In 1993, an arsonist burned and destroyed the Blue Mountain \nWomen's Clinic in Missoula, the second clinic that closed in Montana \ndue to arson in the span of a year and a half. And I recall Dr. Susan \nWicklund from Bozeman, who was repeatedly harassed by life-threatening \nletters and calls. Prior to passage of the Freedom of Access to Clinic \nEntrances Act of 1994, the Federal Bureau of Investigations did not \nhave the authority to protect Dr. Wicklund. Today, however, Federal law \nsafeguards women who choose to exercise their constitutional right to \nhave an abortion, and those who assist them in doing so.\n  Last year, Congress passed and the President signed the Freedom of \nAccess to Clinic Entrances Act of 1994. I cosponsored this legislation, \nestablishing new penalties for individuals threatening, obstructing, \ninjuring, intimidating, or interfering with any person obtaining or \nproviding abortion services. Moreover, it protects health care clinics \nby allowing the Attorney General to bring Federal criminal charges \nagainst any person who damages or attempts to damage a medical facility \nthat provides abortion services.\n  This amendment, which I am cosponsoring, asks the Attorney General to \nfully enforce the Freedom of Access to \n[[Page S1106]] Clinic Entrances Act. In 1994, over 130 incidents of \nviolence and intimidation were recorded by reproductive health care \nclinics. Furthermore, we cannot permit the recent shootings in \nMassachusetts and Virginia to pass us by without taking action.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment and help curb the \nviolence surrounding our reproductive health care clinics.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                      BROWN AMENDMENTS NOS. 61-62\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. BROWN submitted two amendments intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, S. 1, supra, as follows:\n\n                            Amendment No. 61\n\n       Strike title IV of the bill and insert the following:\n\n                       TITLE IV--JUDICIAL REVIEW\n\n     SEC. 401.

PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to strengthen the partnership between the Federal \n     Government and States, local governments, and tribal \n     governments;\n       (2) to end the imposition, in the absence of full \n     consideration by Congress, of Federal mandates on States, \n     local governments, and tribal governments without adequate \n     Federal funding, in a manner that may displace other \n     essential State, local, and tribal governmental priorities;\n       (3) to assist Congress in its consideration of proposed \n     legislation establishing or revising Federal programs \n     containing Federal mandates affecting States, local \n     governments, tribal governments, and the private sector by--\n       (A) providing for the development of information about the \n     nature and size of mandates in proposed legislation; and\n       (B) establishing a mechanism to bring such information to \n     the attention of the Senate before the Senate votes on \n     proposed legislation;\n       (4) to promote informed and deliberate decisions by \n     Congress on the appropriateness of Federal mandates in any \n     particular instances;\n       (5) to establish a point-of-order vote on the consideration \n     in the Senate of legislation containing significant Federal \n     mandates; and\n       (6) to assist Federal agencies in their consideration of \n     proposed regulations affecting States, local governments, and \n     tribal governments, by--\n       (A) requiring that Federal agencies develop a process to \n     enable the elected and other officials of States, local \n     governments, and tribal governments to provide input when \n     Federal agencies are developing regulations; and\n       (B) requiring that Federal agencies prepare and consider \n     better estimates of the budgetary impact of regulations \n     containing Federal mandates upon States, local governments, \n     and tribal governments before adopting such regulations, and \n     ensuring that small governments are given special \n     consideration in that process.\n\n     SEC. 3.

or\n       (II) would place caps upon, or otherwise decrease, the \n     Federal Government's responsibility to provide funding to \n     States, local governments, or tribal governments under the \n     program;

FINDINGS ON THE IMPACT ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.\n\n       The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Congress should be concerned about shifting costs \n     from Federal to State and local authorities and should be \n     equally concerned about the growing tendency of States to \n     shift costs to local governments;\n       (2) cost shifting from States to local governments has, in \n     many instances, forced local governments to raise property \n     taxes or curtail sometimes essential services; and\n       (3) increases in local property taxes and cuts in essential \n     services threaten the ability of many citizens to attain and \n     maintain the American dream of owning a home in a safe, \n     secure community.\n       On page 21, insert between lines 13 and 14 the following \n     new paragraph:\n       ``(2) Estimate of possible local property tax relief.--The \n     Director shall include in each statement submitted to a \n     committee of the Congress under this subsection an estimate \n     of the amount by which additional Federal funding or \n     alleviation of the applicable mandate could be used to lower \n     property taxes of a local government, if--\n       ``(A) such additional funding were first applied to relief \n     of such taxes; or\n       ``(B) such State or local government funds previously used \n     to help pay for a mandate which is proposed to be alleviated \n     were first applied to relief of such taxes.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                      LAUTENBERG AMENDMENT NO. 125\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him \nto the bill S. 1, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 13, line 5, strike out ``or''.\n       On page 13, line 8, strike out the period and insert in \n     lieu thereof a semicolon and ``or''.\n       On page 13, insert between lines 8 and 9 the following new \n     paragraph:\n       (7) limits exposure to known human (Group A) carcinogens, \n     as defined in the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk \n     Assessment Guidelines of 1986.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                     HARKIN AMENDMENTS NOS. 126-127\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. HARKIN submitted two amendments intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill S. 1, supra; as follows:\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 126\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . DIRECTIVE TO THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL \n                   PROTECTION AGENCY CONCERNING REGULATION OF \n                   FISHING LURES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) millions of Americans of all ages enjoy recreational \n     fishing; fishing is one of the most popular sports;\n       (2) lead and other types of metal sinkers and fishing lures \n     have been used by Americans in fishing for hundreds of years;\n       (3) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency has proposed to issue a rule under section 6 of the \n     Toxic Substances Control Act, to prohibit the manufacturing, \n     processing, and distribution in commerce in the United \n     States, of certain smaller size fishing sinkers containing \n     lead and zinc, and mixed with other substances, including \n     those made of brass;\n       (4) the Environmental Protection Agency has based its \n     conclusions that lead fishing sinkers of a certain size \n     present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the \n     environment on less than definitive scientific data, \n     conjecture and anecdotal information;\n       (5) alternative forms of sinkers and fishing lures are \n     considerably more expensive than those made of lead; \n     consequently, a ban on lead sinkers would impose additional \n     costs on millions of Americans who fish;\n       (6) in the absence of more definitive evidence of harm to \n     the environment, the Federal Government should not take steps \n     to restrict the use of lead sinkers; and\n       (7) alternative measures to protect waterfowl from lead \n     exposure should be carefully reviewed.\n       (b) Fishing Sinkers and Lures.--\n       (1) Directive.--The Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency shall not, under purported authority of \n     section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. \n     2605), take action to prohibit or otherwise restrict the \n     manufacturing, processing, distributing, or use of any \n     fishing sinkers or lures containing lead, zinc, or brass.\n       (2) Further action.--If the Administrator obtains a \n     substantially greater amount of evidence of risk of injury to \n     health or the environment than that which was adduced in the \n     rulemaking proceedings described in the proposed rule dated \n     February 28, 1994 (59 Fed.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING BALANCED BUDGET \n                   AMENDMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) social security is a contributory insurance program \n     supported by deductions from workers' earnings and matching \n     contributions from their employers that are deposited into an \n     independent trust fund;\n       (2) over 42,000,000 Americans, including over 3,000,000 \n     children and 5,000,000 disabled workers and their families, \n     receive social security benefits;\n       (3) social security is the only pension program for 60 \n     percent of older Americans;\n       (4) almost 60 percent of older beneficiaries depend on \n     social security for at least half of their income and 25 \n     percent depend on social security for at least 90 percent of \n     their income;\n       (5) without social security an additional 15,000,000 \n     Americans, mostly senior citizens, would be thrown into \n     poverty;\n       (6) 138,000,000 American workers participate in the social \n     security system and are insured in case of retirement, \n     disability, or death;\n       (7) social security is a contract between workers and the \n     Government;\n       (8) social security is a self-financed program that is not \n     contributing to the current Federal budget deficit; in fact, \n     the social security trust funds currently have over \n     $400,000,000,000 in reserves and that surplus will increase \n     during fiscal year 1995 alone by an additional \n     $70,000,000,000;\n       (9) this surplus is necessary to pay monthly benefits for \n     current and future beneficiaries;\n       (10) recognizing that social security is a self-financed \n     program, Congress took social security completely ``off-\n     budget'' in 1990; however, unless social security is \n     explicitly excluded from a balanced budget amendment to the \n     United States Constitution, such an amendment would, in \n     effect, put the program back into the Federal budget by \n     referring to \n     [[Page S1117]] all spending and receipts in calculating \n     whether the budget is in balance;\n       (11) raiding the social security trust funds to reduce the \n     Federal budget deficit would be devastating to both current \n     and future beneficiaries and would further undermine \n     confidence in the system among younger workers;\n       (12) the American people in poll after poll have \n     overwhelmingly rejected cutting social security benefits to \n     reduce the Federal deficit and balance the budget; and\n       (13) social security beneficiaries throughout the nation \n     are gravely concerned that their financial security is in \n     jeopardy because of possible social security cuts and deserve \n     to be reassured that their benefits will not be subject to \n     cuts that would likely be required should social security not \n     be excluded from a balanced budget amendment to the United \n     States Constitution.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that any joint resolution providing for a balanced budget \n     amendment to the United States Constitution passed by the \n     Senate shall specifically exclude social security from the \n     calculations used to determine if the Federal budget is in \n     balance.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        LEAHY AMENDMENT NO. 128\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. LEAHY submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, S. 1, supra, as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       (  ) A law or regulation which protects the citizens, \n     businesses or property in a State from the actions of \n     persons, businesses or governments in another State or States \n     is excluded from the provisions of this Act.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                         BYRD AMENDMENT NO. 129\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. BYRD submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the \nbill, S. 1, supra, as follows:\n\n       On page 23, strike beginning with line 24 through line 21 \n     on page 24.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                    BINGAMAN AMENDMENT NOS. 130-132\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN submitted three amendments intended to be proposed by \nhim to the bill, S. 1, supra, as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 130\n\n       On page 7, insert:\n       ``(iii) any requirement for a license or permit for the \n     treatment or disposal of hazardous waste''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 131\n\n       On page 6, insert before lines 2 and 3 the following:\n       ``iii any requirement for a license or permit for the \n     treatment or disposal of nuclear and hazardous waste''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 132\n\n       On page 5, line 23, after ``or'' insert ``a condition of \n     receipt of a Federal license;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Consumer and Main Street \n     Business Protection Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. ____02. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) merchandise purchased from out-of-State firms is \n     subject to State and local sales taxes in the same manner as \n     merchandise purchased from in-State firms,\n       (2) State and local governments generally are unable to \n     compel out-of-State firms to collect and remit such taxes, \n     and consequently, many out-of-State firms choose not to \n     collect State and local taxes on merchandise delivered across \n     State lines,\n       (3) moreover, many out-of-State firms fail to inform their \n     customers that such taxes exist, with some firms even falsely \n     claim that merchandise purchased out-of-State is tax-free, \n     and consequently, many consumers unknowingly incur tax \n     liabilities, including interest and penalty charges,\n       (4) Congress has a duty to protect consumers from explicit \n     or implicit misrepresentations of State and local sales tax \n     obligations,\n       (5) small businesses, which are compelled to collect State \n     and local sales taxes, are subject to unfair competition when \n     out-of-State firms cannot be compelled to collect and remit \n     such taxes on their sales to residents of the State,\n       (6) State and local governments provide a number of \n     resources to out-of-State firms including government services \n     relating to disposal of tons of catalogs, mail delivery, \n     communications, and bank and court systems,\n       (7) the inability of State and local governments to require \n     out-of-State firms to collect and remit sales taxes deprives \n     State and local governments of needed revenue and forces such \n     State and local governments to raise taxes on taxpayers, \n     including consumers and small businesses, in such State,\n       (8) the Supreme Court ruled in Quill Corporation v. North \n     Dakota, 112 S. Ct. 1904 (1992) that the due process clause of \n     the Constitution does not prohibit a State government from \n     imposing personal jurisdiction and tax obligations on out-of-\n     State firms that purposefully solicit sales from residents \n     therein, and that the Congress has the power to authorize \n     State governments to require out-of-State firms to collect \n     State and local sales taxes, and\n       (9) as a matter of federalism, the Federal Government has a \n     duty to assist State and local governments in collecting \n     sales taxes on sales from out-of-State firms.\n\n     SEC. ____03. AUTHORITY FOR COLLECTION OF SALES TAX.\n\n       (a) In General.--A State is authorized to require a person \n     who is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the State to \n     collect and remit a State sales tax, a local sales tax, or \n     both, with respect to tangible personal property if--\n       (1) the destination of the tangible personal property is in \n     the State,\n       (2) during the 1-year period ending on September 30 of the \n     calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the \n     taxable event occurs, the person has gross receipts from \n     sales of such tangible personal property--\n       (A) in the United States exceeding $3,000,000, or\n       (B) in the State exceeding $100,000, and\n       (3) the State, on behalf of its local jurisdictions, \n     collects and administers all local sales taxes imposed \n     pursuant to this title.\n       (b) States Must Collect Local Sales Taxes.-- Except as \n     provided in section ____04(d), a State in which both State \n     and local sales taxes are imposed may not require State sales \n     taxes to be collected and remitted under subsection (a) \n     unless the State also requires the local sales taxes to be \n     collected and remitted under subsection (a).\n       (c) Aggregation Rules.--All persons that would be treated \n     as a single employer under section 52 (a) or (b) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be treated as one person \n     for purposes of subsection (a).\n       (d) Destination.--For purposes of subsection (a), the \n     destination of tangible personal property is the State or \n     local jurisdiction which is the final location to which the \n     seller ships or delivers the property, or to which the seller \n     causes the property to be shipped or delivered, regardless of \n     the means of shipment or delivery or the location of the \n     buyer.\n\n     SEC.____04. TREATMENT OF LOCAL SALES TAXES.\n\n       (a) Uniform Local Sales Taxes.--\n       (1) In general.--Sales taxes imposed by local jurisdictions \n     of a State shall be deemed to be uniform for purposes of this \n     title and shall be collected under this title in the same \n     manner as State sales taxes if--\n       (A) such local sales taxes are imposed at the same rate and \n     on identical transactions in all geographic areas in the \n     State, and\n       (B) such local sales taxes imposed on sales by out-of-State \n     persons are collected and administered by the State.\n       (2) Application to border jurisdiction tax rates.--A State \n     shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of \n     paragraph (1)(A) if, with respect to a local jurisdiction \n     which borders on another State, such State or local \n     jurisdiction--\n       (A) either reduces or increases the local sales tax in \n     order to achieve a rate of tax equal to that imposed by the \n     bordering State on identical transactions, or\n       (B) exempts from the tax transactions which are exempt from \n     tax in the bordering State.\n       (b) Nonuniform Local Sales Taxes.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in subsection (d), \n     nonuniform local sales taxes required to be collected \n     pursuant to this title shall be collected under one of the \n     options provided under paragraph (2).\n       (2) Election.--For purposes of paragraph (1), any person \n     required under authority of this title to collect nonuniform \n     local sales taxes shall elect to collect either--\n       (A) all nonuniform local sales taxes applicable to \n     transactions in the State, or\n       (B) a fee (at the rate determined under paragraph (3)) \n     which shall be in lieu of the nonuniform local sales taxes \n     described in subparagraph (A).\n     Such election shall require the person to use the method \n     elected for all transactions in the State while the election \n     is in effect.\n       (3) Rate of in-lieu fee.--For purposes of paragraph (2)(B), \n     the rate of the in-lieu fee for any calendar year shall be an \n     amount equal to the product of--\n       (A) the amount determined by dividing total nonuniform \n     local sales tax revenues collected in the State for the most \n     recently completed State fiscal year for which data is \n     available by total State sales tax revenues for the same \n     year, and\n       (B) the State sales tax rate.\n\n     Such amount shall be rounded to the nearest 0.25 percent.\n       (4) Nonuniform local sales taxes.--For purposes of this \n     title, nonuniform local sales taxes are local sales taxes \n     which do not meet the requirements of subsection (a).\n       (c) Distribution of Local Sales Taxes.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in subsection (d), a \n     State shall distribute to local jurisdictions a portion of \n     the amounts collected pursuant to this title determined on \n     the basis of--\n       (A) in the case of uniform local sales taxes, the \n     proportion which each local jurisdiction receives of uniform \n     local sales taxes not collected pursuant to this title,\n       (B) in the case of in-lieu fees described in subsection \n     (b)(2)(B), the proportion which each local jurisdiction's \n     nonuniform local sales tax receipts bears to the total \n     nonuniform local sales tax receipts in the State, and\n       (C) in the case of any nonuniform local sales tax collected \n     pursuant to this title, the geographical location of the \n     transaction on which the tax was imposed.\n\n     The amounts determined under subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall \n     be calculated on the basis of data for the most recently \n     completed \n     [[Page S1124]] State fiscal year for which the data is \n     available.\n       (2) Timing.--Amounts described in paragraph (1) (B) or (C) \n     shall be distributed by a State to its local jurisdictions in \n     accordance with State timetables for distributing local sales \n     taxes, but not less frequently than every calendar quarter. \n     Amounts described in paragraph (1)(A) shall be distributed by \n     a State as provided under State law.\n       (3) Transition rule.--If, upon the effective date of this \n     title, a State has a State law in effect providing a method \n     for distributing local sales taxes other than the method \n     under this subsection, then this subsection shall not apply \n     to that State until the 91st day following the adjournment \n     sine die of that State's next regular legislative session \n     which convenes after the effective date of this title (or \n     such earlier date as State law may provide).

RETURN AND REMITTANCE REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A State may not require any person subject \n     to this title--\n       (1) to file a return reporting the amount of any tax \n     collected or required to be collected under this title, or to \n     remit the receipts of such tax, more frequently than once \n     with respect to sales in a calendar quarter, or\n       (2) to file the initial such return, or to make the initial \n     such remittance, before the 90th day after the person's first \n     taxable transaction under this Act.\n       (b) Local Taxes.--The provisions of subsection (a) shall \n     also apply to any person required by a State acting under \n     authority of this title to collect a local sales tax or in-\n     lieu fee.\n\n     SEC.____06. NONDISCRIMINATION AND EXEMPTIONS.\n\n       Any State which exercises any authority granted under this \n     title shall allow to all persons subject to this title all \n     exemptions or other exceptions to State and local sales taxes \n     which are allowed to persons located within the State or \n     local jurisdiction.\n\n     SEC.____07.

Res. 63\n\n       Whereas the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n     System has maintained that the current Consumer Price Index \n     overstates the rate of inflation by as much as 50 percent;\n       Whereas other expert opinions on the accuracy of the \n     Consumer Price Index range from those indicating a modest \n     overstatement of the rate of inflation to those indicating \n     the possibility of an understatement of the rate of \n     inflation;\n       Whereas several leaders in the Congress have called for an \n     immediate change in the way in which the Consumer Price Index \n     is calculated;\n       Whereas changing the Consumer Price Index in the manner \n     recommended by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n     System would result in both a reduction in Social Security \n     benefits and an increase in income taxes;\n       Whereas the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n     System estimates that a 1-percentage point reduction in the \n     Consumer Price Index, effected today, would generate \n     $150,000,000,000 in revenue over the next 5 years, including \n     $55,000,000,000 generated during the year 2000 alone;\n       Whereas the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n     System estimates that, of the $55,000,000,000 in revenue \n     estimated to be generated during the year 2000, \n     $27,500,000,000 would result from a reduction in Social \n     Security benefits and $21,400,000,000 would result from an \n     increase in personal income taxes, which would primarily \n     impact families with children;\n       Whereas the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which has \n     responsibility for the Consumer Price Index, is working to \n     identify and correct problems with the way in which the \n     Consumer Price Index is currently calculated; and\n       Whereas calculation of the Consumer Price Index should be \n     based on sound economic principles and not on political \n     pressure: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) a precipitous change in the calculation of the Consumer \n     Price Index that would result in an increase in income taxes \n     and a decrease in Social Security benefits is not the \n     appropriate way to resolve this issue; and\n       (2) any change in the calculation of the Consumer Price \n     Index should result from thoughtful study and analysis and \n     should be the result of a consensus reached by the experts, \n     not pressure exerted by politicians.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues Senator Dodd \nand Senator Harkin to submit a sense-of-the-Senate resolution opposing \nany precipitous change in the way the Consumer Price Index [CPI] is \ncalculated that is based on politics rather than sound economic \nanalysis.\n  The discussion in recent days by the Speaker of the House and some \nothers about the calculation of the Consumer Price Index reaffirms the \nunderstanding that just because a person is thoughtless doesn't mean \nthey can't also be reckless.\n  The precipitous call for a change in the Consumer Price Index by the \nSpeaker and others shows again how attracted they are to gimmicks and \nillusions to prop up the house of cards they call an economic strategy.\n  This latest suggestion that they dub as technical is one that would \ncut Social Security COLA's for America's elderly and increase taxes for \nmost of America's taxpayers--all of this under something that they \nwould describe as a technical change.\n  Let's review what's been said about this. Recently, Chairman Alan \nGreenspan of the Federal Reserve Board testified before Congress and \nsaid that in his judgment the CPI calculation overstates the CPI by 0.5 \nto 1.5 percent.\n  I will leave aside, for the moment, the question that begs to be \nanswered. What on earth are Alan Greenspan and his buddies at the Fed \ndoing raising interest rates six times if they think the real rate of \ninflation is only 1.2 to 1.7 percent.\n  As to the question about the calculation of the CPI, the studies that \nhave been done--and there have been several--stem mostly from research \ndone by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that calculates the CPI. The Fed \nstudy shows it overstates inflation by one-half to 1\\1/2\\ percent. The \nCongressional Budget Office thinks it overstates inflation by two-\ntenths of 1 percent to eight-tenths of 1 percent. And there are others \nin the academic community that think it may actually understate \ninflation.\n  This weekend, when asked about Greenspan's comments, the Speaker of \nthe House said that he would give the Bureau of Labor Statistics people \n``30 days to get it right'' or he would fire them and give the job to \nthe Fed. And Dick Armey, the House majority leader, said he wants to \nchange the CPI immediately. Of course the motive for both is that if \nthey can use a gimmick like changing the CPI they will reduce the \ndeficit by cutting Social Security COLA's and by increasing taxes and \nclaim it's all just technical.\n  The appetite to play these games to justify their economic proposals \nseems boundless. First they propose to change the way proposals in \nCongress are scored so that their proposals will look less radical. Now \nthey do half-gainers at Alan Greenspan's suggestion that they change \nthe CPI because they think that will be an easy fix to show a reduced \ndeficit even though someone else--the elderly and the wage earners--\nwill pay the price.\n  Because the Speaker indicated he would mandate the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics to make this change in 30 days or he would ``zero them out \nof the budget'' the three of us will propose today a sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment to the mandates bill now on the floor expressing the \nsense of the Senate that changes in the CPI should be a result of \nconsensus reached by experts; not pressure exerted by politicians.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/18/senate-section/article/S1125-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1125-S1126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 64--ORIGINAL RESOLUTION REPORTED AUTHORIZING \n           EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON VETERANS' AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON, from the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, reported the \nfollowing original resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nRules and Administration:\n\n                               S.

PETE WILSON'S INAUGURAL ADDRESS\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, our former colleague, California's \nGovernor Pete Wilson delivered a powerful address on the occasion of \nhis second inaugural on January 7, 1995.\n  Appropriately titled ``Forging America's Future,'' Governor Wilson's \naddress urges a recommitment ``to that miracle we call democracy.''\n  Mr. President, Governor Wilson's eloquent speech is timely and \npertinent for all Americans. I commend it to my colleagues' attention.\n  The address follows:\n\n                  California: Forging America's Future\n\n       This is a day of renewal. Today, we recommit ourselves to \n     that miracle we call democracy, and to the spirit and promise \n     we call California.\n       That spirit and promise burn brightest not here in the \n     Capitol, but in the hearts and minds of California's people--\n     in our factories and on our farms, in our factories and on \n     our farms, in our churches and our temples, in our classrooms \n     and around our kitchen tables.\n       This morning's ceremony is a celebration, and also a \n     vindication: a vindication not of an individual or political \n     party, but of a resilient and sturdy people blessed with \n     courage and character. Though tested and tempered in the \n     forge of adversity, they came through the fire, their faith \n     intact, clinging tenaciously to the promise of California.\n       When the earth shook and the hills burned, when rivers \n     overflowed and riots scarred our cities, when drought seared \n     the earth and fiscal crises tested our confidence in \n     government itself, a lesser people would have just given up.\n       But not Californians. That's not the California Way.\n       When confronted with the worst, we respond with our best.\n       That is the California Way.\n       Californians have always answered adversity with bold \n     thoughts and challenged convention with fresh ideas. They \n     have always dared to dream.\n       The poet Carl Sandburg wrote, ``The Republic is a dream. \n     Nothing happens unless first a dream.''\n       In the 1850s, a dream led pioneers West in wagon trains \n     across a desolate prairie and over frozen mountains.\n       These early pioneers risked their lives crossing the mighty \n     Sierra, till one day they crossed a ridge to find themselves \n     gazing down from the heights upon a golden valley that held \n     the promise of California.\n       Most of us are not the lineal descendents of those \n     pioneers. We came later. We came by ship from Asia and by \n     station wagon from Ohio. We came during the Great Depression \n     from the Dust Bowl in pick-ups piled high with our \n     possessions. And we came by jet-liner last year, last month, \n     and last week.\n       Today, we too stand on that same ridge, with a valley of \n     promise spread before us, inviting us to partake of the good \n     life.\n       But ours is a generation that cannot take for granted the \n     good life, the historically generous bounty of California, \n     unless we are prepared to make dramatic change.\n       We must act, and act quickly, because we live in a time of \n     great and accelerating change; because we live in a shrinking \n     and more competitive global marketplace; and because, as we \n     rush toward the 21st century, we are at a crossroads and must \n     choose what kind of California we will have.\n       We must choose whether California will be the Golden \n     State--or a welfare state. It can't be both.\n       On that, my fellow citizens, there can be no question.\n       We must be wise enough, tough-minded and honest enough to \n     repeal programs that fail their stated noble purpose and fail \n     expensively, incurring fiscal and human costs that are \n     unaffordable.\n       The people agree. They are out of patience with misfired \n     good intentions that defy sense or fairness.\n       They ask: Is it fair that the welfare system taxes working \n     people who can't afford children and pays people who don't \n     work for having more children?\n       They ask: Why should federal law reward illegal immigrants \n     for violating the law and punish California taxpayers and \n     needy legal residents?\n       They ask: Why have schools that reward poor teachers for \n     promoting--even graduating--students who can't adequately \n     speak and write English?\n       And they ask: Why do our laws put dangerous criminals back \n     on our street, and put us behind barred windows and locked \n     doors?\n       The last refuge of those who call these questions unfair is \n     to assert their compassion, and to deny ours.\n       The ultimate compassion is to build an economy that works, \n     one that grows and provides the jobs working Californians \n     need to feed their families, build their homes and pay their \n     taxes.\n       To produce that economy and all the work our people need, \n     we must lift the burdens that government has placed on risk-\n     takers, on the people who create California's jobs. If we \n     over-tax and over-regulate, if our workers are not well-\n     educated and our streets are not safe, we will drive these \n     job-creators to other states.\n       California can't afford to do that. If we do, we will \n     deserve to lose the talent, the entrepreneurial drive, the \n     energy and innovation that make California all that it is.\n       So we will not put up with bad schools, or violence on our \n     streets, or regulations that impose costs greater than their \n     benefits, or taxes that dwarf those levied by our neighbors.\n       We must free our people, and release their creative energy.\n       By lifting from them the restraints, regulations, and \n     burdens that government has imposed, we free them to seize \n     opportunity and create more.\n       [[Page S1127]] And they will.\n       And all of California will succeed.\n       So, we will deliberately shrink government to expand \n     opportunity.\n       We will demand that all citizens meet the test of common \n     decency, respecting the rights of others, and we will demand \n     that those who can, pull their own weight and meet the test \n     of personal responsibility.\n       We will make clear that welfare is to be a safety net, not \n     a hammock--and absolutely not a permanent way of life.\n       We will correct our laws to make clear that bringing a \n     child into the world is an awesome personal responsibility \n     for both the mother and the father.\n       The costs are simply too high for society to continue \n     tolerating the promiscuity and irresponsibility that have \n     produced generations of unwed teen mothers.\n       It is monstrously unfair to the children; to their sad, \n     ill-equipped teen mothers; and certainly to working \n     taxpayers, who must support them at a cost to their own \n     children.\n       We will insist that those who receive public assistance \n     earn it. We will give them help and support to escape from \n     dependency to the independence and self-respect of work. We \n     want them to see in the eyes of their children that special \n     look of respect and pride that only working parents can know.\n       We will not tolerate the selfishness of ``dead-beat dads'' \n     who casually father a child and walk away from their \n     responsibility. Their child is their obligation, not the \n     taxpayer's.\n       If they lack the basic decency to send love to their child, \n     they must at least send money. If they don't, we will track \n     them down and dock their pay for child support.\n       We will demand accountability and personal responsibility. \n     Now the teen predator who does violence to his victim will be \n     prosecuted not as a juvenile, but as an adult.\n       But as I said four years ago--how much better it is to \n     prevent crime than to punish it.\n       That kind of prevention is fundamentally a father's \n     responsibility. Too often the fatherless child of a teen \n     mother becomes a teen predator, and the trigger man for his \n     gang.\n       We are paying for too many prisons because absent fathers \n     have failed to take responsibility to socialize and civilize \n     their children. That must change.\n       For those who become so brutalized that they can't respect \n     themselves or the rights of others, prison must be the answer \n     to violence.\n       The fundamental right of every Californian is not to become \n     a crime victim, and it is the first responsibility of \n     government to safeguard that right.\n       We will do so. Those who commit violent crimes will pay \n     heavily for their brutality.\n       But we must at the same time work to alter the behavior of \n     parents who default on their responsibility as parents. When \n     we succeed, we can build more laboratories and libraries--and \n     fewer prisons.\n       We must also change our schools. Something's wrong with our \n     schools. Something important and basic.\n       Some are superb. Too many are not. Despite the dedication \n     and skill of many teachers, the quality of our schools is \n     erratic.\n       Our schools must be safe: free of guns and drugs and free \n     of kids who bring them.\n       We must insist on order and discipline in the classroom, or \n     teaching and learning cannot occur.\n       Recognizing the enormous importance and the influence of \n     good teaching in a child's life, we must recognize and reward \n     excellence, and removed from the classroom those teachers \n     whose performance is inadequate.\n       Children must learn the basics. And we must be assured that \n     they have learned by standardized tests that measure \n     individual student performance.\n       We must raise our standards high enough to challenge our \n     children to meet the competition they will all too soon \n     encounter in the international marketplace. The standards we \n     enforce must be high and clear, not imprecise and politically \n     correct.\n       And if our kids have not learned what they must know to \n     compete in this increasingly demanding job market, we must \n     not do them the serious disservice of pretending that they \n     have.\n       Social promotion is the worst form of false kindness. We \n     must not promote them.\n       If they can't do arithmetic, don't understand rudimentary \n     science, and especially if they cannot read, write and speak \n     English, our children won't be hired, much less promoted.\n       Much is written and spoken about the importance of self-\n     esteem to a child's success. Self-esteem is important. But it \n     cannot be conferred. It must be earned by performance, by \n     meeting standards, and by having been honestly tested and \n     honestly judged to have met or exceeded clear, high \n     standards.\n       Anything less is not honest, and not fair. It is deception, \n     and cannot be the basis for success. Not for a school child, \n     not even for a nation-state that boasts the world's seventh \n     largest economy.\n       We must reward effort and achievement. We must honor those \n     who work hard, who meet life's test playing by the rules; who \n     respect themselves and the rights of others; who honor their \n     obligations as parents and citizens; who raise their children \n     to obey the law.\n       And just as we demand that citizens meet these standards of \n     decency and responsibility, we must demand at least as much \n     from government--in Sacramento and in Washington.\n       California will not submit its destiny to faceless federal \n     bureaucrats or even Congressional barons.\n       We declare to Washington that California is a proud and \n     sovereign state, not a colony of the federal government.\n       We will set our own course.\n       We will return both dollars and decisions to Californians \n     who are working hard this very day to build a better future.\n       We will perform radical surgery to undo two decades of \n     mischief, which, though wrought with good intentions, have \n     imposed an intolerable burden on our people.\n       We will break the bonds of restraint which government has \n     placed on those strong enough to create opportunity, and \n     break the chains of dependency on those addicted to \n     government's largesse.\n       We will make these changes and empower Californians.\n       We will meet the challenge of building the first society to \n     embrace every culture, every language, every ethnic group on \n     the planet.\n       We will not allow ourselves to be divided into divergent \n     interests who simply rub up against one another like the \n     tectonic plates of the San Andreas fault.\n       We will meet the tests that lie ahead, as a people proud of \n     our many pasts, who now share a common future, a proud \n     future.\n       And what makes our success all the more critical is that a \n     nation--indeed a world--challenged by constant change looks \n     to us for new lessons in democratic renewal.\n       America has always asked a special role from California: to \n     seek out the American future by trying new ideas, rejecting \n     what doesn't work, and building on what does.\n       The historian Kevin Starr wrote, ``California [is] the \n     prism through which America glimpses its unfolding \n     identity.''\n       The California Way has always been to shape the future with \n     courage and creativity, embracing change, while still \n     clinging to the unchanging values of faith and family, of \n     individual effort and personal responsibility without which \n     no republic can long endure.\n       Our role, our responsibility, is to assure that California \n     chooses greatness, to guarantee those seeking opportunity \n     that we will provide it, and that we can and will take the \n     steps required to do so.\n       This, then, is the California Way: seeing possibilities \n     where others see only problems, forging a new future of \n     opportunity from the flames of adversity. Where others suffer \n     change, or patiently await it, California will invent the \n     future--and export it.\n       In a time of grave peril Abraham Lincoln declared: ``The \n     occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with \n     the occasion.''\n       Time and again, America has seen California rise with the \n     occasion and triumph over peril. Through every difficulty, \n     California has offered a dream to be realized. We will make \n     real again the dream of a republic where work is respected \n     and rewarded, where every right is balanced by \n     responsibility, where freedom thrives and opportunity burns \n     bright.\n       We choose to be victors, not victims.\n       We are, after all Californians.\n       California's favorite son, Ronald Reagan, has for all his \n     life embodied that special unbridled optimism that is at the \n     heart of the California dream. He is again teaching us new \n     lessons about courage, candor and dignity.\n       In his moving letter to the American people, President \n     Reagan wrote:\n       ``For America, there will always be a bright dawn ahead.''\n       My friends, let us vow that we will keep faith with Ronald \n     Reagan's vision for America.\n       Let us assure him and our children that we will make \n     California that shining city on the hill, where America's \n     bright dawn is always breaking.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/18/senate-section/article/S1126-3", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1127-S1128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      BUTTE AND MICRON TECHNOLOGY\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to express my support \nfor two amendments adopted unanimously by the senate on Friday, January \n13, 1995--the Dorgan modified amendment No. 1 and the Kempthorne \namendment No. 19. Due to an issue of great importance to my home State \nof Montana, and the possible creation of thousands of jobs, I felt it \nwas more important for me to be home during Friday's Senate session, \nand therefore was not able to be present during the votes.\n  Although it is very rare for me to miss a vote, on Friday, January \n13, 1995, I traveled home to attend a task force meeting in Butte, \norganized with the aim of bringing one of the United States preeminent \nhigh tech companies, Micron Technology Inc., to Butte. Butte is on the \nfinalist list for a new Micron semiconductor manufacturing facility, \nwhich would employ 3,000 to 4,000 Montanans. The city of Butte asked \nthat I be part of this important task force meeting.\n  Butte and Micron are a match made in heaven. There is no community in \nthe United States where I have seen a higher level of work ethic, \nloyalty and community spirit than in Butte. The possibility of a major \nsemiconductor manufacturing company locating in \n[[Page S1128]] Montana--particularly one which has based its success on \nthe western ideals of hard work and thinking big--has energized the \ncommunity of Butte and my State of Montana. We are all doing everything \npossible to convince Micron that its new manufacturing plant could have \nno better home anywhere in the United States.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/18/senate-section/article/S1127-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        A MILESTONE FOR THE C-17\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the State of Missouri is very proud \nof the enormous contribution more than 2,000 of its aerospace workers \nhave made in producing the C-17 Globemaster III at the McDonnell \nDouglas Corp. plant in St. Louis. Yesterday, Gen. Robert Rutherford, \nAir Mobility Command Commander, declared the initial operational \ncapability of the first C-17 squadron at Charleston Air Force Base, SC. \nThe C-17's capability to airlift in excess of 160,000 pounds strategic \ndistances and land on runways as short as 3,000 feet is now available \nfor everyday operations anywhere in the world. I am very proud that the \nskilled aerospace workers in Missouri had a part in this significant \nachievement. But, more so, I am encouraged that we are seeing the \nachievement of another major step in the plan toward building a fleet \nof 120 critically needed C-17's.\n  As the centerpiece of America's ability to respond in a crisis \nquickly with the right military force or humanitarian aid, the C-17 \nwill take this Nation well into the 21st century as the most capable \nand flexible airlifter ever to take flight. The declaration of initial \noperational capability of the C-17 is a milestone we can all be proud \nof.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/18/senate-section/article/S1128-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 THE ALBION COLLEGE FOOTBALL CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to recognize and congratulate \nthe Albion College Britons football team, the 1994 NCAA Division III \nNational Champions.\n  On a rainy Saturday afternoon in December, the Britons met the \nWashington and Jefferson Presidents in the 22d annual Amos Alonzo Stagg \nBowl in Salem, VA. Coming into the game, the Presidents had the \nNation's top-ranked defense in Division III. The Britons, winners of \nsix consecutive Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association titles, \nrose to the occasion to win a 38-15 victory. The victory capped an \nimpressive drive through four playoff games which included victories \nover three former national champions.\n  At one point, the Britons scored 31 unanswered points. The aggressive \nAlbion defense and special teams forced three turnovers and returned an \ninterception for a touchdown. Tailback Jeff Robinson rushed for 166 \nyards on the soggy field and scored three touchdowns.\n  The Albion players and coaches have faced many challenges this year \nas they went to an undefeated 13-0 record. They overcame them by \npulling together as a team and playing their hearts out. I admire their \nspirit and applaud them for giving it their all in every game.\n  I want to extend my warmest congratulations to each of the players, \ncoaches, parents, and supporters of this championship team as well as \nto President Melvin Vulgamore and the entire Albion College community.\n  Mr. President, the people of Michigan are proud of the Albion College \nBritons.
